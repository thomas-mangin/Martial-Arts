# Article Writing Guidelines

## Structure Overview

Your Aikido educational articles should follow a clear, comprehensive structure that serves both practitioners and newcomers to the art. Articles are designed as progressive learning resources that could be compiled into a book.

---

## 1. Title & Metadata

### Title Best Practices
- Clear and descriptive (educational focus)
- Professional, not catchy or clickbait
- Directly states the topic covered
- 5-15 words typically
- Examples (Educational Article Style):
  - ✓ "The Principle of Irimi: Biomechanics and Progressive Training"
  - ✓ "Ukemi: Technical Foundations and Safety Principles"
  - ✓ "Ikkyo: Comprehensive Guide to Variations and Applications"
- Avoid (Blog/Clickbait Style):
  - ✗ "Why Your Aikido Teacher Won't Shut Up About Sword Training"
  - ✗ "The One Thing You're Getting Wrong About Ikkyo"
  - ✗ "This Ancient Secret Will Transform Your Practice"

### Metadata Fields
- **Date**: Publication or last updated date
- **Author**: Your name
- **Series**: Which article series this belongs to (if applicable)
- **Article Number**: Position in series (e.g., "3 of 7" or "Chapter 2.3")
- **Prerequisites**: Earlier articles readers should read first (if building on concepts)
- **Category**: Choose from:
  - Technique (specific waza analysis)
  - Philosophy (principles and concepts)
  - Training (practice methods and tips)
  - History (lineage, O-Sensei, development)
  - Syllabus Reference (Iwama technical documentation)
  - Personal Reflection (your journey and insights)
- **Primary Audience**: 1-2 audience profiles who will gain the most value (see audience-profiles.md)
- **Secondary Audiences**: 2-3 additional profiles who will benefit
- **Audience Notes**: Brief explanation of what each audience type will gain
- **Estimated Length**: Target word count (1,500-3,000+ words for comprehensive coverage)

---

## 2. Introduction (150-300 words)

**Purpose**: Establish context, learning objectives, and scope

**Elements to include:**
- Clear statement of what this article covers
- Learning objectives (what readers will understand after reading)
- Prerequisites (if building on earlier articles, reference them)
- Scope and approach (comprehensive coverage, technical depth, etc.)
- Connection to broader Aikido principles or series theme

**Educational opening patterns:**
- "This article examines [topic] through [framework/lens]..."
- "Building on [previous article], we now explore..."
- "Understanding [concept] requires examining three key elements: [list]..."
- "This comprehensive guide covers [topic] from foundational principles through advanced applications..."

**Avoid blog-style hooks:**
- ✗ "Have you ever wondered why..." (too casual)
- ✗ "What if I told you..." (clickbait pattern)
- ✗ Provocative questions designed for engagement rather than education

---

## 3. Main Content (1200-2500+ words)

**Structure**: 3-8 major sections with clear descriptive headings

**Note**: Articles should be comprehensive. Longer content (2,500-4,000 words) is acceptable and encouraged if needed for thorough coverage.

### Section Headings
- Use descriptive headings (not "Section 1")
- Make them informative and specific
- Examples:
  - ✓ "Understanding Ma-ai: The Critical Distance"
  - ✓ "Three Common Mistakes in Shiho Nage"
  - ✗ "Background Information"
  - ✗ "Further Discussion"

### Content Development

**For Technique Posts:**
- Breakdown of the movement
- Key principles at work
- Common mistakes and corrections
- Variations or applications
- Connection to broader concepts

**For Philosophy Posts:**
- Define the concept clearly
- Historical or traditional context
- Modern interpretation/relevance
- Practical examples from training
- Personal insights or observations

**For Training Posts:**
- The problem or challenge addressed
- Specific methods or exercises
- How to implement in practice
- Expected benefits
- Progression or variations

### Writing Style
- **Clarity and precision**: Explain jargon for non-practitioners, but don't avoid technical depth
- **Evidence-based**: Support claims with multi-source validation when possible
- **Show, don't just tell**: Use examples and specific demonstrations
- **Build progressively**: Each section should flow logically, building on previous concepts
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Don't leave gaps - cover topic thoroughly
- **Cross-reference**: Reference earlier articles in series when building on concepts
- **Professional tone**: Educational and authoritative (while maintaining first-dan humility)
- **Authenticity**: Share genuine insights from experience and observation

### Japanese Terminology
- Use Japanese terms appropriately
- Always provide translation on first use
- Be consistent with romanization style
- Use proper macrons if using them (ō, ū)
- Don't overuse - balance with English explanations

---

## 4. Practical Takeaways (3-5 points)

**Purpose**: Give readers actionable insights

**Format**: Brief, bulleted list of key points they can:
- Remember during training
- Apply immediately
- Reflect on deeper
- Use as training goals

**Examples:**
- "Focus on maintaining connection through your center, not your arms"
- "Practice ukemi with awareness of how you're absorbing energy"
- "Consider how aiki principles apply off the mat in conflict resolution"

---

## 5. Conclusion (100-150 words)

**Purpose**: Wrap up and leave lasting impression

**Elements to include:**
- Synthesis of main points
- Return to opening theme/question
- Broader perspective or invitation
- Forward-looking thought

**Avoid:**
- Introducing completely new ideas

## Writing for Multiple Audiences

### Why Audience Matters

Your blog serves a diverse community with different experience levels, roles, interests, and needs. Understanding your audiences ensures:
- Every post provides value to multiple reader types
- Content is accessible while offering depth
- No audience is systematically overlooked
- Your blog has broader reach and impact

**See `audience-profiles.md` for complete audience definitions** including:
- Experience-based profiles (Beginners → Advanced → Returning)
- Role-based profiles (Students, Instructors, Dojo Owners)
- Interest-based profiles (Technical, Philosophical, Practical, Historical)
- Life-stage profiles (Youth, Young Adults, Middle-Aged, Seniors)
- Adjacent profiles (Parents, Prospective Students, Cross-Training Martial Artists)

### The Layered Content Approach

**The best posts serve 3-5 different audience profiles simultaneously through layering:**

**Example: "The Three Types of Relaxation in Aikido"**
- **Beginners** learn that "relax" doesn't mean limp or passive
- **Intermediate** understand the three distinct types in detail
- **Advanced** explore subtle distinctions and advanced applications
- **Instructors** get framework for explaining concept to students
- **Technical-focused** get biomechanical breakdown
- **Philosophical-focused** see connection to mushin (no-mind) concepts

### Designing Multi-Audience Content

#### 1. Identify Your Audiences (Metadata)

**Every post should specify:**
- **Primary Audience** (1-2 profiles): Who gains the most value?
- **Secondary Audiences** (2-3 profiles): Who else benefits?
- **Audience Notes**: What each audience type will gain

**Example:**
```markdown
**Primary Audience**: Intermediate practitioners (3-7 years) + Technical focus
**Secondary Audiences**: Advanced practitioners, Instructors, Beginners (foundational understanding)
**Audience Notes**:
- Beginners: Learn foundational concept of ma-ai
- Intermediate/Advanced: Develop sophisticated understanding
- Instructors: Framework for teaching ma-ai progression
```

#### 2. Structure for Multiple Entry Points

**Use clear section headings to guide different readers:**

```markdown
## Understanding Ma-ai: The Basics
[Accessible to all levels, foundational]

## Three Levels of Ma-ai Awareness
[Progressive depth - beginners grasp first level, advanced readers see full progression]

## For Beginners: Where to Focus
[Explicit section serving specific audience]

## For Advanced Practitioners: Subtle Refinements
[Deep dive for experienced readers]

## For Instructors: Teaching Ma-ai Effectively
[Pedagogical insights for teachers]
```

#### 3. Tier Your Practical Takeaways

**Provide value at multiple levels:**

```markdown
## Practical Takeaways

**For Beginners**:
1. Start by noticing the distance where you feel comfortable/uncomfortable
2. Practice static ma-ai before worrying about dynamic ma-ai

**For Intermediate/Advanced**:
1. Develop awareness of emotional ma-ai, not just physical distance
2. Practice deliberately disrupting and restoring ma-ai in freestyle

**For Instructors**:
1. Use specific exercises to develop ma-ai sensitivity progressively
2. Help students distinguish physical distance from energetic connection
```

#### 4. Signal Accessibility Clearly

**Help readers navigate content appropriate to their level:**

**Opening paragraph example:**
> "This post explores ma-ai from beginner to advanced perspectives. If you're new to Aikido, focus on the foundational sections—you'll find the advanced concepts make more sense after a few months of practice. If you're experienced, you might skim the basics and dive into the refinements section."

**Section heading examples:**
- "Ma-ai Fundamentals (Essential for All Levels)"
- "Advanced Ma-ai: Subtle Energetic Distance (Intermediate+)"
- "Teaching Progression: Helping Students Develop Ma-ai (Instructors)"

### Audience-Specific Writing Techniques

#### For Beginners (0-2 years)
**Approach:**
- Define all terms clearly
- Reassure that difficulty is normal
- Provide concrete, simple actions
- Avoid overwhelming detail
- Use encouraging tone

**Example:**
> "Don't worry if shiho nage feels awkward right now. Every aikidoka struggled with the entry. Here's one thing to focus on this week: Get your body behind uke's shoulder before attempting the turn. That's it. Master that positioning, and the throw will start to make sense."

#### For Intermediate Practitioners (3-7 years)
**Approach:**
- Build on foundational knowledge
- Introduce nuance and variations
- Connect techniques to principles
- Provide refinement guidance
- Challenge understanding

**Example:**
> "You've done ikkyo hundreds of times. But have you noticed the subtle spiral in the wrist control? It's not a straight line down—there's a slight rotation that aligns uke's structure. This distinction separates functional ikkyo from muscular ikkyo."

#### For Advanced Practitioners (8+ years)
**Approach:**
- Assume deep technical knowledge
- Explore sophisticated principles
- Present challenging concepts
- Invite critical engagement
- Address paradoxes and complexities

**Example:**
> "The paradox of musubi: We're told to maintain connection, yet O-Sensei demonstrated techniques where connection appears to break. Is this contradiction real, or have we misunderstood what 'connection' means? Consider that musubi might be energetic continuity rather than physical contact."

#### For Instructors
**Approach:**
- Provide pedagogical frameworks
- Suggest teaching progressions
- Address common teaching challenges
- Offer curriculum ideas
- Share classroom-tested methods

**Example:**
> "Teaching irimi to beginners: Don't start with the full technique. First, spend two weeks on simple entering exercises—walk straight through uke's center line while they provide resistance. Only when students understand 'entering' as body movement should you add arm techniques. This progression prevents the common mistake of thinking irimi is an arm technique."

#### For Different Interest Profiles

**Technical/Mechanical Focus:**
- Precise biomechanical explanations
- Body movement breakdowns
- Efficiency analysis
- Specific physical cues

**Philosophical/Spiritual Focus:**
- Connect to budo principles
- Explore meaning and purpose
- Life applications beyond dojo
- O-Sensei's vision and teachings

**Practical/Martial Focus:**
- Effectiveness discussion
- Realistic application
- Martial context
- Honest assessment of limitations

**Historical/Cultural Focus:**
- Lineage information
- Evolution of concepts
- Cultural context
- Traditional teachings

### Avoid These Pitfalls

❌ **Advanced-only writing**: Forgetting beginners exist, using unexplained jargon throughout
❌ **Beginner-only writing**: Never offering depth for experienced practitioners
❌ **Single-interest writing**: Only serving technical readers OR only philosophical readers
❌ **Unclear targeting**: Readers can't tell who the post is for
❌ **Condescending tier separation**: Making beginners feel "less than"

### Aim For These Patterns

✅ **Clear signaling**: Readers immediately know if content is for them
✅ **Inclusive layering**: Multiple audiences find value in same post
✅ **Respectful tone**: All experience levels treated with respect
✅ **Progressive depth**: Content starts accessible, builds to complexity
✅ **Explicit sections**: Clear headings guide readers to relevant content
✅ **Tiered takeaways**: Practical value at every level

### Testing Multi-Audience Effectiveness

**Before publishing, ask:**
1. **Accessibility**: Can a beginner understand the core concept?
2. **Depth**: Do advanced practitioners find new insight?
3. **Practical value**: Do students get actionable takeaways?
4. **Teaching value**: Do instructors gain pedagogical ideas?
5. **Interest diversity**: Does content serve technical AND philosophical readers (where relevant)?

**If answer is "no" to multiple questions, revise to broaden appeal.**

### Tracking Audience Coverage

**Quarterly review:**
1. List all published posts
2. Note primary and secondary audiences for each
3. Identify which profiles received focused content
4. Identify underserved audiences
5. Plan topics to serve underrepresented profiles

**Goal: Over time, all audience profiles receive valuable, focused content.**

## Authenticity: Writing from Your Core Values

### Why Your Values Matter

Your blog isn't just information—it's your perspective, grounded in your personal experience and beliefs as a martial artist. **Authenticity and consistency of voice come from clarity about what you believe.**

**Three foundational documents guide your authentic voice:**
- **`core-values.md`** - Your fundamental beliefs as a martial artist
- **`divisive-topics.md`** - Topics that cause disagreement in the community
- **`learning-journey.md`** - Your understanding of mastery stages and learning progression

### Using Core Values in Writing

**Before writing, review `core-values.md` to:**
1. Ground your perspective on the topic
2. Ensure consistency with your stated beliefs
3. Identify potential blog angles aligned with your values
4. Avoid contradicting your established positions

**Example - Biomechanics vs. Mysticism:**

If your core value is teaching through biomechanics rather than abstract concepts:
- ✅ "Let's break down why kokyu-nage works: When you drop your weight while extending forward..."
- ❌ "Simply let the ki flow through you and uke will fall naturally..."

**Your values shape:**
- Which examples you choose
- How you explain techniques
- What teaching methods you recommend
- Which controversies you engage with

### Navigating Divisive Topics

**When writing about controversial subjects, consult `divisive-topics.md` to:**
1. Recognize you're entering debated territory
2. Understand multiple perspectives in the community
3. Position your stance clearly and respectfully
4. Anticipate counter-arguments
5. Acknowledge legitimate alternative views

**Framework for handling divisive topics:**

```markdown
## [Divisive Topic Title]

Many practitioners debate [topic]. Some believe [Perspective A] because [reasons].
Others emphasize [Perspective B] because [different reasons].

In my experience, [your stance]. Here's why: [your reasoning grounded in practice].

I respect those who approach it differently, but [explain your position clearly].
What I've found in training is [concrete evidence from your practice].
```

**Example - Iwama vs. Blending:**

❌ **Dismissive approach:**
> "Iwama practitioners just stay rigid and never learn to relax. Blending is the only true Aikido."

✅ **Nuanced approach:**
> "Many practitioners debate whether weapons training or blending practice should come first. Iwama emphasizes building structure through ken and jo, while other approaches prioritize flowing movement from day one. In my training, I've found that weapons training builds a solid foundation—but I've also noticed many Iwama practitioners never complete the journey to genuine relaxation. My view: strong structure must come first, but it's only the beginning, not the destination."

### Writing About Learning and Mastery

**When discussing training progression, reference `learning-journey.md` for:**
1. Clear frameworks for explaining growth stages
2. Distinction between knowing and embodied mastery
3. The "kata as alphabet" concept
4. Teaching implications of different mastery levels

**Common blog applications:**

**Topic: Plateau problems**
- Reference knowing vs. embodiment distinction
- Explain why intellectual understanding isn't enough
- Guide readers toward embodied practice

**Topic: Teaching methodology**
- Reference kata as alphabet concept
- Explain progression: learn forms → understand principles → create spontaneously
- Warn against treating kata as scripture

**Topic: Respecting advanced practitioners**
- Reference what master-level martial artists see
- Explain depth visible only after embodiment
- Discuss humility about your own learning stage

### Consistency Across Posts

**Track your positions:**
- If you write about biomechanics in one post, don't suddenly advocate for mystical ki concepts in another
- If you critique rigid Iwama practitioners, acknowledge their valid foundation-building approach
- If you emphasize embodied mastery, explain learning journey from knowing to embodying

**When your views evolve:**
1. Update the relevant document (core-values.md, etc.)
2. Note the evolution in decisions.md
3. Consider writing a post about what changed your thinking
4. Don't contradict past posts without acknowledgment

### Finding Your Unique Voice

**Your authentic voice emerges from:**
- Your core values (what you believe)
- Your awareness of debates (what others believe)
- Your learning journey framework (how mastery develops)
- Your specific experiences and insights

**This combination is unique to you.** Two instructors might both emphasize biomechanics, but one focuses on Iwama structure while another emphasizes blending. Your particular constellation of beliefs creates your distinctive voice.

### Practical Application

**When drafting a post:**

1. **Check relevance**: Does this topic touch on your core values or divisive topics?
2. **Review position**: What's your stance from core-values.md?
3. **Consider controversy**: Is this divisive? Check divisive-topics.md
4. **Apply framework**: Does learning-journey.md provide useful concepts?
5. **Write authentically**: Express your genuine perspective
6. **Stay consistent**: Align with your established positions

**When reviewing a post** (`/review-aikido` will check):

1. **Value alignment**: Does post contradict your stated values?
2. **Divisive topic handling**: If controversial, are multiple views acknowledged?
3. **Consistency**: Does this match your positions in other posts?
4. **Authenticity**: Does this sound like genuine insight or generic advice?

## Quality Standards

### Before Publishing
- Run `/review-aikido` command for feedback
- Check all Japanese terms for correct spelling
- Verify any historical facts or claims
- **Verify technical accuracy against `/syllabus/` directory** (see below)
- Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing
- Ensure logical flow between sections
- Confirm practical value for readers

### Using the Syllabus for Technical Verification

**The `/syllabus/` directory is your factual reference system** - use it to ensure technical accuracy before publishing.

**When to Check the Syllabus:**
- Writing about specific techniques → Check `/syllabus/techniques/`
- Using Japanese terminology → Verify against `/syllabus/terminology.md` (100+ term dictionary)
- Discussing weapons training → Reference complete kata sequences in `/syllabus/weapons/`
- Mentioning rank or grading → Confirm details in `/syllabus/overview.md`
- Describing attacks → Check progression in `/syllabus/attacks.md`

**What the Syllabus Contains:**

1. **Comprehensive Terminology** (`/syllabus/terminology.md`)
   - 100+ Japanese terms with English translations
   - Definitions, historical context, proper usage
   - Techniques, attacks, ranks, philosophical concepts
   - Organizational terms and etiquette

2. **Technique Documentation** (`/syllabus/techniques/*.md`)
   - Detailed technique descriptions and mechanics
   - When techniques are introduced (by rank)
   - Key principles and teaching points
   - Connections to other techniques

3. **Complete Kata Sequences** (`/syllabus/weapons/`)
   - **31 Jo Kata**: All 31 movements documented with descriptions
   - **13 Jo Kata**: All 13 movements with Japanese names, translations, details
   - **7 Ken Suburi**: Sword solo practice
   - **Ki Musubi no Tachi**: Partnered sword practice
   - Other weapons forms (kumijo, ken-tai-jo)

4. **Rank Progression** (`/syllabus/overview.md`)
   - Grading structure (Rokkyu through Yondan)
   - When techniques/kata are introduced
   - Kihon vs. Kinonagare distinction
   - Takemusu/Iwama lineage information

5. **Attack Types** (`/syllabus/attacks.md`)
   - All attack types explained
   - Progressive introduction by rank
   - Proper terminology

**How to Use:**
1. **Draft your content first** - get ideas down
2. **Identify claims to verify** - techniques, terms, kata sequences, historical facts
3. **Check relevant syllabus files** - confirm accuracy
4. **Correct any errors** before running `/review-aikido`
5. **Cite specifics when helpful** - "In the 31 Jo Kata, movement #13..." shows depth

**Syllabus = Facts, Research = Interpretation:**
- `/syllabus/` contains documented factual information
- `/research/` contains your analysis and frameworks
- Separate facts from interpretation in your writing
- Ground interpretations in documented facts

**Example:**
- ✓ "Ikkyo is introduced at Rokkyu (6th kyu) in the Iwama syllabus" ← Verifiable fact from `/syllabus/overview.md`
- ✓ "I believe ikkyo is taught first because..." ← Your interpretation from `/research/`
- ✗ "Ikkyo is always the first technique taught" ← Unverified generalization

### Length Guidelines
- Minimum: 1,200 words (shorter only for very focused reference topics)
- Standard: 1,500-2,500 words for most articles
- Comprehensive: 2,500-4,000+ words for major topics or syllabus documentation
- No maximum - prioritize completeness over brevity
- Quality AND quantity - be thorough AND comprehensive

### Tone
- Professional and educational
- Knowledgeable but humble
- Accessible but not patronizing (explain clearly without dumbing down)
- Personal but not self-centered
- Respectful of tradition but not dogmatic
- Honest about challenges and questions
- Evidence-based and well-referenced
- **Writing from the journey, not the destination** - You're first dan, still learning
- More formal than blog posts, but still personal voice

### Your Voice & Perspective

**Your Position**:
- First dan (shodan) - experienced practitioner, still progressing
- Can speak authentically to Stages 1-3 from lived experience
- Currently working through Stage 4 (core-initiated movement)
- Observing and learning from Stage 5 (pattern recognition) in advanced practitioners

**How to Frame Your Insights**:
- ✅ "In my training so far, I've noticed..."
- ✅ "From observing more advanced practitioners..."
- ✅ "What I've experienced at my level..."
- ✅ "My current understanding is..."
- ✅ "This is what I'm working on understanding..."
- ❌ "This is definitively how mastery works..." (false authority)
- ❌ Writing as if you've achieved complete mastery

**Your Strength as First Dan**:
- Close enough to beginner experience to remember and relate
- Far enough along to have useful perspective and insights
- Ideal position for teaching-focused content
- Honest about ongoing learning builds credibility, doesn't undermine it

**When Writing About Advanced Concepts**:
- Acknowledge when based on observation vs. personal embodiment
- Invite dialogue and correction from more experienced practitioners
- Present frameworks as working models, not absolute truth
- Your understanding will evolve - that's part of the journey

## Review Philosophy: Critical & Collaborative

### Expect Rigorous Feedback

When you use `/review-aikido`, expect **high standards and direct, critical feedback**. This is educational article series work that could become a book, not casual blog writing.

**The review will:**
- Point out weaknesses directly without sugar-coating
- Challenge vague statements, unsupported claims, and clichés
- Ask probing questions to push your thinking deeper
- Identify where writing is generic or lacks depth
- Hold you to standards of precision, clarity, and insight
- Not accept "good enough" - push for excellence

### Work Collaboratively on Improvements

Reviews are the start of a conversation, not a final judgment.

**The collaborative process:**
1. **Receive critical feedback** - Understand what needs improvement and why
2. **Ask questions** - Clarify feedback you don't understand
3. **Discuss options** - Work through multiple revision approaches
4. **Revise iteratively** - Make improvements section by section
5. **Re-review** - Get feedback on revisions until the post reaches excellence
6. **Keep iterating** - Multiple review rounds are normal and encouraged

### What "Educational Article Quality" Means

**Content depth:**
- Comprehensive coverage, not surface-level highlights
- Offers genuine insight supported by evidence
- Shows critical thinking about Aikido concepts
- Draws on personal experience meaningfully
- Challenges or expands conventional understanding
- Leaves no significant gaps in topic coverage
- Cross-references and builds on earlier articles in series

**Writing quality:**
- Every sentence serves a purpose (no padding)
- Examples are specific and illustrative
- Terminology is precise and correctly used
- Arguments are supported with evidence or reasoning
- Voice is authentic and engaging

**Structure:**
- Introduction hooks and sets up the exploration
- Sections build logically on each other
- Transitions are smooth and purposeful
- Conclusion synthesizes, doesn't just summarize
- Every paragraph advances the main idea

### Embrace the Critical Process

**This approach will:**
- Produce significantly better final articles
- Deepen your critical thinking about Aikido
- Develop your writing and analytical skills
- Ensure your articles offer real educational value to readers
- Build a body of work worthy of book publication
- Maintain consistency and quality across entire series

**Remember:** Critical feedback is not personal criticism. It's a tool for achieving excellence. Welcome it as an opportunity to make your work stronger.
