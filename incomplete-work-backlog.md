## 8. Blog Writing - Nothing Written Yet

### No Blog Posts Exist

**Current State:**
- topics.md is empty template
- No posts in posts/ directory
- No discussions in discussions/ directory
- All workflow infrastructure complete but untested in practice

**Needed:**

**Estimated Work**:
- First post: 4-6 hours (exploration + writing + revision)
- Subsequent posts: 3-4 hours each (workflow refined)
- One complete series (5 posts): 15-20 hours

---

## 9. Integration Testing - Untested Workflow

### Slash Commands Not Yet Tested in Practice

**Current State:**
- `/review-aikido` updated to be syllabus-aware
- `/discuss` updated to reference syllabus
- blog-guidelines.md has syllabus verification section
- **BUT**: No actual blog post written to test these integrations

**Needed:**

1. **Test `/discuss` Command**
   - Run discussion session on actual blog topic
   - Verify syllabus references work as expected
   - Confirm discussion note format is helpful
   - Identify any gaps or improvements needed

2. **Test `/review-aikido` Command**
   - Review an actual blog post draft
   - Verify syllabus verification catches errors
   - Confirm terminology checking works
   - Test kata sequence verification (if weapons post)
   - Identify any gaps in review process

3. **Test Blog Guidelines**
   - Follow syllabus verification section while writing
   - Confirm workflow is clear and helpful
   - Identify any missing guidance or unclear steps

4. **Iteration and Refinement**
   - Based on first post experience, refine commands/guidelines

## 10. Research Frameworks - Personal Insights Missing

### Frameworks Exist but Lack Personal Application

**Completed Frameworks:**
- ✓ core-values.md - User's fundamental beliefs
- ✓ divisive-topics.md - Community debates
- ✓ learning-journey.md - Mastery stages
- ✓ biomechanical-principles.md - 23 principles
- ✓ weapons-training-framework.md - How weapons develop taijutsu
- ✓ stance-principles.md - Stability, power, movement
- ✓ demonstration-robotization.md - Teaching trap

**What's Missing:**
- **Personal examples** - User's specific experiences applying these frameworks
- **Teaching stories** - Real dojo scenarios illustrating principles
- **Failure cases** - What didn't work and why
- **Evolution** - How understanding has changed over time
- **Edge cases** - Where frameworks break down or need nuance

**How to Fill:**
- Use `/discuss` sessions to explore personal application
- Add "Personal Notes (First Dan Perspective)" sections to framework files
- Document teaching experiments and results
- Capture "aha moments" as they occur in training

**Value**: Personal application transforms frameworks from abstract to authentic, making blog posts more relatable and credible.

2. **Research Frameworks ↔ Video Evidence**
   - Frameworks validated by video analysis
   - Need explicit citations (video ID, timestamp, quote)
   - Need comparative analysis (Tony vs. Alexander approaches)
   - **Value**: Evidence-based frameworks vs. pure theory

3. **Blog Series ↔ Research Frameworks**
   - blog-series-structure.md doesn't explicitly map to frameworks
   - Need to identify which framework each series draws from
   - Need to ensure frameworks are fully utilized
   - **Value**: Ensures research informs content systematically

**Estimated Work**:
- Video references in technique files: 4-6 hours
- Research framework citations: 3-4 hours
- Blog series mapping: 1 hour

## How to Use This Document

**Planning Sessions:**
- Review before each session to choose high-value work
- Consider: What's needed for immediate blog writing? What's foundational for multiple posts?
- Balance quick wins (blog posts) with infrastructure (syllabus, research)

**Tracking Progress:**
- Check off completed items
- Add new gaps as discovered
- Update estimates based on actual time spent
- Remove items that become unnecessary

**Prioritizing:**
- Phase 1 work enables everything else (validate workflow)
- Focus on work that unblocks blog writing (priority research topics)
- Syllabus completion is ongoing, add as needed for posts
- Don't aim for 100% completion - aim for "good enough to write quality posts"

**Staying Motivated:**
- Mix types of work (writing, analysis, documentation)
- Celebrate milestones (first post published, 10 posts written, major series analyzed)
- Remember: Perfect is the enemy of done
- The system is already very comprehensive - use it!
