# Decision Log

This document tracks important decisions made during the project.

## 2025-10-30

### Session Continuity System
**Decision**: Use /checkpoint and /resume commands with markdown files to maintain context
**Rationale**: Simple, readable, version-controlled way to track progress between sessions
**Files**: topics.md, session-context.md, decisions.md

### Project Documentation for Claude
**Decision**: Create .claude/claude.md to document entire project setup
**Rationale**: Ensures future Claude Code sessions can understand the complete system architecture, workflow, and current state without needing to rediscover it
**Impact**: Faster onboarding for new sessions, better continuity

### User Documentation and Workflow Reminders
**Decision**: Create help.md for user and update /resume to show workflow reminder
**Rationale**: User needs clear documentation on how to use the system, and should be reminded of the workflow at the start of each session to maintain good habits
**Impact**:
- User can reference help.md anytime they need guidance
- Workflow reminder on /resume ensures consistent use of checkpoint/resume pattern
- Reduces friction in maintaining the session continuity system

### Critical and Collaborative Review Approach
**Decision**: /review-aikido should be highly critical and work collaboratively with user on improvements
**Rationale**: This is MA-level work requiring high standards. User wants rigorous, honest feedback, not polite praise. Collaborative iteration will produce better final posts than one-shot reviews.
**Standards**:
- Apply MA-level quality expectations
- Point out weaknesses directly without sugar-coating
- Challenge vague statements, unsupported claims, and clichés
- Ask probing questions to deepen thinking
- Provide specific, actionable feedback with multiple revision options
- Work iteratively through improvements
- Don't accept "good enough" - push for excellence
**Impact**:
- Higher quality blog posts
- Deeper critical thinking about Aikido concepts
- User develops stronger writing and analytical skills
- Final posts offer genuine insight, not just information

### Session History with Timestamped Summaries
**Decision**: /checkpoint should automatically create timestamped session summaries in sessions/ directory
**Rationale**: User requested ability to review sessions at a glance. session-context.md only shows current state, not historical record. Timestamped summaries provide:
- Permanent record of each session's work
- Ability to review progress over time
- Searchable history of topics and decisions
- Context for understanding the project's evolution
**Format**: `session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md` containing session focus, accomplishments, decisions, conversation highlights, files modified, and next steps
**Impact**:
- Can review any past session to see what was discussed
- Track patterns in work and progress
- Search across sessions for specific topics
- Better understanding of MA thesis development journey
- Historical context for future reference

### Discussion Capture and Extraction System
**Decision**: Create /discuss and /extract commands to transform informal conversations into blog posts
**Rationale**: User requested "an agent to help me transform informal discussions into decision, recording of idea in a way which can later be extracted to create the blog post". Direct writing from templates can be difficult - starting with informal exploration is more natural.
**System Components**:
- **/discuss command**: Conversational exploration of topics with probing questions, captures insights in structured notes
- **/extract command**: Transforms discussion notes into initial blog post drafts
- **discussions/ directory**: Stores discussion notes for later extraction or reference
- **Workflow**: Explore → Extract → Develop → Review → Iterate
**Benefits**:
- Reduces "blank page" problem by starting with conversation
- Captures authentic voice and insights naturally
- Allows thinking through ideas before committing to structure
- Creates reusable raw material (discussions can feed multiple posts)
- Separates ideation (discussion) from composition (blog writing)
- Decisions made during discussions can be logged to decisions.md
**Impact**:
- More natural workflow for content creation
- Better quality insights from exploratory discussions
- Preserves thinking process for future reference
- Enables extracting multiple posts from single discussion
- Reduces friction in getting started with blog writing

### Source Tracking and Content Monitoring System
**Decision**: Create /track-source and /scan-sources commands to monitor martial arts bloggers and generate ideas
**Rationale**: User requested "two agents which can help me find what was posted by other martial artists in their blog and use that for the recording of idea". Need system to:
1. Track martial arts bloggers from any discipline (Aikido, Karate, etc.)
2. Monitor their content for new posts
3. Analyze posts for key ideas and arguments
4. Generate blog topic ideas (response, alternative perspective, inspired exploration)
5. Build engagement with martial arts community

**System Components**:
- **/track-source command**: Register blogger profiles with URL, discipline, focus areas, scan history
- **/scan-sources command**: Fetch recent posts, analyze content, generate blog ideas, create findings reports
- **sources/registry/**: Blogger profiles with metadata and tracking history
- **sources/findings/**: Content analysis reports with blog ideas, response opportunities, discussion prompts
- **Example sources**: Leo Tamaki (Aikido), Lionel Froidure (Karate)
- **Workflow**: Track → Scan → Review Findings → Explore/Respond → Write

**Types of Blog Ideas Generated**:
- Response (direct engagement with their argument)
- Alternative Perspective (different way to view topic)
- Inspired Exploration (their topic sparks related idea)
- Extension (building on their foundation)
- Comparative Analysis (cross-discipline insights)

**Benefits**:
- Discover content inspiration from martial arts community
- Identify response and engagement opportunities
- Generate cross-discipline insights (Aikido vs. Karate perspectives)
- Stay connected to ongoing martial arts discourse
- Build dialogue with other practitioners
- Find gaps in community conversation to fill

**Impact**:
- Third approach to blog creation (source-inspired)
- Systematic monitoring replaces ad-hoc browsing
- Ideas captured and structured for easy action
- Can respond to timely topics in community
- Cross-pollination between different martial arts
- Builds authentic engagement vs. working in isolation
- Findings reports provide ready-to-use blog ideas

**Integration**:
- Findings can feed into /discuss (explore idea first)
- Or direct blog writing (respond immediately)
- Ideas tracked in topics.md
- Source connections documented
- Supports all three workflow approaches

### Audience Targeting and Multi-Profile Content Strategy
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive audience targeting system to serve diverse reader profiles
**Rationale**: User realized "our blog reader will have different profiles, martial artists beginner, advanced, some will be teaching and seek for idea for their course, perhaps parent looking for advice for their kid, etc." Single-audience writing excludes potential readers and limits blog impact.

**System Components**:
- **audience-profiles.md**: 16+ distinct reader profiles across 5 categories
  - Experience-based (Beginners, Intermediate, Advanced, Returning)
  - Role-based (Students, Instructors, Dojo Owners, Seminar Attendees)
  - Interest-based (Technical, Philosophical, Practical, Historical)
  - Life-stage (Youth, Young Adults, Middle-Aged, Seniors)
  - Adjacent (Parents, Prospective Students, Cross-Training Martial Artists)
- **Layered Content Approach**: Posts serve 3-5 audience profiles simultaneously
- **Metadata Tracking**: Every post identifies primary + secondary audiences
- **Tiered Takeaways**: Practical insights organized by experience level
- **Audience-Specific Hooks**: Hook formulas customized for different reader types
- **Quarterly Review System**: Track coverage to ensure all profiles receive content

**Updates Made**:
1. **blog-template.md**: Added audience targeting metadata fields
2. **blog-guidelines.md**: Added extensive "Writing for Multiple Audiences" section (100+ lines)
3. **blog-engagement-techniques.md**: Added audience-specific hook examples for all major profiles
4. **content-analysis-framework.md**: Added audience fit consideration in analysis steps
5. **topics.md**: Added audience tracking per topic + quarterly coverage review section
6. **All slash commands updated**:
   - /discuss: Asks who post will serve
   - /extract: Identifies and preserves audience targeting
   - /scan-sources: Identifies which audiences source content serves
   - /review-aikido: Checks audience appropriateness and multi-audience design

**Design Principles**:
- **Inclusive Layering**: Multiple audiences find value in same post through structure
- **Clear Signaling**: Readers know immediately if content is for them
- **Progressive Depth**: Accessible to beginners, challenging for advanced
- **Balanced Coverage**: No audience systematically overlooked over time
- **Respectful Tone**: All experience levels treated with equal respect
- **Multi-Entry Points**: Hooks, sections, examples serve different reader types

**Benefits**:
- **Broader Reach**: Content serves 3-5 audiences vs. single audience
- **Strategic Coverage**: Quarterly tracking ensures no profiles neglected
- **Better Value**: Each post provides layered value to multiple reader types
- **Inclusive Community**: Parents, prospective students, cross-trainers included
- **Instructor Support**: Teaching-focused content explicitly addressed
- **Life-Long Relevance**: Youth through senior practitioners served

**Impact**:
- Blog becomes resource for entire aikido community ecosystem
- Posts strategically designed for audience diversity from inception
- Quality review includes audience appropriateness check
- Topic planning considers which audiences need content
- Engagement techniques customized for different reader motivations
- Long-term tracking prevents audience blind spots

**Example Multi-Audience Post**:
"The Three Types of Relaxation in Aikido"
- Beginners: Learn "relax" doesn't mean limp
- Intermediate: Understand three distinct types in detail
- Advanced: Explore subtle distinctions and applications
- Instructors: Framework for teaching to students
- Technical: Biomechanical breakdown
- Philosophical: Connection to mushin concepts

**System Completeness**: All procedures, templates, commands, and frameworks now incorporate audience awareness. Blog is ready to create strategically targeted content that serves diverse community.
