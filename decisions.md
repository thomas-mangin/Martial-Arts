# Decision Log

This document tracks important decisions made during the project.

## 2025-10-30

### Session Continuity System
**Decision**: Use /checkpoint and /resume commands with markdown files to maintain context
**Rationale**: Simple, readable, version-controlled way to track progress between sessions
**Files**: topics.md, session-context.md, decisions.md

### Project Documentation for Claude
**Decision**: Create .claude/claude.md to document entire project setup
**Rationale**: Ensures future Claude Code sessions can understand the complete system architecture, workflow, and current state without needing to rediscover it
**Impact**: Faster onboarding for new sessions, better continuity

### User Documentation and Workflow Reminders
**Decision**: Create help.md for user and update /resume to show workflow reminder
**Rationale**: User needs clear documentation on how to use the system, and should be reminded of the workflow at the start of each session to maintain good habits
**Impact**:
- User can reference help.md anytime they need guidance
- Workflow reminder on /resume ensures consistent use of checkpoint/resume pattern
- Reduces friction in maintaining the session continuity system

### Critical and Collaborative Review Approach
**Decision**: /review-aikido should be highly critical and work collaboratively with user on improvements
**Rationale**: This is MA-level work requiring high standards. User wants rigorous, honest feedback, not polite praise. Collaborative iteration will produce better final posts than one-shot reviews.
**Standards**:
- Apply MA-level quality expectations
- Point out weaknesses directly without sugar-coating
- Challenge vague statements, unsupported claims, and clichés
- Ask probing questions to deepen thinking
- Provide specific, actionable feedback with multiple revision options
- Work iteratively through improvements
- Don't accept "good enough" - push for excellence
**Impact**:
- Higher quality blog posts
- Deeper critical thinking about Aikido concepts
- User develops stronger writing and analytical skills
- Final posts offer genuine insight, not just information

### Session History with Timestamped Summaries
**Decision**: /checkpoint should automatically create timestamped session summaries in sessions/ directory
**Rationale**: User requested ability to review sessions at a glance. session-context.md only shows current state, not historical record. Timestamped summaries provide:
- Permanent record of each session's work
- Ability to review progress over time
- Searchable history of topics and decisions
- Context for understanding the project's evolution
**Format**: `session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md` containing session focus, accomplishments, decisions, conversation highlights, files modified, and next steps
**Impact**:
- Can review any past session to see what was discussed
- Track patterns in work and progress
- Search across sessions for specific topics
- Better understanding of MA thesis development journey
- Historical context for future reference

### Discussion Capture and Extraction System
**Decision**: Create /discuss and /extract commands to transform informal conversations into blog posts
**Rationale**: User requested "an agent to help me transform informal discussions into decision, recording of idea in a way which can later be extracted to create the blog post". Direct writing from templates can be difficult - starting with informal exploration is more natural.
**System Components**:
- **/discuss command**: Conversational exploration of topics with probing questions, captures insights in structured notes
- **/extract command**: Transforms discussion notes into initial blog post drafts
- **discussions/ directory**: Stores discussion notes for later extraction or reference
- **Workflow**: Explore → Extract → Develop → Review → Iterate
**Benefits**:
- Reduces "blank page" problem by starting with conversation
- Captures authentic voice and insights naturally
- Allows thinking through ideas before committing to structure
- Creates reusable raw material (discussions can feed multiple posts)
- Separates ideation (discussion) from composition (blog writing)
- Decisions made during discussions can be logged to decisions.md
**Impact**:
- More natural workflow for content creation
- Better quality insights from exploratory discussions
- Preserves thinking process for future reference
- Enables extracting multiple posts from single discussion
- Reduces friction in getting started with blog writing
