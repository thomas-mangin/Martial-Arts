# Decision Log

This document tracks important decisions made during the project.

## 2025-10-30

### Session Continuity System
**Decision**: Use /checkpoint and /resume commands with markdown files to maintain context
**Rationale**: Simple, readable, version-controlled way to track progress between sessions
**Files**: topics.md, session-context.md, decisions.md

### Project Documentation for Claude
**Decision**: Create .claude/claude.md to document entire project setup
**Rationale**: Ensures future Claude Code sessions can understand the complete system architecture, workflow, and current state without needing to rediscover it
**Impact**: Faster onboarding for new sessions, better continuity

### User Documentation and Workflow Reminders
**Decision**: Create help.md for user and update /resume to show workflow reminder
**Rationale**: User needs clear documentation on how to use the system, and should be reminded of the workflow at the start of each session to maintain good habits
**Impact**:
- User can reference help.md anytime they need guidance
- Workflow reminder on /resume ensures consistent use of checkpoint/resume pattern
- Reduces friction in maintaining the session continuity system

### Critical and Collaborative Review Approach
**Decision**: /review-aikido should be highly critical and work collaboratively with user on improvements
**Rationale**: This is MA-level work requiring high standards. User wants rigorous, honest feedback, not polite praise. Collaborative iteration will produce better final posts than one-shot reviews.
**Standards**:
- Apply MA-level quality expectations
- Point out weaknesses directly without sugar-coating
- Challenge vague statements, unsupported claims, and clich√©s
- Ask probing questions to deepen thinking
- Provide specific, actionable feedback with multiple revision options
- Work iteratively through improvements
- Don't accept "good enough" - push for excellence
**Impact**:
- Higher quality blog posts
- Deeper critical thinking about Aikido concepts
- User develops stronger writing and analytical skills
- Final posts offer genuine insight, not just information

### Session History with Timestamped Summaries
**Decision**: /checkpoint should automatically create timestamped session summaries in sessions/ directory
**Rationale**: User requested ability to review sessions at a glance. session-context.md only shows current state, not historical record. Timestamped summaries provide:
- Permanent record of each session's work
- Ability to review progress over time
- Searchable history of topics and decisions
- Context for understanding the project's evolution
**Format**: `session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md` containing session focus, accomplishments, decisions, conversation highlights, files modified, and next steps
**Impact**:
- Can review any past session to see what was discussed
- Track patterns in work and progress
- Search across sessions for specific topics
- Better understanding of MA thesis development journey
- Historical context for future reference
