# Shiho-nage (四方投げ)

**Japanese**: Shiho-nage
**Romanization**: Four-direction throw
**English Translation**: Four-directions throw / All-directions throw
**Category**: Nage-waza (Projection / Throw)

---

## Description

Shiho-nage is a fundamental projection where nage raises uke's arm overhead and throws them in one of four directions by cutting downward (like a sword cut). The technique is named for the ability to throw in any of the four cardinal directions.

The technique emphasizes:
- Raising uke's arm overhead (taking their balance upward first)
- Cutting motion downward (like shomenuchi with sword)
- Control of uke's elbow throughout
- Can throw in multiple directions (omote/ura, different angles)

## Variations

### By Direction
- **Omote (表)**: Front entry, throw forward
- **Ura (裏)**: Turning entry, throw to rear

### By Attack
- **Katatedori shiho-nage**: From wrist grab (most common teaching)
- **Shomenuchi shiho-nage**: From overhead strike
- **Yokomenuchi shiho-nage**: From side strike
- **Kosadori shiho-nage**: From cross-hand grab
- **Ryotedori shiho-nage**: From both-hands grab
- **Tsuki shiho-nage**: From thrust

### By Practice Mode
- **Tachiwaza**: Standing
- **Suwariwaza**: Both in seiza (sitting) - at higher levels
- **Hanmihandachi**: Nage sits, uke stands - at dan levels

### By Form
- **Kihon**: Basic, structured form
- **Kinonagare**: Flowing form (from 2nd kyu)

## Key Biomechanical Principles

[TO BE FILLED: Detailed biomechanical analysis]

Preliminary notes:
- Lifting/raising uke's balance upward first
- Cutting motion like shomenuchi (sword strike)
- Control through elbow, not just hand
- Four directions = can adapt throw to any direction
- Similar body mechanics to ken suburi #1

**Framework Connection**: See research/biomechanical-principles.md

---

## Common Errors

### For Beginners (Gokyu-Sankyu)
- **Not raising uke's arm high enough**: Must take balance upward first
- **Pulling instead of cutting**: Should be cutting motion, not pull-down
- **Wrong grip**: Must control elbow, not just wrist
- **Forgetting the direction**: Must commit to throw direction clearly
- **Stopping the cut**: Motion should be continuous

## Learning Journey Connections

[TO BE FILLED: Detailed stage mapping]

**Stage 1-2**: Learning to raise arm and cut downward
**Stage 3-4**: Understanding different directions and entries
**Stage 5**: Spontaneous direction choice based on uke's energy

*See: research/learning-journey.md*

---

## School/Lineage Variations

**Your School (Takemusu/Iwama)**:
- Strong emphasis on cutting motion (like ken)
- Arm must be raised fully overhead
- Clear shomenuchi-style cut downward

**Known Variations**:
- **Aikikai**: Often more flowing, less sharp cut
- **Yoshinkan**: Very precise kihon form with specific angles
- **Ki Society**: Emphasis on extension rather than cutting

Different schools have notably different shiho-nage styles.

## Teaching Notes

[TO BE FILLED: Detailed teaching progression]

**Key Teaching Points**:
- "Raise uke's arm as high as you can first"
- "Cut down like shomenuchi with the sword"
- "Four directions means you can throw anywhere"
- "Control the elbow, not just the hand"

---

## Weapon Connection

**Shomenuchi with ken**: Shiho-nage's cutting motion directly mirrors the overhead sword strike (ken suburi #1). The body mechanics are essentially the same.

*See: research/weapons-training-framework.md*

---

## Personal Notes (First Dan Perspective)

Shiho-nage felt awkward for a long time until I understood it's literally just a sword cut with uke's arm attached. The "four directions" name makes sense—you can throw in any direction by adjusting your positioning, but the cutting motion stays the same.
