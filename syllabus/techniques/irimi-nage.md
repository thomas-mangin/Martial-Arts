# Irimi-nage (入身投げ)

**Japanese**: Irimi-nage
**Romanization**: Entering throw
**English Translation**: Entering body throw
**Category**: Nage-waza (Projection / Throw)

---

## Description

Irimi-nage is a fundamental projection where nage enters deeply into uke's space, typically redirecting their momentum and throwing them with a circular motion behind their head/neck. Often called the "20-year technique" because it takes that long to truly master.

The technique emphasizes:
- Deep irimi (entering) movement
- Circular motion (like horizontal sword cut)
- Control of uke's head/neck line
- Timing and ma-ai (distance)
- Not using strength against neck

## Syllabus Progression (Takemusu/Iwama)

| Grade | Attack(s) | Form | Notes |
|-------|-----------|------|-------|
| **Yonkyu (4th)** | Katatedori | - | First introduction |
| **Sankyu (3rd)** | Yokomenuchi | Kinonagare | Flowing form, entering/absorbing |
| **Nikyu (2nd)** | Tsuki | - | Direct thrust attack |
| **Ikkyu (1st)** | Katatedori & Yokomenuchi | Kinonagare | Refined execution |
| **Ikkyu (1st)** | Shomenuchi | - | Suwariwaza |
| **Shodan** | Shomenuchi & Yokomenuchi | Kinonagare | Suwariwaza & Hanmihandachi |
| **Shodan** | Shomenuchi & Yokomenuchi | Kinonagare | Tachiwaza (standing) |
| **Nidan** | Ushiro ryotedori | - | Rear attack |

**Note**: Typically taught in kinonagare (flowing) form rather than strict kihon, though basics must be solid.

## Variations

### By Attack
- **Shomenuchi irimi-nage**: Response to front strike
- **Yokomenuchi irimi-nage**: Response to side strike (most common teaching)
- **Katatedori irimi-nage**: Response to wrist grab
- **Tsuki irimi-nage**: Response to punch/thrust
- **Ushiro ryotedori irimi-nage**: Response to rear grab

### By Entry
- **Irimi (entering)**: Direct deep entry
- **Tenkan (turning)**: Initial pivot then enter
- Different schools emphasize different entries

### By Practice Mode
- **Tachiwaza**: Standing
- **Suwariwaza**: Both in seiza (sitting)
- **Hanmihandachi**: Nage sits, uke stands

## Key Biomechanical Principles

1. **Ma-ai (#2)**: Critical distance management for entry
2. **Timing (#7)**: Must enter at right moment
3. **Circular Motion (#6)**: Horizontal cutting motion (like yokomenuchi with ken)
4. **Hip Power (#8)**: Throw generated from hip rotation
5. **Off-balancing (#3)**: Taking uke's balance through center control
6. **Structural Integrity (#11)**: Maintaining posture during deep entry
7. **Relaxation (#23)**: Technique fails if tense - must be soft and flowing

**Framework Connection**: See research/biomechanical-principles.md

## Common Errors

### For Beginners (Yonkyu-Sankyu)
- **Grabbing/pushing the head**: Should guide, not push
- **Shallow entry**: Not entering deeply enough into uke's space
- **Using arm strength**: Power from hips and body rotation
- **Poor timing**: Entering too early or too late
- **Breaking ma-ai**: Losing proper distance

### For Intermediate (Ikkyu-Shodan)
- **Mechanical movement**: Technique becomes robotic, lacks flow
- **Telegraphing entry**: Uke sees it coming, can counter
- **Dropping posture**: Bending forward, losing structural integrity
- **Wrong angle**: Not cutting at proper angle for momentum redirection
- **Forcing the throw**: Should feel effortless, not forceful

### For Advanced (Nidan+)
- **Over-reliance on cooperation**: Must work with non-compliant uke
- **Lack of subtlety**: Movement too obvious, not refined
- **Missing connection**: Losing musubi (connection) with uke
- **Inconsistent ukemi safety**: Must protect uke's neck properly

## Learning Journey Connections

**Stage 2-3 (Refining)**: Yonkyu-Ikkyu
- Learning the entry timing
- Understanding circular motion
- Practicing safe execution for uke
- "How do I enter without getting countered?"

**Stage 4 (Integrating)**: Shodan-Nidan
- Entry becomes natural
- Can adapt to different attacks
- Timing is intuitive
- "It just flows"

**Stage 5 (Embodied)**: Sandan+
- Effortless irimi
- No thought, spontaneous adaptation
- Teaching others the subtleties
- "The 20-year technique" - still refining

## School/Lineage Variations

**Your School (Takemusu/Iwama)**:
- Emphasizes deep irimi (entering)
- Connection to yokomenuchi (sword cut)
- Often taught with tenkan (pivot) first
- Strong emphasis on not using force against neck

**Known Variations**:
- **Aikikai**: Often softer, more flowing entry
- **Yoshinkan**: More structured kihon version exists
- **Ki Society**: Emphasis on ki extension through throw
- Some styles enter directly, others pivot first

## Teaching Notes

### Key Teaching Points
1. **"Enter like you're going to walk through them"**: Deep commitment to entry
2. **"Horizontal sword cut"**: Connection to yokomenuchi with ken
3. **"Guide the head, don't push"**: Neck safety critical
4. **"Your hips throw them, not your arms"**: Hip rotation powers throw
5. **"See the opening, then move"**: Timing is everything

### Progression
1. Start with yokomenuchi attack (most natural for learning timing)
2. Practice entry (irimi) separately first
3. Add throw motion slowly with cooperative uke
4. Emphasize ukemi safety (protect neck)
5. Gradually increase speed as timing improves
6. Later add other attacks (katatedori, tsuki, etc.)

### Common Fixes
- **Uke doesn't throw**: Entry not deep enough → Practice irimi drills
- **Throw feels forced**: Using arm strength → Focus on hip rotation
- **Technique too slow**: Poor timing → Practice entry timing separately
- **Uke's neck uncomfortable**: Pushing instead of guiding → Review hand placement and motion

## Weapon Connection

**Yokomenuchi with ken**: Irimi-nage mirrors the body movement of receiving and countering a side sword strike. The throw motion is like making a horizontal cut behind uke's head.

**Ken tai jo application**: The footwork and timing principles in irimi-nage directly relate to weapons work.

## Personal Notes (First Dan Perspective)

Irimi-nage remains one of my most challenging techniques. The timing of the entry is something I'm still working on—entering too early feels forced, too late and the opening is gone.

The phrase "20-year technique" makes sense to me now. The basics can be learned quickly, but the subtle timing, the effortless entry, the feeling of just being in the right place at the right moment—that's what takes years.

Key insight from training: When it works, it feels like uke threw themselves. When it doesn't work, I'm usually trying too hard.
