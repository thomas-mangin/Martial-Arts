# Nikyo (二教)

**Japanese**: Nikyo
**Romanization**: Second Teaching
**English Translation**: Second control / Second principle
**Category**: Osae-waza (Pin / Immobilization)
**Also known as**: Kote-mawashi (wrist twist)

---

## Description

Nikyo is the second pin, controlling uke through a wrist/forearm twist that creates pressure on the wrist joint and forearm. The technique uses a rotating motion to take uke's balance and pin them face-down with their arm twisted.

The technique emphasizes:
- Wrist and forearm rotation (not just wrist)
- Circular spiral motion
- Pressure on wrist joint and forearm
- Taking balance through rotational control

## Key Biomechanical Principles

[TO BE FILLED: Detailed biomechanical analysis]

Preliminary notes:
- Uses wrist joint rotation and forearm twist
- Spiral/rotational motion is key
- Similar to wringing motion
- Must affect both wrist and forearm, not just wrist

**Framework Connection**: See research/biomechanical-principles.md

---

## Common Errors

### For Beginners
- **Twisting only the wrist**: Must engage forearm rotation as well
- **Using excessive force**: Technique should be smooth, not forceful
- **Wrong angle of application**: Wrist must be at specific angle for control
- **Losing connection**: Breaking contact during rotation
- **Grabbing instead of controlling**: Should guide, not grip hard

## Teaching Notes

**Key Teaching Points**:
- "Rotate the forearm, not just the wrist"
- "Like wringing out a towel"
- "Find the angle where uke's balance breaks"

## Personal Notes (First Dan Perspective)

Nikyo remains challenging to apply correctly without using excessive force. The key seems to be finding the exact angle where uke's structure collapses—too little rotation and there's no control, too much and you're fighting their resistance.
