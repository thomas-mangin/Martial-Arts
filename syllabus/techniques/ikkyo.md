# Ikkyo (一教)

**Japanese**: Ikkyo
**Romanization**: First Teaching
**English Translation**: First control / First principle
**Category**: Osae-waza (Pin / Immobilization)
**Also known as**: Ude-osae (arm pin)

---

## Description

Ikkyo is the first and most fundamental pin in Aikido. It controls uke's arm through the elbow, using circular movement to take their balance and pin them face-down with their arm extended.

The technique emphasizes:
- Control through the elbow (not the wrist)
- Circular cutting motion (like cutting with a sword)
- Taking balance (kuzushi) through hip movement
- Extension and connection

## Variations

### By Direction
- **Omote (表)**: Entering/front variation
  - Enter directly toward uke's front
  - Control arm while moving forward
  - More direct, linear

- **Ura (裏)**: Turning/rear variation
  - Pivot/turn to uke's rear
  - Circular entry
  - More flowing, circular

### By Attack
- **Shomenuchi ikkyo**: Response to overhead strike
- **Yokomenuchi ikkyo**: Response to side strike
- **Katatedori ikkyo**: Response to wrist grab
- **Katadori ikkyo**: Response to shoulder grab
- **Ushiro ryotedori ikkyo**: Response to rear both-hands grab

### By Practice Mode
- **Tachiwaza**: Standing
- **Suwariwaza**: Both in seiza (sitting)
- **Hanmihandachi**: Nage sits, uke stands

### By Form
- **Kihon**: Basic, structured form (sharp angles, clear steps)
- **Kinonagare**: Flowing form (smooth, continuous, blending)

## Key Biomechanical Principles

1. **Leverage (#1)**: Using elbow as fulcrum to control uke's structure
2. **Center/Balance (#3)**: Taking uke's balance through center movement
3. **Circular Motion (#6)**: Cutting downward in arc (like sword cut)
4. **Hip Power (#8)**: Movement generated from hips, not just arms
5. **Structural Alignment (#11)**: Maintaining strong posture throughout
6. **Extension (#14)**: Extending uke's arm while maintaining connection

**Framework Connection**: See research/biomechanical-principles.md

## Common Errors

### For Beginners (Rokkyu-Yonkyu)
- **Grabbing the wrist**: Control should be through elbow, not wrist
- **Using arm strength**: Power comes from hip movement, not biceps
- **Stopping movement**: Should be continuous flowing motion
- **Wrong angle**: Not cutting at proper angle to take balance
- **Losing connection**: Breaking contact during movement

### For Intermediate (Sankyu-Ikkyu)
- **Mechanical execution**: Kihon becomes robotic, lacking flow
- **Poor ma-ai**: Distance management needs refinement
- **Weak kuzushi**: Not fully taking uke's balance before pin
- **Collapsing posture**: Bending forward instead of maintaining shisei

### For Advanced (Shodan+)
- **Over-reliance on uke's cooperation**: Technique must work with resistance
- **Lack of kime**: Not decisive at moment of control
- **Insufficient zanshin**: Awareness drops after pin completed

## Learning Journey Connections

**Stage 1-2 (Knowing)**: Rokkyu-Yonkyu
- Learning the steps intellectually
- Counting movements: "Step 1, step 2, step 3..."
- Focus on memorizing sequence

**Stage 3 (Refining)**: Sankyu-Ikkyu
- Making technique smooth
- Understanding principles behind movements
- Beginning to adapt to different body types

**Stage 4 (Integrating)**: Shodan-Nidan
- Technique becomes natural
- Can apply principles to variations
- Hip movement automatic

**Stage 5 (Embodied)**: Sandan+
- Effortless execution
- Spontaneous adaptation
- Teaching others naturally

## School/Lineage Variations

**Your School (Takemusu/Iwama)**:
- Strong emphasis on weapon connection (ken cutting motion)
- Hip movement (koshi) crucial
- Clear distinction between kihon and kinonagare
- Pin requires full extension and control

**Known Variations**:
- **Aikikai**: Often softer entry, more blending
- **Yoshinkan**: Very precise angles, strict kihon form
- **Ki Society**: Emphasis on ki extension and relaxation
- **Tomiki**: May include competition-style variations

## Teaching Notes

### Key Teaching Points
1. **Start with shomenuchi**: Most natural attack for learning
2. **Emphasize elbow control**: "Control the elbow, not the wrist"
3. **Sword analogy**: "Cut downward like shomenuchi with ken"
4. **Hip movement**: "Let your hips move your arms"
5. **Continuous motion**: "Don't stop - keep flowing"

### Progression
1. Teach omote first (more natural/direct)
2. Then add ura (requires more coordination)
3. Start with tachiwaza (standing)
4. Add suwariwaza after tachiwaza is comfortable
5. Introduce kinonagare only after kihon is solid

### Common Fixes
- **Uke can easily resist**: Nage is using arm strength → Focus on hip movement
- **Technique feels jerky**: Not cutting in smooth arc → Practice solo cutting motion
- **Uke doesn't go down**: Balance not taken → Check entry angle and depth

## Personal Notes (First Dan Perspective)

Ikkyo was my first technique and remains one of the most challenging to execute properly. The difference between knowing the steps and actually taking someone's balance through hip movement took me about 2 years to begin understanding.

Key insight: Ikkyo is not about pushing uke down—it's about taking their center so they have nowhere to go but down.
