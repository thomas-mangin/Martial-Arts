# Jo Suburi (杖素振り)

**Japanese**: Jo Suburi
**Translation**: Staff solo striking practice
**Category**: Aikijo (Aikido staff practice)
**Equipment**: Jo (wooden staff, approximately 128cm / 50 inches)

---

## Overview

Jo suburi are solo staff striking and thrusting exercises. The jo is central to Iwama Aikido training—Saito Sensei emphasized jo practice extensively. Like ken (sword) work, jo training develops body mechanics that transfer directly to empty-hand techniques.

## Personal Notes (First Dan Perspective)

Jo is everywhere in Iwama Aikido. The staff work feels more central than sword work in some ways—maybe because there are 31 kata vs. fewer ken kata. The connection to empty-hand isn't as obvious to me yet as ken is, but instructors keep saying the hip movement is the same.
