# Ken Suburi (剣素振り)

**Japanese**: Ken Suburi / Bokken Suburi
**Translation**: Sword solo striking practice
**Category**: Aikiken (Aikido sword practice)
**Equipment**: Bokken (wooden sword)

---

## Overview

Ken suburi are solo sword cutting exercises that develop proper body mechanics, posture, and the connection between sword work and empty-hand techniques (taijutsu). In Iwama Aikido, sword training is not separate from empty-hand—the same principles apply to both.

## Weapon Connection to Taijutsu

**Key Principle**: In Iwama Aikido, sword and empty-hand are not separate. The body mechanics are the same.

**Examples**:
- Ken suburi #1 (shomenuchi) = Ikkyo cutting motion = Shiho-nage cutting motion
- Yokomenuchi (sword) = Yokomenuchi attack (empty-hand) = Irimi-nage entry
- Sword posture (hanmi) = Empty-hand posture (hanmi)

## Personal Notes (First Dan Perspective)

The sword work made empty-hand techniques finally make sense. Ikkyo isn't just "moving an arm"—it's cutting like shomenuchi. This connection is what makes Iwama style distinctive.
