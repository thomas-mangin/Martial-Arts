# Ken Suburi (剣素振り)

**Japanese**: Ken Suburi / Bokken Suburi
**Translation**: Sword solo striking practice
**Category**: Aikiken (Aikido sword practice)
**Equipment**: Bokken (wooden sword)

---

## Overview

Ken suburi are solo sword cutting exercises that develop proper body mechanics, posture, and the connection between sword work and empty-hand techniques (taijutsu). In Iwama Aikido, sword training is not separate from empty-hand—the same principles apply to both.

### Kumitachi (組太刀)
**Translation**: Paired sword practice
**Progression**: 1-2 at Nikyu (2nd kyu), 1-5 at Ikkyu (1st kyu) and above
**Description**: Pre-arranged partner sword forms
[TO BE FILLED: Details of each kumitachi]

### Ki Musubi no Tachi (気結びの太刀)
**Translation**: Ki-connection sword / Blending-spirit sword / Energy-blending sword
**Category**: Kumitachi (paired sword practice)
**Grade**: Nikyu (2nd kyu) and above
**Type**: Flowing partner practice

**Description**:
Ki Musubi no Tachi is a flowing, continuous sword practice between two partners that emphasizes connection (musubi) rather than rigid choreography. Unlike the numbered kumitachi forms (kumitachi #1-5), which have specific sequences, Ki Musubi no Tachi focuses on maintaining connection and flow between partners' swords.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Musubi (結び)**: Connection, tying together, blending
- Continuous flowing movement between partners
- Maintaining connection through sword contact and movement
- Responsive rather than pre-choreographed
- Develops sensitivity and timing
- Embodies principle of blending (awase) with weapon

**Relationship to Other Practice**:
- Advanced form of Awase (blending practice)
- Related to concept of Ki no Nagare (flowing with ki) in taijutsu
- Emphasizes same principles as flowing empty-hand techniques
- Develops ma-ai (distance) awareness dynamically

**Teaching Context**:
Introduced at Nikyu level after students have developed:
- Solid ken suburi foundation (all 7 suburi)
- Understanding of basic kumitachi forms (1-2)
- Experience with awase (blending exercises)
- Ability to maintain connection while moving

**Pedagogical Value**:
- Develops non-attachment to rigid form
- Teaches principle of continuous connection
- Bridges gap between kata (forms) and jiyu-waza (free practice)
- Cultivates sensitivity to partner's intention and movement
- Prepares for more advanced spontaneous practice

**Technical Points** (from Tony Sargeant instruction):

1. **Posture and Balance**:
   - Don't lean forward on attack - maintain upright posture
   - 50/50 weight distribution on both feet
   - Mutual stance (both partners positioned identically)
   - Balanced weight throughout engagement

2. **Precise Measurement**:
   - Sword should cover partner's wrist by approximately 7cm
   - Exact positioning critical for technique effectiveness
   - If measurements change, entire technique breaks
   - Distance awareness developed through fixed weapon length

3. **Full Body Connection**:
   - "Connected all the way through my body"
   - Front foot "operates through my body"
   - NOT: lift foot and then step forward (disconnected)
   - Move whole body, not just arms

4. **Cut Angle Precision**:
   - Slight angle on cut: effective technique
   - Straight step without angle: incomplete/incorrect
   - Angle and footwork relationship critical
   - Body angle = sword angle

5. **Sensory Connection ("Like a Piece of String")**:
   - "Connected sensory wise... like a piece of string"
   - Continuous awareness of partner's movement
   - Tactile feedback through sword contact
   - Watch partner throughout execution
   - If partner slides back too far, reveals lack of connection

6. **Body Movement vs Arm Movement**:
   - "He moves his body not just his arm"
   - Whole-body coordination required
   - Analogy: "like letting air out of a balloon"
   - Kinetic chain integrity from ground up

**Biomechanical Translation**:
- "Connected like string" = tactile feedback + proprioceptive awareness
- "Ki musubi" = sensory integration (visual + tactile + proprioceptive)
- Fixed weapon length teaches precise measurement (can't fake distance)
- Sword weight reveals disconnected movement (can't muscle it)
- Forces proper kinetic chain (ground-up force transmission)

### Ken tai Jo (剣対杖)
**Translation**: Sword vs. staff
**Description**: Paired practice with one partner using ken, one using jo
[TO BE FILLED: When introduced, specific forms]

## Weapon Connection to Taijutsu

**Key Principle**: In Iwama Aikido, sword and empty-hand are not separate. The body mechanics are the same.

**Examples**:
- Ken suburi #1 (shomenuchi) = Ikkyo cutting motion = Shiho-nage cutting motion
- Yokomenuchi (sword) = Yokomenuchi attack (empty-hand) = Irimi-nage entry
- Sword posture (hanmi) = Empty-hand posture (hanmi)

*See: research/weapons-training-framework.md for detailed analysis*

## Personal Notes (First Dan Perspective)

The sword work made empty-hand techniques finally make sense. Ikkyo isn't just "moving an arm"—it's cutting like shomenuchi. This connection is what makes Iwama style distinctive.
