## Missing Rank-Specific Files

### No Rank Files Exist Yet (0/10)

**Purpose**: Consolidate exact requirements per rank from TIAE syllabus

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Information exists in overview.md, but not organized by rank

**Kyu Grades (6 files):**
- [ ] ranks/rokkyu.md - 6th kyu requirements
- [ ] ranks/gokyu.md - 5th kyu requirements
- [ ] ranks/yonkyu.md - 4th kyu requirements
- [ ] ranks/sankyu.md - 3rd kyu requirements
- [ ] ranks/nikyu.md - 2nd kyu requirements
- [ ] ranks/ikkyu.md - 1st kyu requirements

**Dan Grades (4 files):**
- [ ] ranks/shodan.md - 1st dan requirements
- [ ] ranks/nidan.md - 2nd dan requirements
- [ ] ranks/sandan.md - 3rd dan requirements
- [ ] ranks/yondan.md - 4th dan requirements

**What Each File Should Contain:**
- Exact technique requirements from TIAE syllabus
- When kihon vs kinonagare expected (2nd kyu and above)
- Weapons requirements (which suburi, kata, kumijo)
- Attack types introduced at this level
- Ukemi requirements
- Testing expectations
- Estimated training time to achieve

**Estimate**: 8-12 hours to create all 10 files (extract from overview.md + TIAE syllabus PDFs)

**When to Create**: When writing beginner-focused or progression-focused blog posts

## Video Evidence Integration

### Need to Add to Technique Files

**Purpose**: Ground syllabus in observable teaching from Tony Sargeant and Alexander Gent

**What's Needed:**
- Specific video IDs for each technique
- Timestamps for key teaching points
- Comparative notes (Tony vs Alexander approaches)

**Priority by Technique:**
1. Ikkyo - HIGH (fundamental technique)
2. Shiho-nage - HIGH (common projection)
3. Irimi-nage - HIGH (fundamental projection)
4. Nikyo - MEDIUM
5. Others - Add as blog posts require

**Process:**
1. When writing about a technique, search video transcripts
2. Identify relevant clips from Tony/Alexander
3. Add to technique file with timestamp and key teaching point
4. Note differences in approach if any

**Estimate**: 1-2 hours per technique (search + document + review)

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Add Content

**Add immediately:**
- Technique files when writing blog post about that technique
- Personal insights after significant practice breakthroughs
- Video references when you find particularly clear explanations

**Add when convenient:**
- Weapons details if writing weapons-focused posts
- Rank files if writing progression-focused content
- Common errors as you observe them in teaching

**Don't prioritize:**
- Completing every technique file "just because"
- Filling every "TO BE FILLED" before writing posts
- Creating all rank files upfront

### Priority Decision Framework

Ask: "Do I need this for the blog post I'm writing?"
- **Yes** → Add it now (research becomes part of writing process)
- **No** → Note it and move on (backlog tracks it for later)

### Tracking Progress

- Check items as completed
- Update "Last Updated" date when making changes
- Remove completed sections when no longer relevant
- Add new gaps as discovered

*The syllabus grows strategically based on blog needs, not comprehensively based on completeness goals. Quality over quantity.*
