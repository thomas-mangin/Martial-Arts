## What Makes Takemusu/Iwama Aikido Unique

### 1. Strong Foundations
Iwama Aikido emphasizes mastering basics:
- Stances (kamae)
- Grips (kumi)
- Posture (hanmi)
- Core techniques (kihon waza)

These are the pillars of practice.

### 2. Integrated Weapons and Empty-Hand
Weapons (bokken/ken, jo, tanto) studied alongside empty-hand (taijutsu):
- Deepens understanding of distance (ma-ai)
- Develops timing (awase)
- Improves movement quality

### 3. Step-by-Step Progression
Syllabus introduces new material at each grade:
- Often focuses on single attack or theme per grade
- Builds confidence and depth systematically
- Progressive complexity

### 4. Takemusu ("Spontaneous Technique")
Progression from structured basics to flowing, adaptive movement:
- Early: Kihon (basic, structured form)
- Later: Kinonagare (flowing, adaptive form)
- Ultimate: Expressing Aikido freely as O-Sensei intended

## Grading Philosophy

### Supportive and Manageable
- Gradings are concise (20-30 minutes)
- Examiner selects few techniques from each section
- Reduces stress, focuses on quality

### Building Confidence
- Early gradings: Core techniques and principles
- Later grades: Add variety and complexity
- Always deepening understanding

### Principles Over Performance
As you progress, assessment shifts to:
- Relaxation
- Use of hips (koshi)
- Posture (shisei)
- Connection (musubi)
- Awareness (zanshin)
