# Vital Points Reference

**Purpose**: Educational reference documenting anatomical vulnerabilities, biomechanical explanations, and legal/ethical context for targeting.

**Educational Intent**: This document exists to:
1. Understand human anatomical vulnerabilities (knowledge, not promotion)
2. Recognize when techniques target vital points (awareness)
3. Know legal/ethical implications of targeting (responsibility)
4. Make informed decisions about force level (judgment)

**WARNING**: This information is for educational purposes only. Targeting vital points carries serious legal and ethical responsibilities. Improper use can result in permanent injury, death, and criminal prosecution.

## Understanding Vital Points

### What Makes a Point "Vital"

**Vital Point** (Kyusho in Japanese): Anatomical location where strikes, pressure, or manipulation cause disproportionate effect relative to force applied.

**Biomechanical Reasons for Vulnerability**:

1. **Structural Weakness**: Unsupported tissue (throat, eyes, groin)
2. **Nerve Concentration**: High nerve density (solar plexus, jaw hinge)
3. **Vascular Access**: Major blood vessels near surface (carotid, femoral)
4. **Joint Vulnerability**: Mechanical limits exceeded (knee, elbow, fingers)
5. **Organ Exposure**: Vital organs with minimal protection (liver, spleen, kidneys)
6. **Respiratory Dependency**: Compromise breathing (nose, throat, solar plexus)
7. **Neurological Impact**: Brain function disruption (temple, jaw, base of skull)

**Not Mystical** - Pure Biomechanics:
- Traditional "pressure point" mysticism → biomechanical vulnerability
- "Dim mak" (death touch) myth → understanding of anatomical weakness
- "Chi disruption" → nerve damage, vascular compromise, or trauma

**Why This Matters**:
Understanding WHY a point is vulnerable allows:
- Recognition of danger when attacked
- Informed decisions about targeting
- Appreciation of technique lethality
- Legal awareness of force implications

---

## Effect Levels Classification

### Level 1: Pain Compliance ⚠️
**Effect**: Causes pain but no lasting injury
**Recovery**: Immediate to minutes
**Legal**: Generally acceptable for control in appropriate context

**Examples**:
- Nikyo (wrist twist) - nerve pressure
- Sankyo (wrist spiral) - joint stress
- Pressure to muscle bellies
- Finger/hand manipulation

**Appropriate Context**:
- Controlling non-cooperative person (bouncer, security)
- Restraining aggressive but not deadly threat
- Teaching/demonstration (light pressure)

**Legal Status**: Reasonable force for physical threat (non-deadly)

---

### Level 2: Temporary Incapacitation ⚠️⚠️
**Effect**: Disables for seconds to minutes, no permanent damage (if done correctly)
**Recovery**: Minutes to hours
**Legal**: Justified for serious physical threat

**Examples**:
- Solar plexus strike (wind knocked out)
- Common peroneal nerve strike (leg "dead leg")
- Moderate groin strike (pain, temporary disability)
- Joint locks near breaking point (but not broken)

**Appropriate Context**:
- Active physical assault (sustained attack)
- Need to incapacitate to escape
- Defending others from harm

**Legal Status**: Reasonable force for Level 2-3 threats (see legal-ethical-context.md)

**Risk**: If executed improperly or with too much force → Level 3

---

### Level 3: Serious Injury ⚠️⚠️⚠️
**Effect**: Permanent damage, disability, or long recovery
**Recovery**: Weeks to months, possibly permanent impairment
**Legal**: Only justified for deadly threat scenarios

**Examples**:
- Joint breaks (elbow, knee, ankle)
- Severe groin strike (testicular rupture)
- Eye trauma (vision loss)
- Broken ribs (possible organ damage)
- Spinal trauma

**Appropriate Context**:
- Deadly weapon threat
- Multiple attackers
- Disparity of force (must disable to survive)

**Legal Status**: Deadly force - same justification required as lethal techniques

**Legal Warning**: Prosecutor will argue this is excessive unless deadly threat clearly proven

---

### Level 4: Lethal ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
**Effect**: Death or high likelihood of death
**Recovery**: N/A
**Legal**: Only justified when facing imminent threat of death

**Examples**:
- Throat crush (asphyxiation)
- Carotid artery rupture (exsanguination)
- Temple strike (brain trauma)
- Spinal severance (paralysis/death)
- Trachea collapse

**Appropriate Context**:
- Armed deadly weapon attack (knife, gun)
- Imminent threat of death
- No other options for survival

**Legal Status**: Deadly force - will be investigated as homicide (justifiable or criminal)

**Ethical Weight**: Taking a life is irreversible - exhaust all other options first

---

## Legal/Ethical Framework

### The Decision Tree

**Before Targeting ANY Vital Point, Ask**:

1. **Can I escape without engaging?**
   - YES → Escape (safest legally and physically)
   - NO → Proceed to question 2

2. **What level of threat am I facing?**
   - Verbal only → De-escalate, no physical response
   - Minor physical → Control techniques (Level 1)
   - Serious attack → Incapacitation (Level 2)
   - Deadly threat → All options including lethal (Level 3-4)

3. **Is this technique proportionate to the threat?**
   - Throat strike for drunk shove → NO (excessive force)
   - Joint lock for sustained punch attack → YES (proportionate)
   - Eye gouge for knife attack → YES (deadly force justified)

4. **Can I articulate why this was necessary?**
   - To police, to prosecutor, to jury
   - If you can't explain it, don't do it
   - "I panicked" ≠ legal justification

### Legal Terminology

**Deadly Force**: Any technique with high likelihood of causing death or grave bodily harm
- Includes: Level 3-4 vital point strikes
- Requires: Imminent threat of death to justify
- Consequence: Homicide investigation (justified or not)

**Reasonable Force**: Force a reasonable person would use in similar circumstances
- Context-dependent
- Proportionate to threat
- Stops when threat neutralized

**Duty to Retreat**: Legal requirement to escape if safely possible (jurisdiction-dependent)
- If exists in your area: Must attempt escape before using force
- Exception: "Castle Doctrine" (home defense)
- Not universal: "Stand Your Ground" laws vary

**Disparity of Force**: Circumstances making less force more justified
- Large attacker vs. small defender
- Multiple attackers vs. single defender
- Trained attacker vs. untrained defender
- Armed vs. unarmed

### Your Responsibility as Martial Artist

**Higher Standard of Care**:
- Training = knowledge of consequences
- "I didn't mean to hurt them badly" won't excuse excessive force
- Expected to control techniques and choose appropriately
- Rank/belts may be cited as evidence of premeditation

**What Courts Will Consider**:
- Could you have used less force?
- Did you continue after threat stopped?
- What is your training background? (works against you if excessive)
- Did you escalate or de-escalate?
- Were you in actual danger or perceived danger?

## Vital Points by Region

### Head & Face

#### Eyes
**Vulnerability**: Extremely fragile, no protective bone coverage
**Biomechanics**: Cornea/sclera easily damaged, loss of vision immediate
**Techniques**: Finger strikes, thumb gouges, rakes
**Effect Level**: 3 (permanent vision loss) to 4 (brain penetration if extreme)

**Legal Context**: Deadly force
- Only justified for deadly threat
- Permanent disability = serious consequences
- Prosecutor will scrutinize heavily

**Aikido Relation**: Not typically targeted
- Omote/ura entry avoids face
- Throws position face away from strikes
- **Design feature**: Can control without blinding

---

#### Temples
**Vulnerability**: Thin skull, pterion bone junction, middle meningeal artery
**Biomechanics**: Impact causes brain trauma, possible arterial rupture, fracture
**Techniques**: Horizontal strikes (hammer fist, elbow, palm)
**Effect Level**: 4 (lethal)

**Why Lethal**:
- Thinnest part of skull (~4mm)
- Pterion junction = weakest structural point
- Middle meningeal artery rupture = epidural hematoma = death
- Traumatic brain injury

**Legal Context**: Deadly force
- Strike to temple = intent to kill (prosecutor's argument)
- Very difficult to justify unless weapon threat
- "I aimed for jaw but hit temple" = inadequate excuse (should control techniques)

**Aikido Relation**: Not targeted
- Strikes in Aikido rare, not to head
- Atemi (strikes) typically to torso or arms

---

#### Jaw/Mandible
**Vulnerability**: Nerve junction (trigeminal ganglion), mechanical lever, brain stem proximity
**Biomechanics**:
- Hinge point = mechanical advantage
- Impact transmits to brain (concussion)
- TMJ dislocation possible
**Techniques**: Uppercut, hook, cross strikes to jaw hinge
**Effect Level**: 2 (knockout/concussion) to 3 (fracture/permanent TMJ damage)

**Knockout Mechanism**:
- Sudden rotation of head → brain impacts skull → loss of consciousness
- Trigeminal nerve trauma → neurological disruption
- Not "punched so hard" - angular acceleration of brain

**Legal Context**: Serious force
- Knockout = potential serious injury (head trauma)
- Justified for serious physical threat
- Risk of death (hitting ground, continued assault while unconscious)

**Aikido Relation**: Avoided
- Irimi enters past punch, not into it
- Tenkan redirects rather than blocks/strikes
- Control arms, not face

---

#### Nose
**Vulnerability**: Fragile cartilage/bone, rich nerve supply, bleeding
**Biomechanics**:
- Nasal bone easily broken
- Heavy bleeding (visual/psychological impact)
- Pain compliance
- Upward strike myth (won't "drive bone into brain" - anatomically impossible)
**Techniques**: Palm heel strikes, elbow strikes
**Effect Level**: 1-2 (pain/bleeding) to 3 if extreme (permanent disfigurement)

**Debunking Myth**: "Nose bone into brain"
- Nasal bone is flat, not a spike
- Cribriform plate is fragile but protected
- Would require extraordinary force + precise angle
- Possible but extremely rare, not reliable technique

**Legal Context**: Moderate force
- Broken nose = assault (justified if proportionate)
- Disfigurement increases legal scrutiny
- Better targets exist (solar plexus, legs)

**Aikido Relation**: Sometimes used
- Atemi to nose as distraction (not full power)
- Creates space for technique entry
- Rarely full-force strike

---

### Neck & Throat

#### Throat/Trachea
**Vulnerability**: Unsupported cartilage, airway, no protective bone
**Biomechanics**:
- Cartilage rings easily crushed
- Collapse = asphyxiation
- Swelling from trauma = delayed asphyxiation
**Techniques**: Straight punches, knife hand strikes, chokes (if misapplied)
**Effect Level**: 4 (lethal)

**Why Lethal**:
- Trachea collapse = inability to breathe
- Even partial damage → swelling → suffocation within minutes
- Emergency tracheotomy required to save life
- High mortality rate

**Legal Context**: DEADLY FORCE
- Throat strike = intent to kill
- Only justified for armed/deadly attack
- **This is the Wing Chun example**: Effective but legally indefensible except deadly threat

**Aikido Relation**: NOT targeted
- **This is key design feature of Aikido**
- Techniques control limbs, not throat
- Can incapacitate without killing
- Legal advantage over striking arts

---

#### Carotid Arteries (sides of neck)
**Vulnerability**: Major blood supply to brain, near surface
**Biomechanics**:
- Compression → unconsciousness in 3-10 seconds (blood choke)
- Rupture → exsanguination/stroke
- Baroreceptor disruption → cardiac issues
**Techniques**: Chokes (judo/BJJ), strikes to side of neck
**Effect Level**: 2 (unconsciousness if controlled) to 4 (death if ruptured or held too long)

**Blood Choke vs. Air Choke**:
- **Blood choke** (carotid compression): Safer, faster, recoverable
- **Air choke** (trachea compression): More dangerous, slower, risk of death
- Proper chokes compress carotids, not trachea

**Legal Context**: Depends on application
- Controlled choke (releases when unconscious) = Level 2 (justified for serious threat)
- Continued after unconscious = assault/murder
- Strike to carotid = deadly force (rupture risk)

**Aikido Relation**: Limited
- Some neck controls in classical techniques
- Not primary focus (arm/wrist control emphasized)
- **Caution**: Even "control" of neck is legally risky

---

#### Base of Skull/Spine
**Vulnerability**: Spinal cord, medulla oblongata, cervical vertebrae
**Biomechanics**:
- Spinal severance = paralysis or death
- Medulla trauma = respiratory/cardiac failure
- Cervical fracture = quadriplegia
**Techniques**: Strikes to back of neck, extreme throws onto head
**Effect Level**: 4 (lethal or permanent disability)

**Legal Context**: DEADLY FORCE
- Spinal techniques = attempted murder if unjustified
- Throwing someone on head = potentially lethal
- Only justified for deadly threat

**Aikido Relation**: Aware but avoided
- Proper ukemi (breakfalls) protects neck/spine
- Nage responsible for safe execution
- Hard throws possible, but controlled
- Training: Don't spike uke's head into mat

---

### Torso

#### Solar Plexus (Celiac Plexus)
**Vulnerability**: Nerve cluster, diaphragm connection, no bone protection
**Biomechanics**:
- Impact disrupts diaphragm → temporary breathing difficulty ("wind knocked out")
- Vagus nerve stimulation → possible vasovagal response
- Nerve cluster trauma = intense pain
**Techniques**: Straight punches, front kicks, knee strikes
**Effect Level**: 2 (temporary incapacitation)

**"Wind Knocked Out" Mechanism**:
- Diaphragm spasm from impact
- Inability to inhale voluntarily
- Panic response (feels like suffocating)
- Recovery: 30 seconds to few minutes

**Legal Context**: Reasonable force for serious threat
- Temporarily disabling, not lethal
- Proportionate for sustained physical attack
- Recoverable (no permanent damage if moderate force)

**Aikido Relation**: Sometimes targeted
- Atemi to solar plexus as entry/distraction
- Knee strikes in classical techniques (rare)
- Generally light atemi, not full-force strikes

---

#### Liver (Right side, below ribs)
**Vulnerability**: Large organ, rich blood supply, thin protection
**Biomechanics**:
- Impact causes severe pain (visceral pain)
- Possible laceration/rupture if extreme
- Vagal response → loss of consciousness
**Techniques**: Left hook to body, knee strikes, elbow strikes
**Effect Level**: 2 (incapacitation) to 3 (rupture/internal bleeding)

**"Liver Shot" in Combat Sports**:
- Legal in boxing/MMA
- Extremely painful, incapacitating
- Rarely causes permanent damage (in sport context)

**Legal Context**: Moderate to serious force
- Justified for serious physical threat
- Risk of internal bleeding if too forceful
- Rupture = Level 3 injury (deadly force implications)

**Aikido Relation**: Not typically targeted
- Techniques focus on limbs, not torso strikes
- Some classical schools include body strikes (rare)

---

#### Kidneys (Lower back, sides)
**Vulnerability**: Vital organs, minimal posterior protection
**Biomechanics**:
- Trauma causes intense pain
- Rupture risk → internal bleeding
- Urinary system damage
**Techniques**: Strikes to lower back, knee strikes from behind
**Effect Level**: 2 (pain) to 3 (rupture/permanent damage)

**Legal Context**: Moderate to deadly force
- Pain compliance = Level 2
- Rupture risk = deadly force territory
- "Rabbit punching" (back of head/neck) banned in sport for good reason

**Aikido Relation**: Not targeted
- Techniques redirect, not strike from behind
- Some throws expose back, but not targeted for strikes

---

#### Groin (Testicles/Pelvic Nerves)
**Vulnerability**: Extremely sensitive nerve cluster, unsupported organs
**Biomechanics**:
- Testicular trauma = extreme pain, incapacitation
- Possible rupture, torsion
- Vagal response (nausea, collapse)
**Techniques**: Kicks, knee strikes, grabs
**Effect Level**: 1 (pain) to 3 (rupture/permanent damage)

**Why So Effective**:
- Evolutionary pain response (protect reproductive capacity)
- No muscular protection
- Nerve density extremely high
- Visceral pain = whole-body response

**Legal Context**: TRICKY - depends on force
- Light strike (pain compliance) = Level 1-2
- Full-force strike (rupture risk) = Level 3 (deadly force?)
- Legal gray area: Often considered justified for serious threat
- Risk: Permanent infertility = serious bodily harm

**Aikido Relation**: Rarely emphasized
- Some traditional schools include groin strikes
- Modern Aikido generally avoids
- **Krav Maga emphasizes** (assumes deadly threat context)

---

### Limbs & Extremities

#### Knee (Lateral/Medial)
**Vulnerability**: Joint designed for one plane of motion (flexion/extension only)
**Biomechanics**:
- Lateral (side) kicks hyperextend MCL/LCL ligaments
- Medial (inward) stress tears ACL/meniscus
- Joint destruction = permanent mobility loss
**Techniques**: Side kicks, low kicks, stomps
**Effect Level**: 2 (hyperextension) to 3 (permanent joint damage)

**Why Targeted in Self-Defense**:
- Immediately incapacitates (can't chase you)
- Lower legal scrutiny than head/neck/groin
- Distance weapon (kick range)
- **Krav Maga favorite**: Disable mobility, escape

**Legal Context**: Moderate to serious force
- Hyperextension (recoverable) = justified for serious threat
- Permanent destruction = Level 3 (deadly force?)
- Courts generally more lenient than strikes to head/neck/groin
- Proportionate for armed or sustained attack

**Aikido Relation**: Not typically targeted
- Some foot sweeps affect balance
- Classical techniques include knee destruction (rare in modern practice)
- Throws sometimes stress knees (uke protects with ukemi)

---

#### Elbow (Hyperextension)
**Vulnerability**: Hinge joint, ligament limits
**Biomechanics**:
- Hyperextension tears ligaments (UCL, MCL, radial collateral)
- Fracture possible
- Permanent loss of range of motion
**Techniques**: Arm bars, ikkyo/nikyo taken to break, juji-gatame
**Effect Level**: 1 (pain at limit) to 3 (break/permanent damage)

**Control vs. Break**:
- **Control**: Apply pressure to limit, maintain (pain compliance)
- **Break**: Apply pressure past limit (permanent injury)
- Aikido trains control, not breaks (usually)

**Legal Context**: Control vs. break = different legal outcomes
- Control (Level 1) = reasonable for non-deadly threat
- Break (Level 3) = deadly force, needs deadly threat justification
- "I didn't mean to break it" = negligence if trained martial artist

**Aikido Relation**: CORE TECHNIQUE FAMILY
- Ikkyo, nikyo, sankyo, yonkyo all control elbow
- Train to feel the limit (don't go past)
- **This is legal advantage**: Control without permanent damage
- CAN break if necessary (deadly threat) but trained NOT to

---

#### Wrist/Fingers
**Vulnerability**: Small bones, complex joint, leverage disadvantage
**Biomechanics**:
- Wrist locks = mechanical advantage (lever + fulcrum)
- Finger breaks easy (small bones, high leverage)
- Nerve compression (radial, median, ulnar)
**Techniques**: Wrist locks (nikyo, sankyo, kote-gaeshi), finger manipulation
**Effect Level**: 1 (pain) to 2 (breaks, permanent dexterity loss if severe)

**Why Aikido Emphasizes**:
- Small force needed for large effect (leverage)
- Control possible without permanent damage
- Multiple lock options from same position
- Legally defensible (proportionate)

**Legal Context**: Generally reasonable force
- Pain compliance = justified for non-cooperative person
- Breaks = excessive unless serious threat
- Risk: "Small" breaks (fingers) still legally scrutinized

**Aikido Relation**: FUNDAMENTAL
- Kotegaeshi, sankyo, nikyo = wrist controls
- Yonkyo = nerve compression
- Finger control in some classical techniques
- **Design for control, not destruction**

---

## Aikido Technique Analysis

### Techniques That AVOID Vital Points (By Design)

These are Aikido's **legal advantage** - effective control without excessive force:

#### Ikkyo (First Teaching)
**Targets**: Elbow joint, shoulder structure
**Vital Points**: None directly
**Effect**: Control and immobilization through joint leverage
**Legal**: Reasonable force for physical threat (Level 1-2)

**Why Legally Smart**:
- Controls aggressor without striking
- Reversible (can release immediately)
- Minimal injury risk if applied correctly
- Demonstrates restraint

---

#### Nikyo (Second Teaching)
**Targets**: Wrist joint, radial nerve
**Vital Points**: Nerve pressure (not damage)
**Effect**: Pain compliance through joint twist and nerve pressure
**Legal**: Reasonable force for non-compliance (Level 1)

**Caution**:
- CAN break wrist if excessive force
- Train to feel limit, don't exceed
- Nerve damage possible if held too long with too much pressure

---

#### Irimi-Nage (Entering Throw)
**Targets**: Balance, structure
**Vital Points**: None
**Effect**: Throws opponent, creates distance
**Legal**: Reasonable force for physical attack (Level 2)

**Legal Risk**:
- Fall itself can cause injury (head hits ground)
- Nage responsible for safe execution
- "He hit his head when he fell" = your legal problem if excessive

---

#### Shiho-Nage (Four-Direction Throw)
**Targets**: Wrist, shoulder, balance
**Vital Points**: Can stress elbow/shoulder if extreme
**Effect**: Throws with joint leverage
**Legal**: Reasonable force for serious threat (Level 2)

---

### Techniques That CAN Target Vital Points (If Modified)

#### Atemi (Strikes)
**Traditional Use**: Distraction, entry creation
**Vital Point Potential**: HIGH (depends on target)

**Aikido Atemi Targets**:
- Face (distraction, not full power) - **Vital point**
- Solar plexus (entry) - **Vital point**
- Ribs (classical)
- Arms (deflection)

**Modern Practice**: Often omitted or light touch only
**Legal Context**: Depends entirely on target and force

**Responsible Training**:
- Light atemi = distraction (legal)
- Full-force to vital points = deadly force (legal only if deadly threat)
- Know the difference

---

#### Koshi-Nage (Hip Throws)
**Vital Point Risk**: Falling on head/neck
**Effect**: Can cause serious injury if thrown onto concrete
**Legal Context**: Depends on surface and force

**Reality**:
- On mat = safe (with ukemi)
- On concrete = potentially lethal
- Courts will consider environment

---

### Aikido's Philosophical AND Legal Alignment

**Why Aikido Avoids Vital Points**:

1. **Philosophical**: "Art of peace" - control without killing
2. **Practical**: Can defend without legal liability
3. **Tactical**: Control provides options (can release or escalate as needed)
4. **Ethical**: Minimal harm principle

**This Is Strength, Not Weakness**:
- Founders COULD kill (samurai warriors)
- CHOSE to develop control-focused techniques
- Recognized modern context (not battlefield)
- Legal intelligence, not pacifism

**When Aikido May Be Insufficient**:
- Knife attack (weapon = deadly threat, need vital points)
- Multiple attackers (may need strikes to incapacitate)
- Extreme disparity of force (small person vs. large attacker)

**Responsible Aikido Training**:
- Master control techniques (Aikido's strength)
- Understand vital points (Aikido's option if deadly threat)
- Train decision-making (when to use what)

---

## Decision-Making Framework

### The Vital Point Decision Tree

**BEFORE targeting any vital point:**

```
START: Am I in danger?
│
├─ NO → Leave/de-escalate (no force justified)
│
└─ YES → Can I escape without engaging?
    │
    ├─ YES → Escape (safest option)
    │
    └─ NO → What level of threat?
        │
        ├─ Verbal/postural → De-escalate (no physical response)
        │
        ├─ Minor physical (shove/grab) → Control techniques (ikkyo, nikyo)
        │
        ├─ Serious attack (sustained punches) → Incapacitation (throws, solar plexus, legs)
        │
        └─ Deadly threat (weapon/multiple/disparity) → Vital points justified
            │
            └─ Can I articulate why this was deadly threat?
                │
                ├─ YES → Proceed (document everything)
                │
                └─ NO → Reconsider (if you can't explain it, court won't accept it)
```

### Post-Incident Protocol

**IF you were forced to use vital point techniques:**

1. **Ensure safety** (yours and others)
2. **Call emergency services** (police + ambulance)
3. **Provide medical aid if qualified** (duty of care)
4. **Brief statement**: "I was attacked, I defended myself, I want my lawyer"
5. **DO NOT elaborate** without legal counsel
6. **Document everything**: Witnesses, injuries (yours), photos, timeline
7. **Seek legal counsel immediately**
8. **Expect investigation**: Deadly force = homicide investigation (justified or not)

**What NOT to Do**:
- ❌ "I'm a black belt, I knew what I was doing" (establishes premeditation)
- ❌ "I aimed for his throat because..." (intent to cause serious harm)
- ❌ Detailed explanation without lawyer (anything you say will be used against you)
- ❌ Leaving scene (legal duty to remain in most jurisdictions)

---

## Summary: Vital Points & Responsibility

### Key Principles

1. **Knowledge ≠ Permission**: Knowing vital points doesn't justify using them indiscriminately

2. **Context Determines Appropriateness**: Same technique legal in one scenario, criminal in another

3. **Aikido's Design Intelligence**: Control without vital points = effective AND legal for most situations

4. **Vital Points Reserved for Deadly Threats**: Only justified when facing imminent death or grave harm

5. **Legal Burden on Defender**: You must prove force was necessary and proportionate

6. **Training Responsibility**: Know the techniques, know the law, know when to use each

7. **The Goal**: Survive the attack + avoid prison + live with yourself ethically
