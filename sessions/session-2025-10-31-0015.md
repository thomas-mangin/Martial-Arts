## Main Focus

**Information Architecture Improvement** - Created comprehensive routing system for organizing information in the project.

---

## What Happened

### Session Start
User ran `/resume` to load previous session context about YouTube channel analysis work.

### Key Trigger
User shared conceptual knowledge about violence contexts (monkey dance, predatory violence, sport fighting, war) - a framework explaining why "does it work?" is the wrong question for martial arts effectiveness.

### Problem Identified
I initially placed this framework in `decisions.md` (behavioral instructions) when it should have gone in `research/divisive-topics.md` (conceptual knowledge). This revealed a gap: **no clear routing rules for where different types of information should be stored**.

### User Feedback
User pointed out the misplacement and asked how to improve the system to ensure future information is correctly stored. They provided clarity on the purpose of various files and directories:
- README.md: Getting started, command reminders, GitHub display
- help.md: Detailed workflows (consider help/ folder in future)
- scripts/: Utility code for commands/agents
- syllabus/: Technical Aikido instruction
- sessions/: Auto-generated session history
- blog/: Writing standards and templates
- PROJECT-STATUS.md: High-level roadmap and phases

## Accomplishments

### 1. Created Information Routing Guide
**File**: `.claude/docs/information-routing.md`

**Content**:
- 14 routing categories covering all file types in the project
- 12-step decision tree for routing new information
- Quick reference table with test questions
- Detailed examples showing correct routing

**Categories Documented**:
1. decisions.md - Behavioral instructions only
2. syllabus/ - Technical Aikido instruction (how to perform techniques)
3. research/ - Conceptual frameworks and philosophy
4. session-context.md - Current session state
5. PROJECT-STATUS.md - Project phases and roadmap
6. topics.md - Blog content planning
7. sources/ - External content
8. blog/ - Writing standards and templates
9. README.md - Getting started guide
10. help.md (future: help/) - User documentation
11. .claude/docs/ - System internals
12. scripts/ - Utility code
13. sessions/ - Auto-generated history
14. posts/discussions/ - User's content

### 2. Fixed Misplaced Content
**Moved**: Violence contexts framework from decisions.md â†’ research/divisive-topics.md

**Framework Content**:
- Four violence types: Monkey Dance (ego), Predatory (criminal), Sport/Cage (agreed rules), War (organized)
- Each has different dynamics and appropriate responses
- Critical insight: Arm grab defenses useless for male monkey dance, crucial for women escaping predatory violence
- Explains why "does Aikido work?" debates are confused - different contexts require different techniques

**Left in decisions.md**: Reference to use the framework when discussing effectiveness (the behavioral instruction)

### 3. Updated Architecture Documentation
**File**: `.claude/docs/architecture.md`
- Added routing guide reference
- Ensures future sessions know the routing guide exists

### 4. Identified Workspace Issue
Discovered 150+ YouTube transcript files (.srt, .json, .txt) in wrong location during git status check. Noted for cleanup in next session.

## Key Decisions

### Decision: Separate Conceptual Knowledge from Behavioral Instructions
**Date**: 2025-10-31

**What**: decisions.md should only contain behavioral instructions (how Claude should think/behave), not conceptual knowledge about Aikido

**Why**:
- Prevents file bloat in decisions.md
- Keeps conceptual frameworks in research/ where they can be easily referenced
- Maintains clear separation of concerns

**Impact**: Violence contexts moved to research/divisive-topics.md; routing guide created to prevent future misplacements

## Conversation Highlights

**User's Teaching**:
> "There is different kind of fight and each is different. If you look at what is called the 'monkey dance' (violence escalation due to ego clash) the fight is agreed (or forced) and is to establish power dynamic like animal do..."

This insight led to the violence contexts framework being added to research.

**User's System Design Input**:
> "looking at meta concept and rules, I agree README.md is for helping me to remember what to do and to display on github... help should probably be merged into it or it should be extended with an help folder..."

This clarified the purpose of various project files and informed the routing guide structure.

**User's Question**:
> "when I give you information like the one above the structure of our system should help to indentify where to store this information. What I said is not a decision so how can you improve the location where you will store it..."

This triggered the creation of the comprehensive routing system.

## Files Modified

**Created**:
- `.claude/docs/information-routing.md` (new comprehensive routing guide)

**Modified**:
- `.claude/docs/architecture.md` (added routing guide reference)
- `decisions.md` (removed violence contexts, added reference to research/)
- `research/divisive-topics.md` (added violence contexts framework)
- `session-context.md` (updated for this session)

**Noted for future**:
- 150+ transcript files in wrong location need cleanup

---

## Technical Details

**Commits**:
1. `0733bbe` - "Create comprehensive information routing system"
   - Created information-routing.md
   - Moved violence contexts framework
   - Updated architecture.md and decisions.md

2. `eceb3b6` - "Update session context after information routing work"
   - Updated session-context.md with current status

**Lines Changed**:
- Added: ~500 lines (routing guide)
- Modified: ~100 lines (decisions, research, architecture, session-context)

---

## Challenges/Issues

**Workspace Organization**:
- Found 150+ YouTube transcript files in `sources/youtube/transcripts/` working directory
- Should be organized into channel subdirectories or cleaned up
- Deferred to next session

**Files to Handle Later**:
- SYSTEM_REVIEW.md - user wants to defer decision
- .crush/ directory - needs investigation
- help.md restructuring - consider help/ folder with topic-specific files

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Clean up workspace**: Organize or remove 150+ transcript files in wrong location
2. **Decide on priorities**: Choose between YouTube analysis, blog writing, or system maintenance

### Future Considerations
- Consider restructuring help.md into help/ folder (as noted in routing guide)
- Handle SYSTEM_REVIEW.md and .crush/ directory
- Investigate research.md vs research/INDEX.md relationship (both serve different purposes)

### Content Creation Ready
- 45+ blog post ideas available from 4 channel analyses
- New topic from this session: "The Four Types of Violence: Why Context Determines What Works"

---

## Session Value

**Strategic Impact**: High

**Why**: Created reusable infrastructure that prevents information misplacement and file bloat. The routing guide will benefit all future sessions by providing clear rules for information organization.

**User Satisfaction**: High - user drove the improvement by identifying the problem and providing clear requirements for the solution.

**Knowledge Captured**:
- Violence contexts framework (important martial arts concept)
- Meta-system organization principles
- Clear distinction between different information types

---

## Notes

**Session Type**: System improvement triggered by user feedback

**User Engagement**: Highly collaborative - user provided conceptual knowledge, identified system weakness, clarified file purposes, and validated the solution

**System Evolution**: The routing guide represents a significant maturity step in the project's information architecture. Future sessions will have clear guidelines for where information belongs.

**Quote of the Session**:
> "when I give you information like the one above the structure of our system should help to indentify where to store this information" - User

This insight led to creating infrastructure that makes the system more maintainable and scalable.
