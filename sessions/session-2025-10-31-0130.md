**Session Date**: 2025-10-31
**Session Time**: 01:30
**Duration**: ~75 minutes
**Git Commits**: 2 commits (b0bf681, 82d2c55)

## Main Focus

**Document Audit & Reorganization Planning** - Comprehensive review of all files against routing rules, identification of structural issues, and creation of detailed reorganization plan.

---

## What Happened

### Session Continuation
User ran `/checkpoint` after previous routing system creation, then immediately requested deeper audit: "can you make sure all information in documents are stored correctly according to the routing rules and if some of the research information should be broken down differently"

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Audit

**Audited**:
- 8 root-level markdown files (91-779 lines each)
- 13 research/ files (total 6,321 lines)
- Evaluated sizes, content types, overlaps

**Key Findings**:
1. **decisions.md vs core-values.md overlap** - Behavioral "how to write" guidance mixed with beliefs
2. **research.md redundancy** - Duplicates research/INDEX.md with different purposes
3. **biomechanical-principles.md size** - 1,293 lines (52KB) - needs splitting consideration
4. **Missing category**: No dedicated space for analysis findings (video/blog summaries)
5. **SYSTEM_REVIEW.md** - Doesn't fit any category cleanly

### Phase 2: User Directives

User provided clear instructions for reorganization:

> "decision should be broken down and core-values content be made part of it, looking at each type within the file it should be decided what kind of decision it is, writing style, or other like indeed values like believing that martials arts are bio-mechanical."

> "research contain summary information about video and blog analysis which should have its own space and routing rules."

> "every content of SYSTEM-REVIEW should be routed according to our rules and if some information does not match rules, new sections and rules should be created to allow for it."

> "biomechanical principles are physical rules we should be able to link to science and should stay remain broken down logically as you suggest."

> "for reserch use the INDEX.md as suggested and move all the data within the folder."

> "how to write is a blog style info."

### Phase 3: Reorganization Planning

**Created REORGANIZATION-PLAN.md**:
- 8 phases of reorganization work
- Detailed file operations (create, move, update, delete)
- 3-session timeline with checkpoints
- Validation checklist
- Risk mitigation strategies

**Created decisions-NEW.md**:
- 6-category structure:
  1. **Foundational Values** - Core beliefs (biomechanics, knowing vs embodied, peace through understanding cost)
  2. **Writing Style** - Voice, honesty, framing, presenting frameworks
  3. **Content Strategy** - Multi-audience, violence context awareness
  4. **Content Quality** - Critical review standards
  5. **System Architecture** - Lean docs, single agent modes
  6. **Session Management** - Checkpoint autonomy, GitHub push

- Table of contents for navigation
- Clear separation of what IS vs how to USE it
- Behavioral instructions extracted from core-values.md

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Complete Document Audit
- Analyzed 21 markdown files
- Identified 5 major structural issues
- Evaluated against routing rules
- Found most content correctly placed

### 2. Comprehensive Reorganization Plan
**File**: `REORGANIZATION-PLAN.md` (684 lines)

**8 Phases**:
1. Restructure decisions.md (categorize)
2. Create blog/blog-voice-guide.md (writing guidance)
3. Create findings/ directory (analysis summaries)
4. Route SYSTEM_REVIEW.md content
5. Create biomechanics/ subdirectory (split large file)
6. Consolidate research indexes
7. Move writing guidance to blog/
8. Update routing guide

**File Operations**:
- Create: 7 files/directories
- Move: 4 files
- Update: 7 files
- Delete: 5 files (after moving content)

**Timeline**: 2-3 sessions with checkpoints between

### 3. New decisions.md Structure
**File**: `decisions-NEW.md` (ready for review)

**Improvements over current**:
- Clear categorization (6 sections)
- Separated values from style from strategy
- Table of contents for navigation
- Behavioral instructions only (no conceptual knowledge)
- Extracted writing guidance from core-values.md

### 4. Identified New Routing Categories

**findings/** - Analysis summaries
- Summaries of video/blog analyses
- Different from raw sources (sources/)
- Different from user frameworks (research/)

**research/biomechanics/** - Physical principles
- Individual principle files
- Scientific basis for each
- Scalable structure

---

## Key Decisions

### Decision: Separate Beliefs from Behavioral Instructions
**Date**: 2025-10-31

**Context**: User identified that decisions.md should be broken down by type

**Categories established**:
- **Foundational Values** = Core beliefs about martial arts (biomechanics, learning, peace)
- **Writing Style** = How to write (voice, framing, honesty)
- **Content Strategy** = What to write about (audience, topics)

**Impact**: Content from core-values.md will move into appropriate categories in decisions.md

### Decision: Create findings/ for Analysis Summaries
**Date**: 2025-10-31

**What**: New top-level directory for video/blog analysis summaries

**Why**: Research contains summaries of Tony Sargeant's videos, but these are analysis of EXTERNAL content, not user's frameworks

**Distinction**:
- sources/ = Raw external content
- findings/ = Summaries/insights from analyzing external content
- research/ = User's own frameworks and beliefs

### Decision: Split biomechanical-principles.md
**Date**: 2025-10-31

**What**: Create research/biomechanics/ subdirectory with individual principle files

**Why**:
- Current file is 1,293 lines (52KB)
- Principles are scientific/physical rules
- Can link each to science
- Better for on-demand loading

**Structure**: foundation/, application/, advanced/ subdirectories

## Conversation Highlights

**User's Clarity on Categorization**:
> "decision should be broken down and core-values content be made part of it, looking at each type within the file it should be decided what kind of decision it is"

This led to the 6-category structure separating values, style, strategy, quality, architecture, and management.

**User's Insight on findings/**:
> "research contain summary information about video and blog analysis which should have its own space and routing rules"

This identified a gap - analysis summaries didn't fit cleanly into existing categories.

**User's Preference for Consolidation**:
> "for reserch use the INDEX.md as suggested and move all the data within the folder"

Clear directive to delete research.md redundancy.

**User's Plan Request**:
> "write a plan so I can review it, we will checkpoint and then do it"

Led to creation of comprehensive reorganization plan rather than immediate execution.

---

## Files Modified

**Created**:
- `REORGANIZATION-PLAN.md` (comprehensive execution plan)
- `decisions-NEW.md` (new categorized structure)

**Modified**:
- `session-context.md` (updated for current session)

**Noted for future action**:
- 150+ transcript files in sources/youtube/transcripts/ need organization

## Session Value

**Strategic Impact**: Very High

**Why**: This reorganization will establish clear separation of concerns:
- Behavioral decisions separate from beliefs
- Writing guidance separate from both
- Analysis summaries properly categorized
- Scientific principles organized scalably

**User Engagement**: Highly collaborative - user provided clear, specific directives for exactly how to reorganize

**Planning Quality**: Comprehensive - detailed plan covers file operations, timeline, validation, risks

**Ready State**: All planning complete, awaiting user review and approval before execution

---

## Notes

**Session Type**: Deep analysis and planning

**Methodology**:
- Systematic audit of all files
- User-driven directive gathering
- Comprehensive planning before execution
- Clear checkpoints and review points

**Key Insight**: Information architecture must separate:
1. WHAT you believe (values)
2. HOW to apply it (style/strategy)
3. WHAT you found (findings from others)
4. WHAT the science says (biomechanics)

**Quote of the Session**:
> "write a plan so I can review it, we will checkpoint and then do it" - User

This ensured quality planning over rushed execution.
