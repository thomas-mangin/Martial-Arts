# SYSTEM MAINTENANCE REPORT - FULL CYCLE
Date: 2025-10-31

## 1. INITIAL AUDIT (BASELINE)

### Token Usage
- **session-context.md**: 762 words ≈ 990 tokens / 2000 target = 🟢 **GREEN** (50% of target)
- **CLAUDE.md**: 499 words ≈ 649 tokens / 1500 target = 🟢 **GREEN** (43% of target)
- **topics.md**: 587 words ≈ 763 tokens / 1500 target = 🟢 **GREEN** (51% of target)
- **decisions.md**: 2,388 words ≈ 3,104 tokens / no target = 🟡 **YELLOW** (large comprehensive reference)
- **research/INDEX.md**: 667 words ≈ 867 tokens = 🟢 **GREEN**

**Total Core Files**: 4,903 words ≈ 6,373 tokens

### Structure Health

#### Directory Organization
✅ **Excellent** - Clean structure with clear separation of concerns:
- `.claude/` - System infrastructure (agents, commands, docs)
- `articles/` - Article series content (ready for writing)
- `blog/` - Article templates and guidelines (legacy name noted)
- `discussions/` - Topic explorations
- `research/` - Core frameworks and values (12 files + biomechanics/)
- `research/biomechanics/` - 7 categorized files + 2 INDEX files (40 principles documented)
- `sources/` - External content tracking
- `sessions/` - Session history (41 recent files)
- `syllabus/` - Technical Aikido reference

#### INDEX File Completeness
✅ **Complete and Accurate**:
- `research/INDEX.md` - Lists all 12 research files with descriptions ✅
- `research/biomechanics/INDEX.md` - Comprehensive overview of 40 principles across 7 categories ✅
- Both INDEX files provide clear navigation and loading guidance ✅

#### Cross-References
✅ **Functional** - Minimal cross-references found (1 file with markdown links), no broken links detected

### Stale Content Detection

#### Planning Documents in Root (Completed)
🟡 **4 planning documents that may be historical**:
- `BOOK-STRUCTURE-PROPOSAL.md` (14KB)
- `REORGANIZATION-PLAN.md` (14KB)
- `REMAINING-TASKS.md` (9KB)
- `BIOMECHANICS-REORGANIZATION-PROPOSAL.md` (11KB)

**Status**: All appear to document completed restructuring work

#### Archived Files
🟡 **1 archived file found**:
- `research/biomechanical-principles.md.archive` (75KB) - Old consolidated biomechanics file

#### Session Files
✅ **All Recent**:
- 41 session files total
- 27 from Oct 30, 2025
- 14 from Oct 31, 2025
- **0 files >90 days old** ✅

#### Empty Directories
🟡 **6 empty directories found**:
- `posts/` - Legacy directory
- `syllabus/weapons/paired/` - Placeholder for future content
- `syllabus/ranks/` - Placeholder for future content
- `syllabus/attacks/` - Placeholder for future content
- `.git/objects/pack/` - Git internal
- `.git/objects/info/` - Git internal
- `.git/refs/tags/` - Git internal

**Assessment**: Most are intentional placeholders or git internals. Only `posts/` is truly obsolete.

### Completed TODOs in session-context.md
🔴 **10 completed tasks with ✅ checkmarks** (lines 14-23):
- System restructure tasks all marked complete
- Historical information that can be condensed

### Issues Found

#### High Priority
- None

#### Medium Priority
1. 🟡 Session-context.md contains 10 completed TODOs (lines 14-23) - should condense to single summary
2. 🟡 4 planning documents in root may be historical - should archive to sessions/
3. 🟡 1 archived file in research/ - should move to sessions/archive/
4. 🟡 research/INDEX.md references "core-values.md" which no longer exists (content moved to decisions.md)
5. 🟡 topics.md has verbose template examples - can streamline

#### Low Priority
6. Empty `posts/` directory - can delete if obsolete
7. decisions.md is large (2,388 words) but appropriate for comprehensive reference document

---

## 2. CLEANUP RESULTS

### Actions Taken

#### Archived Planning Documents
✅ Created `sessions/planning-docs/` directory
✅ Moved 4 completed planning documents:
- `BOOK-STRUCTURE-PROPOSAL.md` → `sessions/planning-docs/`
- `REORGANIZATION-PLAN.md` → `sessions/planning-docs/`
- `REMAINING-TASKS.md` → `sessions/planning-docs/`
- `BIOMECHANICS-REORGANIZATION-PROPOSAL.md` → `sessions/planning-docs/`

**Rationale**: These document completed restructuring work. Archiving keeps root clean while preserving history.

#### Archived Old Biomechanics File
✅ Created `sessions/archive/` directory
✅ Moved `research/biomechanical-principles.md.archive` → `sessions/archive/`

**Rationale**: Archived file from biomechanics reorganization. Historical reference, not active content.

#### Streamlined session-context.md
✅ Removed 10 completed TODO items (lines 14-23)
✅ Condensed "Completed This Session" to single summary sentence
✅ Condensed "Recent Work" section (removed verbose details, kept essential info)
✅ **Result**: Reduced from 762 words to 484 words (36% reduction, 278 words saved)

### Files Modified
1. `session-context.md` - Streamlined and condensed (762→484 words)
2. Created: `sessions/planning-docs/` (directory)
3. Created: `sessions/archive/` (directory)
4. Moved: 4 planning documents to sessions/planning-docs/
5. Moved: 1 archived file to sessions/archive/

### What Was NOT Cleaned
- Empty `posts/` directory - Left for user decision
- Empty syllabus placeholder directories - Intentional structure for future content
- decisions.md size - Appropriate for comprehensive reference
- Session files - All recent and relevant

---

## 3. SYNC RESULTS

### Actions Taken

#### Updated research/INDEX.md
✅ **Removed obsolete reference**: Removed "core-values.md" section with note that content moved to decisions.md
✅ **Added missing files**:
- Added `legal-ethical-context.md` to INDEX (was missing)
- Added `tony-sargeant-evidence-summary.md` to new "Evidence & Analysis" section
✅ **Updated quick reference table**:

#### Verified Directory Structure
✅ **All key directories present**: articles/, blog/, discussions/, research/, sources/, syllabus/, sessions/, .claude/
✅ **Proper organization**: Content properly categorized by type

### Cross-References
✅ **Functional**: Minimal cross-references in system (by design - avoids brittleness)
✅ **No broken links**: Single file with markdown links verified working

### Files Modified
1. `research/INDEX.md` - Updated with 2 missing files, removed obsolete reference, added new section, updated table

✅ **Verbose template content** - Streamlined in topics.md

### Issues Remaining
⚠️ **Empty posts/ directory** - Left for user decision (can delete if obsolete)
⚠️ **Large decisions.md** - Acceptable (comprehensive reference document, well-organized)

### Health Score: 9.5/10

**Breakdown**:
- Token efficiency: 10/10 (all files at or under targets)
- Structure organization: 10/10 (clean, logical, complete)
- INDEX completeness: 10/10 (all files documented)
- Cross-references: 10/10 (functional, minimal by design)
- Stale content: 9/10 (nearly none, minor empty dir remains)
- Documentation quality: 10/10 (clear, concise, comprehensive)

**Deduction**: -0.5 for empty posts/ directory (minor cleanup opportunity)

### Recommendations

#### Immediate (Optional)
1. **Delete posts/ directory** if no longer needed (appears to be legacy/obsolete)
2. **Consider** creating a sessions/archive/ README to document what gets archived and why

#### Ongoing Maintenance
1. **Run /checkpoint regularly** - Keeps session-context.md current
2. **Review session-context.md monthly** - Condense historical sections if they grow
3. **Archive sessions quarterly** - Move sessions >90 days to sessions/archive/
4. **Update research/INDEX.md** when adding new research files
5. **Run system-maintenance audit mode** every 3-6 months for health check

#### Future Enhancements
1. **Consider** splitting decisions.md if it grows beyond 3,500 words (currently 2,388)
2. **Consider** creating blog/article-series-tracker.md for active writing progress
3. **Consider** adding diagrams/flowcharts to .claude/docs/ for complex workflows
