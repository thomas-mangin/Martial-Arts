## Notes

### Session Significance
This session completed the **workflow integration cycle** that began with syllabus creation. The progression:
1. **First session**: Created foundational syllabus from PDFs
2. **Second session**: Enhanced with online resources (100+ term dictionary, kata sequences)
3. **This session**: Integrated syllabus into slash commands for automatic verification

Result: **Complete integrated workflow** where technical accuracy is built-in, not bolted-on.

### Key Achievement
**Automated Technical Accuracy**: Commands now automatically reference comprehensive documentation without manual lookup. This means:
- `/review-aikido` verifies terminology, techniques, kata sequences automatically
- `/discuss` grounds conversations in documented facts before interpretation
- Blog guidelines provide clear roadmap for using syllabus during writing
- Technical accuracy checking happens seamlessly during workflow

### Workflow Transformation
**Before**:
- Syllabus existed but required manual reference
- Writer had to remember to check terminology
- Fact-checking was separate from writing/review process

**After**:
- Commands automatically leverage syllabus at appropriate checkpoints
- Terminology verification built into review process
- Technical accuracy integrated into workflow from start
- Separation of facts/interpretation enforced by system itself

### System Completeness
All major infrastructure now complete:
- ✓ **Syllabus**: Comprehensive factual reference (terminology, techniques, kata, ranks)
- ✓ **Research**: Validated frameworks and analysis
- ✓ **Commands**: Integrated with syllabus for automatic verification
- ✓ **Guidelines**: Clear instructions for using syllabus during writing
- ✓ **Workflow**: Blog writing → discussion → extraction → review → publish

### Ready to Write
**The system is production-ready**. Next session should focus on actual blog writing to:
- Test integrated workflow end-to-end
- Validate syllabus integration in practice
- Produce first MA-quality blog post
- Identify any gaps or refinements needed

### Integration Philosophy
The integration maintains the core principle: **Separation of facts (syllabus) from interpretation (research)**. Commands reference facts for accuracy, then allow interpretation grounded in those facts. This prevents:
- Unverified technical claims
- Incorrect terminology usage
- Misrepresentation of kata sequences
- Claims about rank progression without documentation

### Technical Notes
- All changes committed and pushed (commit `dedd031`)
- No merge conflicts or issues
- Commands tested conceptually (not in practice yet)
- Next session will be first real-world test of integrated workflow
