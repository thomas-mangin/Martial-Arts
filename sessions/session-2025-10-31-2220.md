## Technical Details

### Efficient Batch Processing

For Phase 7 (100+ fixes), used efficient batch processing:
```bash
# Batch replacements across multiple files
perl -pi -e 's/\bBlog\b/Article/g; s/\bblog\b/article/g' *.md

# Verification
grep -r "\bblog\b\|\bBlog\b" *.md | wc -l  # Result: 0
```

### Multi-Instance Session Pattern

This was a **5-checkpoint continuous session** on instance 2025-10-31-1953:

- Multi-instance architecture complete and correct
- Educational progression approach throughout
- All commands, research files, templates aligned

### User Experience

**Session pattern**: User provided clear "go" / "yes" confirmations enabling autonomous execution without excessive back-and-forth. Trusted approach allowed efficient completion of all 8 phases.

**Decision making**: All major scope decisions (like "fix all" vs "fix high-priority") provided by user when needed.
