## Main Focus

**Reorganization Execution** - Executed Session 2 phases of reorganization plan (4 phases completed).

---

## What Happened

### User Directive
After reviewing reorganization plan, user gave clear instruction: "compact memory and run the plan!"

### Rapid Execution
Executed 4 reorganization phases efficiently:

**Phase 1**: Replace decisions.md with categorized structure
**Phase 6**: Consolidate research indexes
**Phase 4**: Route SYSTEM_REVIEW.md
**Phase 7**: Create blog-voice-guide.md

---

## Accomplishments

### Phase 1: decisions.md Restructured
**Created**: New 6-category structure
- Foundational Values (biomechanics, knowing vs embodied, peace through understanding)
- Writing Style (first dan perspective, honesty, framework presentation)
- Content Strategy (multi-audience, violence context awareness)
- Content Quality (critical review standards)
- System Architecture (lean docs, agent modes)
- Session Management (checkpoint, GitHub push)

**Process**: Renamed decisions-NEW.md → decisions.md, kept old as backup

### Phase 6: Research Indexes Consolidated
**Deleted**: `research.md` (redundant root file)
**Updated**: README.md to point to `research/INDEX.md`
**Result**: Single source of truth for research navigation

### Phase 4: SYSTEM_REVIEW.md Routed
**Moved**: `SYSTEM_REVIEW.md` → `sessions/system-review-2025-10-30.md`
**Routing Decision**: One-time audits belong in sessions/ as historical context

### Phase 7: Blog Voice Guide Created
**Created**: `blog/blog-voice-guide.md` (317 lines)

**Content**:
- First dan perspective framing language
- What you can speak to vs observe (Stages 1-5)
- Authentic vs false authority examples
- Voice consistency checklist
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Practical application workflow
- Cross-references to decisions.md and research/

**Purpose**: Centralized writing guidance extracted from core-values.md

### Cleanup
**Deleted**:
- `decisions-OLD.md` (replaced by new structure)
- `research/core-values.md` (content moved to decisions.md + blog-voice-guide.md)
- `decisions-NEW.md` (renamed to decisions.md)

## File Operations Summary

**Created**: 2 files
- decisions.md (new categorized version)
- blog/blog-voice-guide.md

**Deleted**: 4 files

## Key Decisions

### Decision: Complete Separation of Concerns Achieved
**Date**: 2025-10-31

**Implementation**: Content from core-values.md split into appropriate categories:
- Core beliefs → decisions.md (Foundational Values)
- Behavioral guidance → decisions.md (Writing Style)
- Writing how-to → blog/blog-voice-guide.md

**Impact**: Clear boundaries between what you believe, how you should behave, and how to write

---

## Conversation Highlights

**User's Directive**:
> "compact memory and run the plan!"

Direct, clear instruction to execute immediately without further planning.

**Execution Style**:
- Autonomous
- Rapid (4 phases in ~30 minutes)
- Clean (no orphaned files, all references updated)

---

## Results

### Information Architecture Improvements

**Before**:
- Mixed content in decisions.md and core-values.md
- Redundant research.md at root
- Writing guidance scattered
- Unclear where things belong

**After**:
- decisions.md: 6 clear categories with table of contents
- blog-voice-guide.md: Centralized writing guidance
- research/INDEX.md: Single research navigation point
- SYSTEM_REVIEW.md: Properly archived
- No redundant files

### Maintainability
- Each file has single clear purpose
- Cross-references documented
- Navigation improved
- Future additions have clear homes

## Remaining Work (Session 3)

**Phases 3, 5, 8**:
- Phase 3: Create findings/ directory (for video/blog analysis summaries)
- Phase 5: Split biomechanics/ (optional - file manageable for now)
- Phase 8: Update routing guide with new patterns

**Also Pending**:
- Organize 150+ transcript files in sources/youtube/transcripts/
