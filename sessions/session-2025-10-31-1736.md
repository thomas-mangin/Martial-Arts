# Session Summary - 2025-10-31 17:36

**Instance ID**: 2025-10-31-1736
**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Duration**: ~25 minutes (17:36 - 18:00)
**Status**: Completed and checkpointed

---

## Main Focus

Two primary objectives:
1. **User Profile Creation** - Centralized biographical information to prevent inaccurate assumptions
2. **Documentation Corrections** - Fixed MA thesis references to MSc throughout project

(Note: Session also completed AI disclosure implementation from previous work)

---

## Accomplishments

### User Profile System Created

✅ **Comprehensive Profile Built** (`research/user-profile.md`)
- Personal information (Thomas Mangin, 51, French, 1.85m, ~100kg, UK-based)
- Education (MSc Computer Science) and professional role (CTO, ISP filtering, ~50 employees)
- Complete martial arts journey:
  - Childhood: 1 year judo
  - Age 35: Started Jitsu (Jitsu Foundation)
  - Age 38: Began teaching Jitsu (13 years experience)
  - 7 years Jitsu → Green belt
  - ~2 years Wing Chun (to strengthen shoulder)
  - 7-9 years Aikido → Shodan (2023)
- Current training schedule: Tuesday (teach Jitsu + train Aikido), Thursday (Tai Jitsu), Sunday (weapons)
- Direct lineage: Student of Alexander Gent → Paul Lowing → Tony Sargeant → Saito Morihiro → O'sensei (Iwama tradition)
- Physical considerations: AC joint injury (permanent, managed), ankle surgically repaired, intoeing corrected by military service, wears orthotics
- Military service: French conscription (mountain infantry), no combat deployment
- Street incident: Knife attack before training (clothes cut in scuffle)

✅ **Profile Includes**
- Strengths: Biomechanics understanding, 13 years teaching, multi-art perspective, analytical mindset
- Acknowledged limitations: Technical knowledge ≠ fighting prowess, writing as student not master
- What can/cannot claim based on direct experience
- Core philosophy: Biomechanics over mysticism, knowing vs. embodied understanding, peace through understanding violence's cost

### Documentation Corrections

✅ **Fixed MA to MSc References**
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Project purpose now accurate (personal project, MSc-level quality)
- `README.md` - Updated project description and added author bio
- `article/article-series-structure.md` - Changed "MA-level" to "MSc-level quality"
- `.claude/state/instances/2025-10-31-1736/current-objective.md` - Fixed quality references

✅ **Key Clarifications**
- Project is NOT academic thesis - personal educational article series for book publication
- Quality standard: MSc-level rigor without thesis constraints
- Author positioning: Advanced student/shodan with teaching experience

## Key Decisions

**Decision**: Create centralized user profile to prevent false assumptions

**Rationale**:
- User noted several inaccuracies in Claude's statements (e.g., "veteran perspective" when no combat deployment, "MA thesis" when MSc in CS)
- Profile ensures all future interactions based on factual information
- Documents what can/cannot be claimed in article writing
- Prevents biographical errors in published content

**Implementation**:
- Exhaustive search of codebase for existing biographical info
- User corrections and additions provided directly
- Profile includes "do not assume" section for unknown information
- Clear guidance on voice and positioning for articles

---

## Conversation Highlights

### User Request
- "We need to create a profile for me as you say things about me which are a bit inaccurate"
- Led to comprehensive fact-finding and correction process

### Corrections Provided
- Military service = conscription, not professional soldier
- Observed PTSD in others, no personal combat deployment
- Street incident = knife pulled, clothes cut, not major attack
- MSc in Computer Science, not writing MA thesis on Aikido
- Wing Chun trained to strengthen shoulder (not because injury prevented other training)
- Shoulder injury permanent but not severe, managed through training
- Foot condition: intoeing corrected by military service, wears orthotics
- Physical stats: 1.85m, ~100kg, French national

### Profile Validation
- User reviewed and corrected profile multiple times
- Final summary validated for accuracy
- All "Stage 4" references noted as Claude's framework, not user's terminology

## Files Modified

**Created:**
- `research/user-profile.md` - Comprehensive user biography and context

**Modified:**
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Fixed project description
- `README.md` - Updated overview and added author bio
- `article/article-series-structure.md` - Corrected quality standards
- `.claude/state/instances/2025-10-31-1736/session-info.md` - Updated activity log
- `.claude/state/registry.md` - Updated instance status

**Note**: Also includes AI disclosure files from earlier in session:
- `article/article-template.md`
- `.claude/commands/review-aikido.md`
- `decisions.md`

---

## Challenges/Issues

**None** - Session proceeded smoothly with clear user corrections

---

## Instance State

**Instance 2025-10-31-1736**:
- Status: Idle (checkpointed)
- Created: 17:36
- Ended: 18:00
- Objectives completed: AI disclosure implementation + User profile creation

**Registry**: 1 instance (idle)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Use profile before making assumptions** - Reference `research/user-profile.md` before any biographical statements
2. **Article writing ready** - All infrastructure complete, profile established
3. **Consider first article topic** - Peace & Violence series recommended, or biomechanics foundations
4. **Resume options**:
   - `/discuss [topic]` - Explore article idea through conversation
   - `/extract` - Transform discussion into draft
   - Plan article series structure

---

## Notes

**Significance**: This profile is critical for maintaining accuracy and credibility in published articles. Ensures:
- Biographical accuracy in author bio and personal anecdotes
- Appropriate voice and positioning (advanced student, not master)
- Correct claims about experience and lineage
- Honest presentation of strengths and limitations

**User Concern**: User noticed inaccuracies and proactively requested centralized profile - demonstrates commitment to intellectual honesty and accurate representation.

**Profile Location**: `research/user-profile.md` should be first reference before writing any article with personal context or biographical information.
