## Key Decisions

### Educational Article Series Approach (2025-10-31)

**Decision**: Shift from blog posts to educational article series designed for book publication

**Rationale**: User wants to write self-consistent educational content that could be compiled into a book, not engagement-focused blog posts. Priority is comprehensive learning over clicks.

**Impact**:
- All writing now targets 1,500-3,000+ words for thoroughness
- Articles must build progressively and cross-reference earlier content
- Titles must be clear/descriptive, not catchy
- Tone shifts to professional educational (while maintaining personal voice)
- Quality bar raised: comprehensive depth, no gaps in coverage
- Series consistency becomes critical requirement

---

## Conversation Highlights

**User's Core Request**: "I want to reframe my work to blogs to blog series or more precisely article series which should all be self consistent and could be ultimately be published together as a book. Can you please use /resume to get the whole context and update the system to change the objective from blog to articles. I am not looking for catchy topics but more for educational content."

**User's Clarification**: "Do not try to find out the content of the serie, instead focus on changing all the 'blog' related best practice to become article best practice"

**Key Insight**: User has extensive Iwama syllabus knowledge (7 Ken Suburi, 13 Jo Kata, 31 Kumijo, etc.) that should be captured as detailed "how to perform" instructions as part of article series.

**User's Final Check**: "anything I should know?" - Wanted to understand what was changed and any gotchas

---

## Files Modified

### Created:
- `BOOK-STRUCTURE-PROPOSAL.md` - Comprehensive book structure (6 parts, 14 chapters)
- `blog/article-template.md` - New template with series metadata
- `blog/article-guidelines.md` - Renamed from blog-guidelines.md with article standards

### Modified:
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (OVERVIEW.md) - Changed blog → article throughout
- `decisions.md` - Added 5 new article-series principles
- `session-context.md` - Updated current status and next steps
- `topics.md` - Restructured for series tracking instead of post queue

### Deleted:
- `blog/blog-guidelines.md` - Renamed to article-guidelines.md

---

## Challenges/Issues

**None encountered** - Straightforward systematic update of all blog-related best practices to article standards.

**Note**: Command files (`.claude/commands/`) were NOT updated - they may still reference "blog posts" internally. Only documentation about them was updated.

---

## What Wasn't Changed

1. **Command files** - `/discuss`, `/extract`, `/review-aikido` command instructions may still say "blog" internally
2. **blog/blog-series-structure.md** - Still has old catchy blog titles, wasn't updated per user instruction
3. **Directory structure** - No `articles/` directory created yet (referenced but doesn't exist)
4. **Workflow names** - Commands still called `/review-aikido` (kept for consistency)

---

## User Concerns Addressed

**"anything I should know?"** - Provided comprehensive summary of:
- What wasn't touched (command files, blog-series-structure.md)
- Directory structure ambiguity (articles/ referenced but not created)
- Mental shift required (completeness vs. engagement)
- YouTube research still valuable (but as evidence, not inspiration)
- Review standards now more rigorous (checks series consistency)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (When User Resumes):
1. Consider whether to update command files (`.claude/commands/`) to reference articles
2. Decide on directory structure: Keep `blog/` or create `articles/`
3. Optionally update `blog/blog-series-structure.md` with educational article titles
4. Consider creating actual `articles/` directory structure for organizing content

### When Ready to Write:
1. Choose an article series to start
2. Use `/discuss [topic]` to explore first article
3. Use `/extract [discussion]` to create article draft
4. Write using article-template.md with comprehensive depth
5. Use `/review-aikido [file]` for rigorous review (depth, consistency, completeness)
6. Expect multiple revision rounds for book-level quality
7. Track progress in topics.md

### Long-term:
- Begin writing Iwama syllabus documentation series (20-30 articles with "how to" instructions)
- Develop other major series (biomechanics, learning journey, teaching, etc.)
- Ensure series consistency across all articles
- Prepare for potential book compilation

## Technical Notes

**Git Status**:
- 4 commits ahead of origin/main (need to push)
- This session committed as: "Restructure: Convert blog system to educational article series"
- Session will push to GitHub after summary creation

**System Status**:
- All blog-to-article conversions complete
- System ready for educational article writing
- No content written yet - just infrastructure prepared

**Token Usage**: Well within limits for session complexity

---

## Notes

This was a **major philosophical restructure** of the entire project:
- From engagement-focused blog → comprehensive educational articles
- From standalone posts → progressive series
- From quick reads → thorough coverage
- From catchy titles → clear descriptive titles
- From casual tone → professional educational tone

The shift represents a fundamental change in purpose: creating publishable educational content rather than traffic-driving blog posts.

User's Iwama syllabus knowledge (techniques, weapons kata, kumijo) should eventually become a major article series with detailed technical documentation.
