## Key Decisions

### Session Continuity System
- Use /checkpoint and /resume commands with markdown files
- Maintain both current state (session-context.md) and history (sessions/)
- Track decisions separately in decisions.md

### Critical Review Approach
- Apply MA-level quality standards
- Direct, critical feedback without sugar-coating
- Collaborative iterative improvement
- Challenge vague statements and unsupported claims

### Session History with Timestamps
- Automatic timestamped summaries on each checkpoint
- Format: session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md
- Includes: focus, accomplishments, decisions, conversation highlights, files, next steps
- Enables progress review and searchable history

### Documentation Structure
- User-facing: help.md (comprehensive), README.md (quick start)
- AI-facing: .claude/claude.md (system documentation)
- Writing: blog-guidelines.md (standards and philosophy)
- Tracking: session-context.md (current), sessions/ (history), decisions.md (rationale)

## Conversation Highlights

### Initial Context Loading
- User asked where we were and if previous work was saved
- Discovered .claude/commands/review-aikido.md already existed
- Established fresh session with no prior context

### System Design Discussion
- User requested session continuity between Claude Code sessions
- Designed checkpoint/resume workflow pattern
- Added blog structure with templates and guidelines
- User emphasized wanting workflow reminders on session start

### Critical Review Requirements
- User explicitly requested: "I want you to be very critical of the blog post when reviewing them and work with me collaboratively"
- Enhanced /review-aikido command with rigorous standards
- Added "Review Philosophy" section to blog-guidelines.md
- Set MA-level quality expectations

### Session History Feature
- User requested: "Can you make sure that on checkpoint, a summary of the session is saved in a folder with a file timestamped"
- Implemented sessions/ directory with automatic summary creation
- Each checkpoint now creates permanent historical record

### System Review Request
- User asked to "review everything we done up to now for consistency, logic and well ordered"
- Conducted comprehensive system review
- Created SYSTEM_REVIEW.md with findings and prioritized recommendations
- Identified 3 critical issues, 5 important issues, 7 nice-to-have improvements

### Priority 1 Resolution
- User authorized "Option A" to fix critical issues
- Created .gitignore file
- Created README.md with complete project overview
- Executed initial git commit (fa25f1c)

---

## Challenges/Issues

### Slash Command Execution
- Attempted to use /checkpoint as SlashCommand tool
- Received error: "Slash command checkpoint is not a prompt-based command"
- **Resolution**: Manually executed checkpoint steps (worked successfully)
- **Note**: May need to understand why SlashCommand tool didn't work

### No Initial Content Yet
- topics.md is still empty (no blog ideas)
- No example blog post created
- **Status**: Acceptable - Priority 2 items for next session

2. **Create example blog post** showing completed template
3. **Update /checkpoint** to auto-update session-context.md timestamp
4. **Update /resume** to show snippet from most recent session
5. **Clarify** session summary commit timing in checkpoint.md

### Ready to Begin Writing:
