# Session Summary: YouTube Channel Tracking Enhancement

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Time**: 11:15 AM
**Duration**: ~35 minutes
**Main Focus**: Enhancing YouTube channel tracking with automated information extraction

---

## Session Overview

User ran `/track-source https://www.youtube.com/@Tony_Sargeant` but the system couldn't extract channel information because WebFetch doesn't work with YouTube. User requested: "can you update the tooling to use the information in the youtube user page to extract information, it does not require video analysis"

This triggered a complete enhancement of the YouTube channel tracking system.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Created youtube-channel-info.py Script

**File**: `scripts/youtube-channel-info.py` (~150 lines)

**Functionality**:
- Extracts comprehensive channel information using yt-dlp
- No WebFetch dependency (bypasses YouTube access limitations)
- Gets channel metadata:
  - Channel name and ID
  - Subscriber count
  - Up to 10 recent videos
  - Video titles, URLs, views, durations
- Returns JSON output for programmatic use
- Uses `--flat-playlist` flag for efficient channel scraping
- Includes detailed video fetch for description and subscriber count

**Output Format**: JSON with channel_name, channel_id, subscriber_count, video_count, recent_videos array, description

### 2. Updated /track-source Command

**File**: `.claude/commands/track-source.md`

**Changes**:
- Added Step 4 instructions for YouTube channel information extraction
- Changed from "Optional WebFetch" to mandatory youtube-channel-info.py usage
- Added guidance to analyze video titles for:
  - Martial art discipline detection
  - Content themes identification
  - Teaching style assessment
- Updated channel profile template with richer fields:
  - Subscriber count
  - Content themes (from video analysis)
  - Teaching style
  - Recent video topics
  - Recommended videos for detailed analysis

### 3. Tracked Tony Sargeant's YouTube Channel

**File**: `sources/youtube/registry/tony-sargeant.md`

**Extracted Information**:
- Channel: Tony Sargeant
- Discipline: Aikido (Iwama style) - detected from video titles
- Subscribers: 1,600
- Recent videos: 11 identified with full titles and URLs

**Content Analysis**:
- **Themes identified**:
  - Ki Musubi (energy connection) principles
  - Kumitachi (paired sword kata) instruction
  - Teacher seminars and introductions
  - Dan test demonstrations
  - Weapons training (bokken, jo)
- **Teaching style**: Traditional Iwama Aikido with emphasis on weapons kata and ki principles
- **Video examples**:
  - "Ki Musubi 4 important points Cam 2"
  - "Improving your Aikido 6"
  - "4th Dan test demo St P Russia"
  - "Scotland 93 11 3,4,&5 Kumitachi"

**Connections to Research**:
- Highly relevant to core-values.md Iwama critique
- Strong connection to weapons-training-framework.md (kumitachi, weapons emphasis)
- Traditional ki approach vs. user's biomechanical analysis
- Provides comparison/contrast material for blog posts

### 4. Enhanced System Capabilities

**Before**:
- YouTube channels tracked with minimal information
- Required manual video analysis to populate profiles
- WebFetch couldn't access YouTube

**After**:
- Comprehensive channel information extracted automatically
- Discipline and themes identified from video titles
- Subscriber count and recent videos listed
- Specific video recommendations provided
- Immediate connections to research frameworks identified

---

## Key Decisions

**Decision**: Create youtube-channel-info.py using yt-dlp instead of relying on WebFetch

**Rationale**:
- User correctly identified that channel information should be extractable without video analysis
- WebFetch can't access YouTube
- yt-dlp provides comprehensive channel API
- Enables automated, programmatic channel profiling

**Logged in**: decisions.md (2025-10-30)

## Conversation Highlights

**User Request**: "can you update the tooling to use the information in the youtube user page to extract information, it does not require video analysis"

**Key Insight**: User recognized that the system was over-relying on video-level analysis when channel-level information should be extracted first

**Solution Approach**:
1. Created Python script using yt-dlp (already in project for video transcripts)
2. Tested with Tony Sargeant's channel - successfully extracted all information
3. Updated /track-source command documentation
4. Populated Tony Sargeant's profile with real extracted data
5. Identified connections to existing research frameworks

**User Verification**: "continue" after login - accepted and approved the enhancement

## Files Modified

**Created**:
- scripts/youtube-channel-info.py (YouTube channel information extractor)

**Modified**:
- .claude/commands/track-source.md (added YouTube channel extraction step)
- sources/youtube/registry/tony-sargeant.md (populated with real data)
- session-context.md (updated status and recent work)
- decisions.md (logged YouTube extraction decision)

**Git Operations**:
- Commit b40e2ea: "Add Tony Sargeant YouTube channel tracking and update /track-source for YouTube"
- Commit 0e7f94b: "Add YouTube channel information extraction capability"
- Both commits pushed to origin/main successfully

## Technical Details

### youtube-channel-info.py Implementation

**Key Functions**:
```python
get_channel_info(channel_url)
  ├── yt-dlp --flat-playlist --dump-json (first 10 videos)
  ├── Parse JSON lines for video metadata
  ├── Extract channel info from first entry
  ├── yt-dlp detailed fetch for description/subscribers
  └── Return comprehensive JSON result
```

**Data Extracted**:
- Channel name, ID, URL
- Subscriber count (1,600 for Tony Sargeant)
- Video count and recent video list
- Each video: title, ID, URL, duration, views
- Channel description (when available)

**Error Handling**:
- Graceful fallback if detailed fetch fails
- JSON parsing error handling
- Subprocess execution error handling

## Next Steps

### Immediate Opportunities

1. **Analyze Tony Sargeant's Videos**:
   - `/youtube-fetch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx7S6lm73aA` (Ki Musubi)
   - `/youtube-fetch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ5Uv2IfO5I` (Improving Aikido)
   - Compare traditional Iwama approach with your biomechanical analysis

2. **Track More YouTube Channels**:
   - Now easy to add new channels with `/track-source <channel_url>`
   - Immediate comprehensive profiles without video analysis
   - Build library of martial arts content sources

3. **Begin /discuss Sessions** (original plan):
   - Weapons Training Framework
   - Contextual Design of Martial Arts
   - Demonstration Robotization

### Medium-Term

- Use Tony Sargeant's Iwama content as reference for weapons-training-framework.md development
- Blog post ideas:
  - "Traditional Ki vs. Biomechanical Principles in Aikido"
  - "Iwama Kumitachi Kata: Pedagogy and Purpose"
  - "What Iwama Gets Right (and Wrong) About Weapons Training"
