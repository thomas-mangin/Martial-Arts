# Session Summary: Repository Refactoring

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Time**: Evening session (~22:00)
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Session ID**: session-2025-10-30-1001

---

## Main Focus

Repository structure refactoring to improve organization and maintainability of the MA thesis blog project.

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Repository Reorganization

**Created two new directories:**
- `blog/` - All blog-related content files
- `research/` - All research and analysis documents

**Files Moved:**

**blog/ directory (4 files):**
- blog-template.md
- blog-guidelines.md
- blog-engagement-techniques.md
- blog-series-structure.md

**research/ directory (8 files):**
- core-values.md
- divisive-topics.md
- learning-journey.md
- biomechanical-principles.md (25+ principles)
- areas-needing-development.md (13 major topics)
- audience-profiles.md
- SESSION-SUMMARY-BIOMECHANICS.md
- SYSTEM_REVIEW.md

### 2. Updated All File References

**Files Updated:**
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Complete directory structure documentation and all file path references
- `.claude/commands/discuss.md` - Updated to reference research/ files
- `.claude/commands/extract.md` - Updated template and guidelines paths
- `.claude/commands/review-aikido.md` - Updated research document references
- `.claude/commands/scan-sources.md` - Updated template and audience profile paths
- `.claude/commands/resume.md` - Updated workflow reminder paths
- `help.md` - Updated all examples and workflow instructions
- `README.md` - Updated project structure documentation

### 3. Git Operations

- Used `git mv` to preserve file history
- Committed refactoring with descriptive commit message
- Added `tree` command to allowed bash commands
- All changes tracked and documented

## Key Decisions

### Repository Structure Refactoring (2025-10-30)

**Decision**: Reorganize files into blog/ and research/ directories

**Rationale**: User requested better organization as root directory was cluttered with specialized files. Grouping related files by purpose improves maintainability and navigation.

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner root directory with only essential tracking files (topics.md, session-context.md, decisions.md, help.md, README.md)
- Related files grouped logically by function
- Easier to find relevant files in future sessions
- Professional structure suitable for MA thesis work
- All functionality preserved - no breaking changes

**Documented in**: decisions.md

## Files Modified This Session

### Created
- `blog/` directory
- `research/` directory
- `sessions/session-2025-10-30-1001.md` (this file)

### Modified
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Updated directory structure and file references
- `.claude/commands/discuss.md` - Updated research/ paths
- `.claude/commands/extract.md` - Updated blog/ paths
- `.claude/commands/review-aikido.md` - Updated research/ paths
- `.claude/commands/scan-sources.md` - Updated blog/ and research/ paths
- `.claude/commands/resume.md` - Updated workflow reminder
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Added tree command
- `help.md` - Updated all file references
- `README.md` - Updated project structure
- `session-context.md` - Updated with refactoring work
- `decisions.md` - Logged refactoring decision

### Moved (via git mv)
- 12 files relocated to blog/ and research/ directories (preserving git history)

---

## Challenges/Issues

**None** - Refactoring completed smoothly. All file references were systematically identified using grep and updated. Git history preserved through `git mv`.

---

## Conversation Highlights

1. **User Request**: "can you please refactor the repository, the blog- files should probably all be under a blog folder. Some for the files like SESSION-SUMMARY-BIOMECHANICS.md and SYSTEM_REVIEW.md areas-needing-development.md audience-profiles.md biomechanical-principles.md and core-values.md should probably be grouped under a folder called research"

2. **Systematic Approach**: Created todo list to track refactoring steps:
   - Create directories
   - Move files with git mv
   - Update CLAUDE.md
   - Update slash commands
   - Update help.md and README.md
   - Commit changes

3. **Thorough Reference Updates**: Used grep to find all file references across the codebase and updated them systematically to prevent broken links.

4. **Verification**: Used `tree` command to display new directory structure and confirm organization.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)

1. **Resume context** with `/resume` to verify refactored structure works correctly
2. **Begin /discuss sessions** on highest-priority topics:
   - **Weapons Framework** ⭐⭐⭐ (may need multiple sessions)
   - **Contextual Design of Martial Arts** ⭐⭐⭐
   - **Demonstration Robotization** ⭐⭐⭐
   - **Stance Principles** ⭐⭐

### Short-term (This Week)

1. Start working through priority topics in `research/areas-needing-development.md`
2. Build depth through `/discuss` sessions before writing blog posts
3. Consider writing one of the "ready to write" topics (Newton's Third Law, Kinetic Chain, etc.)

### Medium-term (This Month)

1. Complete 3-5 `/discuss` sessions on foundational topics
2. Write first blog posts with proper depth
3. Use `/review-aikido` to ensure MA-level quality
4. Begin building the blog series structure

---

## Notes

- **System Status**: All workflows functional after refactoring
- **File Organization**: Much cleaner and more professional
- **Ready for Content Creation**: Data gathering phase foundation is solid
- **80+ Blog Ideas**: Documented and organized, most need /discuss depth first
- **Next Major Phase**: Deep exploration through /discuss sessions, then blog writing

---

## Project State Summary

**Research Phase**:
- ✅ Core values documented
- ✅ Divisive topics framework complete
- ✅ Learning journey framework established
- ✅ 25+ biomechanical principles documented
- ✅ 13 major topics identified needing /discuss
- ✅ Audience targeting system in place
- ✅ Repository well-organized

**Ready For**:
- 🎯 Deep /discuss sessions on priority topics
- 🎯 Blog post writing (some topics ready immediately)
- 🎯 Quality review and iteration
- 🎯 Building progressive blog series

**System Health**: Excellent - organized, documented, ready for content creation phase.
