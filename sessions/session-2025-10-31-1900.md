## Conversation Highlights

**User chose Option 1**: Continue restructure from where previous session left off

**Systematic approach:**
1. Explored blog/ directory structure
2. Identified files needing updates vs. deletion vs. legacy marking
3. Updated guidelines with systematic find/replace for terminology
4. Updated command documentation
5. Implemented directory naming strategy (blog/ = guidelines, articles/ = content)
6. Verified cross-references and consistency
7. Updated session-context.md with completion status

**Efficiency**: Used TodoWrite throughout to track progress and mark completions

---

## Challenges/Issues

**None** - Restructure executed smoothly with clear plan from previous session decisions.

---

## Next Steps

System is now ready for article writing! Three options available:

**Option A: Plan Article Series**
- Review `blog/article-series-structure.md` for 10 pre-planned series
- Choose first series to write (recommended: Biomechanics Foundations or Peace & Violence)
- Outline specific articles within series
- Update `topics.md` with chosen series plan

**Option B: Start Writing First Article**
- Use `/discuss [topic]` to explore article idea through conversation
- Use `/extract` to transform discussion into article draft
- Develop and expand draft in `articles/` directory
- Use `/review-aikido` for critical quality review before finalizing

**Option C: Capture Iwama Syllabus**
- Begin documenting detailed Iwama syllabus as article series
- "How to perform" instructions for techniques, weapons kata, etc.
- Comprehensive technical reference series

**Recommendation from session**: Start with Peace & Violence series - leverages unique veteran perspective and personal experiences.

## Research Status

**Unchanged this session** - Research base remains:
- 1,983 YouTube transcripts analyzed across 5 channels

**Message**: "Complete system restructure: Blog â†’ Educational Article Series"
**Pushed**: âœ… Successfully pushed to origin/main

## Notes

**Session Significance**: This session completed the infrastructure transformation. The system is now fully aligned with the educational article series approach:
- All documentation uses "article" terminology
- All commands support article workflow
- Clear directory structure (guidelines vs. content)
- Book-level quality standards throughout
- Ready to begin actual article writing

**Clean separation achieved**:
- `/blog/` = Writing toolkit (guidelines, templates, references)
- `/articles/` = Content organized by series
- `/discussions/` = Informal explorations before extraction

**Legacy acknowledgment**:
- Directory name "blog/" kept for simplicity (functional despite name)
- Engagement techniques marked as LEGACY for optional reference
- All active guidelines reflect educational depth approach
