00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,550
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,370
Thank you for coming.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:12,627
First I would like us to do the formal bow together, which is something that is done at the beginning of every judo practice.

4
00:00:12,627 --> 00:00:18,299
First, please face towards the picture of Kano Jigoro Shihan

5
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:22,199
Towards Kano Shihan... bow...

6
00:00:23,162 --> 00:00:26,316
Now towards each other... bow...

7
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:18,000
Kano Jigoro Sensei was born on the 28th of October, 

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,338
so every year, we hold events for about three days leading up to that day 

9
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:35,512
to let people in Japan and around the world know about his achievements.

10
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:40,070
It's not a big event 

11
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,490
but I think that it should continue like this, quietly and calmly.

12
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:51,385
If we try to make into something big, it will lose its strength.

13
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:55,752
So I'm thinking of keeping content like his special exhibition,

14
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:57,338
the calligraphy class,

15
00:01:57,338 --> 00:02:00,454
and the judo practice with kids and parents, 

16
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,745
just as is, for a long time.

17
00:02:02,854 --> 00:02:06,875
Kano Sensei didn't like flashy things.

18
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:48,674
During the period of the birthday celebrations, 

19
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:58,219
we allow not just the members of the Kodokan to participate, but we also welcome the members of the general public to practice.

20
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,664
This is a great system.

21
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:12,519
And, in fact, judo is not just about throwing and being thrown, 

22
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:20,486
it's a physical activity that incorporates whole body movements.

23
00:03:20,486 --> 00:03:23,475
In today's audience, we had:

24
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:29,429
people with black belts, people with white belts,

25
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:36,720
people who had never done it before, mothers, fathers, and children

26
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:48,100
Since there may not usually be much communication between parents and children, we thought of doing this at the birthday party.

27
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,480
It is one of the important parts of this birthday celebration.

28
00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:01,528
That's why the partner of Shimoyama Sensei (6th Dan) who I taught the class was his own daughter.

29
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:08,013
And they really had fun doing it, so I think it was fantastic.

30
00:04:08,211 --> 00:04:21,222
In other sports, I don't think there are many opportunities for parents and children to laugh and interact with each other like that.

31
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,060
I would like to continue in the future.

32
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:36,097
I wish I had more time, but it was only an hour.

33
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:42,594
Oh well, perhaps it is good to have such a compact one-hour format,

34
00:04:42,594 --> 00:04:49,492
because although I think that it was a lot of fun today, 

35
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:54,294
if we kept doing it a little longer, people might get sore.

36
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,533
[Guillaume: They'd need to know a bit more ukemi...]

37
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:56,781
Yes.

38
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:59,541
It can become painful, right?

39
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:03,021
Therefore, I believe that sports should be fun. 

40
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:11,011
Both the government and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology recognize judo as a sport.

41
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:17,101
There are a lot of sport practiced in the middle school and judo is one of them.

42
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:28,827
However, if I was asked what the characteristics of Judo are, I would say that it is the element of tanren [disciplined training].

43
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:34,167
That's why we have kangeiko [mid-winter training] and shochu geiko [mid-summer training].

44
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,558
So, although people think that all sports have wonderful characteristics,

45
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:55,330
I think that element such as training that are specific to judo compared to ball games and other events should not lose their Japanese characteristics.

46
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:02,263
I think that there are people who, on the contrary, move away from judo because there is an element of discipline.

47
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:07,291
But without discipline, I don't think one can become stronger as a human being.

48
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:11,631
After all, it is important to be resilient.

49
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:17,800
Because there are a lot of people who think that they are resilient is good,

50
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:23,153
but they only say what they want, or eat what they want,

51
00:06:23,153 --> 00:06:34,909
but this won't lead to progress as a human being.

52
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:41,479
But it can't be quantified. Education cannot be quantified.

53
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Also, it takes time to see any result in education.

54
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,419
Even if we did it for about an hour today, it won't be an educative experience per se.

55
00:06:52,419 --> 00:07:04,029
It was fun, but I think it takes years of practice to develop one's human character through judo.

56
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:12,765
Today is also the anniversary of the establishment of Judo by Kano Sensei.

57
00:08:12,765 --> 00:08:16,094
This is represented in the following calligraphy as:

58
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:20,621
"Good use of energy" and "Mutual Prosperity"

59
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:29,432
and I think that those who aspire to join Judo know these words.

60
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:38,439
"The power that makes the most effective use of body and mind."

61
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:47,626
We say that mutual prosperity for ourselves and others will bring prosperity to all.

62
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:54,326
Judo is not about wining or losing.

63
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:02,772
Kano Jigoro Shihan designed it as a teaching method to make each other happy.

64
00:09:02,772 --> 00:09:06,912
Those words: "Good use of energy" and "Mutual Prosperity",

65
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:13,556
"The power that makes the most effective use of body and mind."

66
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:29,141
If we and others prosper together, that will lead to world peace.

67
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:45,929
Kano Sensei's main idea is that it is not about only being happy by ourselves. 

68
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:49,309
Our family should be happy. 

69
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:59,369
Not only our family, but the people next door, the other people should be happy too.

70
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:02,519
If you think about it in a broader sense, 

71
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,511
Japan can't be happy and at peace by itself.

72
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,701
For instance, that's why there are many problems that are due to the Russian war on Ukraine,

73
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:24,000
including shortages of food, oil and electricity

74
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,458
are having an impact on the Japanese nation.

75
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,618
I think that's exactly what Kano Sensei taught.

76
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:46,564
I feel that we can't say the words "I'm happy" while a war like that between Ukraine and Russia exist.

77
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,207
In the Judo training, we work in pairs,

78
00:10:57,207 --> 00:11:01,110
-- I think that Aikido is done at a distance. --

79
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:05,746
-- Though of course, there are times when you come into contact. --

80
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,871
In judo, you do it together, so you can understand the opponent's feelings at the moment,

81
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:21,966
and judo techniques are used to throw the opponent, lock on joints, and perform strangleholds. You can also do joints and chocking techniques.

82
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:25,711
this is the technical structure of judo.

83
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:34,909
If you don't have the feeling of respecting your opponent during that time, then it's just violence.

84
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:41,035
So when you throw, you must throw so that the opponent does not get hurt.

85
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,777
Why is there a choke technique or a lethal technique?

86
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:50,112
It's a technique to control an opponent in an instant, 

87
00:11:50,112 --> 00:12:01,758
but it is also a technique to take a joint to strangle an opponent while protecting him, waiting for him to get out of the way and taking it slowly.

88
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:05,306
If you take it tightly, will you hurt him, right?

89
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,612
Through this kind of technique, you can understand each other's feelings and become friends.

90
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:16,935
That's the judo technique.

91
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:31,186
Therefore, Olympic or World Championship matches are only a small part of this overall goal.

92
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,827
So it is not all about who won gold medals. 

93
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:41,066
The person who won the gold medal just happened to win the competition.

94
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:49,865
If we ask whether the people that Kano Sensei had in mind are those who are highly skilled, there are of course those who are, but there are also many who are not.

95
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:56,135
It is only a matter of high technical level.

96
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:07,997
One of the aspects of Judo training are matches.

97
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:17,891
In a match, in principle, the rules say who has won and who has lost, so there are always winners and losers. 

98
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:25,773
However, it's because there was an opponent at that time that you could understand the feeling that you had won. 

99
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:37,214
And even those who lost, if the other person showed consideration for them, they will want to try their best again.

100
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,853
So, when it comes to the match, 

101
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:44,353
-- and it's the same in Aikido, -- 

102
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:52,551
if the person who throws the other does a victory pose,

103
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:56,342
it's extremely rude to the person being thrown,

104
00:13:56,342 --> 00:14:00,474
so if you are considerate about the other person, you can't do something like a victory pose.

105
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:05,180
As we repeat these things over and over,

106
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:12,037
the purpose of the match should be to enhance each other.

107
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:19,604
But now it's no longer a martial art, it's a sport, 

108
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:29,486
and the ranking of gold, silver, 1st place and 2nd and 3rd place has become the goal for young children.

109
00:14:29,774 --> 00:14:38,594
That's the purpose of youths, junior high school students, high school students, etc. 

110
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,562
that's why I think that Judo has to change.

111
00:14:43,562 --> 00:14:55,731
As a consequence, the All Japan Judo Federation eliminated elementary school matches.

112
00:14:55,731 --> 00:15:00,609
There is a need to be more open-minded,

113
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:05,541
but that is difficult.

114
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,740
After all, at first, we start training with the idea of winning.

115
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:20,268
Kano Sensei also thought that competitions are useful for increasing judo popularity.

116
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:28,811
However, he did not like the idea that the only purpose of this sport would be to establish who wins and loses, 

117
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:38,850
since it would not lead to the development of one's character.

118
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:45,436
But people all over the world who practice judo should understand that.

119
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:58,671
Therefore, the Kodokan never sets winning or losing as a goal when instructing.

120
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:07,389
But it's difficult, we're still in the process of training ourselves when it comes to character development.

121
00:16:12,545 --> 00:16:23,816
Right now, we are in the process of instructing the International Judo Federation and others about attitudes after a match.

122
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:35,075
So I think that judo instructors are now thinking about getting people to not do victory poses, etc. 

123
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:40,267
I think that is really the important part of Zanshin. 

124
00:16:40,854 --> 00:16:56,769
And also in technique, very well-trained people are not getting injured when being thrown.

125
00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:07,829
However, if a young elementary or junior high school student thrower falls down, this can result in a big accident, such as hitting one's head.

126
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:19,388
Therefore, the thrower, retains a firm zanshin even after throwing.

127
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:24,000
That is what we are currently teaching at the Kodokan.

128
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,839
That's why the one who throws with zanshin doesn't fall over.

129
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,366
Then, the one being thrown does a graceful ukemi.

130
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:37,585
because if he pulls the chest before the throw, the other will will fall too.

131
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:44,283
And since we both have judogi, if they pull them together they will balance each other out.

132
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:58,637
I called it a lifeline, so zanshin, purity, and lifeline.

133
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:05,875
If you follow these 3 things, you won't get injured very often.

134
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:18,792
Judo is practiced to prevent injuries, so injuring others is outrageous, and it's the same as violence.

135
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,025
Yes, I think so.

136
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:35,520
That's why I said earlier that Kano Sensei thought that matches are necessary for the spread and development of judo,

137
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,682
but since this is a form of judo training, if there is something like this in aikido, it will be more like judo.

138
00:18:40,682 --> 00:18:51,040
I think that if aikido had something like this, the number of judo practitioners would increase, and the techniques would develop as well.

139
00:18:51,040 --> 00:19:02,779
But that's not all. Judo and aikido are both about human development, and I think that's what budo is all about.

140
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:18,637
Judo instructors are getting younger now, so there are more young people, so we are doing it within the current rules.

141
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:30,913
Therefore, the old atemi-waza being dangerous, so it is not used in actual practice.

142
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:44,176
Also, techniques that have been proven to cause many injuries in matches are banned in the rules.

143
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:55,844
Therefore, I believe that it is wrong to teach and cause injury to others.

144
00:19:55,844 --> 00:20:02,893
There are many ways to teach, but it is wrong to teach in a way that causes injury.

145
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:11,518
So, for example, in osotogari, if you let go of the hand I mentioned earlier, you'll hit your head. This is a practice mistake.

146
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:18,907
But if it's the original killing technique, to kill the opponent, you throw him and let go.

147
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,020
Now that's extremely dangerous, right?

148
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:34,391
Therefore, if there is such a dangerous judo technique, we must stop at once.

149
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:47,093
The referee also has a rule that if there is something dangerous, he must stop the match immediately by telling the player "mate!". 

150
00:20:47,220 --> 00:21:02,321
Therefore, we are really trying to prevent safety injuries, and although there may have been various techniques in the past to cause injuries, they are no longer used.

151
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:09,387
The old techniques?

152
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:18,000
No, there aren't many people who understand the old techniques, so we can't teach them that way.

153
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,260
There are only modern techniques.

154
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:36,780
That's really true of all fields, but people who specialize know what they are doing, but the general public doesn't.

155
00:21:42,412 --> 00:21:49,353
I think the conditions for competing are in place, but each person is different.

156
00:21:49,353 --> 00:22:01,492
But a match is a tournament, like the all-Japan tournament, the Olympics is a tournament, and you can participate in matches for the rest of your life,

157
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:05,242
like during friendly matches for recreation purposes.

158
00:22:05,663 --> 00:22:23,723
So, if you think of a competition as a ranking order, you have to be at your best in order to compete. 

159
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:34,912
So for example, if you are an Olympian and you get to 30 or 35 years old, all you can do is fall from the top of the world, right?

160
00:22:34,912 --> 00:22:45,147
But for example, at the Kodokan, there is a high dan tournament with 5th dan, 6th dan, 7th dan and 8-dan matches. 

161
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:51,626
There are people who are about 90 years old. That is also a match.

162
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:55,777
You can have matches at any age.

163
00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:09,492
In Judo, when it comes to challenge, Kano Sensei created a Dan system of ranks.

164
00:23:09,492 --> 00:23:17,407
If you get to 5th Dan, your challenge is the 6th Dan, and then your challenge becomes the 7th Dan, and so on.

165
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:20,168
He created that path.

166
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:32,714
So, for example, if you aim for the 3rd Dan, you may think that 3rd Dan is enough, but once you get it, you will try again for 4th Dan.

167
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:43,460
So, I think that Kano Sensei understood those instincts of human beings very well, and I think it is still a wonderful system.

168
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:54,586
It takes time in order to move up a Dan, for example, from 7th to 8th dan, it takes 12 years.

169
00:23:54,586 --> 00:24:03,982
Also there are tournaments and you need 10 points. You get 1 point for a win, and 0.5 points for a draw.

170
00:24:03,982 --> 00:24:11,160
So, it's a very difficult system to move up a rank. 

171
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,009
After all, human beings are capable of taking on such challenges,

172
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:26,510
-- I'm not sure how many people from all over the country to participate in this once-a-year tournament for high ranks, perhaps 1,500? ---

173
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:33,076
0 points for a loss, 0.5 for a draw, 1 for a win,

174
00:24:33,076 --> 00:24:36,961
in the end you will have to score 10 points,

175
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:39,099
and you have 12 years to do that,

176
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,481
and then there is the need for refereeing skills.

177
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:47,217
You can only be promoted to a higher rank when you satisfy a variety of factors.

178
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,827
Actually, I have been to France several times to see judo clubs.

179
00:26:09,827 --> 00:26:26,240
Therefore, I don't think the figure that the judo population in France is larger than that in Japan, as what some people say, because the basic numbers are different.

180
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,494
In Japan, there are 2.4 million people who have black belts.

181
00:26:32,494 --> 00:26:35,659
Actually, the number of people who are still alive is 2.1 million.

182
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:43,181
So, if you compare those populations, the standard of the number is totally different from the standard of thinking.

183
00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:51,592
In this sense, I have visited France to observe judo and have taught in France.

184
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:58,462
It was like: "Today it is judo, tomorrow it is soccer, the next is basketball, the next is swimming", 

185
00:26:58,462 --> 00:27:05,068
and in this way, I think they are cultivating physical activity among children in a very good way.

186
00:27:05,198 --> 00:27:13,513
This may become the case in Japan as well.

187
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:20,438
However, when I look at the children who come to the Kodokan, 

188
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:33,113
I see that for most of them it's their parents who want their children to study judo,

189
00:27:33,113 --> 00:27:52,200
and while their goal may of course be to become stronger, many of them come to the Kodokan for the sake of etiquette and discipline.

190
00:27:53,324 --> 00:28:01,475
I don't think that it's really what first grade or kindergarten children would want to do as of themselves.

191
00:28:01,475 --> 00:28:07,580
But that's an education system, so parents give their children that chance.

192
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:22,568
And I think that judo should be one of the ways to grow, not only judo, but also soccer, swimming, and basketball, just like in France.

193
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:31,826
And even if you become a judo champion in elementary school, you often cannot become one in junior high or high school.
 

194
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:41,674
So even though you are learning judo now, you can always move on to another sport.
 
 

195
00:28:41,674 --> 00:28:47,383
We want them to have a variety of experiences.

196
00:28:47,383 --> 00:28:55,718
So I don't think it is necessary to say, "Do what you are doing now or continue this for the rest of your life."

197
00:28:55,718 --> 00:29:07,435
I think it is very important to train your mind and body well now and then further experience other sports in your life.

198
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:20,700
When we say "old people", what age are we talking about?

199
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:27,727
It is still difficult to distinguish sports and martial arts in Japan,

200
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:34,855
but I think that the most well known Japanese athletic sports are judo and kendo.

201
00:29:34,949 --> 00:29:46,420
However, students including current college students, and young people who have graduated from college, and I don't know how old they are, have one thing in common: 

202
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:53,800
I think they have a longing for judo.

203
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:59,564
If you have strong judo, you will become strong.

204
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:08,250
But if they don't have the courage to do it here, they won't have the courage to do it there.

205
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:19,080
And since there is a possibility that we may gradually move away from traditional Japanese athletic culture,

206
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:35,908
I think that although young people may like the judo they see, judo will not be the sport of choice for them to actually do.

207
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:48,576
Therefore, even though judo originated in Japan, there are still good things from other countries, 

208
00:30:48,576 --> 00:31:02,504
so there is no longer any need to stick to Japanese kendo or judo as a martial art, and I think that is fine.

209
00:31:08,842 --> 00:31:11,498
[Practice] by yourself, right?

210
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,301
It 's just like you said.

211
00:31:15,301 --> 00:31:18,141
In the Kodokan too.

212
00:31:18,141 --> 00:31:24,117
There was a period when the practice in the dojo itself was stopped.

213
00:31:24,117 --> 00:31:31,411
But when the number of students decreased, it was OK to come to Kodokan.

214
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:39,508
However, we created phases and at first, training was done by oneself.

215
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:54,092
So what we have found over time is that the children's bodies have become more solid.

216
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:03,385
Until then, they always relied on their partner to work with them, and their balance, etc., has been dependent on their partner, 

217
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:11,613
but through training alone, their so-called core body axis has become more solid.

218
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:24,324
Also, for example, when they all did push-ups, they would have to do 10 times in total, but they only actually did it about 5 times.

219
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:34,295
But then that was the only training they could do, so they did 10 times on their own.

220
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:39,579
I felt like they could do it themselves.

221
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:44,898
So I don't necessarily think that the pandemic was had that negative an effect.

222
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:53,468
Of course, there were a lot of negative aspects, but I could see the positive aspects.

223
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,973
The kids are getting really solid through training alone.

224
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:08,069
Conversely, I believe that they have come to understand that judo cannot be practiced without an opponent, 

225
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:20,497
and that the importance of the physical person and the opponent has become clear to them, 

226
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,059
I believe that we were also able to provide such guidance.

227
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,919
Therefore, I think we have done most of what we can do in terms of action.
 

228
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:41,296
I am now in a different position, 

229
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:50,332
but I got tired after being in charge as the director of this dojo for three years, including the two years of pandemic.

230
00:33:50,419 --> 00:34:03,117
We need to think about a system for how to keep judo relevant for children,

231
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:14,530
in the old days, you only had to teach judo and children would come.

232
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:27,005
Without children, we are just normal human beings, and we are only meaningful as leaders when we have students,

233
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:40,664
I also felt the importance of the children's growth, and I was grateful for their presence.

234
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:49,561
I think that's why all the instructors were grateful to the children.
