they want to be
correct this is quite a standard but

32
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
correct this is quite a standard but
 

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,750
correct this is quite a standard but
this also means that they cannot be

34
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:22,760
this also means that they cannot be
 

35
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,550
this also means that they cannot be
massui because they're worrying about

36
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:25,560
massui because they're worrying about
 

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,150
massui because they're worrying about
getting it correct but this is what

38
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
getting it correct but this is what
 

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,190
getting it correct but this is what
basic training means it's learning the

40
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
basic training means it's learning the
 

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,390
basic training means it's learning the
form so while we learn the form we will

42
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
form so while we learn the form we will
 

43
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,229
form so while we learn the form we will
become

44
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:35,239
become
 

45
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,309
become
nervous and um in time we must overcome

46
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:39,319
nervous and um in time we must overcome
 

47
00:02:39,319 --> 00:03:12,750
nervous and um in time we must overcome
this so that massui takes place

48
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:12,760

 

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,430

so that's um an average speed that it

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:16,440
so that's um an average speed that it
 

51
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,110
so that's um an average speed that it
would be done at if you could do it

52
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
would be done at if you could do it
 

53
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,710
would be done at if you could do it
slower now and show each point as a as a

54
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
slower now and show each point as a as a
 

55
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,509
slower now and show each point as a as a
pause and then carry on to the next one

56
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:24,519
pause and then carry on to the next one
 

57
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:44,070
pause and then carry on to the next one
please

58
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
