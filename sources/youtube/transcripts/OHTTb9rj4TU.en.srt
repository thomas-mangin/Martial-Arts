1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,510

okay that should be where you go

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,520
okay that should be where you go
 

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,309
okay that should be where you go
you should not go into the

4
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:05,319
you should not go into the
 

5
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:07,510
you should not go into the
demoralization we gotta get past

6
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,520
demoralization we gotta get past
 

7
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,950
demoralization we gotta get past
that okay we're going to

8
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
that okay we're going to
 

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,749
that okay we're going to
learn what work has to be done by seeing

10
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
learn what work has to be done by seeing
 

11
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,589
learn what work has to be done by seeing
where i cannot work

12
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,599
where i cannot work
 

13
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,310
where i cannot work
where i cease to function and so it's

14
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
where i cease to function and so it's
 

15
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,390
where i cease to function and so it's
going to take you back to your basics of

16
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
going to take you back to your basics of
 

17
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,029
going to take you back to your basics of
course

18
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
course
 

19
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,429
course
but you are learning things more than

20
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:23,439
but you are learning things more than
 

21
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,509
but you are learning things more than
your basics and as i always say

22
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
your basics and as i always say
 

23
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,750
your basics and as i always say
your basics are actually part of the

24
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
your basics are actually part of the
 

25
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,830
your basics are actually part of the
problem

26
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
problem
 

27
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,790
problem
okay um so we're going to go back to the

28
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:32,800
okay um so we're going to go back to the
 

29
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,790
okay um so we're going to go back to the
to the live environment with the control

30
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
to the live environment with the control
 

31
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,830
to the live environment with the control
device and his

32
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:35,840
device and his
 

33
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,950
device and his
grip is predetermined okay

34
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
grip is predetermined okay
 

35
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,630
grip is predetermined okay
and we're also going to predetermine

36
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
and we're also going to predetermine
 

37
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,790
and we're also going to predetermine
that he has a

38
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
that he has a
 

39
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,510
that he has a
spinal displacement kind of pressure

40
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
spinal displacement kind of pressure
 

41
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,510
spinal displacement kind of pressure
okay

42
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
okay
 

43
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,430
okay
and we'll keep in there what we were

44
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
and we'll keep in there what we were
 

45
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,790
and we'll keep in there what we were
doing last time

46
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
doing last time
 

47
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,069
doing last time
so uh i am not going to predict before

48
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
so uh i am not going to predict before
 

49
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,670
so uh i am not going to predict before
he touches me

50
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
he touches me
 

51
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,349
he touches me
my technique i'm also of course

52
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
my technique i'm also of course
 

53
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,910
my technique i'm also of course
going to practice uh the

54
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:02,920
going to practice uh the
 

55
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,910
going to practice uh the
non-contestation of my jiu jitsu

56
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
non-contestation of my jiu jitsu
 

57
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,149
non-contestation of my jiu jitsu
so i'm not going to force the technique

58
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
so i'm not going to force the technique
 

59
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,630
so i'm not going to force the technique
i'm going to harmonize or reconcile yin

60
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
i'm going to harmonize or reconcile yin
 

61
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,990
i'm going to harmonize or reconcile yin
yang at all time but we're going to add

62
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
yang at all time but we're going to add
 

63
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,950
yang at all time but we're going to add
to that now

64
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
to that now
 

65
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,670
to that now
okay some some strategic elements

66
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
okay some some strategic elements
 

67
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,789
okay some some strategic elements
one is that within his

68
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
one is that within his
 

69
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,510
one is that within his
first to second step he is either

70
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
first to second step he is either
 

71
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,870
first to second step he is either
tilting

72
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
tilting
 

73
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,670
tilting
or i'm in the back okay so that would

74
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
or i'm in the back okay so that would
 

75
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,710
or i'm in the back okay so that would
make this

76
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
make this
 

77
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,030
make this
wrong one two he hasn't tilted till

78
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
wrong one two he hasn't tilted till
 

79
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,910
wrong one two he hasn't tilted till
three four

80
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
three four
 

81
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,510
three four
that would be wrong that will not

82
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
that would be wrong that will not
 

83
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,950
that would be wrong that will not
translate into a more live environment

84
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
translate into a more live environment
 

85
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,789
translate into a more live environment
so i could go here one i'm in the back

86
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799

 

87
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,069

or of course okay

88
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
or of course okay
 

89
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,950
or of course okay
okay i got i got two steps in which i'm

90
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
okay i got i got two steps in which i'm
 

91
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,550
okay i got i got two steps in which i'm
no longer in front of him

92
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
no longer in front of him
 

93
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,190
no longer in front of him
or his spine is already tilting okay

94
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
or his spine is already tilting okay
 

95
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,350
or his spine is already tilting okay
um second one any throw that you do

96
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
um second one any throw that you do
 

97
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,270
um second one any throw that you do
it can't be a momentum throw

98
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
it can't be a momentum throw
 

99
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,469
it can't be a momentum throw
so i'm not going to go like this

100
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479

 

101
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,470

there has to be some spinal displacement

102
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
there has to be some spinal displacement
 

103
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,110
there has to be some spinal displacement
i'm sorry some base of support

104
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
i'm sorry some base of support
 

105
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,150
i'm sorry some base of support
displacement

106
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
displacement
 

107
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,510
displacement
do you see that because that will

108
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
do you see that because that will
 

109
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,309
do you see that because that will
not not never translate into a live

110
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
not not never translate into a live
 

111
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,030
not not never translate into a live
environment

112
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
environment
 

113
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,229
environment
but it's low percentage okay

114
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
but it's low percentage okay
 

115
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,630
but it's low percentage okay
um do you understand what i mean by that

116
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
um do you understand what i mean by that
 

117
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,270
um do you understand what i mean by that
so

118
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
so
 

119
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,390
so
i'm not gonna go uh here and

120
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
i'm not gonna go uh here and
 

121
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,589
i'm not gonna go uh here and
he takes his role

122
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
he takes his role
 

123
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,070
he takes his role
i have to have some technique where i

124
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
i have to have some technique where i
 

125
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,270
i have to have some technique where i
take out

126
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
take out
 

127
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,710
take out
his base okay i either

128
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
his base okay i either
 

129
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,229
his base okay i either
com move it in a different vector

130
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
com move it in a different vector
 

131
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,430
com move it in a different vector
than his line of gravity or i prevent it

132
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
than his line of gravity or i prevent it
 

133
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,589
than his line of gravity or i prevent it
from moving with his line of gravity

134
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
from moving with his line of gravity
 

135
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,630
from moving with his line of gravity
does that make sense

136
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
does that make sense
 

137
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,990
does that make sense
okay so those those are my goals

138
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
okay so those those are my goals
 

139
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,190
okay so those those are my goals
as i go along

140
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200

 

141
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,470

a lot of times you can do this with a

142
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
a lot of times you can do this with a
 

143
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,790
a lot of times you can do this with a
coke projection it doesn't always have

144
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
coke projection it doesn't always have
 

145
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,790
coke projection it doesn't always have
to be that you're taking audrey's face

146
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800

 

147
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:22,309

okay so he's pushing

148
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319

 

149
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,670

okay okay

150
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
okay okay
 

151
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,830
okay okay
so um the question is

152
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
so um the question is
 

153
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,830
so um the question is
how do i not a momentum throw

154
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
how do i not a momentum throw
 

155
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,030
how do i not a momentum throw
and here i'm defining a momentum throw

156
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
and here i'm defining a momentum throw
 

157
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,470
and here i'm defining a momentum throw
where his line of gravity and his base

158
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
where his line of gravity and his base
 

159
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,589
where his line of gravity and his base
of support

160
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
of support
 

161
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,270
of support
are traveling along the same vector okay

162
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
are traveling along the same vector okay
 

163
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,229
are traveling along the same vector okay
so he's pretty mobile flexible strong

164
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
so he's pretty mobile flexible strong
 

165
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,750
so he's pretty mobile flexible strong
athletic

166
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
athletic
 

167
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,789
athletic
um let's just have you run out okay as

168
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
um let's just have you run out okay as
 

169
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,710
um let's just have you run out okay as
best you can maybe you land on your face

170
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
best you can maybe you land on your face
 

171
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,350
best you can maybe you land on your face
or

172
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
or
 

173
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,710
or
or whatever okay so we're gonna go here

174
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
or whatever okay so we're gonna go here
 

175
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,470
or whatever okay so we're gonna go here
and i'm know you see

176
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
and i'm know you see
 

177
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,270
and i'm know you see
okay so i have a couple choices

178
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
okay so i have a couple choices
 

179
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,830
okay so i have a couple choices
but all i have to do is make sure that

180
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
but all i have to do is make sure that
 

181
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,670
but all i have to do is make sure that
his line of gravity

182
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
his line of gravity
 

183
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,070
his line of gravity
and his face of support are not

184
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
and his face of support are not
 

185
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,710
and his face of support are not
traveling along the same vector

186
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
traveling along the same vector
 

187
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,110
traveling along the same vector
so first i have two means of doing that

188
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
so first i have two means of doing that
 

189
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,629
so first i have two means of doing that
the first means

190
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
the first means
 

191
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,749
the first means
is i stop his space of support

192
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
is i stop his space of support
 

193
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,150
is i stop his space of support
it doesn't travel with designer so it

194
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
it doesn't travel with designer so it
 

195
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,749
it doesn't travel with designer so it
can be on the same vector

196
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
can be on the same vector
 

197
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,710
can be on the same vector
but i don't allow it to go the second

198
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
but i don't allow it to go the second
 

199
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,710
but i don't allow it to go the second
means is i actually make the base of

200
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
means is i actually make the base of
 

201
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,590
means is i actually make the base of
support travel

202
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
support travel
 

203
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,710
support travel
on a different vector okay then

204
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
on a different vector okay then
 

205
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,590
on a different vector okay then
for each of those ways i have two ways

206
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
for each of those ways i have two ways
 

207
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,030
for each of those ways i have two ways
of doing it as well

208
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
of doing it as well
 

209
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,150
of doing it as well
i can either

210
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
i can either
 

211
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,270
i can either
block or displace his base of support

212
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
block or displace his base of support
 

213
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,510
block or displace his base of support
with my base of support

214
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
with my base of support
 

215
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,510
with my base of support
or i can coqject his

216
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
or i can coqject his
 

217
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,909
or i can coqject his
base of support onto a different vector

218
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
base of support onto a different vector
 

219
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:56,550
base of support onto a different vector
okay

220
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
okay
 

221
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,189
okay
so we'll be going i do got to do that

222
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
so we'll be going i do got to do that
 

223
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,469
so we'll be going i do got to do that
same technique

224
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
same technique
 

225
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,629
same technique
and when he comes around i step one so i

226
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
and when he comes around i step one so i
 

227
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,749
and when he comes around i step one so i
stepped on my heart

228
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
stepped on my heart
 

229
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,270
stepped on my heart
i step inside of his base

230
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
i step inside of his base
 

231
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,749
i step inside of his base
till i stop his bases support from

232
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
till i stop his bases support from
 

233
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,870
till i stop his bases support from
continuing

234
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
continuing
 

235
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,110
continuing
on with it this is a good one to know

236
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
on with it this is a good one to know
 

237
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,150
on with it this is a good one to know
when the guy turns

238
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
when the guy turns
 

239
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,550
when the guy turns
into you really sharp so he turns in

240
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
into you really sharp so he turns in
 

241
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,950
into you really sharp so he turns in
really sharp and then you step in

242
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960

 

243
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,189

the other one is i'll do the coq

244
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
the other one is i'll do the coq
 

245
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,950
the other one is i'll do the coq
projection

246
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
projection
 

247
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,430
projection
and his head will go this way but his

248
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
and his head will go this way but his
 

249
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,029
and his head will go this way but his
hips

250
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
hips
 

251
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,070
hips
will go that way you see okay so we're

252
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
will go that way you see okay so we're
 

253
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,430
will go that way you see okay so we're
doing

254
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
doing
 

255
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,189
doing
the technique and i should never have a

256
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
the technique and i should never have a
 

257
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,189
the technique and i should never have a
rep where he just would like that

258
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199

 

259
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,909

i'm always going to deal with that

260
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
i'm always going to deal with that
 

261
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,560
i'm always going to deal with that
basically

262
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:47,570

 

263
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,350

[Applause]

264
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360

 

265
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,390

okay here we go half positioning is also

266
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
okay here we go half positioning is also
 

267
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,749
okay here we go half positioning is also
key so this is not martial this is why

268
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
key so this is not martial this is why
 

269
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,590
key so this is not martial this is why
we handcuff people so they lose their

270
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
we handcuff people so they lose their
 

271
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,029
we handcuff people so they lose their
martial ability

272
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
martial ability
 

273
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,150
martial ability
okay so you should have awareness of

274
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
okay so you should have awareness of
 

275
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,950
okay so you should have awareness of
your hands

276
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
your hands
 

277
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,150
your hands
never been in the same plane okay

278
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
never been in the same plane okay
 

279
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,749
never been in the same plane okay
especially two planes but

280
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
especially two planes but
 

281
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,830
especially two planes but
here are three planes i have going

282
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
here are three planes i have going
 

283
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,110
here are three planes i have going
height width and depth they're in the

284
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
height width and depth they're in the
 

285
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,150
height width and depth they're in the
same plane

286
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
same plane
 

287
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,189
same plane
so i always have a sense

288
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
so i always have a sense
 

289
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,550
so i always have a sense
of covering my outer rim

290
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
of covering my outer rim
 

291
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,430
of covering my outer rim
in different planes okay so when i'm

292
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
in different planes okay so when i'm
 

293
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,070
in different planes okay so when i'm
doing

294
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
doing
 

295
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,990
doing
a tenshi nugget you see different planes

296
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
a tenshi nugget you see different planes
 

297
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:45,189
a tenshi nugget you see different planes
they come around different planes

298
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199

 

299
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,230

don't let them tie it again

300
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
don't let them tie it again
 

301
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,749
don't let them tie it again
never like this do not translate

302
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
never like this do not translate
 

303
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,350
never like this do not translate
you need to have an awareness of

304
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
you need to have an awareness of
 

305
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,350
you need to have an awareness of
covering your body and he's throwing

306
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
covering your body and he's throwing
 

307
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,629
covering your body and he's throwing
lots of stripes

308
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
lots of stripes
 

309
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,710
lots of stripes
and you're covering your body so you can

310
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
and you're covering your body so you can
 

311
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,430
and you're covering your body so you can
do your thing

312
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
do your thing
 

313
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,870
do your thing
always covered

314
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880

 

315
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:16,230

till first step

316
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
till first step
 

317
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,909
till first step
how how do i put him in well i have a

318
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
how how do i put him in well i have a
 

319
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,550
how how do i put him in well i have a
inward spiral at the outer spine like

320
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
inward spiral at the outer spine like
 

321
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,390
inward spiral at the outer spine like
oh straight places

322
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
oh straight places
 

323
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,390
oh straight places
even more awkward

324
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400

 

325
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,870

okay don't put your hands together it's

326
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
okay don't put your hands together it's
 

327
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,589
okay don't put your hands together it's
not marshall

328
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
not marshall
 

329
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,390
not marshall
no okay somewhere you are finding this

330
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
no okay somewhere you are finding this
 

331
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,950
no okay somewhere you are finding this
is this part here same thing

332
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
is this part here same thing
 

333
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,670
is this part here same thing
basic support line of gravity on the

334
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
basic support line of gravity on the
 

335
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,110
basic support line of gravity on the
same line

336
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
same line
 

337
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,029
same line
so just run out of it

338
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
so just run out of it
 

339
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,430
so just run out of it
you see so again i have the same thing i

340
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
you see so again i have the same thing i
 

341
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,749
you see so again i have the same thing i
can

342
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
can
 

343
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,070
can
have his i have to have his base of

344
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
have his i have to have his base of
 

345
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,270
have his i have to have his base of
support and

346
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
support and
 

347
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,830
support and
going in different directions so his i

348
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
going in different directions so his i
 

349
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,350
going in different directions so his i
can have his center going

350
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
can have his center going
 

351
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,950
can have his center going
forward then it'll work

352
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
forward then it'll work
 

353
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,869
forward then it'll work
because this center is going that way

354
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
because this center is going that way
 

355
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,550
because this center is going that way
when i pull this top down

356
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
when i pull this top down
 

357
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,589

easy to have his center going

382
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
easy to have his center going
 

383
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,470
easy to have his center going
in that direction because it's a slow

384
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
in that direction because it's a slow
 

385
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,990
in that direction because it's a slow

a line of support you have to be able to

396
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
a line of support you have to be able to
 

397
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,350
a line of support you have to be able to
feel that

feel that
 

399
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,710
feel that
so that you would not do what what i'm

400
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
so that you would not do what what i'm
 

401
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,430
so that you would not do what what i'm
seeing

402

do you get it so it's if if you're going

412
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
do you get it so it's if if you're going
 

413
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,829
do you get it so it's if if you're going
full speed

full speed
 

415
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,310
full speed
and the guy is going through wow you

416
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
and the guy is going through wow you
 

417
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,470
and the guy is going through wow you
might be able to get the cochlear nugget

418
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
might be able to get the cochlear nugget
 

419
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:34,870
might be able to get the cochlear nugget
but

420
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
but
 

421
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,670
but
at the slow speed that we're doing and

422
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
at the slow speed that we're doing and
 

423
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,110
at the slow speed that we're doing and
in guwaza

424
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
in guwaza
 

425
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,269
in guwaza
that is the wrong technique because you

426
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
that is the wrong technique because you
 

427
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,949
that is the wrong technique because you
don't have your center going through

428
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
don't have your center going through
 

429
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,750
don't have your center going through
so you're training yourself incorrectly

430
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
so you're training yourself incorrectly
 

431
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,310
so you're training yourself incorrectly
so

432
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
so
 

433
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,230
so
yes this is the key hon but this

434
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
yes this is the key hon but this
 

435
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,790
yes this is the key hon but this
that little thing is not real it will

not help you
you should be able to tell that so you

440
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
you should be able to tell that so you
 

441
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,829
you should be able to tell that so you
have to find

442
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
have to find
 

443
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,990
have to find
the the other things that you're doing

444
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
the the other things that you're doing

in here
see okay let's go okay so

448
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
see okay let's go okay so
 

449
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,269
see okay let's go okay so
you have some techniques where you have

450
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
you have some techniques where you have
 

451
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,829
you have some techniques where you have
uh bent the guy on his waist

452
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
uh bent the guy on his waist
 

453
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,110
uh bent the guy on his waist
as opposed to tilt him okay

454
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
as opposed to tilt him okay
 

455
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,430
as opposed to tilt him okay
oh wait techniques where the guys bent

456
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
oh wait techniques where the guys bent
 

457
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,389
oh wait techniques where the guys bent
over

458
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:16,399
over
 

459
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,710
over
his energy went here so his energy

460
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
his energy went here so his energy
 

461
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,470
his energy went here so his energy
should keep going forward

462
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
should keep going forward
 

463
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,990
should keep going forward
otherwise he won't be a yin yang

464

so now i go like this and then

468
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
so now i go like this and then
 

469
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,430
so now i go like this and then
i try to shout him back up so i could

470
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
i try to shout him back up so i could
 

471
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,710
i try to shout him back up so i could
take him backwards

take him backwards
 

473
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,110
take him backwards
that would be a uh one it's contestation

474
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
that would be a uh one it's contestation
 

475
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,069
that would be a uh one it's contestation
and it's not

476
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
and it's not
 

477
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,470
and it's not
young reconciliation so you have to

478
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
young reconciliation so you have to
 

479
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,190
young reconciliation so you have to
watch

a guy's bent over and then he goes ahead
and see regain his height

514
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
and see regain his height
 

515
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,069
and see regain his height
okay so maybe maybe you're doing uh if

516
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,079
okay so maybe maybe you're doing uh if
 

517
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,110
okay so maybe maybe you're doing uh if
not

518
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
not
 

519
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,150
not
he bends over and then you go okay what

520
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
he bends over and then you go okay what
 

521
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,269
he bends over and then you go okay what
do i do

522
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
do i do
 

523
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,150
do i do
i'm trying for uh kaiten but he stood

524
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
i'm trying for uh kaiten but he stood
 

525
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,350
i'm trying for uh kaiten but he stood
back up

526
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
back up
 

527
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,710
back up
oh okay then i go to the what if train

528
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
oh okay then i go to the what if train
 

529
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,829
oh okay then i go to the what if train
but in guwaza he has no prescription

530
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
but in guwaza he has no prescription
 

531
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,870
but in guwaza he has no prescription
placed upon him so if he's bending over

532
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
placed upon him so if he's bending over
 

533
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,590
placed upon him so if he's bending over
and energy is going forward she should

534
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:43,600
and energy is going forward she should
 

535
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,870
and energy is going forward she should
just keep going forward

536
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
just keep going forward
 

537
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,190
just keep going forward
okay so if i'm doing uh

538
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
okay so if i'm doing uh
 

539
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,269
okay so if i'm doing uh
i have the one where i don't bend them

540
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
i have the one where i don't bend them
 

541
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,670
i have the one where i don't bend them
forward

542
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
forward
 

543
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,509
forward
but sometimes there's a lot of momentum

544
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
but sometimes there's a lot of momentum
 

545
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,790
but sometimes there's a lot of momentum
that's going

546
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
that's going
 

547
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,470
that's going
a lot of momentums that go on that way

548
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
a lot of momentums that go on that way
 

549
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,470
a lot of momentums that go on that way
that's where your tent concludes

550
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
that's where your tent concludes
 

551
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,069
that's where your tent concludes
you see and then you have to crush your

552
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
you see and then you have to crush your
 

553
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:04,790
you see and then you have to crush your
center

554
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
center
 

555
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,829
center
so i'll show you what that is so

556
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
so i'll show you what that is so
 

557
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,670
so i'll show you what that is so
i'm coming around won't and i drop him

558
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
i'm coming around won't and i drop him
 

559
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,389
i'm coming around won't and i drop him
and then i catch him coming up if he

560
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
and then i catch him coming up if he
 

561
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,910
and then i catch him coming up if he
doesn't want to come up

562
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
doesn't want to come up
 

563
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,829
doesn't want to come up
then that's where i come into my other

564
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839

 

565
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,629

technique

566
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
technique
 

567
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,870
technique
but the whole time i'm not going to make

568
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
but the whole time i'm not going to make
 

569
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,670
but the whole time i'm not going to make
him go

570
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
him go
 

571
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,509
him go
down and then try to get him to come up

572
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
down and then try to get him to come up
 

573
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,710
down and then try to get him to come up
so i'm coming in here well he bent down

574
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
so i'm coming in here well he bent down
 

575
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,509
so i'm coming in here well he bent down
on me

576
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
on me
 

577
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,670
on me
don't try to shovel him back up find

578
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
don't try to shovel him back up find
 

579
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,110
don't try to shovel him back up find
your different find your different

580
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
your different find your different
 

581
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,509
your different find your different
techniques and just open it back up

582
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519
techniques and just open it back up
 

583
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,310
techniques and just open it back up
boom

584
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320

 

585
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,069

well next thing i want you to pay

586
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
well next thing i want you to pay
 

587
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,509
well next thing i want you to pay
attention to is

588
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
attention to is
 

589
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,350
attention to is
we're now going to go to this weird

590
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
we're now going to go to this weird
 

591
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,629
we're now going to go to this weird
thing

592
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
thing
 

593
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,910
thing
because we're not trying to do

594
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
because we're not trying to do
 

595
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,310
because we're not trying to do
techniques you got it

596
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
techniques you got it
 

597
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,790
techniques you got it
this is still energy energy that's

598
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
this is still energy energy that's
 

599
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,990
this is still energy energy that's
crossing

600
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
crossing
 

601
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,269
crossing
okay

602
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279

 

603
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,750

so if you feel like at first anyway

604
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760

 

605
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,790

it's because you're stuck in forms okay

606
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
it's because you're stuck in forms okay
 

607
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,750
it's because you're stuck in forms okay
it's still just energy energy is coming

608
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
it's still just energy energy is coming
 

609
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,470
it's still just energy energy is coming
in

610
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
in
 

611
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,590
in
feel the energy okay

612
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,600
feel the energy okay
 

613
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,069
feel the energy okay
let's go okay it's just a mind trick

614
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:20,079
let's go okay it's just a mind trick
 

615
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,430
let's go okay it's just a mind trick
it's just like a koan

616
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
it's just like a koan
 

617
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,389
it's just like a koan
it's it's it's your stuff on form that

618
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
it's it's it's your stuff on form that
 

619
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,509
it's it's it's your stuff on form that
you don't see the

620
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
you don't see the
 

621
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,750
you don't see the
the technique really what is let's say

622
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
the technique really what is let's say
 

623
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,710
the technique really what is let's say
he only grabs one of those at a time

624
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
he only grabs one of those at a time
 

625
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,550
he only grabs one of those at a time
what is that you see so really i get a

626
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
what is that you see so really i get a
 

627
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,470
what is that you see so really i get a
choice of which close to dirty i want

628
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
choice of which close to dirty i want
 

629
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,150
choice of which close to dirty i want
you're going to come around and do it

630
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
you're going to come around and do it
 

631
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,550
you're going to come around and do it
you see

632
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560

 

633
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,550

right all right and then you can also

634
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
right all right and then you can also
 

635
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,430
right all right and then you can also
uncross you could uh uncross the thing

636
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
uncross you could uh uncross the thing
 

637
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,189
uncross you could uh uncross the thing
so i come around this is

638
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:51,199

 

639
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,949

it's only crossed because your mind is

640
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
it's only crossed because your mind is
 

641
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,470
it's only crossed because your mind is
crossed okay

642
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
crossed okay
 

643
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,629
crossed okay
of course you since you have the cause

644
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
of course you since you have the cause
 

645
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,550
of course you since you have the cause
of dirty you you kind of ignore the

646
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
of dirty you you kind of ignore the
 

647
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,269
of dirty you you kind of ignore the
hands right and you're in here

648
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
hands right and you're in here
 

649
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,750
hands right and you're in here
so let's look at giugi nagio or it would

650
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
so let's look at giugi nagio or it would
 

651
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,750
so let's look at giugi nagio or it would
be coconutty going forward and where's

652
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
be coconutty going forward and where's
 

653
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,750
be coconutty going forward and where's
the base displacement on that

654
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
the base displacement on that
 

655
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,110
the base displacement on that
so his leg is gonna step

656
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
so his leg is gonna step
 

657
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,150
so his leg is gonna step
in the throat and my pushy is gonna go

658
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
in the throat and my pushy is gonna go
 

659
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,310
in the throat and my pushy is gonna go
on this stop

660
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
on this stop
 

661
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,670
on this stop
my is going to go boom and kick

662
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
my is going to go boom and kick
 

663
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,269
my is going to go boom and kick
that leg out

664
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279

 

665
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,910

so again i don't i don't want a momentum

666
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
so again i don't i don't want a momentum
 

667
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,550
so again i don't i don't want a momentum
throw

668
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
throw
 

669
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,150
throw
or he's ahead of me because he'll just

670
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
or he's ahead of me because he'll just
 

671
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,310
or he's ahead of me because he'll just
walk out of it

672
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320

 

673
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,910

so i stop his face

674
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920

 

675
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,470

displace his face with your face okay

676
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
displace his face with your face okay
 

677
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,230
displace his face with your face okay
here we go

678
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
here we go
 

679
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,870
here we go
okay so uh the original control device

680
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
okay so uh the original control device
 

681
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,790
okay so uh the original control device
was the iota-doty and spinal

682
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
was the iota-doty and spinal
 

683
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,990
was the iota-doty and spinal
displacement

684
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000

 

685
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,430

okay but some of you are

686
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
okay but some of you are
 

687
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,829
okay but some of you are
now taking away one of our control

688
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839
now taking away one of our control
 

689
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,150
now taking away one of our control
devices

690
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160
devices
 

691
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,269
devices
in that's a no-no because we're working

692
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
in that's a no-no because we're working
 

693
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,710
in that's a no-no because we're working
on our particular thing

694
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
on our particular thing
 

695
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,870
on our particular thing
and jiwaza let's use it as an

696
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
and jiwaza let's use it as an
 

697
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,750
and jiwaza let's use it as an
opportunity

698
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
opportunity
 

699
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,069
opportunity
to feel when the technique has changed

700
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
to feel when the technique has changed
 

701
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:08,870
to feel when the technique has changed
because it's

702
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
because it's
 

703
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,750
because it's
because the opening has been countered

704
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
because the opening has been countered
 

705
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,230
because the opening has been countered
uh

706
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
uh
 

707
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,990
uh
you're gonna this will be foreign to you

708
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
you're gonna this will be foreign to you
 

709
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,910
you're gonna this will be foreign to you
because you usually do what you're told

710
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
because you usually do what you're told
 

711
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,389
because you usually do what you're told
but you're gonna turn away from

712
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
but you're gonna turn away from
 

713
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,430
but you're gonna turn away from
detective turn

714
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
detective turn
 

715
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,949
detective turn
there you go you see now he's not doing

716
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959
there you go you see now he's not doing
 

717
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,470
there you go you see now he's not doing
the second prescription

718
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
the second prescription
 

719
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,629
the second prescription
so you're you're going to try to do this

720
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
so you're you're going to try to do this
 

721
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,629
so you're you're going to try to do this
technique he turns on you you this is a

722
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
technique he turns on you you this is a
 

723
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,350
technique he turns on you you this is a
no no

724
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
no no
 

725
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,509
no no
this technique is not here this is not

726
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:31,519
this technique is not here this is not
 

727
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,550
this technique is not here this is not
where

728
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
where
 

729
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,310
where
um any of the back outer kazushi

730
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
um any of the back outer kazushi
 

731
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,269
um any of the back outer kazushi
patterns are

732
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,279
patterns are
 

733
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,670
patterns are
the back our kazushi patterns have the

734
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:39,680
the back our kazushi patterns have the
 

735
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,430
the back our kazushi patterns have the
guy's base going forward

736
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
guy's base going forward
 

737
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,949
guy's base going forward
forward forward he can't

738
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
forward forward he can't
 

739
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,069
forward forward he can't
turn it so anyone who turns it

740
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
turn it so anyone who turns it
 

741
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,389
turn it so anyone who turns it
it's not going forward they're

742
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
it's not going forward they're
 

743
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,990
it's not going forward they're
countering that the movement

744
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
countering that the movement
 

745
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,189
countering that the movement
so you have to feel that okay so i go

746
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
so you have to feel that okay so i go
 

747
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,670
so you have to feel that okay so i go
and he turns on me right you have to

748
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
and he turns on me right you have to
 

749
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,310
and he turns on me right you have to
feel that technique

750
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320
feel that technique
 

751
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,749
feel that technique
you don't keep trying to do

752
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759

 

753
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,150

tenshi nage kokuhol it got counter

754
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
tenshi nage kokuhol it got counter
 

755
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,269
tenshi nage kokuhol it got counter
got you guys got it okay so

756

got you guys got it okay so
 

757
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,949
got you guys got it okay so
i'm trying for my technique you'll feel

758
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
i'm trying for my technique you'll feel
 

759
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,550
i'm trying for my technique you'll feel
it you just goes in on you

760
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560
it you just goes in on you
 

761
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,110
it you just goes in on you
just goes in on you just go around right

762
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
just goes in on you just go around right
 

763
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,110
just goes in on you just go around right
you have the same base

764
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,120
you have the same base
 

765
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,550
you have the same base
same base problem

766
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
same base problem
 

767
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,509
same base problem
so out here you turn okay keep going

768
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
so out here you turn okay keep going
 

769
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,829
so out here you turn okay keep going
around come in

770
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
around come in
 

771
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,870
around come in
find the base displace it okay here we

772
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
find the base displace it okay here we
 

773
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,440
find the base displace it okay here we
go
