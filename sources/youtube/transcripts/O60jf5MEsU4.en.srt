class and i noticed there was a just a
 

209
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,310
class and i noticed there was a just a
smear of ice

hard we trained
 

237
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,390

and i will always remember that to this
 

257
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,510
and i will always remember that to this
day

when it stops becoming fun perhaps we
 

269
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,749
when it stops becoming fun perhaps we
need a break

270
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
need a break
 

271
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,950

what you want out of your aikido life
 

277
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,550
what you want out of your aikido life
so i spotted the ice and the detail

278
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
so i spotted the ice and the detail
 

279
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,230
so i spotted the ice and the detail
on the map and no one else did

280
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
on the map and no one else did
 

281

00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
my friend was sitting next to me i knew
 

283
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,390
my friend was sitting next to me i knew
i was going to be training with him

284
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
i was going to be training with him
 

285
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,070
i was going to be training with him
because we had so much fun together we

286
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
because we had so much fun together we
 

287
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,550
because we had so much fun together we
trained a lot

288
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
trained a lot
 

289
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,110
trained a lot
or should i say beat each other up a lot

290
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120

 

291
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,390

but i spotted these the film of ice on

292
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
but i spotted these the film of ice on
 

293
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,189
but i spotted these the film of ice on
the mats

the mats
 

295
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,150
the mats
and i prepared tactfully

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160

 

297
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,589

so that's really a technique in itself

298
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
so that's really a technique in itself
 

299
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,909
so that's really a technique in itself

how do you notice these things
well i now know years on but the time

358
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
well i now know years on but the time
 

359

we didn't if you're a

360
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
we didn't if you're a
 

361
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,230
we didn't if you're a
fifth q or fifth dan listening to this

362
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240

 

363
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,350

we all have eyes

364
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360

 

365
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,790

we start with the eyes hopefully it

366
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
we start with the eyes hopefully it
 

367
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,870
we start with the eyes hopefully it
becomes

368
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
becomes
 

369
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,829
becomes
even more developed and becomes senses

370
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
even more developed and becomes senses
 

371
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,829
even more developed and becomes senses
so you sense things

372
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
so you sense things
 

373
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,750
so you sense things
but for the moment i'd like to just show

374
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
but for the moment i'd like to just show
 

375
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,990
but for the moment i'd like to just show
you a small experiment

376
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
you a small experiment
 

377
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,750
you a small experiment
of the eyes i'm i've placed

378
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
of the eyes i'm i've placed
 

379
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,949
of the eyes i'm i've placed
these cocktail sticks

381
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,910

just in my hand here let's just open

382
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
just in my hand here let's just open
 

383
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,829
just in my hand here let's just open
that gap up so you don't think there's a

384
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
that gap up so you don't think there's a
 

385
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,670
that gap up so you don't think there's a
trick

386
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680

 

387
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,190

any difference
 

391
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,110
any difference
if you look closely of course you will

392
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
if you look closely of course you will
 

393
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,750
if you look closely of course you will
see a difference

394
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
see a difference
 

395
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,550
see a difference
because there's one that i've made

396
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
because there's one that i've made
 

397
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,030
because there's one that i've made
different to the others

if the picture is wrong it doesn't need
to be a fifth down you can see it with

424
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
to be a fifth down you can see it with
 

425
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,750
to be a fifth down you can see it with
your own eyes

a normal human being but what you have

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,670
a normal human being but what you have
to do

430
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
to do
 

431
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,710
to do
is you have to look

432
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
is you have to look
 

433
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,269
is you have to look
and when you look across all the

434
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
and when you look across all the
 

435
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,550
and when you look across all the
students

436
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
students
 

437
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,829
students
let's say they're performing the same

438
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839
let's say they're performing the same
 

439
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,710
let's say they're performing the same
techniques

440
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
techniques
 

441
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,310
techniques
when the picture is wrong it jumps to

442
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
when the picture is wrong it jumps to
 

443
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,030
when the picture is wrong it jumps to
you

you
 

445
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,949
you
you don't have to search for that

446
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959

 

447
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,949

so when the picture is wrong

448
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959

 

449
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,110

and you spot it that's the time to

450
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
and you spot it that's the time to
 

451
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,150
and you spot it that's the time to
correct that person

452
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
correct that person
 

453
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,910
correct that person
