because i'm not pushing on him
 

69
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,470
because i'm not pushing on him
um he can't go around me so when i go to

70
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
um he can't go around me so when i go to
 

71
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,750
um he can't go around me so when i go to
when i'm going to push on him

72
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
when i'm going to push on him
 

73
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,750
when i'm going to push on him
he can go he can spin around he can spin

74
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
he can go he can spin around he can spin
 

75
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,550
he can go he can spin around he can spin
around that thing

76
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
around that thing
 

77
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,150
around that thing
i'm going to push on him and he just

78
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
i'm going to push on him and he just
 

79
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,830
i'm going to push on him and he just
spins around on

80
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
spins around on
 

81
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,150
spins around on
but when when he's pushing on me that

82
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
but when when he's pushing on me that
 

83
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,270
but when when he's pushing on me that
the the point where

84
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
the the point where
 

85
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,790
the the point where
where he's pushing on me because the

86
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
where he's pushing on me because the
 

87
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,270
where he's pushing on me because the
anchor so he's going to try to

88
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
anchor so he's going to try to
 

89
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,630
anchor so he's going to try to
turn around that elbow

00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640

 

91
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,949

all right

93
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,229

so something else is happening okay

94
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
so something else is happening okay
 

95
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,110
so something else is happening okay
some other things you'll see like uh

96
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
some other things you'll see like uh
 

97
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,990
some other things you'll see like uh
obviously

98
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
obviously
 

99
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,830
obviously
you can see that the tension in my body

100
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
you can see that the tension in my body
 

101
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,470
you can see that the tension in my body
as i do that he's pushing really hard

102
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
as i do that he's pushing really hard
 

103
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,270
as i do that he's pushing really hard
really hard

104
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
really hard
 

105
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,390
really hard
all you can see that is very relaxed

106
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400

 

107
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,869

nice very very pretty hard too short

108
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
nice very very pretty hard too short
 

109
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,710
nice very very pretty hard too short
it's very relaxed very relaxing

110
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720

 

111
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,949

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,990

it's it's him rebounding off the rock

115
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,589

so i'm just changing

116
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
so i'm just changing
 

117
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,680
so i'm just changing
where my ground vector is

118
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:32,690
where my ground vector is
 

119
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:44,830

for me the harder you push

132
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
for me the harder you push

okay when you do the key on that that's

134
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
okay when you do the key on that that's
 

135
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,830
okay when you do the key on that that's
what you're doing so

136
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
what you're doing so
 

137
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,190
what you're doing so
you have a one cross lateral extension

138
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
you have a one cross lateral extension
 

139
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,589
you have a one cross lateral extension

and
 

141
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,909
and
ground vector and then the technique is

00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
ground vector and then the technique is
 

143
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,030
ground vector and then the technique is
telling you to change it

144
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
telling you to change it
 

145
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,909
telling you to change it
okay or you're doing the keyhole and

146
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
okay or you're doing the keyhole and
 

147
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,430
okay or you're doing the keyhole and
you're doing it doing it inside the
