myself downward yes creates a vector

170
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,150
myself downward yes creates a vector
 

171
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,110
myself downward yes creates a vector
what I'm doing when I release is tilt is

172
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
what I'm doing when I release is tilt is
 

173
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,520
what I'm doing when I release is tilt is
to allow all of that vector to happen in

174
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:25,530
to allow all of that vector to happen in
 

175
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,690
to allow all of that vector to happen in
a purely vertical manner that's gonna be

176
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:29,700
a purely vertical manner that's gonna be
 

177
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,720
a purely vertical manner that's gonna be
the heaviest I can be do you do you

178
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:32,730
the heaviest I can be do you do you
 

179
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,920

understand if I'm leaning like this my

180
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:36,930
understand if I'm leaning like this my
 

181
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,470
understand if I'm leaning like this my
feet are not the heaviest but if I put

182
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:39,480
feet are not the heaviest but if I put
 

183
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,990
feet are not the heaviest but if I put
my mouse over my feet that's the

184
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
my mouse over my feet that's the
 

185
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,270
my mouse over my feet that's the
heaviest

186
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,280
heaviest
 

187
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,930
heaviest
okay

188
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:45,940
okay
 

189
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,260
okay
first drill relaxing allows me to sing

190
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,270
first drill relaxing allows me to sing
 

191
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,590
first drill relaxing allows me to sing
releasing allows me to sync tension for

192
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:55,600
releasing allows me to sync tension for
 

193
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,550
releasing allows me to sync tension for
some reason holds me up go vertical now

194
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:01,560
some reason holds me up go vertical now
 

195
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,890
some reason holds me up go vertical now
practice is same releasing and see if

196
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:04,900
practice is same releasing and see if
 

197
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,320
practice is same releasing and see if
we're sensitive enough to feel the

198
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,330
we're sensitive enough to feel the
 

199
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,650
we're sensitive enough to feel the
weight drop with an increased pressure

200
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:10,660
weight drop with an increased pressure
 

201
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,250

at my feet next row I'm out of it

202
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:14,260
at my feet next row I'm out of it
 

203
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,370
at my feet next row I'm out of it
so we maintain sensitivity go back in

204
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:17,380
so we maintain sensitivity go back in
 

205
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:23,730
so we maintain sensitivity go back in
and feel it out feel it release feel it

206
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:23,740
and feel it out feel it release feel it
 

207
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,830
and feel it out feel it release feel it
out okay this next drill I'm going to

208
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:28,840
out okay this next drill I'm going to
 

209
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,830
out okay this next drill I'm going to
specify the vector maybe for example

00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:33,840
specify the vector maybe for example
 

211
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,390
specify the vector maybe for example
when you were releasing you felt this do

212
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:39,400
when you were releasing you felt this do
 

213
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,050
when you were releasing you felt this do
you see that that the vector is towards

214
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,060
you see that that the vector is towards
 

215
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,670
you see that that the vector is towards
my heels it's back here when I release

you have conscious unconscious tension

318
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
you have conscious unconscious tension
 

319
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,699
you have conscious unconscious tension
that's keeping you locked in place okay

that's keeping you locked in place okay
and each drill we go on that's why you

322
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:28,600
and each drill we go on that's why you
 

323
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,920
and each drill we go on that's why you
need to do the drill so if you could not

324
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:31,930
need to do the drill so if you could not
 

325
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,579
need to do the drill so if you could not
feel the release here it's because you

326
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:35,589
feel the release here it's because you
 

327
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,410
feel the release here it's because you
don't have sensitivity to the tension

328

give it even extra you see this watch me
you start to release what do you think

494
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:20,820
you start to release what do you think
 

495
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,710
you start to release what do you think
is gonna happen I'm going to fall

496
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720
is gonna happen I'm going to fall
 

497
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,000
is gonna happen I'm going to fall
forward but watch me tense am i falling

498
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,010
forward but watch me tense am i falling
 

499
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,380
forward but watch me tense am i falling
forward no but if you pay attention this

500
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:33,390
forward no but if you pay attention this
 

501
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:40,510
forward no but if you pay attention this
body is wavering you see that

502

503
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,470

and I'm kind of like fly-by-wire wing

504
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
and I'm kind of like fly-by-wire wing
 

505

look at my grip notice the end of my
 

865
00:32:33,980 --> 00:33:03,400
look at my grip notice the end of my
sword is bouncing

866
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:03,410

 

867
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:14,210

you see the bounce of my man

868

869
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:27,690

your sword is the same relief

871
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:36,220

00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:45,860
what what is holding this what is the
 

875
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,600
what what is holding this what is the
sword once today well the longer end

876

wants to drop yeah I am taking the

878
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,090
wants to drop yeah I am taking the
 

879
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,980
wants to drop yeah I am taking the
energy of the swords gravity

880
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:58,990
energy of the swords gravity

gravitational pull and vectoring it down

882
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:02,899
gravitational pull and vectoring it down
 

883
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:07,389
gravitational pull and vectoring it down
to my feet so if the sword tip wants to

884
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:07,399
to my feet so if the sword tip wants to
 

885
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:12,579
to my feet so if the sword tip wants to
drop you see that what happens to the

886
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:12,589
drop you see that what happens to the
 

887
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:16,569
drop you see that what happens to the
other end it lifts but if I have my

888
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:16,579
other end it lifts but if I have my
 

889
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:22,599
other end it lifts but if I have my
weight there you can't drop do you

890
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:22,609
weight there you can't drop do you
 

891
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:23,760
weight there you can't drop do you
understand

892
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:23,770
understand
 

893
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,859
understand
you guys don't trust that and you take

894
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:26,869
you guys don't trust that and you take
 

895
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:31,990
you guys don't trust that and you take
your fingers and hold it up here okay so

896
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:32,000
your fingers and hold it up here okay so
 

897
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,349
your fingers and hold it up here okay so
I'm over here and lace comes here and

898
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:35,359
I'm over here and lace comes here and
 

899
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:46,010
I'm over here and lace comes here and
lace tended to pull the sword right out

900
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,020

 

901
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,220

so because I'm constantly vectoring like

902
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:50,230
so because I'm constantly vectoring like
 

903
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,639
so because I'm constantly vectoring like
that in the right way I don't need want

904
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:53,649
that in the right way I don't need want
 

905
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:58,920
that in the right way I don't need want
to grip in this drill in any stage you

906
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:58,930
to grip in this drill in any stage you
 

907
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,180
to grip in this drill in any stage you
can come at any stage go ahead whenever

908
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,190
can come at any stage go ahead whenever
 

909
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:07,110
can come at any stage go ahead whenever
you want you just pull it out ever you

910
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:07,120
you want you just pull it out ever you
 

911
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:15,120
you want you just pull it out ever you
want just grab it pull it do you

912
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,130
want just grab it pull it do you
 

913
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,390
want just grab it pull it do you
understand so when you go like this and

914
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:18,400
understand so when you go like this and
 

915
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,990
understand so when you go like this and
you have that tension usually you have

916
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,000
you have that tension usually you have
 

917
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,900
you have that tension usually you have
the tension because you don't have the

918
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:24,910
the tension because you don't have the
 

919
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,770
the tension because you don't have the
vectoring

920
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:25,780
vectoring
 

921
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,260
vectoring
like you think you do and you having to

922
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:28,270
like you think you do and you having to
 

923
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,260
like you think you do and you having to
control the sword through flight this is

924
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:31,270
control the sword through flight this is
 

925
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:34,530
control the sword through flight this is
you can don't control the sword blend

926
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:34,540
you can don't control the sword blend
 

927
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:40,590
you can don't control the sword blend
with the sword 11 of the storage can you

928
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:40,600
with the sword 11 of the storage can you
 

929
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,090
with the sword 11 of the storage can you
see that can you see okay so at the

930
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:45,100
see that can you see okay so at the
 

931
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,850
see that can you see okay so at the
bottom when I'm here I don't need to

932
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:47,860
bottom when I'm here I don't need to
 

933
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:54,000
bottom when I'm here I don't need to
grab it and shake it okay I go it's

934
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,010
grab it and shake it okay I go it's
 

935
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:59,990
grab it and shake it okay I go it's
loose oh it's little pulling down

936
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,000

 

937
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,550

why is it shaking now it's running into

938
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:05,560
why is it shaking now it's running into
 

939
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,670
why is it shaking now it's running into
the hand this yeah it's not because my

940
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:08,680
the hand this yeah it's not because my
 

941
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,910
the hand this yeah it's not because my
wrist bones are going you see that it

942
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:11,920
wrist bones are going you see that it
 

943
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,180
wrist bones are going you see that it
wants to spin the Cente used to throw

944
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,190
wants to spin the Cente used to throw
 

945
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,090
wants to spin the Cente used to throw
his sword and spin it I'm not going to

946
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:18,100
his sword and spin it I'm not going to
 

947
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,840
his sword and spin it I'm not going to
do that okay but that's what the sword

948
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:21,850
do that okay but that's what the sword
 

949
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,450
do that okay but that's what the sword
wants to do as it's going like this it

950
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:24,460
wants to do as it's going like this it
 

951
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,490
wants to do as it's going like this it
wants to go topsy-turvy

952
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:26,500
wants to go topsy-turvy
 

953
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,130
wants to go topsy-turvy
but I'm blending with the top part you

954
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:29,140
but I'm blending with the top part you
 

955
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,660
but I'm blending with the top part you
see I'm blending with

956
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:30,670
see I'm blending with
 

957
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,780
see I'm blending with
and when we all stop and we hit the

958
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:33,790
and when we all stop and we hit the
 

959
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,690
and when we all stop and we hit the
vector pulling hit stop and it bounces

960
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:36,700
vector pulling hit stop and it bounces
 

961
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,330
vector pulling hit stop and it bounces
off of that it's not me having a tight

962
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:39,340
off of that it's not me having a tight
 

963
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:54,560
off of that it's not me having a tight
grip right it's very loose loose loose

964
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:54,570

 

965
00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:13,500

this position I am NOT pushing you as I

966
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:13,510
this position I am NOT pushing you as I
 

967
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:17,070
this position I am NOT pushing you as I
move it drags that foot it's dragging it

968
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:17,080
move it drags that foot it's dragging it
 

969
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,260
move it drags that foot it's dragging it
you see and when I have all this vector

970
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:19,270
you see and when I have all this vector
 

971
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:25,710
you see and when I have all this vector
I can pick it up but now it's dragging

972
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:25,720
I can pick it up but now it's dragging
 

973
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,330
I can pick it up but now it's dragging
the foot I'll show you the difference

974
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:30,340
the foot I'll show you the difference
 

975
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,970
the foot I'll show you the difference
when I'm here like that

976
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:31,980
when I'm here like that
 

977
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,130
when I'm here like that
and I go like this as I pick it up

978
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:35,140
and I go like this as I pick it up
 

979
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,740
and I go like this as I pick it up
you're gonna do more movement that way

980
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,750
you're gonna do more movement that way
 

981
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:41,370
you're gonna do more movement that way
okay everything is over here it's over

982
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:41,380
okay everything is over here it's over

00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:55,110
there and then it picks up you see that
create tribes and we have this drove

992
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,120
create tribes and we have this drove
 

993
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,550
create tribes and we have this drove
already our feet right here like this

994
00:37:59,550 --> 00:37:59,560
already our feet right here like this
 

995
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,680
already our feet right here like this
you see that do you remember this drum

996
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:03,690
you see that do you remember this drum
 

997

you see that do you remember this drum
there should be no weight on that foot

998
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:06,190
there should be no weight on that foot
 

999
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:11,610
there should be no weight on that foot
you see I'm here my line of gravity is

1000
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:11,620
you see I'm here my line of gravity is
 

1001
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,030
you see I'm here my line of gravity is
not on the mid-foot which is why when I

1002
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,040
not on the mid-foot which is why when I
 

1003
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,849
not on the mid-foot which is why when I
take this other foot up you have to

1004
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:17,859
take this other foot up you have to
 

1005
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:21,539
take this other foot up you have to
see that you were tasked with putting it

1006
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:21,549
see that you were tasked with putting it
 

1007
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,269
see that you were tasked with putting it
on that mid-foot and now there should be

1008
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:24,279
on that mid-foot and now there should be
 

1009
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:26,999
on that mid-foot and now there should be
no tills you see I'm doing that okay now

1010
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:27,009
no tills you see I'm doing that okay now
 

1011
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:29,130
no tills you see I'm doing that okay now
we just widen it even more take the

1012
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:29,140
we just widen it even more take the
 

1013
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:34,650
we just widen it even more take the
first line way over there and now there

1014
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:34,660
first line way over there and now there
 

1015
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,739
first line way over there and now there
should not be tilt because I should have

1016
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:37,749
should not be tilt because I should have
 

1017
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:40,979
should not be tilt because I should have
all my weight on that mid foot this this

1018
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:40,989
all my weight on that mid foot this this
 

1019
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:44,329
all my weight on that mid foot this this
line with relaxation is over there and

1020
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:44,339
line with relaxation is over there and
 

1021
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:47,849
line with relaxation is over there and
not in the middle over here and then

1022
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:47,859
not in the middle over here and then
 

1023
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:51,749
not in the middle over here and then
that's okay try there's things you can

1024
00:38:51,749 --> 00:38:51,759
that's okay try there's things you can
 

1025
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:57,839
that's okay try there's things you can
check okay if I bring this over here you

1026
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:57,849
check okay if I bring this over here you
 

1027

1079
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:39,339

so if I'm over here even though that

1080
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:39,349
so if I'm over here even though that
 

1081

I could have weight on it yeah my mid

1084
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:46,460
I could have weight on it yeah my mid
 

1085
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,540
I could have weight on it yeah my mid
thigh my centerline is not actually over

thigh my centerline is not actually over
 

1087
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,849
thigh my centerline is not actually over
this thing you see that because if it's

1088
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:51,859
this thing you see that because if it's
 

1089
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:53,670
this thing you see that because if it's
over this thing there's nothing on that

1090
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:53,680
over this thing there's nothing on that
 

1091
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,329
over this thing there's nothing on that
yeah okay try it again what you have

yeah okay try it again what you have
been doing is releasing and using the

1094
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:01,790
been doing is releasing and using the
 

1095
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:07,210
been doing is releasing and using the
mass of your own body to release from

mass of your own body to release from
 

1097
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,180
mass of your own body to release from
other angles and aim it at particular

other angles and aim it at particular
 

1099
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:15,609
other angles and aim it at particular
angles okay but the mass of your body is

1100
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:15,619
angles okay but the mass of your body is
 

1101
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:20,170
angles okay but the mass of your body is
a force when you moved your head that

1102
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:20,180
a force when you moved your head that
 

1103
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,839
a force when you moved your head that
course was not comin straight down your

00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:22,849
course was not comin straight down your
 

1105
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:26,440
course was not comin straight down your
spine you did various things with those

1106
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:26,450
spine you did various things with those
 

1107
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,349
spine you did various things with those
are points of articulation to have it

1108
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:29,359
are points of articulation to have it
 

1109
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,079
are points of articulation to have it
aim and put more weight on that mid-foot

1110
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:32,089
aim and put more weight on that mid-foot
 

1111
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:35,380
aim and put more weight on that mid-foot
factor do you understand if you didn't

1112
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:35,390
factor do you understand if you didn't
 

1113
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,950
factor do you understand if you didn't
what happened you would not affect on

1114
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:38,960
what happened you would not affect on
 

1115
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,720
what happened you would not affect on
the big food you fall forward or you

1116
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:40,730
the big food you fall forward or you
 

1117
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,460
the big food you fall forward or you
fall backwards same thing would you

1118
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:42,470
fall backwards same thing would you
 

1119
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,240
fall backwards same thing would you
breath

1120
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,250
breath
 

1121
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,150
breath
same thing with the arms same thing with

1122
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,160
same thing with the arms same thing with
 

1123
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,020
same thing with the arms same thing with
the sword you were a me what was not in

1124
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:50,030
the sword you were a me what was not in
 

1125
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:54,099
the sword you were a me what was not in
and of itself at that mid-foot better do

1126
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:54,109
and of itself at that mid-foot better do
 

1127
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:56,740
and of itself at that mid-foot better do
you understand yes it didn't matter that

1128
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:56,750
you understand yes it didn't matter that
 

1129
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,260
you understand yes it didn't matter that
it was up and down because if I didn't

1130
00:42:59,260 --> 00:42:59,270
it was up and down because if I didn't
 

1131
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:08,529
it was up and down because if I didn't
aim it it wouldn't hold me off

1132
00:43:08,529 --> 00:43:08,539

 

1133
00:43:08,539 --> 00:43:15,829

so this time as he pushes I'm good he's

1134
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:15,839
so this time as he pushes I'm good he's
 

1135
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,220
so this time as he pushes I'm good he's
just energy and I'm going to aim the

1136
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:19,230
just energy and I'm going to aim the
 

1137
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:24,319
just energy and I'm going to aim the
energy into the back foot okay so you

1138
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:24,329

1459
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:34,440
we're finding through our technique okay
so yeah I don't have my key no but I

1460
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:34,450
so yeah I don't have my key no but I
 

1461
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:39,330
so yeah I don't have my key no but I
have the principles so it's the friction

1462
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:39,340
have the principles so it's the friction
 

1463
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,820
have the principles so it's the friction
right you see and now we're just turn

1464
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:41,830
right you see and now we're just turn
 

1465
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:44,820
right you see and now we're just turn
the friction you see it did I'm going to

1466
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:44,830
the friction you see it did I'm going to
 

1467
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:53,970
the friction you see it did I'm going to
turn it this way that way so even though

1468
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:53,980
turn it this way that way so even though
 

1469
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:56,580
turn it this way that way so even though
he's holding me it doesn't matter I was

1470
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:56,590
he's holding me it doesn't matter I was
 

1471
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:58,770
he's holding me it doesn't matter I was
still doing the same thing I'm still

1472
01:04:58,770 --> 01:04:58,780
still doing the same thing I'm still
 

1473
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:01,080
still doing the same thing I'm still
doing the same thing you see still doing

1474
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:01,090
doing the same thing you see still doing
 

1475
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:27,090
doing the same thing you see still doing
the same thing that taste right he's

1476
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:27,100
the same thing that taste right he's
 

1477
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:31,620
the same thing that taste right he's
strong right but the stronger you get

1478
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:31,630
strong right but the stronger you get
 

1479
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:35,400
strong right but the stronger you get
then the more he wait he's waking me

1480
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:35,410
then the more he wait he's waking me
 

1481
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:40,009
then the more he wait he's waking me
he's in and

1482
01:05:40,009 --> 01:05:40,019

 

1483
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:44,370

let's see let's do here have your back

1484
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:44,380
let's see let's do here have your back
 

1485
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,559
let's see let's do here have your back
foot rounded back foot rounded on the

1486
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:46,569
foot rounded back foot rounded on the
 

1487
01:05:46,569 --> 01:05:50,069
foot rounded back foot rounded on the
weight of your arm garrison okay but you

1488
01:05:50,069 --> 01:05:50,079
weight of your arm garrison okay but you
 

1489
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,980
weight of your arm garrison okay but you
see how to the way more friction now I'm

1490
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:52,990
see how to the way more friction now I'm
 

1491
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,660
see how to the way more friction now I'm
saying can you feel that put your weight

1492
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:54,670
saying can you feel that put your weight
 

1493
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:56,609
saying can you feel that put your weight
on the front foot rounded front you see

1494
01:05:56,609 --> 01:05:56,619
on the front foot rounded front you see
 

1495
01:05:56,619 --> 01:06:00,059
on the front foot rounded front you see
how like that it's lighter slightly the

1496
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:00,069
how like that it's lighter slightly the
 

1497
01:06:00,069 --> 01:06:02,150
how like that it's lighter slightly the
pull put your weight on the back foot

1498
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160
pull put your weight on the back foot
 

1499
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,220
pull put your weight on the back foot
okay and now because you have more young

1500
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:05,230
okay and now because you have more young
 

1501
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:07,680
okay and now because you have more young
going that way and I have y'all going

1502
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:07,690
going that way and I have y'all going
 

1503
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:08,430
going that way and I have y'all going
this way

1504
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:08,440
this way
 

1505
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,460
this way
pressure is fire right there you see

1506
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:10,470
pressure is fire right there you see
 

1507
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:13,440
pressure is fire right there you see
okay so I don't need my hands he's going

1508
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:13,450
okay so I don't need my hands he's going
 

1509
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:16,440
okay so I don't need my hands he's going
to be brakes on the back foot and I'm

1510
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:16,450
to be brakes on the back foot and I'm
 

1511
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:23,160
to be brakes on the back foot and I'm
gonna go okay feel the friction stay

1512
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:23,170
gonna go okay feel the friction stay
 

1513
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:26,269
gonna go okay feel the friction stay
like oh whoa

1514
01:06:26,269 --> 01:06:26,279
like oh whoa
 

1515
01:06:26,279 --> 01:06:29,250
like oh whoa
feel it it'll ground this foot use the

1516
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:29,260
feel it it'll ground this foot use the
 

1517
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,349
feel it it'll ground this foot use the
energy to drop that foot once that foots

1518
01:06:31,349 --> 01:06:31,359
energy to drop that foot once that foots
 

1519
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:39,710
energy to drop that foot once that foots
grounded then pull it go he's grounded

1520
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:39,720
grounded then pull it go he's grounded
 

1521
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:45,809
grounded then pull it go he's grounded
Brown get out here and I aim that

1522
01:06:45,809 --> 01:06:45,819
Brown get out here and I aim that
 

1523
01:06:45,819 --> 01:06:49,140
Brown get out here and I aim that
friction energy into the front foot so I

1524
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:49,150
friction energy into the front foot so I
 

1525
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:52,829
friction energy into the front foot so I
have it and I just keep it keep it

1526
01:06:52,829 --> 01:06:52,839
have it and I just keep it keep it
 

1527
01:06:52,839 --> 01:07:01,170
have it and I just keep it keep it
factory and eventually you it's not

1528
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:01,180
factory and eventually you it's not
 

1529
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,120
factory and eventually you it's not
anything it's not a hook or anything

1530
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:03,130
anything it's not a hook or anything
 

1531
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:06,120
anything it's not a hook or anything
okay you just keeping it keeping it

1532
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:06,130
okay you just keeping it keeping it
 

1533
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:10,950
okay you just keeping it keeping it
keeping it all right you starting to go

1534
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:10,960
keeping it all right you starting to go
 

1535
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:19,980
keeping it all right you starting to go
off

1536
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:19,990

 

1537
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:49,600

one hand he's on the back i feel the

1538
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:49,610
one hand he's on the back i feel the
 

1539
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:52,420
one hand he's on the back i feel the
friction it grounds me there and once I

1540
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:52,430
friction it grounds me there and once I
 

1541
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:54,240
friction it grounds me there and once I
have the connection I start to pull it

1542
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:54,250
have the connection I start to pull it
 

1543
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,290
have the connection I start to pull it
and you'll feel it going in

1544
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:56,300
and you'll feel it going in
 

1545
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:59,230
and you'll feel it going in
that's about all I get okay then this

1546
01:07:59,230 --> 01:07:59,240
that's about all I get okay then this
 

1547
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:06,760
that's about all I get okay then this
hand does it so it's not this it's just

1548
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:06,770
hand does it so it's not this it's just
 

1549
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:11,580
hand does it so it's not this it's just
to friction pulls wool wool and then

1550
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:11,590
to friction pulls wool wool and then
 

1551
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:22,329
to friction pulls wool wool and then
mid-foot now come in with the cross push

1552
01:08:22,329 --> 01:08:22,339
mid-foot now come in with the cross push
 

1553
01:08:22,339 --> 01:08:40,410
mid-foot now come in with the cross push
now

1554
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:40,420

 

1555
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:44,349

okay I still have the same friction well

1556
01:08:44,349 --> 01:08:44,359
okay I still have the same friction well
 

1557
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:47,140
okay I still have the same friction well
can you go out then you go and you go

1558
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:47,150
can you go out then you go and you go
 

1559
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:52,140
can you go out then you go and you go
out do you see on your she can't go out

1560
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:52,150
out do you see on your she can't go out
 

1561
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:56,169
out do you see on your she can't go out
do you see that different so he comes in

1562
01:08:56,169 --> 01:08:56,179
do you see that different so he comes in
 

1563
01:08:56,179 --> 01:08:58,899
do you see that different so he comes in
and we're connected can't can he go

1564
01:08:58,899 --> 01:08:58,909
and we're connected can't can he go
 

1565
01:08:58,909 --> 01:09:02,229
and we're connected can't can he go
forward no he can't go forward on yours

1566
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:02,239
forward no he can't go forward on yours
 

1567
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:04,479
forward no he can't go forward on yours
can you go forward yes you can but

1568
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:04,489
can you go forward yes you can but
 

1569
01:09:04,489 --> 01:09:07,059
can you go forward yes you can but
actually what you're using right you see

1570
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:07,069
actually what you're using right you see
 

1571
01:09:07,069 --> 01:09:09,220
actually what you're using right you see
that you're using him to come forward

1572
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:09,230
that you're using him to come forward
 

1573
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:13,629
that you're using him to come forward
and that's the class I have a connection

1574
01:09:13,629 --> 01:09:13,639
and that's the class I have a connection
 

1575
01:09:13,639 --> 01:09:17,439
and that's the class I have a connection
boom boom connection move it

1576
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:17,449
boom boom connection move it
 

1577
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:22,030
boom boom connection move it
I'm moving him move him do you see it's

1578
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:22,040
I'm moving him move him do you see it's
 

1579
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:26,829
I'm moving him move him do you see it's
really a wrestling move it's just that a

1580
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:26,839
really a wrestling move it's just that a
 

1581
01:09:26,839 --> 01:09:27,959
really a wrestling move it's just that a
distance

1582
01:09:27,959 --> 01:09:27,969
distance
 

1583
01:09:27,969 --> 01:09:38,019
distance
we're over here your version once we're

1584
01:09:38,019 --> 01:09:38,029
we're over here your version once we're
 

1585
01:09:38,029 --> 01:09:41,260
we're over here your version once we're
