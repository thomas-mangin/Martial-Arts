passing me can you
 

179
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:23,390
passing me can you
see you see that okay try

180
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:23,400

 

181
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,309

it okay so I'm going to pin this leg

182
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:27,319
it okay so I'm going to pin this leg
 

183
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,469
it okay so I'm going to pin this leg
right there you see so right there is

184
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
right there you see so right there is
 

185
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,270
right there you see so right there is
where that leg is pinned this is where I

186
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
where that leg is pinned this is where I
 

187
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,110
where that leg is pinned this is where I
transfer to to the head I transfer to

188
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,120
transfer to to the head I transfer to
 

189
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,469
transfer to to the head I transfer to
the head you see and now I bring his

190
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:39,479
the head you see and now I bring his
 

191
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,110
the head you see and now I bring his
Center forward and you can see like the

192
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
Center forward and you can see like the
 

193
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,670
Center forward and you can see like the
the grip it does come off at this point

194
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
the grip it does come off at this point
 

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,110
the grip it does come off at this point
and that's why I trade adhesion points

196
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,120
and that's why I trade adhesion points
 

197
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,070
and that's why I trade adhesion points
okay and so the

198
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
okay and so the
 

199
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,990
okay and so the

making you pinned you let go of the grip
 

203
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,110
making you pinned you let go of the grip
okay and now I'm on the head and you're

okay try it again as he's doing the
 

253
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,030
okay try it again as he's doing the
technique everyone's Mobility is a

254
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
technique everyone's Mobility is a
 

255
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,710
technique everyone's Mobility is a
little different but the Tactical

256
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
little different but the Tactical
 

257
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,509
little different but the Tactical
components remain the same so somebody

258
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:48,519
components remain the same so somebody
 

259
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,870
components remain the same so somebody
who's Less Mobile they'll be checked out

260
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
who's Less Mobile they'll be checked out
 

261

hey try it
again so on the suaza techniques you're

314
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
again so on the suaza techniques you're
 

315
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,509
again so on the suaza techniques you're
you just work on the gasi part okay so

316
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
you just work on the gasi part okay so
 

317
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,829
you just work on the gasi part okay so

okay um just like if I'm doing Eda we
 

323
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,829
okay um just like if I'm doing Eda we
know that it's a homolateral throw but

324
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:00,839
know that it's a homolateral throw but
 

325
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,790
know that it's a homolateral throw but
in suar Wasa it's not right he throws

okay if I if I'm doing that that
 

333
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,430
okay if I if I'm doing that that
technique right it's going to be a

334
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:12,440
technique right it's going to be a
