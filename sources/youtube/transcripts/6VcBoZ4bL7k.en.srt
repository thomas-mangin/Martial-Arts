1
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:16,720

okay so we're working on this dinging

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:16,730

 

3
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,370

[Music]

4
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:21,380

 

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:46,610

just work your basic

6
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:46,620

 

7
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,990

is that hard again hi

8
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,000

 

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:04,570

that's that keep the other hand alive

10
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:04,580

 

11
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,180

Joe don't have raised over here have her

12
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,190
Joe don't have raised over here have her
 

13
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,060
Joe don't have raised over here have her
go open there you see and then I come

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,070
go open there you see and then I come
 

15
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,389
go open there you see and then I come
around right this is where you would see

16
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:14,399
around right this is where you would see
 

17
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:16,520
around right this is where you would see
that little tilt that's where I start to

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:16,530
that little tilt that's where I start to
 

19
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,980
that little tilt that's where I start to
compress do you feel that and then this

20
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:18,990
compress do you feel that and then this
 

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:26,050
compress do you feel that and then this
yeah I start to reduce eye movement

22
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:26,060

 

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,100

boom and when we here start the little

24
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:30,110
boom and when we here start the little
 

25
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,320
boom and when we here start the little
tilt that is right there I start to

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,330
tilt that is right there I start to
 

27
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,600
tilt that is right there I start to
compress this hand starts to release

28
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:34,610
compress this hand starts to release
 

29
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:43,660
compress this hand starts to release
boom called cube Oh home there's the

30
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:43,670
boom called cube Oh home there's the
 

31
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,200
boom called cube Oh home there's the
tilt compress start to release this hand

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,210
tilt compress start to release this hand
 

33
00:01:47,210 --> 00:02:13,220
tilt compress start to release this hand
into the turn okay tilt compress release

34
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,230

 

35
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,320

the other hand is not there where we can

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,330
the other hand is not there where we can
 

37
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:22,740
the other hand is not there where we can
control is okay

38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:22,750

 

39
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,449

so the other hand is controls the

40
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:25,459
so the other hand is controls the
 

41
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:29,020
so the other hand is controls the
rotation but incrementally releasing

42
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,030
rotation but incrementally releasing
 

43
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,440
rotation but incrementally releasing
into the tech on not quite boiling but

44
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:32,450
into the tech on not quite boiling but
 

45
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:54,610
into the tech on not quite boiling but
this is there

46
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:54,620

 

47
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,960

okay so go ahead and go keep going and

48
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:00,970
okay so go ahead and go keep going and
 

49
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,210
okay so go ahead and go keep going and
don't turn your game you're not supposed

50
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,220
don't turn your game you're not supposed
 

51
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,420
don't turn your game you're not supposed
to do that you get it you you're not

52
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:07,430
to do that you get it you you're not
 

53
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,869
to do that you get it you you're not
turning you know where this technique

54
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
turning you know where this technique
 

55
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,789
turning you know where this technique
goes that you're turning for it that's

56
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:12,799
goes that you're turning for it that's
 

57
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,199
goes that you're turning for it that's
not where you're supposed to do okay go

58
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,209
not where you're supposed to do okay go
 

59
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:28,650
not where you're supposed to do okay go
don't turn me again

60
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:28,660

 

61
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,090

so if they're pulling your backwards

62
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,100
so if they're pulling your backwards
 

63
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:51,780
so if they're pulling your backwards
you're gonna just fall backwards

64
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:51,790

the problem here is not understanding

the problem here is not understanding
 

73
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,350
the problem here is not understanding
credit you think you're giving yourself

74
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:21,360
credit you think you're giving yourself
 

75
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,850
credit you think you're giving yourself
too much credit for how powerful your so

76
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:24,860
too much credit for how powerful your so

the guy comes in and some energies going

78
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:28,950
the guy comes in and some energies going
 

79
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,580
the guy comes in and some energies going
that way and then what you're

80
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:31,590
that way and then what you're
 

81
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,060
that way and then what you're
understanding is that you stop him and

82
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,070
understanding is that you stop him and
 

83
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,780
understanding is that you stop him and
then you're gonna turn him you see that

84
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:41,790
then you're gonna turn him you see that
 

85
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,230
then you're gonna turn him you see that
and then he's gonna get up or better yet

86
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,240
and then he's gonna get up or better yet
 

87
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,120
and then he's gonna get up or better yet
you pick him up and then you go up you

88
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,130
you pick him up and then you go up you
 

89
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,800
you pick him up and then you go up you
guys see that

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:50,810
guys see that
 

91
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:57,530
guys see that
you got it so he goes and was like my

92
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:57,540
you got it so he goes and was like my
 

93
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,270
you got it so he goes and was like my
energy going that way you see it's not

94
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,280
energy going that way you see it's not
 

95
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,010
energy going that way you see it's not
so easy right and if I had 75 pounds or

96
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,020
so easy right and if I had 75 pounds or
 

97
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,680
so easy right and if I had 75 pounds or
100 pounds on and forget about it you're

98
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:09,690
100 pounds on and forget about it you're
 

99
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,800
100 pounds on and forget about it you're
not going to stop him and do that so the

100
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:12,810
not going to stop him and do that so the
 

101
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,900
not going to stop him and do that so the
problem is different from what you're

102
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:14,910
problem is different from what you're
 

103
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,260
problem is different from what you're
thinking the problem is how do I get his

104
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:18,270
thinking the problem is how do I get his
 

105
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,820
thinking the problem is how do I get his
energy that's going that way to go that

106
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:22,830
energy that's going that way to go that
 

107
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,050
energy that's going that way to go that
way okay you know you want to be facing

108
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,060
way okay you know you want to be facing
 

109
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,830
way okay you know you want to be facing
that way

110
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
that way
 

111
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,690
that way
but you're doing the obvious oh I'm

112
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:29,700
but you're doing the obvious oh I'm
 

113
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,970
but you're doing the obvious oh I'm
going to stop it and then I'm going to

114
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:31,980
going to stop it and then I'm going to
 

115
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,080
going to stop it and then I'm going to
turn it no we're not going to stop it

116
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,090
turn it no we're not going to stop it
 

117
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,630
turn it no we're not going to stop it
and we're not going to make it go that

118
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:38,640
and we're not going to make it go that
 

119
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,120
and we're not going to make it go that
way we're going to create a path of

120
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,130
way we're going to create a path of
 

121
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,000
way we're going to create a path of
least resistance and it'll be on that

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,010
least resistance and it'll be on that
 

123
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,580
least resistance and it'll be on that
spiral and his energy will fall into

124
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,590
spiral and his energy will fall into
 

125
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,620
spiral and his energy will fall into
that okay so I'm going to show you how

126
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:48,630
that okay so I'm going to show you how
 

127
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,860
that okay so I'm going to show you how
I'm doing it so this is part of the

128
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:51,870
I'm doing it so this is part of the
 

129
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,170
I'm doing it so this is part of the
beginning is long we've started a turn

130
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,180
beginning is long we've started a turn
 

131
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,520
beginning is long we've started a turn
here you see that so his energy is not

132
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:58,530
here you see that so his energy is not
 

133
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,400
here you see that so his energy is not
purely going straight it's already

134
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:03,410
purely going straight it's already
 

135
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,370
purely going straight it's already
started that angle which ends up being

136
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:07,380
started that angle which ends up being
 

137
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,230
started that angle which ends up being
taken that way so I'm starting to

138
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,240
taken that way so I'm starting to
 

139
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,050
taken that way so I'm starting to
believe off energy you understand

140
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,060
believe off energy you understand
 

141
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,970
believe off energy you understand
and I starts with the lead-off energy

142
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:13,980
and I starts with the lead-off energy
 

143
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,060
and I starts with the lead-off energy
then I bleed off even more because I

144
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,070
then I bleed off even more because I
 

145
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,100
then I bleed off even more because I
move over there so I'm not holding

146
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,110
move over there so I'm not holding
 

147
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,470
move over there so I'm not holding
against his initial line of attack you

148
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:21,480
against his initial line of attack you
 

149
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,930
against his initial line of attack you
see that okay I get his balance here and

150
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:25,940
see that okay I get his balance here and
 

151
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,580
see that okay I get his balance here and
for other reasons I don't want him

152
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:28,590
for other reasons I don't want him
 

153
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,820
for other reasons I don't want him
tilting like we correct it already so I

154
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:31,830
tilting like we correct it already so I
 

155
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,940
tilting like we correct it already so I
compress his spine all right now what

156
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:34,950
compress his spine all right now what
 

157
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,720
compress his spine all right now what
you guys want to do is turn him don't

158
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:38,730
you guys want to do is turn him don't
 

159
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,990
you guys want to do is turn him don't
don't turn him and see there's a lot of

160
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
don't turn him and see there's a lot of
 

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,200
don't turn him and see there's a lot of
strength right here you see hey it

162
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,210
strength right here you see hey it
 

163
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,690
strength right here you see hey it
reaches its limit so I can't keep

164
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:47,700
reaches its limit so I can't keep
 

165
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,120
reaches its limit so I can't keep
gaining a position of disadvantage along

166

me turning to stay connected to him you
 

205
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,480

207
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,060

body now we'll tilt because there's

208
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,070
body now we'll tilt because there's
 

209
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,010

pressure on one side and there's
 

211
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,960
pressure on one side and there's
decreasing pressure on the other so the

212
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:05,970
decreasing pressure on the other so the
 

213
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,700
decreasing pressure on the other so the

so the reason why they're going face

so the reason why they're going face
 

481
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,310
so the reason why they're going face
down is well tactically that's a better

down is well tactically that's a better
 

483
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,440
down is well tactically that's a better
position for me okay but this takes more

485
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,300
position for me okay but this takes more
energy to turn around if I allow her to

486
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:13,310
energy to turn around if I allow her to

go backwards but to use her own

go backwards but to use her own
 

489
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,940

to get her to come around so no that
 

493
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,960
to get her to come around so no that
takes a lot more energy right you're
