1
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:07,167
We're heading for Shikoku once again.

2
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:14,167
This time, we're taking a Chinese flight bound for Beijing that stops in Shikoku.

3
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:19,167
So instead of getting off at Tokushima, we will stop at Takamatsu this time.

4
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:22,167
It is a little bit cheaper but we have to go all the way to Narita to take that plane.

5
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:26,167
So that's a new way for us, we are trying every available option to get there, none of them easy.

6
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:35,167
What is the meaning of "Aiki" in Aiki-jujutsu?

7
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:43,833
Aiki is the way to express Kokyu.

8
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:52,900
So Kokyu-ho means that through our Kokyu [breath], we can direct the kokyu of someone else right?

9
00:01:53,867 --> 00:02:01,967
Yes, the partner breathes out "To".

10
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:17,133
Humans ventilate via inspiration and expiration, which of these is the most vulnerable phase?

11
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:20,333
Inspiration is the weak phase.

12
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,800
We are strong when we breathe out.

13
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:31,667
In "Aiki", there is "Ki"

14
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:42,433
It means that during Kokyu, we will use the Ki of inspiration and the Ki of expiration.

15
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:50,000
The opponent's breathing.

16
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,967
Does it mean that we can steal the "Iki" [vitality] of the partner?

17
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:58,467
Yes, that too.

18
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:00,033
The opponent is then devoid of his Iki.

19
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,567
Yes, that is right.

20
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,533
It is the effect of surprise.

21
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:09,567
It is like when you point with the finger,
17
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:15,300it blocks the breathing.

22
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:12,733
We usually inspire from the nose and we expire from the mouth,

23
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:26,333
but when we run a 1000m, we usually inspire and expire through the mouth

24
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:31,233
This is what comes into play in Aiki.

25
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:34,567
We use that all the time.

26
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:40,433
We often see that in Daito-ryu, for example during demonstrations.

27
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:52,933
During a movement, we reach a state of unbalance, where the tensions are stopped, a state where "Iki" is stopped.

28
00:05:52,933 --> 00:06:00,733
This is what we call "Zanshin" [litterally: "the remaining spirit"].

29
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,667
Oh, in that sense?

30
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:14,667
This is because there is always the possibility of a counter attack.

31
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:30,267
There is also the case of "Tasu-dori", when several people come to attack at once.

32
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:37,533
In this case, we must take a guard straight away before the next person arrives from behind or who knows where.

33
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:45,033
So we usually head towards the opponent in order to protect ourselves from him.

34
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,333
That is the original meaning of Zanshin.

35
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:53,500
If you look somewhere else, it is not good because if someone else comes to attack, you don't see anything.

36
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,433
If I look at you, my field of view covers about 180 degrees, which means I can see on the sides too.

37
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:16,900
So if an attack is coming from the side, I can perceive it.

38
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:24,467
This is real Kokyu, and if you did not have that...

39
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:41,300
During training, we mainly work on grabs but in reality, we are separated from the opponent and it is at the moment when the attack arrives that we do the technique.

40
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,800
On Ikkajo and Nikajo, we practice on grabs, but starting from Sankajo, we start working on intention.

41
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:56,233
Yes, we allow ourselves to be grabbed, these are the fixed Kata forms.

42
00:07:56,233 --> 00:08:01,100
So we study and memorize forms, and little by little, we move away from the hands that grab in these forms. 

43
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:16,567
Then we switch to 2 or 3 opponents and learn to work in these conditions.

44
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:24,767
We learn to be grabbed, we learn to throw etc.

45
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:29,533
We learn to deal with these sorts of attacks in an Aiki perspective.

46
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:34,233
So the training becomes more and more vast.

47
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:43,933
Actually, the human being does not need to be taught that, it knows how to do it instinctively.

48
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:50,833
This is "Hon-no", the instinct of Aiki.

49
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:56,600
The one who dodges like that can avoid threats.

50
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,800
It is the same for animals, like cats right?

51
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Yes

52
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,933
Humans belong to the animal kingdom, and animals have instincts.

53
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:13,367
In Aiki, this instinct is the Ki.

54
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:17,433
But this does not show during training right?

55
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:23,167
Of course it does! If it didn't, we could not do it. 

56
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:29,200
I will show you tomorrow.

57
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:37,133
The next question is: "In which sense was the word "Aiki" used in the old times?"

58
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:45,300
We just spoke about that right?

59
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:51,867
It is hard to know what people were feeling in the ancient times. 

60
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:57,733
Yes, during the warring states period, it must have been very different, and then different again in the Edo period.

61
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:12,067
It is difficult to compare the sword work of old Budo with today's techniques that make use of riffles or missiles. 

62
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:21,667
It was very different in terms of distance for example.

63
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:27,867
It is a problem of period.

64
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:32,533
Now there are riffles but before there were bows and arrows.

65
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:38,234
When we invented the bow and arrows, we had to invent the armor to protect against them.

66
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:43,601
The problem was to figure out how to reach a man when he was mounted on a horse.

67
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:55,267
Shooting at him was useless because he had a scale armor, arrows couldn't get through.

68
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:59,500
However, you could shoot at the horse; that would work,

69
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:14,033
the horse would fall.

70
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:17,300
So the problematic is that of weaponry right?

71
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,100
Yes, Aiki developed according to that.

72
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:32,400
Can we find the concept of "Aiki" in other Budo than Aikido and Daito-ryu?

73
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,867
Of course,
70
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:43,367but it can't be seen clearly.

74
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:47,433
It is a problem of period but Aiki is really present.

75
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:51,133
These days we talk more in terms of Kokyu and breathing.

76
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,800
The Kiai in Kendo is the same thing.

77
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The fact of getting out of the way is Aiki.

78
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Of course, in Kendo nowadays, we mainly notice the speed.

79
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,900
This hand motion, for example, is typical of the current times.

80
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,267
But this is only because we use Shinai [bamboo sticks] that you can do that.

81
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:15,767
Before, with a real sword, you could not fool around like that.

82
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:24,567
So you would not point towards the other, the sword would be used in a more vertical manner, with a high guard, so that you could "give it back" [in the sense of Kokyu described before].

83
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:36,667
This is why we used to train with big logs of wood, because it did not last a minute, but 2 or 3.

84
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:47,000
This is why the high "Hasso-kamae"-type guards were invented.

85
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:59,700
The techniques of Sankajo and Yonkajo come from there.

86
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,933
These movements are the reflection of these guards.

87
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:07,800
And this is how you control the other.

88
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:14,367
We control in synergy the wrists, the elbow, and the bone structure of the shoulder.

89
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,367
These are the techniques beyond Sankajo.

90
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:18,833
They must be seen as sword techniques.

91
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,433
Yes.

92
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,233
Style is not what matters, the content is important.

93
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:28,067
It is not because you imitate the form that it is good.

94
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:33,567
If you don't understand the essence, it is not good.

95
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:41,233
If you don't lock the movement, you get hit.

96
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:49,933
This is "Kaeshi-waza" [counter techniques], this is Aiki.

97
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:56,600
People think that Aiki is a technique of "doing",

98
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:06,700
but if there is a technique, Ura is the throw back of that technique. 

99
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:14,533
"Kaeshi", "to give back", is really the Ura of that technique,

100
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:21,367
and Aiki is the Ura of a technique.

101
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:37,233
If you know how to do Sankajo, then you can do that.

102
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:49,033
Before we did not give Sandan [level sanctionign the knowledge of Sankajo] as easily and openly as that.

103
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,933
Nowadays, everybody gets to 7th of 8th Dan.

104
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:57,933
There used to be "Chuden" [advanced techniques] and "Okuden" [inner techniques].

105
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:02,833
This is a fundamental change.

106
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:09,454
We used to say "Chuden will be unveiled but the secrets [Okuden] will be well kept".

107
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,487
It was a bit different wasn't it?
