31
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,029
ski Kamai and we're in Josh's range
remember when we talked about um four

32
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
remember when we talked about um four
 

33
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,910
remember when we talked about um four
and five we talked about that the ideal

34
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
and five we talked about that the ideal
 

35
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,229
and five we talked about that the ideal
would be this because it requires very

36
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
would be this because it requires very
 

37
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,430
would be this because it requires very
little for me um however if I'm in a

38
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:56,440
little for me um however if I'm in a
 

39
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,869
little for me um however if I'm in a
panick state I'm probably not going to

40
00:00:57,869 --> 00:00:57,879
panick state I'm probably not going to
 

41
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,470
panick state I'm probably not going to
do something so refined so I'm also very

42
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
do something so refined so I'm also very
 

43
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,150
do something so refined so I'm also very
likely to just do this in a panicked

44
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
likely to just do this in a panicked
 

45
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,109
likely to just do this in a panicked
State now in form two um the UK is just

46
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:08,119
State now in form two um the UK is just
 

47
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:10,230
State now in form two um the UK is just
coming in now of course we could or

48
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
coming in now of course we could or
 

49
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,030
coming in now of course we could or
sorry cyto senses to my my six um so we

50
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,040
sorry cyto senses to my my six um so we
 

51
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,910
sorry cyto senses to my my six um so we
could um have Josh go back after this

52
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:16,920
could um have Josh go back after this
 

53
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,550
could um have Josh go back after this
right so I could go like this and Josh

54
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
right so I could go like this and Josh
 

55
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,950
right so I could go like this and Josh
could hop back and he could use the

56
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:19,960
could hop back and he could use the
 

57
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,870
could hop back and he could use the
jodon guch in order to do that right um

58
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
jodon guch in order to do that right um
 

59
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,550
jodon guch in order to do that right um
but in this he's going to be coming in

60
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
but in this he's going to be coming in
 

61
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,469
but in this he's going to be coming in
so maybe his expectations are that I'm

62
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
so maybe his expectations are that I'm
 

63
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,030
so maybe his expectations are that I'm
going to hop back and then he's going to

64
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:28,040
going to hop back and then he's going to
 

65
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,990
going to hop back and then he's going to
chase me down and and and come get me

66
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
chase me down and and and come get me
 

67
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,510
chase me down and and and come get me
that jodan gu huge but what I do is I

68
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:32,520
that jodan gu huge but what I do is I
 

69
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,789
that jodan gu huge but what I do is I
very quickly am able to fire off a chusi

70
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
very quickly am able to fire off a chusi
 

71
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,030
very quickly am able to fire off a chusi
so as he comes in here I fire this chusi

72
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
so as he comes in here I fire this chusi
 

73
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,149
so as he comes in here I fire this chusi
off okay so what Josh does is he doesn't

74
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
off okay so what Josh does is he doesn't
 

75
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,270
off okay so what Josh does is he doesn't
have time to make adequate distance and

76
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:42,280
have time to make adequate distance and
 

77
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,350
have time to make adequate distance and
get out of the range of that so he just

78
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,360
get out of the range of that so he just
 

79
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,550
get out of the range of that so he just
uses the transition of jodan Sho kind of

80
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
uses the transition of jodan Sho kind of
 

81
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,590
uses the transition of jodan Sho kind of
like you would in UK Nash and he comes

82
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:48,600
like you would in UK Nash and he comes
 

83
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,910
like you would in UK Nash and he comes
off to the side right so as I fire in he

84
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
off to the side right so as I fire in he
 

85
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,789
off to the side right so as I fire in he
gets off to the side okay now he's going

86
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:53,799
gets off to the side okay now he's going
 

87
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,029
gets off to the side okay now he's going
to launch the rest of that jodon guch

88
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:56,039
to launch the rest of that jodon guch
 

89
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,429
to launch the rest of that jodon guch
but because he's close he's not gonna go

90
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
but because he's close he's not gonna go
 

91
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,830
but because he's close he's not gonna go
to my head he's just gonna go to my leg

92
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840
to my head he's just gonna go to my leg
 

93
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,350
to my head he's just gonna go to my leg
because we're close quarters and we see

94
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,360
because we're close quarters and we see
 

95
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,230
because we're close quarters and we see
that last form too that we go to this

96
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
that last form too that we go to this
 

97
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,230
that last form too that we go to this
low position and last form the way I

98
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
low position and last form the way I
 

99
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,350
low position and last form the way I
dealt with it was I went back like this

100
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,360
dealt with it was I went back like this
 

101
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,270
dealt with it was I went back like this
okay but in this form it's going to take

102
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,280
okay but in this form it's going to take
 

103
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,389
okay but in this form it's going to take
too much time because as I'm turning and

104
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
too much time because as I'm turning and
 

105
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,150
too much time because as I'm turning and
stepping and all this he's likely to get

106
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
stepping and all this he's likely to get
 

107
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,190
stepping and all this he's likely to get
me before I'm able to get there so all I

108
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,200
me before I'm able to get there so all I
 

109
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,869
me before I'm able to get there so all I
do is I turn my weapon over right here

110
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:15,879
do is I turn my weapon over right here
 

111
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,750
do is I turn my weapon over right here
so as he goes boom I turn my weapon over

112
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
so as he goes boom I turn my weapon over
 

113
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,190
so as he goes boom I turn my weapon over
right here okay now my front is open to

114
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
right here okay now my front is open to
 

115
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,030
right here okay now my front is open to
him and so as my front's open he just

116
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
him and so as my front's open he just
 

117
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,390
him and so as my front's open he just
subz comes in there I clear that away

118
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:25,400
subz comes in there I clear that away
 

119
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,790
subz comes in there I clear that away
and I come here to the side and that's

120
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
and I come here to the side and that's
 

121
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,110
and I come here to the side and that's
the whole form okay so basically What's

122
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
the whole form okay so basically What's
 

123
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,110
the whole form okay so basically What's
Happening Here is I'm caught a little

124
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
Happening Here is I'm caught a little
 

125
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,030
Happening Here is I'm caught a little
unaware mentally so I have a panicked

126
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
unaware mentally so I have a panicked
 

127
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,790
unaware mentally so I have a panicked
reaction but I am quickly able to shoot

128
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:35,800
reaction but I am quickly able to shoot
 

129
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,309
reaction but I am quickly able to shoot
back in with that chusi and as I do Josh

130
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
back in with that chusi and as I do Josh
 

131
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,630
back in with that chusi and as I do Josh
slides right by that like an UK Nash now

132
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
slides right by that like an UK Nash now
 

133
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,190

that's generally the way site though
 

155
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,830
that's generally the way site though
since I shows it I don't have to do a
