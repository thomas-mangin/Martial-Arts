1
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:52,594
When did you first encounter Budo?

2
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,013
When I was a small child.

3
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,849
People before the Second World War all did.

4
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,393
They started practice in primary school.

5
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,396
Furthermore, in my family a style of archery was transmitted.

6
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:10,153
At the back of our house there was an impressive makiwara.

7
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:16,952
I had the red and black bow that belonged to my father when he was as a child

8
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:23,667
and I learned the basics with it.

9
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,168
That was in  your own home?

10
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,044
In our house.

11
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,379
It was always like that.

12
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:34,428
The style was called Heki-Ryu Chikurin-ha Ban-pa

13
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,722
It is a very rare school.

14
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,474
It was taught in Tsushima to the upper class Samurai

15
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,311
who earned more than 500 koku of rice per year.

16
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,272
Although we had a shooting range in our home,

17
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,274
we didn't accept outside students.

18
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,527
It was part of our family education.

19
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,070
Everybody used to do this.

20
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,071
Only at home.

21
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,072
Yes, at home.

22
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,826
You had a dojo in your house

23
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,162
and that's where you'd practice.

24
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,163
The same is true for horsemanship.

25
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:05,000
A proper samurai would have a stable and practice there.

26
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,795
You wouldn't have to go to school for that.

27
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,590
Of course there are also things that you go to school for.

28
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,216
Was this in Tokyo?

29
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,177
Tokyo, in Jyugaoka.

30
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,806
I was born in the University of Tokyo hospital,

31
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,224
when it was still in Nishikatamachi.

32
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,353
My father was at the Tokyo Imperial University at that time.

33
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:28,565
In 1933 we moved to Jiyugaoka.

34
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:33,862
The house was large and Jiyugaoka at that time was still countryside.

35
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:39,743
I started to practice with the sword in primary school

36
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,873
and when I was a student I also practiced Karate with Funakoshi Gichin Sensei.

37
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,166
That was Shotokan-ryu.

38
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,167
Shotokan.

39
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,252
This is how people called it.

40
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,796
Sensei did not call it like that.

41
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,257
Shoto was Funakoshi Gichin Sensei's pen name.

42
00:02:56,051 --> 00:03:00,764
It is the same kanji as the one used for the Shoto district in Shibuya.

43
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,893
Shoto means “the wind rustling in the pine needles sounds like waves”.

44
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,604
Did you meet Funakoshi Sensei?

45
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,106
Yes, many times.

46
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:14,945
When Funakoshi Sensei went home from the Dojo, I also went to see him off two or three times.

47
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:20,659
What was your motivation for entering the Ueshiba Dojo?

48
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,537
I had known about it since childhood.

49
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,415
I'd often hear about it during the war,

50
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,418
when I was in 3rd or 4th grade.

51
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,673
Many famous people were studying this exceptional Budo.

52
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:40,887
Yano Ichiro, the former president of Dai-Ichi Seimei, was a close friend of my father.

53
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:49,229
He had started Kendo as a child at Hibiya High School and did it all the way through and Tokyo University.

54
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:56,236
then he became the chairman of the Businessmen’s Association and he was also holding the highest degree (Hanshi) of the Butokukai.

55
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:02,367
Mr Yano said about O Sensei that

56
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:08,415
“Compared to Ueshiba Morihei Sensei I am like a baby”

57
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,210
That's what I heard as a child.

58
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,297
Then when I went to Manchuria in 1941,

59
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,216
It was the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Manchu state.

60
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,552
There was a meeting of Budoka from all  over Japan.

61
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:26,475
There was a large demonstration at the Hall of Martial Arts in front of the Last Emperor of China.

62
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,520
I heard that the demonstration that Ueshiba Sensei gave that time was incredible.

63
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,606
I was supposed to attend too,

64
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,568
but my mother and my sister talked too much and we missed it.

65
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,903
But my cousin saw it

66
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,572
How old were you?

67
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,615
I was twelve.

68
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,034
From that point, things became difficult because of the war.

69
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:48,497
A short while after the topic came up again

70
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:53,668
during the spring break at Waseda University Karate Club.

71
00:04:54,211 --> 00:05:02,928
There were talks about a famous master called Ueshiba.

72
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:07,015
That Admiral Takeshita was a patron of his,

73
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,811
and that he could throw foreign officers in the blink of an eye.

74
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:16,566
Harada Mitsusuke who is in London now

75
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:25,200
and Ōshima Tsutomu who is now in America were also there when we talked about it.

76
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,578
Mr Takeda, who was the captain at the time said:

77
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:36,336
“Now that you mention it, a relative of mine did the illustrations for the book on Budo by Ueshiba-Sensei.”

78
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:42,551
I forgot her name, but I knew her well.

79
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:47,305
He said he could get me the dōjō’s address if was interested.

80
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,307
It was is Wakamatsu 102.

81
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,268
It was a short walk from Waseda University.

82
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,686
The same place as today's Hombu Dojo?

83
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:58,400
Yes, nowadays' Wakamatsu-cho 17-18, but it used to be number 102.

84
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:04,114
Did you need a guarantor to sign up?

85
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,575
No, it was already after the war.

86
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:14,332
Generally there were too few people to even make up a dojo.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,253
So you would just have to go visit to be admitted.

88
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:23,258
Were there still refugees living in the dojo?

89
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,719
There were, for another 3 or 4 years.

90
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,680
It wasn't really a shelter, just one family.

91
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,642
From the 80 tatamis, 20 were partitioned off,

92
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,394
and they lived on these 20 twenty tatamis.

93
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:40,191
What was the practice schedule like?

94
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,820
Practice was from Monday to Saturday.

95
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,364
In the morning from 6:30 am to 7:30 am,

96
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,117
and the evening one was from 6:30 pm to 7:30 pm, that was it.

97
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,245
Then you could practice for yourself freely for the whole day.

98
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,707
Because Kisshomaru Sensei was employed and had to go to work.

99
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,710
It was because there were only 5 or 6 students,

100
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,796
and big corporations no longer subsidized the dojo.

101
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,175
It wasn't that kind of time anymore.

102
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:10,388
Could you tell us about O Sensei's whereabouts at the time?

103
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:19,439
O Sensei was always on the move between Iwama, Tokyo, and other places.

104
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,944
When he went to the Kansai Area he would come back to Tokyo and then continue to Iwama.

105
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:30,116
Then he would come back to Tokyo and go to Kansai again.

106
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:36,831
Suita in Osaka, Tanabe in Wakayama, Hikitsuchi Michio’s dōjō in Shingu.

107
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,208
That’s what he did all the time.

108
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:43,797
When you started, was it already called "Aikido"?

109
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,675
When I was admitted it was not called that yet

110
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,176
It was called “Aiki-Budo”.

111
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,973
There was no official name.

112
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:58,144
When I was a student at Waseda university,

113
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,314
I wanted to create a club.

114
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:07,821
Ueshiba Sensei started to give seminars at his dojo.

115
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,617
I wanted to invite O Sensei to teach like that.

116
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:19,124
But in order to advertise this we needed the name of a professor,

117
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:24,004
so we asked Mr Tomiki.

118
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,173
To call it “Aiki-Budō” was problematic because of the times,

119
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,760
so I chose “Aikido”.

120
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,555
But even before then it was called “Aikidō”.

121
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:38,518
Under the Butokukai, it was practiced in the section called “Aikidō”.

122
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:43,523
Wasn't "Aikido" meant as an umbrella term to gather different empty-handed system?

123
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,028
No, that was not the case, it was Ueshiba Sensei’s Aikido.

124
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:56,161
My cousin brought me the programme of the 1942 demonstration in Manchuria,

125
00:08:56,161 --> 00:09:01,332
I lost it but it was billed as “Ueshiba-Ryu Aikijutsu”.

126
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,836
This name also appears in a novel.

127
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,964
Some kind of children’s fiction.

128
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,969
Guillaume started Aikido in André Nocquet's group, did you know Nocquet?

129
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:21,853
When Mr Nocquet joined, I think I was in my mid 20s.

130
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:25,231
Mr Nocquet was around 40.

131
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,694
Before Mr Nocquet came,

132
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:35,075
Mr Mochizuki Minoru had been to France in 1951,

133
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,119
invited by Sakurazawa Nyoichi.

134
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,622
Over there he called himself "George Ohsawa"

135
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:44,167
The George Ohsawa of macrobiotics.

136
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:58,139
It all started when Mr Mochizuki was invited to France by him.

137
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,102
The year after, Abe Tadashi went.

138
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,146
It was in 1952.

139
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,900
Mr Nocquet had learned from Abe Tadashi.

140
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:14,823
After Mr Nocquet came, several Frenchmen started coming.

141
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,491
The French embassy was also involved.

142
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:21,496
They sponsored an Aikido demonstration at the Ueshiba Dojo.

143
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,749
There are some photographs.

144
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:33,716
Mr Nocquet trained under Abe Sensei for a few years, he found it amazing and decided to come.

145
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:38,972
There was an article about him in the Yomiuri newspaper.

146
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,434
At the beginning he practiced Judo, and after he mastered it,

147
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:48,022
he started to practice with Abe Tadashi for several years.

148
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:53,111
He wanted to practice more and came to Japan, where he stayed for 3 or 4 years.

149
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:58,116
André Nocquet used to say that your nikyo was very painful!

150
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,535
I was young!

151
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:04,205
I was only in my twenties, I was practicing from morning to evening.

152
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:11,588
I did not get a job, but dedicated myself to the exclusive study of Aikido and Japanese Budo.

153
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:16,134
While Nocquet-san was here he also did a demonstration.

154
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,306
I remember that when he returned

155
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,726
– at that time you would leave Japan by ship from Yokohama –

156
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,062
he left with an American ship and we went to see him off.

157
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:32,775
When he went home he was perhaps 44 or 45 years old.

158
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,362
I don't know what he did just after going home.

159
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:44,871
I went to Italy in October 1964

160
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:51,377
and in 1965, I was invited to France by Noro.

161
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:58,343
That time, Mr Nocquet came with another person to greet me, and he watched the demonstration.

162
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:03,389
Was it at this time that public demonstrations started?

163
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:07,810
The first public demonstrations took place on the roof of Takashimaya.

164
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:12,857
It was done there because there was no other place where to do a demonstration.

165
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,070
Of course the Budokan didn't exist.

166
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:22,951
There was no place that could host a demonstration.

167
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:33,127
It was not yet the time when you could rent the Hibiya Kōkaidō at great expense.

168
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:41,552
After the demonstration at Takashimaya, followed those at Mitsukoshi and on the roof of Shibuya's Tokyu department store.

169
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:52,063
Then you could rent a lecture hall in a beauty school or at a newspaper publisher,

170
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,856
different places like that.

171
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:00,154
But which was the proper first such occasion the Aikikai put on?

172
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,324
If you look at the records you should find it.

173
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:08,288
It seems that Kisshomaru Doshu had a hard time getting O Sensei to approve of such public displays.

174
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,874
O Sensei was reluctant to open Aikido to the public.

175
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,836
Originally it was not something that was made available to the public.

176
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,546
It was the same in Daito-ryu.

177
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,339
Takeda Sokaku Sensei did not disclose things openly either.

178
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,591
None of the old Budoka did that.

179
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:27,682
They only showed it to privileged people, not to outsiders.

180
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,309
It used to be called Otome-waza.

181
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,645
Otome-waza are the techniques that would not be allowed to be taught outside one’s feudal domain.

182
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:40,695
It's completely understandable because it would put you at a disadvantage if you let outsiders learn your secrets.

183
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,492
Another reason was that if a teaching spread too far, it would deteriorate.

184
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:50,997
That’s why it was only taught to special people, very carefully.

185
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,833
It was that sort of time.
