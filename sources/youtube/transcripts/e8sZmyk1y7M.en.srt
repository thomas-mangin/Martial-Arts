00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
position but if you take a step forward
 

163
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,750
position but if you take a step forward
you just went in on me right look it's

164
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
you just went in on me right look it's
 

165
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,750
you just went in on me right look it's
real simple if i take a step forward

166
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
real simple if i take a step forward
 

167
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,350
real simple if i take a step forward
ball of my foot's on the ground and i

168
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
ball of my foot's on the ground and i
 

169
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,270
ball of my foot's on the ground and i
rotate my foot in i just landed in on me

170
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
rotate my foot in i just landed in on me
 

171
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,070
rotate my foot in i just landed in on me
so it is easier for us to go forward and

172
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
so it is easier for us to go forward and
 

173
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,710
so it is easier for us to go forward and
backward faster if one foot is in front

174
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
backward faster if one foot is in front
 

175
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,990
backward faster if one foot is in front
of the other it just gives us an

176
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
of the other it just gives us an
 

177
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,509
of the other it just gives us an
advantage and so that's why when you're

178
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
advantage and so that's why when you're
 

179
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,630
advantage and so that's why when you're
playing this kind of game and you're

180
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
playing this kind of game and you're
 

181
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,110
playing this kind of game and you're
trying to go forward or go back this is

182
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
trying to go forward or go back this is
 

183
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,830
trying to go forward or go back this is
what you do right so that's why if we're

184
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
what you do right so that's why if we're
 

185
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,030
what you do right so that's why if we're
attacking someone or dealing with

186
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
attacking someone or dealing with
 

187
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,990
attacking someone or dealing with
someone or getting out of the way

188
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
someone or getting out of the way
 

189
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,750
someone or getting out of the way
someone we should have one foot forward

190
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
someone we should have one foot forward
 

191
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,830
someone we should have one foot forward
because we're faster in that plane now

192
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
because we're faster in that plane now
 

193
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,750
because we're faster in that plane now
if we're going sideways we're faster

194
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
if we're going sideways we're faster
 

195
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,190
if we're going sideways we're faster
with our feet like this right so if i

196
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
with our feet like this right so if i
 

197
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,309
with our feet like this right so if i
want to shuffle to this side or this

198
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
want to shuffle to this side or this
 

199
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,149
want to shuffle to this side or this
side my feet are faster this way so this

200
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
side my feet are faster this way so this
 

201
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,750
side my feet are faster this way so this
makes perfect sense i want to go this

202
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
makes perfect sense i want to go this
 

203
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,430
makes perfect sense i want to go this
way this way makes makes good sense

204
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
way this way makes makes good sense
 

205
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,309
way this way makes makes good sense
right

206
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
right
 

207
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,390
right
so there's nothing mysterious about it

208
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
so there's nothing mysterious about it
 

209
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,949
so there's nothing mysterious about it
it's really simple all ropano kamae is

210
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
it's really simple all ropano kamae is
 

211
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,630
it's really simple all ropano kamae is
is take a step forward and turn your

212
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
is take a step forward and turn your
 

213
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,869
is take a step forward and turn your
heel and you're now in ropanokoma it's

214
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
heel and you're now in ropanokoma it's
 

215
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,470
heel and you're now in ropanokoma it's
real simple it's just you're starting to

216
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
real simple it's just you're starting to
 

217
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,309
real simple it's just you're starting to
take a foot forward then if you turn

218
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
take a foot forward then if you turn
 

219
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,670
take a foot forward then if you turn
this foot sideways you get a little

220
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
this foot sideways you get a little
 

221
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,429
this foot sideways you get a little
stability going this way and you can

222
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
stability going this way and you can
 

223
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,030
stability going this way and you can
change to that plane so there are some

224
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
change to that plane so there are some
 

225
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,869
change to that plane so there are some
advantages to standing in specifically

226
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
advantages to standing in specifically
 

227
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,030
advantages to standing in specifically
that way but that is the essence of it

228
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
that way but that is the essence of it
 

229
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,589
that way but that is the essence of it
there's nothing radically mysterious

230
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
there's nothing radically mysterious
 

231
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,550
there's nothing radically mysterious
about it and so i find now that letting

232
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
about it and so i find now that letting
 

233
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,710
about it and so i find now that letting
go of talking about it like this really

234
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
go of talking about it like this really
 

235
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,869
go of talking about it like this really
special way you have to stand makes my

236
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
special way you have to stand makes my
 

237
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,110
special way you have to stand makes my
life a lot easier and it makes it easier

238
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
life a lot easier and it makes it easier
 

239
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,630
life a lot easier and it makes it easier
for my students to actually grasp the

240
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
for my students to actually grasp the
 

241
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,190
for my students to actually grasp the
concept of why they put a foot forward

242
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
concept of why they put a foot forward
 

243
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,789
concept of why they put a foot forward
instead of thinking that they've got to

244
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
instead of thinking that they've got to
 

245
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,710
instead of thinking that they've got to
stand in this special stance that does

246
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
stand in this special stance that does
 

247
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,310
stand in this special stance that does
some kind of magical thing right because

248
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
some kind of magical thing right because
 

249
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,069
some kind of magical thing right because
there is no magic it's just a

250
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
there is no magic it's just a

biomechanic makes you move better this

252
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
biomechanic makes you move better this
 

253
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,030
biomechanic makes you move better this
way and that's why you should stand that

254
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
way and that's why you should stand that
 

255
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,510
way and that's why you should stand that
way in these kinds of situations so i

256
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
way in these kinds of situations so i
 

257
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,030
way in these kinds of situations so i
hope that kind of shook this out a

hope that kind of shook this out a
 

259
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,670
hope that kind of shook this out a
little bit i think it was it was good
