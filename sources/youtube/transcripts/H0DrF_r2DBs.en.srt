00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,150
i have to always go to a yawn face and
then i hit the rotation

136

it is it's no different than if i went

158
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
it is it's no different than if i went
 

159
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,790
it is it's no different than if i went
like this i'm here and i move to this

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120

 

173
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,070

he's here so i'm going to move my spine

174
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
he's here so i'm going to move my spine
 

175
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,870
he's here so i'm going to move my spine
backwards by keeping my line of gravity

176
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
backwards by keeping my line of gravity
 

177
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,830
backwards by keeping my line of gravity
between my two feet and i'll be out of

178
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840
between my two feet and i'll be out of
 

179
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,029
between my two feet and i'll be out of
range

180
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
range
 

181
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,029
range
and now i'm going to establish that

182
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
and now i'm going to establish that
 

183
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,310
and now i'm going to establish that
point you can see

184
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
point you can see
 

185
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,950
point you can see
that range does not change oh

186
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960

 

187
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,550

so as i'm here let's film from here

188
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
so as i'm here let's film from here
 

189
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,430
so as i'm here let's film from here
i want you to keep an eye on my spine

190
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
i want you to keep an eye on my spine
 

191
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,590
i want you to keep an eye on my spine
and how much it traverses

192
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
and how much it traverses
 

193
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,670
and how much it traverses
so double weighted stepping back

194
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680

 

195
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,430

single weighted turning

196
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
single weighted turning
 

197
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,590
single weighted turning
we want the second one

198
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600

 

199
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,550

you're late the second i'm walking to

200
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
you're late the second i'm walking to
 

201
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,670
you're late the second i'm walking to
you you're already

202
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
you you're already
 

203
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,270
you you're already
ready okay

204
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280

 

205
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,070

okay everything has to aim up

206
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
okay everything has to aim up
 

207
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,430
okay everything has to aim up
down down the center so you can see if i

208
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
down down the center so you can see if i
 

209
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:31,830
down down the center so you can see if i
stay

210
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
stay
 

211
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,150
stay
here this cut is going to be off my

212
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
here this cut is going to be off my
 

213
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,150
here this cut is going to be off my
center but that's the angle

214
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
center but that's the angle
 

215
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,510
center but that's the angle
down the center but once i

216
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
down the center but once i
 

217
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,430
down the center but once i
turn you see i move myself under that

218
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
turn you see i move myself under that
 

219
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,150
turn you see i move myself under that
and then once my foot turns and my hips

220
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
and then once my foot turns and my hips
 

221
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,510
and then once my foot turns and my hips
change location

222
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
change location
 

223
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,990
change location
the tiny little bit that i'm off i will

224
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
the tiny little bit that i'm off i will
 

225
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,909
the tiny little bit that i'm off i will
be on

226
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
be on
 

227
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,749
be on
so i'm down his center and my sword

228
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
so i'm down his center and my sword
 

229
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,990
so i'm down his center and my sword
is straight down my nose do you see down

down my spine see it's not over here off
 

235
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:20,629
down my spine see it's not over here off
side of my head you see

down my nose down my spine
 

239
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,469
down my nose down my spine
not off go back

240
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479

 

241
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,830

boom not over here that's not down his

boom not over here that's not down his
 

243
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,550
boom not over here that's not down his
center

244
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
center
 

245
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:40,790
center
this foot went too far

246
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800

 

247
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,990

stay still down

248
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
stay still down
 

249
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,550
stay still down
his center there's his spine right down

250
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560

his center
okay so let let's look at this again

254
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
okay so let let's look at this again
 

255
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,510
okay so let let's look at this again
he's going to push on my shoulder

256
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
he's going to push on my shoulder
 

257
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,909
he's going to push on my shoulder
and i'm here like this so we went over

258
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
and i'm here like this so we went over
 

259
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,029
and i'm here like this so we went over
this in the

260

this in the
 

261
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,150
this in the
in chiba's eight councilwood so when i

262
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
in chiba's eight councilwood so when i
 

263
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,670
in chiba's eight councilwood so when i
double pivot

264
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
double pivot
 

265
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,869
double pivot
i stayed on the line until

266
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
i stayed on the line until
 

267
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,370
i stayed on the line until
somewhere around here

268
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:18,380

 

269
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,469

when i pivot correctly i'm already off
 

273
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,430
when i pivot correctly i'm already off
the line

274
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
the line
 

275
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,670
the line
this is just a re-uh

276
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680

 

277
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,310

a re-vectoring for attack it's not my

278
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
a re-vectoring for attack it's not my
 

279
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,670
a re-vectoring for attack it's not my
deviation

280
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
deviation
 

281
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,790
deviation
the deviation already happened here this

282
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
the deviation already happened here this
 

283
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,670
the deviation already happened here this
is a re-vectoring for the attack

284
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
is a re-vectoring for the attack
 

285
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,990
is a re-vectoring for the attack
on the other one i still deviate he's

286
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
on the other one i still deviate he's
 

287
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,870
on the other one i still deviate he's
still deviating

288
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
still deviating
 

289
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,630
still deviating
until here then i'm off

290
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640

 

291
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,949

so as i do this if you look at my hips

292
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
so as i do this if you look at my hips
 

293
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,750
so as i do this if you look at my hips
my hips are doing a circle that's my

294
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
my hips are doing a circle that's my
 

295
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,870
my hips are doing a circle that's my
deviation

296
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
deviation
 

297
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,350
deviation
like a count countless other arts that

298
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
like a count countless other arts that
 

299
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,829
like a count countless other arts that
do circles

300
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
do circles
 

301
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,550
do circles
so my hips are going to rotate i'm going

302
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
so my hips are going to rotate i'm going
 

303
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,790
so my hips are going to rotate i'm going
to put this plane here now

304
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
to put this plane here now
 

305
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,829
to put this plane here now
so when i shift my weight

306
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
so when i shift my weight
 

307
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,350
so when i shift my weight
i rotate my hips will change

308
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
i rotate my hips will change
 

309
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,110
i rotate my hips will change
places the right hip is now in front

310
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
places the right hip is now in front
 

311
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,230
places the right hip is now in front
i don't want my hips even and then i

312
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
i don't want my hips even and then i
 

313
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,190
i don't want my hips even and then i
step back with my hips even

314
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
step back with my hips even
 

315
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,230
step back with my hips even
so over here

316
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240

 

317
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,710

when i when i do the cut now that means

318
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
when i when i do the cut now that means
 

319
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,910
when i when i do the cut now that means
that i'm not going to have square hips

320
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
that i'm not going to have square hips
 

321
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,550
that i'm not going to have square hips
and square shoulders i have a lean hip

322
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
and square shoulders i have a lean hip
 

323
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,070
and square shoulders i have a lean hip
and so i have a lead shoulder

324
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080

 

325
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,710

if i don't have a lead hip and at least

326
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
if i don't have a lead hip and at least
 

327
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,430
if i don't have a lead hip and at least
shoulder

328
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
shoulder
 

329
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,670
shoulder
i didn't rotate in my angle of

330
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
i didn't rotate in my angle of
 

331
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,870
i didn't rotate in my angle of
deflection

332
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
deflection
 

333
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,110
deflection
do you see i didn't get out of the way

334
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
do you see i didn't get out of the way
 

335
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,430
do you see i didn't get out of the way
of the sword

336
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440

 

337
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,590

change position here

338
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
change position here
 

339
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,959
change position here
not here okay let's go
