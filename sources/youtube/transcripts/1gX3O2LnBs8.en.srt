don't go backwards to go forwards but
 

5
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,190
don't go backwards to go forwards but
some people don't understand that

6
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
some people don't understand that
 

7
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,589
some people don't understand that
if i go here

8
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599
if i go here
 

9
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,669
if i go here
get it out

10
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:11,679
get it out
 

11
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,430
get it out
and do it then it's okay but i've

12
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440
and do it then it's okay but i've
 

13
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,150
and do it then it's okay but i've
actually used that with strength

14
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
actually used that with strength
 

15
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,310
actually used that with strength
there's another one that nick was

16
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
there's another one that nick was
 

17
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,510
there's another one that nick was
showing if i if i do go up

18
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
showing if i if i do go up
 

19
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,509
showing if i if i do go up
and take it then it's basic because i've

20
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
and take it then it's basic because i've
 

21
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,269
and take it then it's basic because i've
got one hand on it but what am i going

22
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
got one hand on it but what am i going
 

23
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,150
got one hand on it but what am i going
to do now

24
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160

 

25
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,910

it just cut it just come from that

26
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:29,920
it just cut it just come from that
 

27
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,189
it just cut it just come from that
height

28
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
height
 

29
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,110
height
it went to that height now it's back at

30
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
it went to that height now it's back at
 

31
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,389
it went to that height now it's back at
this height where's it going to go again

32
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
this height where's it going to go again
 

33
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,470
this height where's it going to go again
you know

34
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
you know
 

35
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,310
you know
look i know you're a prize fighter and

36
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
look i know you're a prize fighter and
 

37
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,430
look i know you're a prize fighter and
you're in the street and you had too

38
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
you're in the street and you had too
 

39
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,790
you're in the street and you had too
many drinks but can you give me a half

40
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
many drinks but can you give me a half
 

41
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,750
many drinks but can you give me a half
an hour because i need this technique

42
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
an hour because i need this technique
 

43
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,510
an hour because i need this technique
you ain't you haven't got i've been in

44
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
you ain't you haven't got i've been in
 

45
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,069
you ain't you haven't got i've been in
real situations and you don't it's

46
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
real situations and you don't it's
 

47
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:57,750
real situations and you don't it's
milliseconds you've got milliseconds

48
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760

 

49
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,310

that's that technique you was doing

50
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
that's that technique you was doing
 

51
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,189
that's that technique you was doing
i can't lift it up lower it down i can't

52
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
i can't lift it up lower it down i can't
 

53
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,990
i can't lift it up lower it down i can't
do anything more so where does it come

54
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
do anything more so where does it come
 

55
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,109
do anything more so where does it come
from

56
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119

 

57
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,149

let's do it simon so you can see see

58
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
let's do it simon so you can see see
 

59
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,390
let's do it simon so you can see see
this hand

60
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400

 

61
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,789

see now we've got two techniques that

62
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
see now we've got two techniques that
 

63
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,789
see now we've got two techniques that
look exactly the same

64
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799

 

65
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,429

i don't know what foot he's got forward

66
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
i don't know what foot he's got forward
 

67
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,390
i don't know what foot he's got forward
so

68
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
so
 

69
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,069
so
i could be like this

70
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
i could be like this
 

71
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:30,789
i could be like this
but

72
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
but
 

73
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,510
but
it would help if i'm in hand me but i

74
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
it would help if i'm in hand me but i
 

75
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,789
it would help if i'm in hand me but i
could be like this

76
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
could be like this
 

77
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,469
could be like this
because i don't know what foot he's got

78
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
because i don't know what foot he's got
 

79
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,469
because i don't know what foot he's got
forward i have to choose what way i'm

80
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
forward i have to choose what way i'm
 

81
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,230
forward i have to choose what way i'm
going to go

82
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240
going to go
 

83
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,350
going to go
so i'm going to

84
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
so i'm going to
 

85
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,270
so i'm going to
go this way or this way

86
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
go this way or this way
 

87
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,670
go this way or this way
this way this way how am i going to lift

88
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
this way this way how am i going to lift
 

89
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,510
this way this way how am i going to lift
my arms up

90
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
my arms up
 

91
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,109
my arms up
i can't lift him up so i'll leave him

92
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
i can't lift him up so i'll leave him
 

93
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,749
i can't lift him up so i'll leave him
where they are

94
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
where they are
 

95
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,830
where they are
i take it out i leave him where he is

96
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
i take it out i leave him where he is
 

97
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,510
i take it out i leave him where he is
i step out here we're back to almost now

98
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
i step out here we're back to almost now
 

99
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,749
i step out here we're back to almost now
dory if you think about it and then i

100
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
dory if you think about it and then i
 

101
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,149
dory if you think about it and then i
push him down

102
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
push him down
 

103
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,030
push him down
so i've now got two techniques that i

104
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
so i've now got two techniques that i
 

105
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,190
so i've now got two techniques that i
don't have to worry about oh how many

106
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
don't have to worry about oh how many
 

107
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,029
don't have to worry about oh how many
techniques we've got to remember

108
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
techniques we've got to remember
 

109
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,710
techniques we've got to remember
because i'm starting to piece them

110
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
because i'm starting to piece them
 

111
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,790
because i'm starting to piece them
together slowly

112
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
together slowly
 

113
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,830
together slowly

if i
do this

118
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
do this
 

119
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,190
do this
and that

120
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
and that
