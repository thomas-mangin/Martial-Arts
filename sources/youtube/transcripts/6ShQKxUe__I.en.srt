1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,350

okay so uh

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:03,360
okay so uh
 

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,269
okay so uh
starting from just some sort of

4
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:05,279
starting from just some sort of
 

5
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,590
starting from just some sort of
quenching maneuver okay

6
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,600
quenching maneuver okay
 

7
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,950
quenching maneuver okay
and then working uh on

8
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
and then working uh on
 

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,070
and then working uh on
the fear reaction cycle okay so i'm

10
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
the fear reaction cycle okay so i'm
 

11
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,269
the fear reaction cycle okay so i'm
gonna shove him and

12
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:17,279
gonna shove him and
 

13
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,310
gonna shove him and
the untrained mind will push back on me

14
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
the untrained mind will push back on me
 

15
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,509
the untrained mind will push back on me
okay he doesn't want to be shoved so

16
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
okay he doesn't want to be shoved so
 

17
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:33,430
okay he doesn't want to be shoved so
uh go boom he enters and i'll take it

18
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440

 

19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,630

so again i'm here

20
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
so again i'm here
 

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:49,990
so again i'm here
i push he pushes i go in

22
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000

 

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,869

make sure that you don't stop me

24
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
make sure that you don't stop me
 

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:06,550
make sure that you don't stop me
and then you do your keyhole

26
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:06,560

 

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,750

okay so he's gonna do that same

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
okay so he's gonna do that same
 

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,190
okay so he's gonna do that same
strategy okay so he pushes and rather

30
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
strategy okay so he pushes and rather
 

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,070
strategy okay so he pushes and rather
than me

32
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
than me
 

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,710
than me
uh resisting i take him into the kazushi

34
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
uh resisting i take him into the kazushi
 

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,910
uh resisting i take him into the kazushi
into the kazushi pattern okay so he goes

36
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
into the kazushi pattern okay so he goes
 

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,710
into the kazushi pattern okay so he goes
to push

38
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
to push
 

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,670
to push
and i'm gonna start turn

40
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,680
and i'm gonna start turn
 

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,429
and i'm gonna start turn
he goes to push and i start to turn

42
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439

 

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,710

so when push 10 he goes to push

44
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
so when push 10 he goes to push
 

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,030
so when push 10 he goes to push
start are you going to see or

46
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
start are you going to see or
 

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,870
start are you going to see or
you won't find the uh question nugget

48
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
you won't find the uh question nugget
 

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,950
you won't find the uh question nugget
try push hard

50
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960

 

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,550

it's not there

52
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560

 

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,389

so neutralize this energy go

54
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
so neutralize this energy go
 

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,910
so neutralize this energy go
start to turn

56
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920

 

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,350

okay okay

58
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360

 

59
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,790

okay so uh struggle

60
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
okay so uh struggle
 

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,550
okay so uh struggle
is me yonging against his young

62
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
is me yonging against his young
 

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,790
is me yonging against his young
it's me being reactionary to him

64
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
it's me being reactionary to him
 

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,470
it's me being reactionary to him
that that's what you're seeing here

66
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480

 

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,510

and struggling harder so he

68
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
and struggling harder so he
 

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,750
and struggling harder so he
struggles harder so i do the yield push

70
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
struggles harder so i do the yield push
 

71
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,470
struggles harder so i do the yield push
please so i do the yield

72
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
please so i do the yield
 

73
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,869
please so i do the yield
is the strategy amongst the unawakened

74
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879

 

75
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,990

what we're doing now is i

76
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
what we're doing now is i
 

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,509
what we're doing now is i
am i'm very why why am i not relaxed i

78
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
am i'm very why why am i not relaxed i
 

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,790
am i'm very why why am i not relaxed i
relax

80
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
relax
 

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,150
relax
i'm relaxed nothing's happening it's no

82
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
i'm relaxed nothing's happening it's no
 

83
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,790
i'm relaxed nothing's happening it's no
different

84
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
different
 

85
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,550
different
than if he has me inside control

86
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
than if he has me inside control
 

87
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,470
than if he has me inside control
he's very tight there's nothing to do

88
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
he's very tight there's nothing to do
 

89
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,470
he's very tight there's nothing to do
just relax don't don't shove on him

90
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
just relax don't don't shove on him
 

91
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,830
just relax don't don't shove on him
just wait just relax he has to move

92
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
just wait just relax he has to move
 

93
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,750
just wait just relax he has to move
sooner or later as he tries to do

94
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
sooner or later as he tries to do
 

95
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,550
sooner or later as he tries to do
something so that's where my space is

96
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
something so that's where my space is
 

97
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,270
something so that's where my space is
go

98
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280

 

99
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,990

so struggle happens internally first

100
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
so struggle happens internally first
 

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,789
so struggle happens internally first
as the unawakened state as the

102
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:24,799
as the unawakened state as the
 

103
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,630
as the unawakened state as the
reactionary state as being

reaction cycle
 

109
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,430
reaction cycle
so as we go here and he goes to

110
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
so as we go here and he goes to
 

111
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,630
so as we go here and he goes to
do the strategy this is what happens as

112
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
do the strategy this is what happens as
 

113
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,470
do the strategy this is what happens as
i'm unawakened i

114
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
i'm unawakened i
 

115
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,509
i'm unawakened i
push back on him i stop him doing what

116
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
push back on him i stop him doing what
 

117
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,470
push back on him i stop him doing what
he's doing

118
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
he's doing
 

119
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,589
he's doing
and that's what sets up his koshinari

120
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
and that's what sets up his koshinari
 

121
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,030
and that's what sets up his koshinari
woah i'm in

122
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040

 

123
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,070

what we're doing in aikido is as

124
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
what we're doing in aikido is as
 

125
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,229
what we're doing in aikido is as
he moves i don't brace

126
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
he moves i don't brace
 

127
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,730
he moves i don't brace
he moves and i move

128
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:02,740
he moves and i move
 

129
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,869

or better said

132
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799

 

133
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,390

he moves me or better said

134
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
he moves me or better said
 

135
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,509
he moves me or better said
it just moves

136
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
it just moves
 

137
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,150
it just moves
so he's going to try very hard to

138
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
so he's going to try very hard to
 

139
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,509
so he's going to try very hard to
trigger me

140
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
trigger me
 

141
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,870
trigger me
that's what i don't want to do

142
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
that's what i don't want to do
 

143
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,390
that's what i don't want to do
he goes to trigger me and

144
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
he goes to trigger me and
 

145
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,590
he goes to trigger me and
i'm letting him move he goes

146
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
i'm letting him move he goes
 

147
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,710
i'm letting him move he goes
and then as i become more relaxed i

148
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
and then as i become more relaxed i
 

149
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,590
and then as i become more relaxed i
become

150
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
become
 

151
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,270
become
more sensitive so he goes and

152
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
more sensitive so he goes and
 

153
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:53,189
more sensitive so he goes and
you can feel when he's gonna go

154
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199

 

155
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,510

he goes

156
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
he goes
 

157
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,790
he goes
so he falls into though not that

158
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
so he falls into though not that
 

159
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,670
so he falls into though not that
is which what he expects but he falls

160
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
is which what he expects but he falls
 

161
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,550
is which what he expects but he falls
into nothing

162
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560

 

163
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,629

and again i'm disconnected he goes

164
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639

 

165
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,310

so treat it as an emotional drill

166
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
so treat it as an emotional drill
 

167
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,350
so treat it as an emotional drill
it's not any different than going you

168
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
it's not any different than going you
 

169
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,830
it's not any different than going you

364
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360

 

365
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,949

boom to there to here

366
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
boom to there to here
 

367
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:35,509
boom to there to here
here we go

368
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519

 

369
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,790

then don't tighten anything

370
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
then don't tighten anything
 

371
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,670
then don't tighten anything
until you can tighten it it's in place

372
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
until you can tighten it it's in place
 

373
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,069
until you can tighten it it's in place
with that

374
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
with that
 

375
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,310
with that
sometimes it's not exactly perfect

376
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
sometimes it's not exactly perfect
 

377
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,470
sometimes it's not exactly perfect
you still have the dynamics

378
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480

 

379
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,829

boom keep it and you'll

380
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
boom keep it and you'll
 

381
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,710
boom keep it and you'll
find it this hand didn't close it's

382
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
find it this hand didn't close it's
 

383
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,710
find it this hand didn't close it's
still doing what it needs to do

384
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
still doing what it needs to do
 

385
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,030
still doing what it needs to do
you'll find it in the technique

386
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040

 

387
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,310

then it will close

388
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320

 

389
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,670

but if you open it up he goes

390
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680

 

391
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,389

no it's not gonna happen you're going

392
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
no it's not gonna happen you're going
 

393
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:27,990
no it's not gonna happen you're going
around his energy

394
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,000

 

395
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,509

by accepting his energy

396
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519
by accepting his energy
 

397
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,790
by accepting his energy
okay so again we're going to do the

398
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
okay so again we're going to do the
 

399
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,230
okay so again we're going to do the
elbow pass he goes

400
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
elbow pass he goes
 

401
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,150
elbow pass he goes
i start the fight attorney i'm going to

402
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
i start the fight attorney i'm going to

405
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,470

so let's open it up again this hand

406
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
so let's open it up again this hand
 

407
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,590
so let's open it up again this hand
goes right into there

408
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600

 

409
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,949

so last time i passed it

410
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
so last time i passed it
 

411
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,590
so last time i passed it
there this time i'm going to pass it out

412
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
there this time i'm going to pass it out
 

413
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,110
there this time i'm going to pass it out
here

414
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,120

 

415
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:09,750

same same pasta

416
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760

 

417
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:28,829

and grab and i'm in

418
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839

 

419
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,389

uh

420
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399

 

421
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:52,389

same yield

422
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399

 

423
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,829

again knock here

424
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839

 

425
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,850

disappear

426
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:01,860

 

427
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:08,710

[Music]

428
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720

 

429
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,430

use what you have so as you go

430
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
use what you have so as you go
 

431
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,310
use what you have so as you go
elbow pass you see

432
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320

 

433
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,189

here even though the shoulder grabs the

434
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
here even though the shoulder grabs the
 

435
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:21,910
here even though the shoulder grabs the
throw

436
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
throw
 

437
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:36,310
throw
you can add to it with the elbow too

438
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320

 

439
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,629

okay so we started this with a push

440
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
okay so we started this with a push
 

441
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,430
okay so we started this with a push
triggering right so we learned a more

442
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
triggering right so we learned a more
 

443
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,069
triggering right so we learned a more
inviting way of moving so

444
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
inviting way of moving so
 

445
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,350
inviting way of moving so
i don't push against his push okay so

446
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
i don't push against his push okay so
 

447
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,670
i don't push against his push okay so
in this technique i'm gonna use that

448
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
in this technique i'm gonna use that
 

449
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,670
in this technique i'm gonna use that
same strategy against him

450
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
same strategy against him
 

451
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,189
same strategy against him
so he goes and i deviate

452
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
so he goes and i deviate
 

453
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,829
so he goes and i deviate
and i'm gonna push and he's gonna do

454
00:15:59,829 --> 00:15:59,839
and i'm gonna push and he's gonna do
 

455
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,389
and i'm gonna push and he's gonna do
what

456
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
what
 

457
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,710
what
yes you see you're gonna push back into

458
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
yes you see you're gonna push back into
 

459
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,030
yes you see you're gonna push back into
me is when he pushes back into me then

460
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040
me is when he pushes back into me then
 

461
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,710
me is when he pushes back into me then
it goes over

462
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720

 

463
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,110

requires a guy to open back into the

464
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
requires a guy to open back into the
 

465
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,069
requires a guy to open back into the
technique

466
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
technique
 

467
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,990
technique
it's not a not a guy standing there

468
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
it's not a not a guy standing there
 

469
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,110
it's not a not a guy standing there
um he's trying to go

470
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
um he's trying to go
 

471
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,110
um he's trying to go
back that way

472
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120

 

473
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,949

so we're here home deviate

474
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:28,959
so we're here home deviate
 

475
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,189
so we're here home deviate
push pass and i'm in the technique

476
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
push pass and i'm in the technique
 

477
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,910
push pass and i'm in the technique
again all of you except one or two

478
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
again all of you except one or two
 

479
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,629
again all of you except one or two
will be triggered so i go here and shove

480
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
will be triggered so i go here and shove
 

481
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,310
will be triggered so i go here and shove
them in

482
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
them in
 

483
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,310
them in
you guys will respond back and then you

484
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
you guys will respond back and then you
 

485
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,710
you guys will respond back and then you
can use that to train you okay

486
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
can use that to train you okay
 

487
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,150
can use that to train you okay
so whoa

488
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160

 

489
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,639

technique okay
