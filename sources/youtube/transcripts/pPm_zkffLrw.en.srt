1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:06,260

any questions come in observation

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:06,270

 

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:16,250

notice I don't know if it's because

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,260

 

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,130

I'm not being as mindful as the lower

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:19,140
I'm not being as mindful as the lower
 

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,170
I'm not being as mindful as the lower
half of my body and I find that I'm not

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:21,180
half of my body and I find that I'm not
 

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,030
half of my body and I find that I'm not
doing

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:24,040

 

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,040

Oishi stuff I'm actually checking myself

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,050
Oishi stuff I'm actually checking myself
 

13
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:36,750
Oishi stuff I'm actually checking myself
out with each step and just yeah we saw

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:36,760
out with each step and just yeah we saw
 

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,440
out with each step and just yeah we saw
a lot of that so sent the same movement

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:40,450
a lot of that so sent the same movement
 

17
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,000
a lot of that so sent the same movement
that lends itself towards stability

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,010
that lends itself towards stability
 

19
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,810
that lends itself towards stability
grounding also lends itself towards

20
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:48,820
grounding also lends itself towards
 

21
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,960
grounding also lends itself towards
projection right sending energy away

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:51,970
projection right sending energy away
 

23
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:52,680
projection right sending energy away
from me

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:52,690
from me
 

25
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:58,500
from me
but it also is the same organization

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:58,510
but it also is the same organization
 

27
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,890
but it also is the same organization
that lends itself towards mobility so

28
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:01,900
that lends itself towards mobility so
 

29
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,049
that lends itself towards mobility so
for example let's take an obvious one

30
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:04,059
for example let's take an obvious one
 

31
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,840
for example let's take an obvious one
when you push your knee over your foot

32
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:08,850
when you push your knee over your foot
 

33
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,020
when you push your knee over your foot
okay and you require a great need to go

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,030
okay and you require a great need to go
 

35
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,660
okay and you require a great need to go
backwards or to change the angle off to

36
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:15,670
backwards or to change the angle off to
 

37
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,940
backwards or to change the angle off to
the flight you're going to have to bring

38
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:17,950
the flight you're going to have to bring
 

39
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,000
the flight you're going to have to bring
that knee back first over your ankle

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,010
that knee back first over your ankle
 

41
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,980
that knee back first over your ankle
before you can adopt a new vector so now

42
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:25,990
before you can adopt a new vector so now
 

43
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:35,360
before you can adopt a new vector so now
you just added time when you're falling

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,370
you just added time when you're falling
 

45
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,190
you just added time when you're falling
because you don't have the ground path

46
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,200
because you don't have the ground path
 

47
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,740
because you don't have the ground path
because you don't have the right ankle

48
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:40,750
because you don't have the right ankle
 

49
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,380
because you don't have the right ankle
angle like when we send your torso is

50
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:43,390
angle like when we send your torso is
 

51
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,570
angle like when we send your torso is
not over your hips and you're starting

52
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:45,580
not over your hips and you're starting
 

53
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,560
not over your hips and you're starting
to fall you if you're not having to step

54
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:49,570
to fall you if you're not having to step
 

55
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,740
to fall you if you're not having to step
in the very direction you were falling

56
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:51,750
in the very direction you were falling
 

57
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,910
in the very direction you were falling
you're going to have to regain your

58
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
you're going to have to regain your
 

59
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,470
you're going to have to regain your
balance you're going to have to put your

60
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:55,480
balance you're going to have to put your
 

61
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,920
balance you're going to have to put your
torso back over your hips right put the

62
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:58,930
torso back over your hips right put the
 

63
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,500
torso back over your hips right put the
rider back on the horse before you can

64
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:01,510
rider back on the horse before you can
 

65
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,060
rider back on the horse before you can
start to move in the other direction so

66
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,070
start to move in the other direction so
 

67
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,350
start to move in the other direction so
that's a whole extra step let's take the

68
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
that's a whole extra step let's take the
 

69
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,839
that's a whole extra step let's take the
opposite side you have locked your knees

70
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:09,849
opposite side you have locked your knees
 

71
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:14,130
opposite side you have locked your knees
out many of you when you come up you

72
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:14,140
out many of you when you come up you
 

73
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,559
out many of you when you come up you
seek height when when the movement is

74
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:16,569
seek height when when the movement is
 

75
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,990
seek height when when the movement is
happening that Joad on the upper level

76
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,000
happening that Joad on the upper level
 

77
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,930
happening that Joad on the upper level
your mind is pulled by it and as your

78
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:21,940
your mind is pulled by it and as your
 

79
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,899
your mind is pulled by it and as your
mind is pulled by it your body follows

80
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:24,909
mind is pulled by it your body follows
 

81
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:28,559
mind is pulled by it your body follows
so I'm working at Joad on my mind rut

82
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:28,569
so I'm working at Joad on my mind rut
 

83
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:32,789
so I'm working at Joad on my mind rut
rut raises and then my body raises how

84
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:32,799
rut raises and then my body raises how
 

85
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:36,569
rut raises and then my body raises how
by I lock my knees out so locked knees

86
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:36,579
by I lock my knees out so locked knees
 

87
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,920
by I lock my knees out so locked knees
is not the ground path

88
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:37,930
is not the ground path
 

89
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,509
is not the ground path
I needed a knee bed now if I have to

90
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:42,519
I needed a knee bed now if I have to
 

91
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,300
I needed a knee bed now if I have to
move what do I have to do I have to

92
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,310
move what do I have to do I have to
 

93
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,610
move what do I have to do I have to
first bend my knees and then I'll be

94
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:47,620
first bend my knees and then I'll be
 

95
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,770
first bend my knees and then I'll be
able to move so same thing you're not

96
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:49,780
able to move so same thing you're not
 

97
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,500
able to move so same thing you're not
rounding and you've added an extra move

98
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:52,510
rounding and you've added an extra move
 

99
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,929
rounding and you've added an extra move
on to whatever you need to do and that

100
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:54,939
on to whatever you need to do and that
 

101
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:58,679
on to whatever you need to do and that
requires more time you're slower so

102
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:58,689
requires more time you're slower so
 

103
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:01,849
requires more time you're slower so
there's not this contradiction or

104
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:01,859
there's not this contradiction or
 

105
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:04,640
there's not this contradiction or
antithetical relationship between

106
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:04,650
antithetical relationship between
 

107
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,390
antithetical relationship between
stability and mobility it's not a trade

108
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:09,400
stability and mobility it's not a trade
 

109
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,759
stability and mobility it's not a trade
off the overextended stance or the super

110
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:14,769
off the overextended stance or the super
 

111
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:17,129
off the overextended stance or the super
wide stance that somebody thinks is a

112
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:17,139
wide stance that somebody thinks is a
 

113
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:22,949
wide stance that somebody thinks is a
stability is not in the same way the

114
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
stability is not in the same way the
 

115
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,800
stability is not in the same way the
narrower stance or the moving stance

116
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:25,810
narrower stance or the moving stance
 

117
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,670
narrower stance or the moving stance
that someone thinks is only mobile it's

118
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
that someone thinks is only mobile it's
 

119
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:37,940
that someone thinks is only mobile it's
not it's very stable so go back to your

120
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:37,950
not it's very stable so go back to your
 

121
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,809
not it's very stable so go back to your
basics then where is my ankle angle

122
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:42,819
basics then where is my ankle angle
 

123
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,509
basics then where is my ankle angle
supposed to be what is the orientation

124
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
supposed to be what is the orientation
 

125
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,890
supposed to be what is the orientation
of my me where is my weight in

126
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:49,900
of my me where is my weight in
 

127
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,159
of my me where is my weight in
relationship to which foot I need to

128
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:53,169
relationship to which foot I need to
 

129
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:56,610
relationship to which foot I need to
move or not move just go to those basics

130
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:56,620
move or not move just go to those basics
 

131
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,500
move or not move just go to those basics
what is my hip to hip relationship what

132
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:01,510
what is my hip to hip relationship what
 

133
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,509
what is my hip to hip relationship what
is my shoulder to shoulder relationship

134
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
is my shoulder to shoulder relationship
 

135
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,479
is my shoulder to shoulder relationship
what is my shoulders to hip relationship

136
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:06,489
what is my shoulders to hip relationship
 

137
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,330
what is my shoulders to hip relationship
check for those and is my Center going

138
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,340
check for those and is my Center going
 

139
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,809
check for those and is my Center going
then go to the inner level what is my

140
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:15,819
then go to the inner level what is my
 

141
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:22,890
then go to the inner level what is my
mind in my panic am i breathing and my

142
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:22,900
mind in my panic am i breathing and my
 

143
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,760
mind in my panic am i breathing and my
shoulders up and my throat is tight have

144
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:26,770
shoulders up and my throat is tight have
 

145
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,040
shoulders up and my throat is tight have
I gone blind has my awareness gone in

146
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,050
I gone blind has my awareness gone in
 

147
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,909
I gone blind has my awareness gone in
and down it's no longer up and out just

148
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
and down it's no longer up and out just
 

149
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,210
and down it's no longer up and out just
run through the checklist every single

150
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:36,220
run through the checklist every single
 

151
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,810
run through the checklist every single
thing we're doing is just that over and

152
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:39,820
thing we're doing is just that over and
 

153
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,020
thing we're doing is just that over and
over and over at body organization every

154
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,030
over and over at body organization every
 

155
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:49,120
over and over at body organization every
technique

156
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,130

 

157
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:56,760

so I really

158
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:56,770

 

159
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:04,779

so here's the subtext of your question I

160
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:04,789
so here's the subtext of your question I
 

161
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:09,550
so here's the subtext of your question I
will address everybody learns at

162
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:09,560
will address everybody learns at
 

163
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,119
will address everybody learns at
different rates the structure though it

164
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:13,129
