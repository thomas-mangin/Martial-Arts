to have your own space that's obviously

200
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
to have your own space that's obviously
 

201
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,430
to have your own space that's obviously
up to

202
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:24,440
up to
 

203
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,469
up to
you so you don't have to do all the

204
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:27,479
you so you don't have to do all the
 

205
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,670
you so you don't have to do all the
seven caner bures but what I suggest is

206
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:30,680
seven caner bures but what I suggest is
 

207
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,110
seven caner bures but what I suggest is
you do at least the first um

208
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
you do at least the first um
 

209
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,029
you do at least the first um
five um

210
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:38,039
five um
 

211
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,749
five um
but the six and seven uh H have the skis

212
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:42,759
but the six and seven uh H have the skis
 

213
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,150
but the six and seven uh H have the skis
added to them so why I'm saying the

214
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,160
added to them so why I'm saying the
 

215
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,950
added to them so why I'm saying the
first five is because they're just

216
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
first five is because they're just
 

217
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,309
first five is because they're just
really all about subur

218
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:50,319
really all about subur
 

219
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,990
really all about subur
Cuts do all seven if you've got time but

220
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
Cuts do all seven if you've got time but
 

221
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,629
Cuts do all seven if you've got time but
like with the buildup of ukmi I suggest

222
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
like with the buildup of ukmi I suggest
 

223
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,390
like with the buildup of ukmi I suggest
that you do the first to

224
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
that you do the first to
 

225
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,589
that you do the first to
kerb until you're really

226
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:05,599
kerb until you're really
 

227
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:12,670
kerb until you're really
satisfied um try to aim for five of each

228
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:12,680
satisfied um try to aim for five of each
 

229
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,629
satisfied um try to aim for five of each
now you may think well that's not many

230
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
now you may think well that's not many
 

231
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,070
now you may think well that's not many
five of each but out of those five

232
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
five of each but out of those five
 

233
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,950
five of each but out of those five
subes I'd like you to aim

234
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
subes I'd like you to aim
 

235
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,350
subes I'd like you to aim
for three subur that felt exactly the

236
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
for three subur that felt exactly the
 

237
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,550
for three subur that felt exactly the
same once you can get to three

238
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
same once you can get to three
 

239
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,950
same once you can get to three
subur that felt exactly the same out of

240
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:31,960
subur that felt exactly the same out of
 

241
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,390
subur that felt exactly the same out of
the five so you do the five straight off

242
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:35,400
the five so you do the five straight off
 

243
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,790
the five so you do the five straight off
one 2 3 four five let's say that was the

244
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
one 2 3 four five let's say that was the
 

245
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,749
one 2 3 four five let's say that was the
first

for some time so perhaps I'll make my
 

283
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,830
for some time so perhaps I'll make my
own test and try that if you can get

you're doing really
 

289
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,749
you're doing really
well do this with every

well do this with every
 

291
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,830
well do this with every
kerb of course you can't do the second

292
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:52,840
kerb of course you can't do the second
 

293
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,510

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
about to lift it but the first subury
 

299
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,950
about to lift it but the first subury
should be able to be done in most

00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
should be able to be done in most
 

301
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,510
should be able to be done in most
ceiling Heights but caution is test out

302
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520

slowly first if you get carried away you

304
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
slowly first if you get carried away you
 

305
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,149
slowly first if you get carried away you
might be hitting the ceiling and causing

306
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:14,159
might be hitting the ceiling and causing
 

307
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,830
might be hitting the ceiling and causing
me to get in trouble as well as

308
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:16,840
me to get in trouble as well as
 

309
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,309
me to get in trouble as well as
yourself okay so that's the

310
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:19,319
yourself okay so that's the
 

311
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,990
yourself okay so that's the
system there's a whole seven subes do

312
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,000
system there's a whole seven subes do
 

313
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,710
system there's a whole seven subes do
them

314
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:23,720
them
 

315
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,830
them
individually one at a time if you can do

316
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:26,840
individually one at a time if you can do
 

317
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,029
individually one at a time if you can do
them nightly then

318
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:30,039
them nightly then
 

319
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:31,469
them nightly then
that's what I

320
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:31,479
that's what I
 

321
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,190
that's what I
recommend it will help with emis

322
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,200
recommend it will help with emis
 

323
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,709
