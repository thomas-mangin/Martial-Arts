because i don't have his body

154
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
because i don't have his body
 

155
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,990
because i don't have his body
and he's just going to push through

156
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000

 

157
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,309

doesn't work like that

158
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319

 

159
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:20,069

so even when i'm doing nico push through

160
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
