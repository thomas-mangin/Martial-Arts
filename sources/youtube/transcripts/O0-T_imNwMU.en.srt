be in our syllabus but it is a part of

24
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:36,149
be in our syllabus but it is a part of
 

25
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,850
be in our syllabus but it is a part of
traditional Aikido and I believe there's

26
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:37,860
traditional Aikido and I believe there's
 

27
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,470
traditional Aikido and I believe there's
a good reason it's a part of pretty

28
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:39,480
a good reason it's a part of pretty
 

29
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,930
a good reason it's a part of pretty
traditional like you know but the reason

30
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:41,940
traditional like you know but the reason
 

31
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,670
traditional like you know but the reason
for that is is different maybe than most

32
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
for that is is different maybe than most
 

33
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,569
for that is is different maybe than most
people would think

34
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:44,579
people would think
 

35
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,450
people would think
and so in Aikido our ideas of pinning

36
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:47,460
and so in Aikido our ideas of pinning
 

37
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,130
and so in Aikido our ideas of pinning

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,729
an opportunity that has arisen for us so
we're going to talk right now about the

44
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:55,739
we're going to talk right now about the
 

45
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,979
we're going to talk right now about the
differences in types of pins and we'll

46
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:57,989
differences in types of pins and we'll
 

47
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:58,849
differences in types of pins and we'll
talk about the differences of

48
00:00:58,849 --> 00:00:58,859
talk about the differences of
 

49
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,580

00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:01,590
traditional style jujitsu pins versus
 

51
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,039
traditional style jujitsu pins versus
modern style jujitsu pins and we're

52
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:04,049
modern style jujitsu pins and we're
 

53
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,479
modern style jujitsu pins and we're
gonna contrast and compare that to

54
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:05,489
gonna contrast and compare that to
 

55
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,910
gonna contrast and compare that to
aikido pins and why Aikido pins are the

56
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
aikido pins and why Aikido pins are the
 

57
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
aikido pins and why Aikido pins are the
way they are and understand the darson

58
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:09,930
way they are and understand the darson
 

59
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,140

sacrifices made 90 depends but IQ pins
 

61
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,870
sacrifices made 90 depends but IQ pins
are actually exactly perfectly designed

62
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880

00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,319
you're doing kind of as a last resort it
can help you control the weapon and it

164
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:56,329
can help you control the weapon and it
 

165
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,940
can help you control the weapon and it
can help you disarm the weapon in ways

166
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:57,950
can help you disarm the weapon in ways
 

167
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,349
can help you disarm the weapon in ways
that would be more difficult if you were

168
00:02:59,349 --> 00:02:59,359
that would be more difficult if you were
 

169
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:01,599
that would be more difficult if you were
both more autonomous by standing up but

170
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:01,609
both more autonomous by standing up but
 

171
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:03,220
both more autonomous by standing up but
in general they're what we don't want to

172
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,230
in general they're what we don't want to
 

173
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,720
in general they're what we don't want to
use they're what might just happen right

174
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:04,730
use they're what might just happen right
 

175
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,740
use they're what might just happen right
and they're there at the end of the

176
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:05,750
and they're there at the end of the
 

177
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,569
and they're there at the end of the
forms because it's the last thing I want

178
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:07,579
forms because it's the last thing I want
 

179
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,160
forms because it's the last thing I want
to do quite honestly so we're in talk

180
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,170
to do quite honestly so we're in talk
 

181
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,420
to do quite honestly so we're in talk
kind of about the pins now the first

182
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,430
kind of about the pins now the first
 

183
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,740
kind of about the pins now the first
thing to understand is the difference

184
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:11,750
thing to understand is the difference
 

185
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,099
thing to understand is the difference
between a modern style jujitsu pin or a

186

between a modern style jujitsu pin or a

00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
European martial arts of pins that you
 

199
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,150
European martial arts of pins that you
might see they've got different

200
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,160
might see they've got different
 

201
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,860
might see they've got different
objectives and these objectives might

202

objectives and these objectives might
 

203
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,780
objectives and these objectives might
seem really weird to you so first of all

seem really weird to you so first of all
 

205

of our takedown methods in Aikido are
gonna be done with arm control right so

210
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:37,910
gonna be done with arm control right so
 

211
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,420
gonna be done with arm control right so
meaning that I'm gonna have his arm in

212
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:40,430
meaning that I'm gonna have his arm in
 

213
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,069
meaning that I'm gonna have his arm in
some way to take him down and control

214
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:42,079
some way to take him down and control
 

215
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,690
some way to take him down and control
him so when a billion takedown it's

216
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:43,700
him so when a billion takedown it's
 

217
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,610
him so when a billion takedown it's
gonna be from the arm now the arm is not

218
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:45,620
gonna be from the arm now the arm is not
 

219
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,530
gonna be from the arm now the arm is not
the best way to take someone down the

220
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:47,540
the best way to take someone down the
 

221
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,539
the best way to take someone down the
reason is because his Center is not

222
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:49,549
reason is because his Center is not
 

223
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:51,460
reason is because his Center is not
directly attached to his arm so while

224
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:51,470
directly attached to his arm so while
 

225
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,140
directly attached to his arm so while
I'm trying to take him down he can move

226
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,150
I'm trying to take him down he can move
 

227
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,490
I'm trying to take him down he can move
his Center in all kinds of position it's

228
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:54,500
his Center in all kinds of position it's
 

229
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,750
his Center in all kinds of position it's
gonna be really hard for me to deal with

230
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
gonna be really hard for me to deal with
 

231
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,520
gonna be really hard for me to deal with
it would be much better to take him down

232
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,530
it would be much better to take him down
 

233
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,619
it would be much better to take him down
by getting a hold of a sinner or getting

234
00:03:59,619 --> 00:03:59,629
by getting a hold of a sinner or getting
 

235
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:01,059
by getting a hold of a sinner or getting
a hold of his leg that's a better way to

236
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:01,069
a hold of his leg that's a better way to
 

237
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:03,069
a hold of his leg that's a better way to
take someone down the problem with that

238
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:03,079
take someone down the problem with that
 

239
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:04,809
take someone down the problem with that
is if we're talking about weapons as you

240
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:04,819
is if we're talking about weapons as you
 

241
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,460
is if we're talking about weapons as you
would see in classical historical

242
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:06,470
would see in classical historical
 

243
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,080
would see in classical historical
European martial arts or in Japanese

244
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,090
European martial arts or in Japanese
 

245

jiu-jitsu if I don't account for those

246
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,160
jiu-jitsu if I don't account for those
 

247
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,670
jiu-jitsu if I don't account for those
arms he's got an arm free to stab me

248
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:12,680
arms he's got an arm free to stab me
 

249
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,259
arms he's got an arm free to stab me
right so if he's stabbing me right now

250
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:14,269
right so if he's stabbing me right now
 

251
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:15,670
right so if he's stabbing me right now
hitting me that would suck but that's

252
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
hitting me that would suck but that's
 

253
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,199
hitting me that would suck but that's
not nearly as bad as to be stabbing me

254
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:17,209
not nearly as bad as to be stabbing me
 

255
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,819
not nearly as bad as to be stabbing me
right so if I was like this

256
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:18,829
right so if I was like this
 

257
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,039
right so if I was like this
and that's killing me every single time

258
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:21,049
and that's killing me every single time
 

259
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:22,990
and that's killing me every single time
he's doing that I'm dying a little bit

260
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,000
he's doing that I'm dying a little bit
 

261
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,749
he's doing that I'm dying a little bit
more right so so I can't deal with this

262
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
more right so so I can't deal with this
 

263
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,219
more right so so I can't deal with this
guy and try and take him down without

264
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:27,229
guy and try and take him down without
 

265
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:29,439
guy and try and take him down without
first having control of that arm so

266
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:29,449
first having control of that arm so
 

267
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:31,059
first having control of that arm so
you're gonna see lots of pinning or

268
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:31,069
you're gonna see lots of pinning or
 

269
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:33,189
you're gonna see lots of pinning or
taking our methods that involve that arm

270
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
taking our methods that involve that arm
 

271
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,409
taking our methods that involve that arm
now once we get down with that says

272
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:35,419
now once we get down with that says
 

273
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:37,240
now once we get down with that says
let's say we just do a basic detail here

274
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,250
let's say we just do a basic detail here
 

275
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,520
let's say we just do a basic detail here
okay so we got a basic detail and you

276
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:39,530
okay so we got a basic detail and you
 

277
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,679
okay so we got a basic detail and you
look at a position like this now a

278
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:41,689
look at a position like this now a
 

279
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,659
look at a position like this now a
position like this might seem like a

280
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:43,669
position like this might seem like a
 

281
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,580
position like this might seem like a
dumb position right it's like this is

282
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:45,590
dumb position right it's like this is
 

283
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,379
dumb position right it's like this is
not the greatest controlling position

284
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:47,389
not the greatest controlling position
 

285
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:49,270
not the greatest controlling position
but now think of what I've done first

286
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
but now think of what I've done first
 

287
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,219
but now think of what I've done first
first thing I've done is I've isolated

288
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:51,229
first thing I've done is I've isolated
 

289
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:52,959
first thing I've done is I've isolated
this hand from the other one which is

290
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:52,969
this hand from the other one which is
 

291
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:55,540
this hand from the other one which is
fantastic for me because by doing this

292
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:55,550
fantastic for me because by doing this
 

293
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,550
fantastic for me because by doing this
kind of pin he can't reach across with

294
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:57,560
kind of pin he can't reach across with
 

295
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,290
kind of pin he can't reach across with
the other hand and switch right you can

296
00:04:59,290 --> 00:04:59,300
the other hand and switch right you can
 

297
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,270
the other hand and switch right you can
try any way he wants the switches okay

298
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
try any way he wants the switches okay
 

299
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,550
try any way he wants the switches okay
now let's say he had another weapon he'd

300
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:03,560
now let's say he had another weapon he'd
 

301
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,749
now let's say he had another weapon he'd
probably have to recover it from there

302
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:04,759
probably have to recover it from there
 

303
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,459
probably have to recover it from there
and by the time he's doing this I can

304
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:06,469
and by the time he's doing this I can
 

305
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:08,080
and by the time he's doing this I can
get over here to control this so we're

306
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,090
get over here to control this so we're
 

307
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,089
get over here to control this so we're
thinking about arm control and weapon

308
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:10,099
thinking about arm control and weapon
 

309
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:12,100
thinking about arm control and weapon
control this is the kind of pin you

310
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,110
control this is the kind of pin you
 

311
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,379
control this is the kind of pin you
might want to have right so it might be

312
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:14,389
might want to have right so it might be
 

313
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,050
might want to have right so it might be
done in this fashion it might be done in

314
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,060
done in this fashion it might be done in
 

315
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,580
done in this fashion it might be done in
this fashion there's lots of different

316
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,590
this fashion there's lots of different
 

317
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,019
this fashion there's lots of different
ways we can go to it but these are the

318
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:20,029
ways we can go to it but these are the
 

319
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,790
ways we can go to it but these are the
