00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,590

I'm Christopher Hine. Uh last video we

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:03,600
I'm Christopher Hine. Uh last video we
 

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,829
I'm Christopher Hine. Uh last video we
talked about uh the Tino Henko and the

4
00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:05,839
talked about uh the Tino Henko and the
 

5
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,990
talked about uh the Tino Henko and the
Roku Tino Henko and and kind of what

6
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,000
Roku Tino Henko and and kind of what
 

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,150
Roku Tino Henko and and kind of what
that is. And I said that I'm taking

8
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,160
that is. And I said that I'm taking
 

9
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,190
that is. And I said that I'm taking
things in a new direction. Um and kind

10
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
things in a new direction. Um and kind
 

11
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,549
things in a new direction. Um and kind
of getting away from that a little bit.

12
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:14,559
of getting away from that a little bit.
 

13
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,990
of getting away from that a little bit.
It's not to say that I'm ever going to

14
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
It's not to say that I'm ever going to
 

15
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,230
It's not to say that I'm ever going to
stop using that because they're clever

16
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
stop using that because they're clever
 

17
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,470
stop using that because they're clever
little ways to explain a way you move to

18
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
little ways to explain a way you move to
 

19
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,029
little ways to explain a way you move to
a position, but overall I think they end

20
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
a position, but overall I think they end
 

21
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,910
a position, but overall I think they end
up being more confusing uh for like

22
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
up being more confusing uh for like
 

23
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,750
up being more confusing uh for like
beginning middling students than they

24
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
beginning middling students than they
 

25
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,589
beginning middling students than they
need to be. So So I'm changing it. So,

26
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
need to be. So So I'm changing it. So,
 

27
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,790
need to be. So So I'm changing it. So,
I'm going to talk right now about the

28
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
I'm going to talk right now about the
 

29
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,150
I'm going to talk right now about the
way I change it. And I'm going to talk

30
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160
way I change it. And I'm going to talk
 

31
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,389
way I change it. And I'm going to talk
about positions and what positions are

32
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:34,399
about positions and what positions are
 

33
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,270
about positions and what positions are
and how positions really dictate the

34
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,280
and how positions really dictate the
 

35
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,549
and how positions really dictate the
movement you need to make. And the

36
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:38,559
movement you need to make. And the
 

37
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,150
movement you need to make. And the
movement you need to make from one

38
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
movement you need to make from one
 

39
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,389
movement you need to make from one
position to another position is the tino

40
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
position to another position is the tino
 

41
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,470
position to another position is the tino
hinko, right? So, that little brief

42
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,480
hinko, right? So, that little brief
 

43
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,630
hinko, right? So, that little brief
second is what it is, but it's simpler

44
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
second is what it is, but it's simpler
 

45
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,910
second is what it is, but it's simpler
to talk about them than I've talked

46
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
to talk about them than I've talked
 

47
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,590
to talk about them than I've talked
about it in the past. So, I'm gonna get

48
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
about it in the past. So, I'm gonna get
 

49
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,869
about it in the past. So, I'm gonna get
Josh and Maya out here. We're going to

50
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
Josh and Maya out here. We're going to
 

51
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,549
Josh and Maya out here. We're going to
go to work. Josh, Maya,

52
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
go to work. Josh, Maya,
 

53
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,709
go to work. Josh, Maya,
is we're on long jog right now. Long

54
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
is we're on long jog right now. Long
 

55
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,310
is we're on long jog right now. Long
jog.

56
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
jog.
 

57
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,549
jog.
All right. Okay. So, so let's talk about

58
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
All right. Okay. So, so let's talk about
 

59
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,469
All right. Okay. So, so let's talk about
position uh and how I'm kind of talking

60
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
position uh and how I'm kind of talking
 

61
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,789
position uh and how I'm kind of talking
about stuff. Um the term tino is still

62
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
about stuff. Um the term tino is still
 

63
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,469
about stuff. Um the term tino is still
absolutely necessary. And to me, Tino

64
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
absolutely necessary. And to me, Tino
 

65
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,870
absolutely necessary. And to me, Tino
Henko is describing the moment that I

66
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
Henko is describing the moment that I
 

67
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,710
Henko is describing the moment that I
change from one position to another

68
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
change from one position to another
 

69
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,950
change from one position to another
position and the stuff that's kind of

70
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
position and the stuff that's kind of
 

71
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,870
position and the stuff that's kind of
included in that. But I've kind of

72
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
included in that. But I've kind of
 

73
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,350
included in that. But I've kind of
stopped hitting that so hard in lots of

74
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
stopped hitting that so hard in lots of
 

75
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,190
stopped hitting that so hard in lots of
ways because really what's important is

76
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
ways because really what's important is
 

77
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,950
ways because really what's important is
you need to understand the position,

78
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
you need to understand the position,
 

79
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,550
you need to understand the position,
what a better position is than the one

80
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
what a better position is than the one
 

81
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,230
what a better position is than the one
you're in and how to get there. And that

82
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
you're in and how to get there. And that
 

83
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,469
you're in and how to get there. And that
is all of course included in tino just

84
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
is all of course included in tino just
 

85
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,510
is all of course included in tino just
looking at it in a slightly different

86
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
looking at it in a slightly different
 

87
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,190
looking at it in a slightly different
way. Okay, so we've talked about this

88
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
way. Okay, so we've talked about this
 

89
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,510
way. Okay, so we've talked about this
before. If it's just me and Josh, right?

90
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
before. If it's just me and Josh, right?
 

91
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,630
before. If it's just me and Josh, right?
So we're just looking at me and Josh

92
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
So we're just looking at me and Josh
 

93
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,630
So we're just looking at me and Josh
right now. You have muhani that's

94
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
right now. You have muhani that's
 

95
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,870
right now. You have muhani that's
without a hanmi. You have hanmi. This

96
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
without a hanmi. You have hanmi. This
 

97
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,149
without a hanmi. You have hanmi. This
hanmi because my left leg is closest to

98
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
hanmi because my left leg is closest to
 

99
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,310
hanmi because my left leg is closest to
Josh's left leg. So those match is I

100
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
Josh's left leg. So those match is I
 

101
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,950
Josh's left leg. So those match is I
hani. If I got offline slightly like

102
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
hani. If I got offline slightly like
 

103
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,190
hani. If I got offline slightly like
this, this would be gaku hani because my

104
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
this, this would be gaku hani because my
 

105
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,590
this, this would be gaku hani because my
right leg is closest to Josh's left leg.

106
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
right leg is closest to Josh's left leg.
 

107
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,350
right leg is closest to Josh's left leg.
So in that way we're opposite and that's

108
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
So in that way we're opposite and that's
 

109
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,270
So in that way we're opposite and that's
gaku, right? So if I came back like

110
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
gaku, right? So if I came back like
 

111
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,510
gaku, right? So if I came back like
that, then that would be gaku. If I came

112
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
that, then that would be gaku. If I came
 

113
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,950
that, then that would be gaku. If I came
off like this, this would be I. But

114
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
off like this, this would be I. But
 

115
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,469
off like this, this would be I. But
these are both just hani. And we're

116
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
these are both just hani. And we're
 

117
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,030
these are both just hani. And we're
having our bodies up like halfing our

118
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,040
having our bodies up like halfing our
 

119
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,990
having our bodies up like halfing our
bodies up. Okay. Then we have hitoi,

120
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
bodies up. Okay. Then we have hitoi,
 

121
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,830
bodies up. Okay. Then we have hitoi,
which is a side by side position. It

122
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
which is a side by side position. It
 

123
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,910
which is a side by side position. It
means in line in Japanese. So we're in

124
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
means in line in Japanese. So we're in
 

125
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,670
means in line in Japanese. So we're in
line like this. And that could be done a

126
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
line like this. And that could be done a
 

127
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,949
line like this. And that could be done a
few different ways, right? So we could

128
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
few different ways, right? So we could
 

129
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,430
few different ways, right? So we could
be I which is facing the same direction.

130
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
be I which is facing the same direction.
 

131
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,670
be I which is facing the same direction.
We could be choku, which is at a 90°

132
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
We could be choku, which is at a 90°
 

133
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,670
We could be choku, which is at a 90°
angle. Or we could be yaku, which is

134
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
angle. Or we could be yaku, which is
 

135
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,229
angle. Or we could be yaku, which is
opposite. Right? Okay. Then we have

136
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
opposite. Right? Okay. Then we have
 

137
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,949
opposite. Right? Okay. Then we have
eini. And that is this position. And I

138
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959
eini. And that is this position. And I
 

139
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,030
eini. And that is this position. And I
think of this as a transitory position

140
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
think of this as a transitory position
 

141
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,229
think of this as a transitory position
that you're not going to keep for very

142
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
that you're not going to keep for very
 

143
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,589
that you're not going to keep for very
long. He's going to be trying to turn

144
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
long. He's going to be trying to turn
 

145
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,510
long. He's going to be trying to turn
around. So that's why this isn't the

146
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:31,520
around. So that's why this isn't the
 

147
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,470
around. So that's why this isn't the
cooho or position. It is the edimi

148
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,480
cooho or position. It is the edimi
 

149
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,750
cooho or position. It is the edimi
position because I'm constantly working

150
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
position because I'm constantly working
 

151
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,509
position because I'm constantly working
to get this. When I'm back here, I'm

152
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
to get this. When I'm back here, I'm
 

153
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,030
to get this. When I'm back here, I'm
either going to be I facing the same

154
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
either going to be I facing the same
 

155
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,710
either going to be I facing the same
direction as Josh. Choku 90° to Josh or

156
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
direction as Josh. Choku 90° to Josh or
 

157
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,030
direction as Josh. Choku 90° to Josh or
Gyaku opposite of Josh. Right? So we've

158
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
Gyaku opposite of Josh. Right? So we've
 

159
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,790
Gyaku opposite of Josh. Right? So we've
talked about those before and that's the

160
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
talked about those before and that's the
 

161
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,150
talked about those before and that's the
way I kind of want to start pushing

162
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
way I kind of want to start pushing
 

163
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,910
way I kind of want to start pushing
people to think. Now, you also have to

164
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
people to think. Now, you also have to
 

165
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,990
people to think. Now, you also have to
understand that we have positions for

166
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
understand that we have positions for
 

167
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,150
understand that we have positions for
multiple attackers as well. Okay? So,

168
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
multiple attackers as well. Okay? So,
 

169
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,270
multiple attackers as well. Okay? So,
actually, I'm gonna have you guys just

170
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
actually, I'm gonna have you guys just
 

171
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,550
actually, I'm gonna have you guys just
stand shoulder-to-shoulder facing the

172
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
stand shoulder-to-shoulder facing the
 

173
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,509
stand shoulder-to-shoulder facing the
camera because I think it'll be easier

174
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
camera because I think it'll be easier
 

175
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,550
camera because I think it'll be easier
for the camera to kind of figure out

176
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
for the camera to kind of figure out
 

177
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,949
for the camera to kind of figure out
when I do this. Okay? If we're in this

178
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
when I do this. Okay? If we're in this
 

179
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,830
when I do this. Okay? If we're in this
kind of situation, this is analogous to

180
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
kind of situation, this is analogous to
 

181
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,070
kind of situation, this is analogous to
aito and me, right? So, we're a side by

182
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
aito and me, right? So, we're a side by
 

183
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,869
aito and me, right? So, we're a side by
side. Okay? And I would try to push to

184
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
side. Okay? And I would try to push to
 

185
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,550
side. Okay? And I would try to push to
get behind these guys, right? So, I'd

186
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
get behind these guys, right? So, I'd
 

187
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,550
get behind these guys, right? So, I'd
try to get to Edimi. So, if we look at

188
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
try to get to Edimi. So, if we look at
 

189
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,270
try to get to Edimi. So, if we look at
them like one, right, as one group, then

190
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
them like one, right, as one group, then
 

191
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,350
them like one, right, as one group, then
we would have Muhani on dead center in

192
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
we would have Muhani on dead center in
 

193
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,869
we would have Muhani on dead center in
the two of them. And then if I start to

194
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
the two of them. And then if I start to
 

195
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,229
the two of them. And then if I start to
get off to the side, we would have

196
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
get off to the side, we would have
 

197
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,710
get off to the side, we would have
hanmi. If I get to this line, we have

198
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
hanmi. If I get to this line, we have
 

199
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,869
hanmi. If I get to this line, we have
hitomi. And if I get behind them, we

200
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
hitomi. And if I get behind them, we
 

201
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,790
hitomi. And if I get behind them, we
would have edimi. Right now, really

202
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:26,800
would have edimi. Right now, really
 

203
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,390
would have edimi. Right now, really
transitory for the edimi because there's

204
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
transitory for the edimi because there's
 

205
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,670
transitory for the edimi because there's
two of them. I'm almost never going to

206
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
two of them. I'm almost never going to
 

207
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,190
two of them. I'm almost never going to
be in this situation very long because

208
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
be in this situation very long because
 

209
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,470
be in this situation very long because
one of them is going to turn around real

210
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
one of them is going to turn around real
 

211
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,830
one of them is going to turn around real
quick and and we're going to break that.

212
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
quick and and we're going to break that.
 

213
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,990
quick and and we're going to break that.
Okay? So, we can look at it that way.

214
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay? So, we can look at it that way.
 

215
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,830
Okay? So, we can look at it that way.
But then I also have names just

216
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
But then I also have names just
 

217
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,470
But then I also have names just
specifically for the formations, like

218
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
specifically for the formations, like
 

219
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,030
specifically for the formations, like
how we look together. And this is really

220
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
how we look together. And this is really
 

221
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,030
how we look together. And this is really
how you should start working if you're

222
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
how you should start working if you're
 

223
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,949
how you should start working if you're
working a a multiple attack or dangerous

224
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
working a a multiple attack or dangerous
 

225
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,509
working a a multiple attack or dangerous
situation because by understanding these

226
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
situation because by understanding these
 

227
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,750
situation because by understanding these
uh formations, you'll always be able to

228
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
uh formations, you'll always be able to
 

229
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,910
uh formations, you'll always be able to
know what the next best position is,

230
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
know what the next best position is,
 

231
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,589
know what the next best position is,
right? And of course, this we could

232
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
right? And of course, this we could
 

233
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,949
right? And of course, this we could
compound this with the previous

234
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
compound this with the previous
 

235
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,190
compound this with the previous
examples, right? So, if these two are

236
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
examples, right? So, if these two are
 

237
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,190
examples, right? So, if these two are
side by side and I'm in the middle of

238
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
side by side and I'm in the middle of
 

239
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,149
side by side and I'm in the middle of
them, okay, like this, this is called a

240
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
them, okay, like this, this is called a
 

241
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,350
them, okay, like this, this is called a
V formation because they shoot off of me

242
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
V formation because they shoot off of me
 

243
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,589
V formation because they shoot off of me
to my sides like this. This is not a

244
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
to my sides like this. This is not a
 

245
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,670
to my sides like this. This is not a
very good position, but absolutely still

246
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
very good position, but absolutely still
 

247
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,429
very good position, but absolutely still
not the worst position because the worst

248
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
not the worst position because the worst
 

249
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,949
not the worst position because the worst
position would be me being in the

250
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
position would be me being in the
 

251
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,110
position would be me being in the
middle. Right? So now why this position

252
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
middle. Right? So now why this position
 

253
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,670
middle. Right? So now why this position
is so bad is if I'm dealing with Maya, I

254
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
is so bad is if I'm dealing with Maya, I
 

255
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,430
is so bad is if I'm dealing with Maya, I
can't deal with Josh. And I turn around

256
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
can't deal with Josh. And I turn around
 

257
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,189
can't deal with Josh. And I turn around
to deal with Josh, suddenly I can't deal

258
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
to deal with Josh, suddenly I can't deal
 

259
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,350
to deal with Josh, suddenly I can't deal
with Maya. So they can always attack me

260
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
with Maya. So they can always attack me
 

261
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,350
with Maya. So they can always attack me
from my rear side, which is really bad

262
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
from my rear side, which is really bad
 

263
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,430
from my rear side, which is really bad
for me. Even if I was kind of like this,

264
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
for me. Even if I was kind of like this,
 

265
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,870
for me. Even if I was kind of like this,
I can only kind of half deal with one,

266
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
I can only kind of half deal with one,
 

267
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,230
I can only kind of half deal with one,
half deal with the other. This would be

268
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
half deal with the other. This would be
 

269
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,670
half deal with the other. This would be
my best hope from this terrible

270
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
my best hope from this terrible
 

271
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,390
my best hope from this terrible
position, but um it's not a good one,

272
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
position, but um it's not a good one,
 

273
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,830
position, but um it's not a good one,
right? And we call this a trap

274
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
right? And we call this a trap
 

275
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,830
right? And we call this a trap
formation. And the name for that comes

276
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
formation. And the name for that comes
 

277
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,710
formation. And the name for that comes
from if I'm back here in a V formation,

278
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
from if I'm back here in a V formation,
 

279
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,990
from if I'm back here in a V formation,
turn around for me. Okay. If I'm back

280
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
turn around for me. Okay. If I'm back
 

281
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,070
turn around for me. Okay. If I'm back
here in a V formation, it might be

282
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
here in a V formation, it might be
 

283
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,070
here in a V formation, it might be
enticing sometimes to think I can go

284
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
enticing sometimes to think I can go
 

285
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,150
enticing sometimes to think I can go
through the middle. But you don't

286
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
through the middle. But you don't
 

287
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,230
through the middle. But you don't
realize how close together these two

288
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
realize how close together these two
 

289
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,990
realize how close together these two
really are. Right? So if they just stick

290
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
really are. Right? So if they just stick
 

291
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,230
really are. Right? So if they just stick
out their arms right now, there is no

292
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
out their arms right now, there is no
 

293
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,230
out their arms right now, there is no
gap there at all. I cannot get through

294
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
gap there at all. I cannot get through
 

295
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,590
gap there at all. I cannot get through
at all. Right? And all it takes is

296
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
at all. Right? And all it takes is
 

297
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,150
at all. Right? And all it takes is
either one of them to raise an arm and I

298
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
either one of them to raise an arm and I
 

299
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,909
either one of them to raise an arm and I
can't get it. Even if they're slightly

300
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
can't get it. Even if they're slightly
 

301
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,909
can't get it. Even if they're slightly
wider. Okay, that's significantly wider.

302
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
wider. Okay, that's significantly wider.
 

303
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,830
wider. Okay, that's significantly wider.
Go ahead and raise your arms. Notice

304
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
Go ahead and raise your arms. Notice
 

305
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,670
Go ahead and raise your arms. Notice
we're still not in Hanmi. So look, even

306
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
we're still not in Hanmi. So look, even
 

307
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,590
we're still not in Hanmi. So look, even
though this they're pretty far apart

308
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
though this they're pretty far apart
 

309
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,950
though this they're pretty far apart
now, let's have them go out to where

310
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
now, let's have them go out to where
 

311
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,550
now, let's have them go out to where
Hani is. So now out here in Maai, when

312
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
Hani is. So now out here in Maai, when
 

313
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,110
Hani is. So now out here in Maai, when
we're in Maai, look at how big the gap

314
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
we're in Maai, look at how big the gap
 

315
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,749
we're in Maai, look at how big the gap
is. The gap's enormous, right? So that's

316
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
is. The gap's enormous, right? So that's
 

317
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,430
is. The gap's enormous, right? So that's
where you would have to be normally in

318
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
where you would have to be normally in
 

319
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,150
where you would have to be normally in
ID to make a safe play uh for Hani,

320
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
ID to make a safe play uh for Hani,
 

321
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,430
ID to make a safe play uh for Hani,
right? So I'd want to be in a Hani

322
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
right? So I'd want to be in a Hani
 

323
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,870
right? So I'd want to be in a Hani
situation. They have to be that wide.

324
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
situation. They have to be that wide.
 

325
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,629
situation. They have to be that wide.
Look how wide that is. Right? Now, if

326
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
Look how wide that is. Right? Now, if
 

327
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,070
Look how wide that is. Right? Now, if
they are wider than that, it's not

328
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
they are wider than that, it's not
 

329
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,670
they are wider than that, it's not
really a trap formation anymore, right?

330
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
really a trap formation anymore, right?
 

331
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,870
really a trap formation anymore, right?
So, if they're significantly wider,

332
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
So, if they're significantly wider,
 

333
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,310
So, if they're significantly wider,
you're just dealing with one person. The

334
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
you're just dealing with one person. The
 

335
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,670
you're just dealing with one person. The
other person's too far away to worry

336
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
other person's too far away to worry
 

337
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,990
other person's too far away to worry
about, right? But up until then, it's a

338
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
about, right? But up until then, it's a
 

339
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,510
about, right? But up until then, it's a
trap formation, right? So, come back in

340
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
trap formation, right? So, come back in
 

341
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,469
trap formation, right? So, come back in
for me. So, they come in here. This this

342
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
for me. So, they come in here. This this
 

343
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,830
for me. So, they come in here. This this
is bad for me, right? So, I'm probably

344
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
is bad for me, right? So, I'm probably
 

345
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,110
is bad for me, right? So, I'm probably
not going to get through that. Okay? But

346
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
not going to get through that. Okay? But
 

347
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,430
not going to get through that. Okay? But
this position is still better than the

348
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
this position is still better than the
 

349
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,150
this position is still better than the
position of uh a trap formation, right?

350
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
position of uh a trap formation, right?
 

351
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,749
position of uh a trap formation, right?
So, be in a trap. So, right here, I'm in

352
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
So, be in a trap. So, right here, I'm in
 

353
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,590
So, be in a trap. So, right here, I'm in
a V. All right? Now, if I manage to come

354
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
a V. All right? Now, if I manage to come
 

355
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,990
a V. All right? Now, if I manage to come
off to the side, we call this a stagger.

356
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
off to the side, we call this a stagger.
 

357
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,590
off to the side, we call this a stagger.
So if they turn towards me a little bit,

358
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
So if they turn towards me a little bit,
 

359
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,590
So if they turn towards me a little bit,
we have a stagger formation now. Now a

360
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
we have a stagger formation now. Now a
 

361
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,469
we have a stagger formation now. Now a
stagger formation is much better because

362
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
stagger formation is much better because
 

363
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,469
stagger formation is much better because
deal with them one at a time. They're

364
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
deal with them one at a time. They're
 

365
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,390
deal with them one at a time. They're
not both coming up at me. Now if I was

366
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
not both coming up at me. Now if I was
 

367
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,629
not both coming up at me. Now if I was
back here in the V formation, they come

368
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
back here in the V formation, they come
 

369
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,629
back here in the V formation, they come
at me at the same time, which means I'm

370
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
at me at the same time, which means I'm
 

371
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,790
at me at the same time, which means I'm
still having to deal with them at once,

372
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
still having to deal with them at once,
 

373
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,790
still having to deal with them at once,
right? So I don't have a time advantage

374
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
right? So I don't have a time advantage
 

375
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,150
right? So I don't have a time advantage
because they still come to me at the

376
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
because they still come to me at the
 

377
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,309
because they still come to me at the
same time. But when I get over here,

378
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
same time. But when I get over here,
 

379
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,830
same time. But when I get over here,
I've messed things up for them a little

380
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
I've messed things up for them a little
 

381
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,350
I've messed things up for them a little
bit. Josh is going to get to me before

382
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
bit. Josh is going to get to me before
 

383
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,350
bit. Josh is going to get to me before
Maya, and that's really, really good. So

384
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
Maya, and that's really, really good. So
 

385
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,430
Maya, and that's really, really good. So
I want to start staggering them. Now, a

386
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
I want to start staggering them. Now, a
 

387
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,270
I want to start staggering them. Now, a
better position yet would be to come

388
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
better position yet would be to come
 

389
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,110
better position yet would be to come
here and put them perfectly in line with

390
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
here and put them perfectly in line with
 

391
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,150
here and put them perfectly in line with
each other. And now that they're

392
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
each other. And now that they're
 

393
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,909
each other. And now that they're
perfectly in line with each other, Josh

394
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
perfectly in line with each other, Josh
 

395
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,309
perfectly in line with each other, Josh
is always blocking Maya's move. Maya's

396
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
is always blocking Maya's move. Maya's
 

397
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,390
is always blocking Maya's move. Maya's
always got to come around Josh or hit

398
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
always got to come around Josh or hit
 

399
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,469
always got to come around Josh or hit
Josh first or whatever. So, this is way

400
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
Josh first or whatever. So, this is way
 

401
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,790
Josh first or whatever. So, this is way
better for me because Josh is in the way

402
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
better for me because Josh is in the way
 

403
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,590
better for me because Josh is in the way
of Maya. Okay. Now, understand the best

404
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
of Maya. Okay. Now, understand the best
 

405
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,430
of Maya. Okay. Now, understand the best
position, which is this position, an eye

406
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
position, which is this position, an eye
 

407
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,629
position, which is this position, an eye
formation in a two attacker formation,

408
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
formation in a two attacker formation,
 

409
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,270
formation in a two attacker formation,
is still the worst position in a

410
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
is still the worst position in a
 

411
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,189
is still the worst position in a
multiple attacker situation. So look,

412
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
multiple attacker situation. So look,
 

413
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,870
multiple attacker situation. So look,
I'm still or in a single attacker

414
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
I'm still or in a single attacker
 

415
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,790
I'm still or in a single attacker
position. I'm still one-on-one with

416
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
position. I'm still one-on-one with
 

417
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,029
position. I'm still one-on-one with
Josh, right? So I'm still in muhani with

418
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
Josh, right? So I'm still in muhani with
 

419
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,350
Josh, right? So I'm still in muhani with
Josh, which is no good, right? If I come

420
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
Josh, which is no good, right? If I come
 

421
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,189
Josh, which is no good, right? If I come
out of this muhan me, I get into a

422
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
out of this muhan me, I get into a
 

423
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,870
out of this muhan me, I get into a
slightly worse position with Maya

424
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
slightly worse position with Maya
 

425
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,950
slightly worse position with Maya
because I give her a free reign, right?

426
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
because I give her a free reign, right?
 

427
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,629
because I give her a free reign, right?
So multiple attackers, even if you

428
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
So multiple attackers, even if you
 

429
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,309
So multiple attackers, even if you
understand how to deal with them, is

430
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
understand how to deal with them, is
 

431
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,189
understand how to deal with them, is
always worse than one attacker. And that

432
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
always worse than one attacker. And that
 

433
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,550
always worse than one attacker. And that
might sound silly that I said that right

434
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
might sound silly that I said that right
 

435
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,790
might sound silly that I said that right
now, but it's it's worth noting that the

436
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
now, but it's it's worth noting that the
 

437
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,710
now, but it's it's worth noting that the
best position for multiple attackers is

438
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
best position for multiple attackers is
 

439
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,469
best position for multiple attackers is
still the worst position for one

440
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
still the worst position for one
 

441
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,309
still the worst position for one
attacker. So you you kind of can't get

442
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
attacker. So you you kind of can't get
 

443
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,390
attacker. So you you kind of can't get
around it. Okay. So these are uh the

444
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
around it. Okay. So these are uh the
 

445
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,790
around it. Okay. So these are uh the
basic formations we use. So we can talk

446
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
basic formations we use. So we can talk
 

447
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,390
basic formations we use. So we can talk
about them in a few different ways. To

448
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
about them in a few different ways. To
 

449
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,309
about them in a few different ways. To
me, the formations are easier to talk

450
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
me, the formations are easier to talk
 

451
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,150
me, the formations are easier to talk
about when we're looking at multiple

452
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
about when we're looking at multiple
 

453
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,670
about when we're looking at multiple
people. Right? Now, of course, what I'd

454
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
people. Right? Now, of course, what I'd
 

455
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,110
people. Right? Now, of course, what I'd
like to do is get behind those guys. If

456
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
like to do is get behind those guys. If
 

457
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,550
like to do is get behind those guys. If
I can get behind of them, great. But

458
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
I can get behind of them, great. But
 

459
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,309
I can get behind of them, great. But
it's going to be mega transitory, right?

460
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
it's going to be mega transitory, right?
 

461
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,950
it's going to be mega transitory, right?
So using edimei for that really isn't

462
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
So using edimei for that really isn't
 

463
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,390
So using edimei for that really isn't
that great. Although that is what you

464
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
that great. Although that is what you
 

465
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,909
that great. Although that is what you
would achieve if you break the line,

466
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919
would achieve if you break the line,
 

467
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,029
would achieve if you break the line,
right? Right? So, if I was dealing with

468
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
right? Right? So, if I was dealing with
 

469
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,710
right? Right? So, if I was dealing with
these guys and we were in a stagger

470
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
these guys and we were in a stagger
 

471
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,110
these guys and we were in a stagger
formation and I could manage to get here

472
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
formation and I could manage to get here
 

473
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,790
formation and I could manage to get here
that I would be shooting edei, right?

474
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
that I would be shooting edei, right?
 

475
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,469
that I would be shooting edei, right?
So, I've achieved edei as long as

476
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:56,479
So, I've achieved edei as long as
 

477
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,070
So, I've achieved edei as long as
they're both that way. But you can see

478
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
they're both that way. But you can see
 

479
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,670
they're both that way. But you can see
and they want to do it right now. The

480
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
and they want to do it right now. The
 

481
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,869
and they want to do it right now. The
second I get back here, they're both

482
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
second I get back here, they're both
 

483
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,790
second I get back here, they're both
just going to turn and I'm no longer in

484
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
just going to turn and I'm no longer in
 

485
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,710
just going to turn and I'm no longer in
that edi position, right? So, I got into

486
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
that edi position, right? So, I got into
 

487
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,629
that edi position, right? So, I got into
a stagger position, which was better

488
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
a stagger position, which was better
 

489
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,230
a stagger position, which was better
than the V formation that I found myself

490
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
than the V formation that I found myself
 

491
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,909
than the V formation that I found myself
in in the beginning, but still not

492
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
in in the beginning, but still not
 

493
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,550
in in the beginning, but still not
wonderful, right? So using these

494
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
wonderful, right? So using these
 

495
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,390
wonderful, right? So using these
multiple attacker formations is a really

496
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
multiple attacker formations is a really
 

497
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,070
multiple attacker formations is a really
good way to start sussing out what you

498
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
good way to start sussing out what you
 

499
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,510
good way to start sussing out what you
should do when there are multiple people

500
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
should do when there are multiple people
 

501
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,029
should do when there are multiple people
attacking you. You're trying to get into

502
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
attacking you. You're trying to get into
 

503
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,550
attacking you. You're trying to get into
eye positions. That's what you're trying

504
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
eye positions. That's what you're trying
 

505
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,309
eye positions. That's what you're trying
to do. If you're dealing with one

506
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
to do. If you're dealing with one
 

507
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,510
to do. If you're dealing with one
person, looking at that one person

508
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
person, looking at that one person
 

509
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,950
person, looking at that one person
you're dealing with, then of course you

510
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
you're dealing with, then of course you
 

511
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,550
you're dealing with, then of course you
want to understand how to work the other

512
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,560
want to understand how to work the other
 

513
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,589
want to understand how to work the other
positions from there. But confusing them

514
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
positions from there. But confusing them
 

515
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,430
positions from there. But confusing them
can be difficult, right? So for example,

516
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
can be difficult, right? So for example,
 

517
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,430
can be difficult, right? So for example,
if I'm in a good eye formation and I go

518
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
if I'm in a good eye formation and I go
 

519
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,350
if I'm in a good eye formation and I go
and I'm thinking one-on-one attacker and

520
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
and I'm thinking one-on-one attacker and
 

521
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,029
and I'm thinking one-on-one attacker and
I say, "Oh, well, I want to get edi.

522
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
I say, "Oh, well, I want to get edi.
 

523
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,430
I say, "Oh, well, I want to get edi.
Now I'm in the best or I'm in the worst

524
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
Now I'm in the best or I'm in the worst
 

525
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,509
Now I'm in the best or I'm in the worst
position. Right? So you always have to

526
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
position. Right? So you always have to
 

527
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,509
position. Right? So you always have to
be able to juggle the two people and

528
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
be able to juggle the two people and
 

529
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,190
be able to juggle the two people and
understand what it is your goal you're

530
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
understand what it is your goal you're
 

531
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,430
understand what it is your goal you're
trying to achieve is. It's not static.

532
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
trying to achieve is. It's not static.
 

533
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,269
trying to achieve is. It's not static.
It's always dynamic. Right? So that's

534
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
It's always dynamic. Right? So that's
 

535
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,630
It's always dynamic. Right? So that's
how you're looking at it. All right. So

536
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
how you're looking at it. All right. So
 

537
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,150
how you're looking at it. All right. So
I hope that was less confusing instead

538
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
I hope that was less confusing instead
 

539
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,670
I hope that was less confusing instead
of more confusing. I'll make more

540
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
of more confusing. I'll make more
 

541
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,350
of more confusing. I'll make more
material if you want on it. Um I also

542
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
material if you want on it. Um I also
 

543
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,710
material if you want on it. Um I also
have a few written things out there that

544
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
have a few written things out there that
 

545
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,470
have a few written things out there that
you can look at. I'm Christopher Hines.

546
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
you can look at. I'm Christopher Hines.
 

547
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,630
you can look at. I'm Christopher Hines.
