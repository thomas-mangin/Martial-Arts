00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
um
 

257
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,390
um
and we were using rotational uh

258
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
and we were using rotational uh
 

259
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,110
and we were using rotational uh
deviation to get it okay

260
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
deviation to get it okay
 

261
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,629
deviation to get it okay
um

262
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
um
 

263
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,749
um
you can of course as she goes in

264
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
you can of course as she goes in
 

265
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,550
you can of course as she goes in
and she comes back there is a desired

266
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
and she comes back there is a desired
 

267
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,950
and she comes back there is a desired
depth on her part because she entered

268
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
depth on her part because she entered
 

269
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,350
depth on her part because she entered
the dichotomous mind frame

270
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
the dichotomous mind frame
 

271
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,469
the dichotomous mind frame
so she you have a desired depth to it

272
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
so she you have a desired depth to it
 

273
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,590
so she you have a desired depth to it
and you get it she's in an antagonistic

274
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
and you get it she's in an antagonistic
 

275
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,270
and you get it she's in an antagonistic
relationship with me

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,550

okay let's try that reconciliation here

346
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
okay let's try that reconciliation here
 

347
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,990

next
 

351
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,710
next
even when i have an angle of deflection

352
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
even when i have an angle of deflection
 

353
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,749

477
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,990

okay let's try that one so i'm moving

478
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
okay let's try that one so i'm moving
 

479
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,710
okay let's try that one so i'm moving
in a deviation over to four o'clock okay

480
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
in a deviation over to four o'clock okay
 

481
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,430
in a deviation over to four o'clock okay
let's

482

so you're going to feel where her
 

519
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,949
so you're going to feel where her
pressure is i know it's going that way

520
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
pressure is i know it's going that way
 

521
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,269
pressure is i know it's going that way
do you understand

522
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
do you understand
 

523
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,829
do you understand
and uh

524
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
and uh
 

525
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,550
and uh
i can feel there's pressure here on her

526
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
i can feel there's pressure here on her
 

527
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,509
i can feel there's pressure here on her
head keep going and then this shoulder

528
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
head keep going and then this shoulder
 

529
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,150
head keep going and then this shoulder
comes in you see

530
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
comes in you see
 

531
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,310
comes in you see
so same thing

532

this way
 

537
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,050
this way
nothing changes

538
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,060
nothing changes
 

539

541
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,509

don't enter into the struggle

542
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
don't enter into the struggle
 

543
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,150
don't enter into the struggle
don't run away from it

544
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
don't run away from it
 

545
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,389
don't run away from it
it's a perfect sweet spot

546
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399

 

547
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,470

okay let's try it

548
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,480
okay let's try it
 

549
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,949
okay let's try it
these are just these are just drills so

550
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
these are just these are just drills so
 

551
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,030
these are just these are just drills so
you're looking at the concept and we're

552
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
you're looking at the concept and we're
 

553
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,150
you're looking at the concept and we're
interested in the psycho physiological

554
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
interested in the psycho physiological
 

555
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,069
interested in the psycho physiological
releasing okay that allows you to do

556
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:35,079
releasing okay that allows you to do
 

557
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:36,629
releasing okay that allows you to do
non-contestation

558
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
non-contestation
 

559
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,389
non-contestation
um

560
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
um
 

561
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,190
um
if if the forces increase right the

562
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
if if the forces increase right the
 

563
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,269
if if the forces increase right the
momentum the inertia all that is

564
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:43,279
momentum the inertia all that is
 

565
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,310
momentum the inertia all that is
increased

566
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
increased

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,030
increased
the concepts remain the same but they do

568
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
the concepts remain the same but they do
 

569
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,310
the concepts remain the same but they do
not look exactly like this okay so for

570
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
not look exactly like this okay so for
 

571
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,350
not look exactly like this okay so for
example if she was really running at me

572
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
example if she was really running at me
 

573
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,150
example if she was really running at me
she

574
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
she
 

575
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,430
she
caught me

576
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
caught me
 

577
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,990
caught me
well you violated the rules do you see

578
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000
well you violated the rules do you see
 

579
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,949
well you violated the rules do you see
you you stayed yourself still she's

580
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
you you stayed yourself still she's
 

581
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,750
you you stayed yourself still she's
really running at me everything is

582
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
really running at me everything is
 

583
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,629
really running at me everything is
uh a little bit opener more open and you

584
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
uh a little bit opener more open and you
 

585
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,590
uh a little bit opener more open and you
will have a little bit more compression

586
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
will have a little bit more compression
 

587
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,750
will have a little bit more compression
before you release it you do you

588
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
before you release it you do you
 

589
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,190
before you release it you do you
understand

590
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
understand
 

591
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,150
understand
do you understand okay so you can't be

592
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
do you understand okay so you can't be
 

593
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,949
do you understand okay so you can't be
so weak or so structurally

594
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
so weak or so structurally
 

595
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,430
so weak or so structurally
fragile that weight gets shifted to your

596
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
fragile that weight gets shifted to your
 

597
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,629
fragile that weight gets shifted to your
heels and things like that okay

598
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
heels and things like that okay
 

599
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,790
heels and things like that okay
there is a

600
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
there is a
 

601
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,269
there is a
process by which you realize you're

602
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
process by which you realize you're
 

603
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,550
process by which you realize you're
going into a given state or better said

604
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
going into a given state or better said
 

605
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,629
going into a given state or better said
where you realize it's better for you to

606
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:36,639
where you realize it's better for you to
 

607
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,069
where you realize it's better for you to
go into a yin state okay so if we slow

608
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
go into a yin state okay so if we slow
 

609
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,350
go into a yin state okay so if we slow
that faster tackle down

610
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,360
that faster tackle down
 

611
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,150
that faster tackle down
uh when do i go into the instinct when i

612
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,160
uh when do i go into the instinct when i
 

613
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,389
uh when do i go into the instinct when i
realize i cannot keep midfoot vector

614
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
realize i cannot keep midfoot vector
 

615
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,509
realize i cannot keep midfoot vector
here you see that so i let her move me

616
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
here you see that so i let her move me
 

617
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,189
here you see that so i let her move me
into

618
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
into
 

619
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,230
into
the other state you get it so

620
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
the other state you get it so
 

621
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,870
the other state you get it so
there's at that moment there's way more

622
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880
there's at that moment there's way more
 

623
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,030
there's at that moment there's way more
pressure let's say

624
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040
pressure let's say
 

625
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,389
pressure let's say
that you might experience in your aikido

626
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
that you might experience in your aikido
 

627
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,590
that you might experience in your aikido
do you see

628
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
do you see
 

629
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,629
do you see
um

630
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639
um
 

631
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,710
um
and that's why like some aikido people

632
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
and that's why like some aikido people
 

633
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,350
and that's why like some aikido people
will go that was an aikido they got too

634
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
will go that was an aikido they got too
 

635
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,829
will go that was an aikido they got too
close to but it's because we're dealing

636
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
close to but it's because we're dealing
 

637
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,550
close to but it's because we're dealing
with greater energy values okay it's

638
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
with greater energy values okay it's
 

639
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,870
with greater energy values okay it's
still the same thing all right you just

640
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
still the same thing all right you just
 

641
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,030
still the same thing all right you just
keep that in mind but let's keep this at

642
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
keep that in mind but let's keep this at
 

643
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,750
keep that in mind but let's keep this at
this level of just concept and then

644
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
this level of just concept and then
 

645
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,230
this level of just concept and then
trying to gain the skill of releasing

646
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
trying to gain the skill of releasing
 

647
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,030
trying to gain the skill of releasing
okay so still you you'll have more of my

648
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,040
okay so still you you'll have more of my
 

649
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,389
okay so still you you'll have more of my
body okay

650
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:30,399
body okay
 

651
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,590
body okay
uh so we'll do like uh

652
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
uh so we'll do like uh
 

653
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,350
uh so we'll do like uh
a clinch okay

654
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
a clinch okay
 

655
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,990
a clinch okay
she i have a lot of her body you see

656
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
she i have a lot of her body you see
 

657
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,829
she i have a lot of her body you see
that but you you want to feel uh where

658
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839
that but you you want to feel uh where
 

659
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,710
that but you you want to feel uh where
i'm at so you're doing the clinch right

660
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
i'm at so you're doing the clinch right
 

661
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,829
i'm at so you're doing the clinch right
okay

662
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
okay
 

663
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,230
okay
so i feel that neck

664
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
so i feel that neck
 

665
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,189
so i feel that neck
i feel turn around

666
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
i feel turn around
 

667
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,269
i feel turn around
i feel this hand

668
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279
i feel this hand
 

669
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,670
i feel this hand
i feel this pressure of her head and i

670
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
i feel this pressure of her head and i
 

671
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,550
i feel this pressure of her head and i
feel the drive of her legs do you see

672
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
feel the drive of her legs do you see
 

673
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,350
feel the drive of her legs do you see
okay so i'm going to take away that hand

674
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
okay so i'm going to take away that hand
 

675
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,269
okay so i'm going to take away that hand
do you see how i did that so you're

676
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
do you see how i did that so you're

do you see
and then um now this is not so tight

688
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
and then um now this is not so tight
 

689
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,509
and then um now this is not so tight
because you're not you're only holding

690
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
because you're not you're only holding
 

691
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,750
because you're not you're only holding
me here with this hand you see that

692
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
me here with this hand you see that
 

693
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,829
me here with this hand you see that
right and i'll just start

694
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:20,839
right and i'll just start
 

695
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:27,590
right and i'll just start
dismantling okay

696
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600

 

697
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,150

if she's really driving everything is

698
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
if she's really driving everything is
 

699
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,470
if she's really driving everything is
neutral but she's driving me forward

700
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
neutral but she's driving me forward
 

701
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,949
neutral but she's driving me forward
he's driving forward you see

702
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
he's driving forward you see
 

703
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,749
he's driving forward you see
well that's going to be the

704
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
well that's going to be the
 

705
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,150
well that's going to be the
contestation you're going to try to

706
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
contestation you're going to try to
 

707
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,150
contestation you're going to try to
deconstruct so she dries you're not

708
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
deconstruct so she dries you're not
 

709
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,629
deconstruct so she dries you're not
going to go like this okay she's going

710
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
going to go like this okay she's going
 

711
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,550
going to go like this okay she's going
to drive and that's what you use

712
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560

 

713
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,550

right because she's holding me in place

714
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
right because she's holding me in place
 

715
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,629
right because she's holding me in place
and she's trying to hold me in place and

716
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
and she's trying to hold me in place and
 

717
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,350
and she's trying to hold me in place and
then you just start to spend time

718
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360

 

719
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,509

so we did a few already going forward

720
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
so we did a few already going forward
 

721
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,350
so we did a few already going forward
let's do whatever she's holding me in

722
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
let's do whatever she's holding me in
 

723
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,310
let's do whatever she's holding me in
place so we'll show it from this side

724
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
place so we'll show it from this side
 

725
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,189
place so we'll show it from this side
okay

726
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
okay
 

727
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:05,910
okay
she

728
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920
she
 

729
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,550
she
she wants that tyson you just move it if

730
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
she wants that tyson you just move it if
 

731
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,230
she wants that tyson you just move it if
i can't move it here i can move it at

732
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240
i can't move it here i can move it at
 

733
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,550
i can't move it here i can move it at
this angle you see and then it's it's

734
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
this angle you see and then it's it's
 

735
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,990
this angle you see and then it's it's
already out

736
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000
already out
 

737
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,710
already out
and then you switch the head through

738
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
and then you switch the head through
 

739
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,829
and then you switch the head through
elbow and then

740
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839

 

741
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,830

you but it becomes very very soft

742
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:24,840
you but it becomes very very soft
 

743
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:31,430
you but it becomes very very soft
[Music]

744
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440

 

745
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,350

okay let's try that

746
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
okay let's try that
 

747
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,590
okay let's try that
all right uh

748
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
all right uh
 

749
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,110
all right uh
so

750
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
so
 

751
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,430
so
what we're doing in this well you can

752
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,440
what we're doing in this well you can
 

753
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,590
what we're doing in this well you can
say of course she's running at me you

754
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
say of course she's running at me you
 

755
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,670
say of course she's running at me you
you're just repeating this strategy okay

756
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
you're just repeating this strategy okay
 

757
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,509
you're just repeating this strategy okay
so here she's got

758
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
so here she's got
 

759
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,629
so here she's got
she was scribbling really hard on

760
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639

 

761
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,189

that would be contesting you see then

762
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
that would be contesting you see then
 

763
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,310
that would be contesting you see then
find out where it doesn't work so i'm

764
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
find out where it doesn't work so i'm
 

765
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,629
find out where it doesn't work so i'm
going to follow the in space you see

766
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
going to follow the in space you see
 

767
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,710
going to follow the in space you see
that was this it's ready to go you can

768
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
that was this it's ready to go you can
 

769
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,270
that was this it's ready to go you can
probably grab it again you see but i

770
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
probably grab it again you see but i
 

771
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,789
probably grab it again you see but i
just you're not going to get it and i

772
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
just you're not going to get it and i
 

773
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,590
just you're not going to get it and i
come around the head now don't try to

774
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
come around the head now don't try to
 

775
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,669
come around the head now don't try to
lift this arm up because she's trying to

776
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:11,679
lift this arm up because she's trying to
 

777
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,990
lift this arm up because she's trying to
anchor it down right so you go around

778
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
anchor it down right so you go around
 

779
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,829
anchor it down right so you go around
and you push the head down push the head

780
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839
and you push the head down push the head
 

781
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,470
and you push the head down push the head
down

782
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
down
 

783
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,750
down
pushing pushing the arm up would be

784
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:20,760
pushing pushing the arm up would be
 

785
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,789
pushing pushing the arm up would be
contestation do you see

786
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:22,799
contestation do you see
 

787
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,350
contestation do you see
it's not doing anything especially once

788
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
it's not doing anything especially once
 

789
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,230
it's not doing anything especially once
i get that head down you see not doing

790
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240
i get that head down you see not doing
 

791
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,669
i get that head down you see not doing
anything

792
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
anything
 

793
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,150
anything
now let's say that she was really strong

794
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
now let's say that she was really strong
 

795
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,950
now let's say that she was really strong
or way taller than me and you can't get

796
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
or way taller than me and you can't get
 

797
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,430
or way taller than me and you can't get
the can't get the head down well the

798
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
the can't get the head down well the
 

799
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,990
the can't get the head down well the
strategy would be not to really muscle

800
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,000
strategy would be not to really muscle
 

801
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,630
strategy would be not to really muscle
but to go around to something else where

802
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
but to go around to something else where
 

803
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,110
but to go around to something else where
you can do something else you see that's

804
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
you can do something else you see that's
 

805
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,590
you can do something else you see that's
the non-contest station

806
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
the non-contest station
 

807
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,070
the non-contest station
of course anywhere in there right you

808
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
of course anywhere in there right you
 

809
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,070
of course anywhere in there right you
can go back to some of the drills that

810
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
can go back to some of the drills that
 

811
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,029
can go back to some of the drills that
we did boom i got my strike oh

812
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:55,039

you could have gone to your strikes
 

815
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,549
you could have gone to your strikes
because you're not a contestant

those things
aren't as available as any strikes

824

keep going with the concept okay so one
 

843
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,470
keep going with the concept okay so one
way

844
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480

 

845
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,310

to not force the head down
