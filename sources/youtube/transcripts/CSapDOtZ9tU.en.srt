1
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,940
How did you come to Aikido?

2
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,260
I came there by chance,

3
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,860
I once met someone in a mountain hut,

4
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,160
we spent the evening talking

5
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,420
and he told me about Aikido.

6
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,800
It turns out that I had done judo when I was a kid,

7
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,820
I stopped because I started in conditions that weren't very good

8
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,000
since it was almost 50 years ago.

9
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,300
It was kid's judo in Spain, but inreality it was adult judo, but with children.

10
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,240
So by the time I got to 12 years old,

11
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,620
I had shoulder problems and my hips were staggered.

12
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,950
I had one foot shorter than the other, anyway.

13
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,210
So I stopped, took it up again, 
stopped, I hurt myself, I started again,

14
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,759
it lasted until I was 15-16 years old and
then I stopped completely.

15
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,800
I wanted to take an art
martial, I did not know what.

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,259
I was not a competitor, it was not my cup of tea.

17
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,020
I had done a little competition since when
you do judo you have to go through competition.

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,740
And this guy that I never saw again,

19
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,100
whose name I do not remember, told me about aikido with so much passion

20
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,570
that I decided to go see.

21
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,220
I went to a club that was in
Fontenay-aux-roses.

22
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,160
At the time it was Louis Cleriot who is one of the pioneers, who's dead now,

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,400
one of those who created the federation, he was the one who taught.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,040
I went with a friend, we watched and both said the same thing:

25
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,620
"Either it's fake or there's something".

26
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,760
My friend didn't register, but I did.

27
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,000
I liked it a lot but I had a busy life at the time

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,520
and I did not have time to train
and to do other things.

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,360
I did two and a half, three
month, I said "stop".

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,600
"I'm going to stop. To do it like this once a week, to not be regular, it doesn't interest me, but I will come back one day. "

31
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,240
I returned five years later.

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,640
G.E: When was it?

33
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,620
It was in 1987.

34
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,360
And then it was Christian Mouza who taught,

35
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,360
so he was doing aikido classes

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,740
and Philippe Bersani gave kenjutsu lessons once a week.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,780
G.E .: Which school of kenjutsu?

38
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,760
He was a student of Christian Tissier,

39
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,840
so the origin is kashima.

40
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,320
And suddenly, that's it, it was three times of aikido and one time of kenjutsu, every week.

41
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,440
It started like this and then I put my finger in it.

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,760
I did the Easter seminar of Christian Tissier when I had three months of Aikido.

43
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,280
I loved it, I understood nothing, but I
became hooked, and from there,

44
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,980
I started doing monthly seminars, I did a summer seminar,

45
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,900
the following year, I did a monthly seminar then two, then the Easter seminar, then two courses in the summer, etc.

46
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,360
That's how it unfolded

47
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,900
How did you decide to become a professional Aikido  teacher?

48
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,100
I didn't really decide.

49
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,480
It decided itself.

50
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,280
Roughly speaking I started Aikido relatively late, I was 22-23 years old.

51
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,100
I got married young, I had children young,

52
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,220
and so I had to manage professional life, family life, and aikido.

53
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,520
I could not do everything thoroughly,

54
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,060
so I decided that I was going to do
professional choices

55
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,220
that allowed me to see my children and to do Aikido.

56
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,300
But not at all thinking of devoting myself
to Aikido professionally.

57
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,860
So it lasted a while, I worked as an educator for years,

58
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,020
and then at some point I started teaching [Aikido], so here, I opened the club in 1999.

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,780
In 2005 I was asked to be technical director for Basse-Normandie,

60
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,400
and at that time I already had a lot of classes,

61
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,140
I started to have a lot of weekends taken,

62
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,880
- not much more than when it was not my job -

63
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,880
but it started to become a lot and I thought:

64
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,840
"OK, I'm switching"

65
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,880
But that happened a little despite myself.

66
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,140
That is to say that at no time I thought
I would become a professional Aikido teacher.

67
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,880
In fact I had a job, I had a family,

68
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,700
I loved doing Aikido, it took a lot of my time,

69
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:13,100
and in fact it was the responsibilities, little by little, that made everything become incompatible and that I said:

70
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,500
"OK, I'm stopping my day job to focus exclusively on Aikido."

71
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,300


72
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,740
It is true,

73
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,740
though we learn to manage,

74
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,740
we fall less,

75
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,840
or less violently.

76
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,000
We see ourselves being less imposed the pace.

77
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,220
That's an important element,

78
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,080
that is, I have memories of 1st, 2nd, 3rd Dan

79
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,900
or indeed, when you are being pushed around,

80
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,920
a little like a puppet from one side to the other,

81
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,620
you do not always fall well ...

82
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,960
I started attending seminars very early,

83
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,560
then after I returned home, I would lay down half an hour on the back

84
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,750
to try to put everything back in line.

85
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,580
Today it's no longer the case.

86
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,580
I mean that I still fall,

87
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,140
but the rhythms are much less imposed on me.

88
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,440
Falls and rhythms.

89
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,580
Of course, with Christian, it's different,

90
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,380
but it's all the time, so it's okay,

91
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,400
and we do not need - compared to a footballer -

92
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,820
A footballer must be at the top, at the peak of the form, for ten years,

93
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,080
and then after nothing.

94
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,560
We may not be at the peak of the form,

95
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,060
we are at an intermediate level,

96
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,860
but it lasts much longer.

97
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,980
That's how I deal with it.

98
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,660
Perhaps the first thing that has changed

99
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,500
it has been to accept that students are what they are,

100
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,320
and not always what we would like them to be.

101
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,060
This is an important element.

102
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,440
That is, for us, we are a certain number of people

103
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,920
have invested a lot in Aikido, regardless of being professionals or not.

104
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,420
It was a passion and one of the pillars of my life,

105
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,810
but I have  to accept that others can come
twice a week

106
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,380
to do one or two hours of aikido at
each time,

107
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,420
a little laid back to see the friends.

108
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,880
It's a step forward to have accept that Aikido

109
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,020
is also for them.

110
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,900
One of the questions is how do we get them

111
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,860
to progress in Aikido at this rate,

112
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,520
and to nurture their progress and to ensure that they too get something out of it.

113
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,920
Most people here, we are in a rather affluent city,

114
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,800
young people invest more in studies than in sports

115
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,900
and adults invest more in their careers, or their work,

116
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,280
or on their professional life than on recreation, let's say.

117
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,940
So we have to accept that
things aren't

118
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:10,760
as we saw them for ourselves at a certain moment.

119
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,300
No, I do not have a decided opinion on it.

120
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,620
Sometimes I say, "There are grades
there are the levels ". (Laughter)

121
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,360
In an ideal vision,

122
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,360
the two things should match,

123
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,360
in fact, we realize,

124
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,560
during the examinations in particular,

125
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,560
that they are two different things.

126
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,300
At the same time,

127
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,540
when it's the baccalaureate season, there are people who are going to get 9.96

128
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,780
and who will just about pass,

129
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,300
and there are people who are going to have 21 out of 20 with the options.

130
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,300
They do not have the same level at all and yet they have the same degree.

131
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,540
In the end, we are not very far from that.

132
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,280
I think the big criteria,

133
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,100
are not very far from the great principles of Aikido.

134
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,440
We try to judge on observable behaviors

135
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,140
and not just on a gut feeling,

136
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,140
in order to be able,

137
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,220
to discuss among judges,

138
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,700
and because it's not just a federation problem, it's also a people problem

139
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,360
so to be able to have elements

140
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,960
that can be relied on to support a reasoning.

141
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,060
So that's essential.

142
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,980
So from there it's not very far from my criteria.

143
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,680
We could vary on criteria severity though

144
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,040
But finally the question does not arise.

145
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,800
We know the level at which we want to see people,

146
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,660
the question is often, for the very talented there is no discussion,

147
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,720
for those who are not good at all there is no discussion,

148
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,400
the majority of people are within an average.

149
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,700
There, you find more subjective criteria, which are:

150
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,140
what are the factors that will weigh in the balance more than other,

151
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,230
which can be criteria of age, criteria of physical condition,

152
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,480
the importance we will give to etiquette, or not,

153
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,380
the work with weapons,

154
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,340
to all those somewhat peripheral elements,

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,740
which are not necessarily the core.

156
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,280
If on the core it's average, more marginal elements will play,

157
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,460
and there sometimes play out differently.

158
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,440
Within the big sensibilities between federations

159
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,700
but also between individuals,
according to one's experience and history ...

160
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,720
G.E.: So there is a lot of human factors, more than purely technical ones...

161
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,360
There is a human part.

162
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,760
At one point I used to say:

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
"Grading examinations are the imposed figures in ice skating".

164
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,360
We have a number of criteria

165
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,840
and there is the part of subjectivity of everyone that will intervene.

166
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,520
We will not necessarily value exactly the same things in the same way.

167
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,400
We will not see the same things

168
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,000
and we will not give equal weight to the same things.

169
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,280
The idea being that in talking - and that's all the work that's done between the technicians of the two federations -

170
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,460
to come to find what common points we can agree upon

171
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,920
to decide whether or not to award a grade.

172
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,480
But it's a continuous job it's not something that is done once and for all.

173
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,840
Because Aikido also evolves,

174
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,179
that is, examinations today are not the same as examinations 20 years ago.

175
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:38,399
Aikido today is not the Aikido of 20 years ago, etc.

176
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,160
So that's really a work of,

177
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,580
permanent development and readjustment of the criteria on a permanent basis.

178
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,660
Yeah.

179
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,460
First of all because that's how I designed Aikido.

180
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,335
That is to say, very early,

181
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,780
I followed Christian

182
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,540
I started in November 1987

183
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,000
and I did the Easter seminar in 1988.

184
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:13,175
And so from there I did a lot of seminars with him.

185
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:14,735
After 3 years,

186
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:16,915
when I got my 1st Dan,

187
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,015
and between the 1st and the 2nd Dan

188
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,920
my teachers said:

189
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,820
"If you want to continue to progress, you have to go to work at Tissier's dojo".

190
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,560
Not only seminars but also regular classes.

191
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,340
So usually I went there for lunchtime, at first it was Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

192
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,105
Lunchtime at the Cercle Tissier and in the evenings, I continued to go

193
00:12:34,105 --> 00:12:36,015
to my old club

194
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:39,225
There is no doubt that in my generation,

195
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,155
Aikido has been something that evolved.

196
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:45,525
Maybe previous generations

197
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:46,960
at one point,

198
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,360
have discovered another way of doing Aikido,

199
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,320
and were responsible for...

200
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,620
I was going to say: to spread the Good Word.

201
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,600
And probably to tell people:

202
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,140
"It's like that and no other way."

203
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,065
We did not live that, we were not responsible.

204
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:06,045
I am of the same generation, in terms of

205
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:07,925
grade and evolution,

206
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:11,005
as Pascal Guillemin and Bruno Gonzales, Marc Bachraty.

207
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,360
I got the 1st Dan at the same time as Pascal, we received the 6th Dan together

208
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,860
and Bruno too.

209
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:23,555
We are of the same generation, we were not in charge

210
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,300
we were not responsible for transmitting.

211
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,820
However, we were in contact with Christian,

212
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,580
if not every day, at least every week

213
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,480
since when he moved [to the South of France], he was there 2 days a week,

214
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,920
but we saw him every week,

215
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,895
and so we have seen this evolution.

216
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,020
For us, aikido has always been something that evolved,

217
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,600
that is, we explore forms,

218
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:50,475
we deepen them, we go far,

219
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,420
sometimes, we realized that he was working on something,

220
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,720
and when it was acquired he said:

221
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,420
"OK, that's good, we leave it out. "

222
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,620
"It's settled, we'll move on."

223
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,040
"We are going to move on to another line of research or another line of work. "

224
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,520
And that, for us, became something natural.

225
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:10,445
So there is no particular effort

226
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,360
to update myself.

227
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,580
I had a little break form practice for a few months,

228
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,020
for personal reasons.

229
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,200
I could not practice on a daily basis

230
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,000
or weekly with Christian,

231
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,560
and in 4, 5, 6 months I saw the difference.

232
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,035
That is to say, I think that almost every year

233
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:42,435
there are new ways that are explored,

234
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,320
sometimes a return to things we worked on years before,

235
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,980
with probably a new way of looking at things.

236
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,040
Something matures, something that has changed.

237
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,800
So when we come back to older things

238
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,700
it's always revisiting in the sense that

239
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,000
it has evolved, it is something that is alive,

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,180
which is constantly a living material.

241
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,520
So it does not take effort,

242
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,000
it's not always comfortable.

243
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,300
because it's true that comfort is establishing a truth,

244
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,585
and not to move from it.

245
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,480
But that's what I'm passionate about.

246
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,160
So,

247
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,175
some time ago, I was on a training course in Italy and _I was asked:

248
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,140
"When Christian Tissier will not be there, who will represent him?"

249
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,320
I said, "Everyone and no one!"

250
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,300
I do not do the Aikido of Christian Tissier,

251
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,320
I do the aikido of Mare Seye.

252
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,980
It turns out that I've been working with Christian for a long time,

253
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,940
and so my training is very marked

254
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:55,305
by what he makes us work on,

255
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,300
by the forms he made us work on,

256
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,380
but that's only what I've integrated,

257
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,080
with what I am, with what I feel,

258
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,780
with my physique, with my qualities, with my faults,

259
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,160
so it will never do Christian Tissier's Aikid.,

260
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,000
I can't, and I'm not trying to make Christian Tissier's Aikido.

261
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,595
I am trying to do Aikido.

262
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:14,695
So at this level I leave myself a total freedom.

263
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,280
When I'm in class and Christian shows a technique in a certain way,

264
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,035
obviously, I'm going to apply myself

265
00:16:20,035 --> 00:16:22,695
to try to understand why he's doing it like that,

266
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,995
where he wants to go, where he wants to take us, etc.

267
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:29,605
When I work for myself, or when I teach,

268
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:31,805
I return

269
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:33,215
to what suits me.

270
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,045
It can sometimes be very close forms, sometimes...

271
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:38,315
so,

272
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,860
for people who do not know the system, it will always look like close forms, (laughs)

273
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,020
but for me it will be things not necessarily the way

274
00:16:46,025 --> 00:16:48,085
which Christian is showing at the moment.

275
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:51,265
Especially since

276
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:52,820
Christian is in a [constant] evolution.

277
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:59,485
So we see him at the end of a path.

278
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,100
When we train people for the first Dan,

279
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,340
we can't immediately give them these elements if they don't have...

280
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,440
- it's is a big question, we could get back to it more -

281
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,855
But the me who understood things, today,

282
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:17,625
is not me 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, or 20 years ago.

283
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:20,735
I understand things, can I give them the shortcut?

284
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:24,315
And tell them here, I'm here, that's what we have to do?

285
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:27,585
Or do they need to build

286
00:17:27,635 --> 00:17:30,165
foundations that are strong enough

287
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:33,420
to be able to get to that point, or go further.

288
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,180
It's a balance that's difficult to reach,

289
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,340
between showing what interests me, where I am, etc.

290
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:46,520
and show what students need at some point, from my perspective.

291
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,600
Yes and no.

292
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:58,895
For me, I separate

293
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:02,175
seminars that I do in a federal framework

294
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,900
since I am in a technical college,

295
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,020
when I intervene in a federal setting,

296
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,100
I have the concern to work from a common background,

297
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:16,285
a common denominator.

298
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:19,540
It depends on the type of seminar, but I can  say to them:

299
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,780
"I'm going to that, that's what interests me right now, etc. "

300
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:26,025
But overall, I'm really trying to work on what's

301
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:29,025
the common denominator and the way I see

302
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,740
the construction within this common denominator,

303
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,315
with my sensitivity, my way of being.

304
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:37,565
In private seminars, I will allow myself to go towards

305
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:40,440
what interests me, what I am looking for,

306
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,500
but it's really dependent on the type of seminar,

307
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,700
not just federal or private,

308
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,720
there are some private seminars in which

309
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,100
I was asked to give building elements,

310
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,165
in which case I will give building elements.

311
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:58,245
There are private seminars, there, the summer course I do in Poitiers

312
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:01,145
where it's more people who see me regularly,

313
00:19:01,145 --> 00:19:04,920
and where I'm going to do what interests me at that moment.

314
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,275
It depends on the seminars, it depends on the encounter.

315
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,560
It also depends on my ability to integrate what I am seeing.

316
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,735
I would say that the first thing is to say to myself:

317
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,880
"OK that we can approach it like that to tackle this or that technique

318
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,280
"Or approach the relationship with the partner in such and such a way. "

319
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,380
So maybe the first question

320
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,040
is indeed the difference of approach.

321
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:44,055
How each people approach things,

322
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:45,775
which ultimately are the same thing.

323
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:49,635
That's the first point, it can open up perspectives,

324
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,580
research, work, questioning,

325
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,300
it can allow me to reinterpret the way I do it, myself.

326
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,680
- that doesn't mean I'm going to copy the form -

327
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,860
but inside, if I understand certain principles,

328
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,860
I will see how to integrate them with what I do.

329
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,325
It is at the same time technical

330
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:10,165
because when I attend a seminar,

331
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,500
I try to reproduce what I am offered,

332
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,100
in any case I'm trying to do it,

333
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,800
but afterwards, I will not come back saying:

334
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,180
"Ah, I saw so-and-so, that's how we'll do ikkyo from now on."

335
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,500
No, I'm going to do what I integrated.

336
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,515
And what I saw, or how I felt

337
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,500
might modify what I have integrated before,

338
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,360
but it will never be more than what I integrated, and basically,

339
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,420
if we put the thousands of hours of a practice

340
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:40,155
compared to ten or fifteen hours

341
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,780
with a Sensei that I discovered at a seminar,

342
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,120
the equilibrium is not there.

343
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,540
It's like I'm a classical musician, I often use the comparison.

344
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,105
I'm a classical musician, I'm going to do a jazz internship,

345
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:56,475
maybe it's going to totally change the way

346
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:58,495
in which I will interpret my songs.

347
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,940
But I am a classical musician.

348
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,320
So maybe I decide to change and get into jazz,

349
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,480
but I mean, if I'm doing a week of jazz,

350
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,260
it will change my openness, it will change my relationship to what is written,

351
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,215
maybe it will give me more freedom

352
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,640
but that does not make me a jazz musician.

353
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:18,995
Even if it can profoundly change the way

354
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:21,365
that I will approach classical music after.

355
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,480
It's a bit in that sense.

356
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,480
No no, I leave them.

357
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,800
Overall, I leave them.

358
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Of two things,

359
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,260
either they will see someone I appreciate,

360
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,260
in which case I consider it an enrichment for them,

361
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,340
or they will see someone who does not convince me, for whatever reason.

362
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,300
There too possibilities,

363
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,560
they think it's great and that's what they want to do,

364
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,120
in this case it is not me who could give them what they are looking for,

365
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,720
or it does not suit them and they prefer what I propose to them,

366
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,075
in which case everything is fine.

367
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,460
But I do not consider myself the owner of my students.

368
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,600
After that, if they ask me my opinion, I can give it

369
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:14,295
but it's up to them to get an idea.

370
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,220
For example, in my dojo, I decided not to do monthly seminars

371
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,860
because I wanted my students to go see other people.

372
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,600
If I offered monthly seminars,

373
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,520
in a way, the students would feel obliged to come

374
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,220
and since they do not do a lot of seminars

375
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,740
it would probably be to the detriment of the discovery of other teachers or other approaches.

376
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,720
So I think it's a richness anyway.

377
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,680
After, we have discussions with students who sometimes do things, and then say to me:

378
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,180
"Yes, but he's doing it like that. "

379
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,520
I say, "OK, but when you're here, you'll do it like this."

380
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,595
It doesn't mean it's better, it doesn't mean it's worse,

381
00:22:57,595 --> 00:23:00,495
simply if you want to follow the path that I propose to you and go there

382
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,100
I suggest that you go through there and there,

383
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,500
and if you go your way, you will not find that.

384
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,000
In any case, I will not be able to bring you there.

385
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,960
So we need to be able to prioritize.

386
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,080
For me the seminars are also that.

387
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,460
When I attend seminars with teachers who have different practices,

388
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,920
it's not like I'm going to do something else.

389
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:29,420
I continue to do it in a coherence of work,

390
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,120
and inside that, there are things that are questioned, that are changed...

391
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:41,620
But the idea is that you can't build yourself by constancy dispersing.

392
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,360
So you have to go and see, we need to open up to it,

393
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,920
and at the same time, you have to keep a framework that allows you to progress.

394
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,280
When I go on an seminars, I really position myself as a student.

395
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,680
And I try to reproduce not only the form,

396
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,400
I try to understand what is there.

397
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,900
There comes a time when we have lived enough

398
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:13,035
so that when one reproduces a form, one does not reproduce only one form.

399
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,080
That is, inside the form,

400
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,220
I will look for what is happening in the movement.

401
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:21,325
And form will be a way of getting into what is happening.

402
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,420
But that, I think is the chance we had with Christian Tissier.

403
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,900
He gave us such a structure,

404
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,580
with more or less abilities,

405
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,860
we can enter forms of work that are not ours

406
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,620
because we have a sufficiently structured practice

407
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:43,720
to be able to understand what is changed,

408
00:24:43,725 --> 00:24:46,585
how does it change, sometimes it can take a little time,

409
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:50,600
but overall, we have tools to adapt,

410
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,055
so suddenly, by working another form,

411
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:55,215
we try to work also another way to feel the movement.
