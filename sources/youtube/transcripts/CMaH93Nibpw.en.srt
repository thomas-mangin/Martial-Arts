something doesn't happen until i have
 

181
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,189
something doesn't happen until i have
the last

182
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
the last
 

183
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,670
the last
piece you're not doing the technique

184
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
piece you're not doing the technique
 

185
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,909
piece you're not doing the technique
right

186
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919

 

187
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,950

so if if i can't manipulate his body

188
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
so if if i can't manipulate his body
 

189
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,950
so if if i can't manipulate his body
till i get his wrist then it's not

190
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
till i get his wrist then it's not
 

191
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,990
till i get his wrist then it's not
i'm not doing it's not partially viable

192
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
i'm not doing it's not partially viable
 

193
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,790
i'm not doing it's not partially viable
so body boom elbow goes around you don't

194
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
so body boom elbow goes around you don't
 

195
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,710
so body boom elbow goes around you don't
need the wrist because it's the last

196
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
need the wrist because it's the last
 

197
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:23,830
need the wrist because it's the last
redundant puzzle piece

198
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840

 

199
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,520

let's go no wrist hands
