is that not

408
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
is that not
 

409
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,389
is that not

that's the only reason why that doesn't

416
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:40,839
that's the only reason why that doesn't
 

417
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,629
that's the only reason why that doesn't
happen over and over and over again

okay okay the other point I made was the

420
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
okay okay the other point I made was the
 

421
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,710
okay okay the other point I made was the
range of the throwing engine and by

00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:51,720
range of the throwing engine and by
 

423

00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,790
some ballistic projectile it has a
certain range in which it will function

428
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
certain range in which it will function

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,190
certain range in which it will function
as designed and then outside of that

430
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
as designed and then outside of that
 

431
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,190
as designed and then outside of that
range it starts to lose momentum and

432
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
range it starts to lose momentum and
 

433
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,710
range it starts to lose momentum and
gravity starts to take over okay it just

434
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:05,720
gravity starts to take over okay it just
 

435
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,629

00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,310
doesn't have enough
range range here is does it have enough

438
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:11,320
range range here is does it have enough
 

439
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,550
range range here is does it have enough
range to actively and directly move the

he's in that three-point stance again

446
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:22,360
he's in that three-point stance again
 

447
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,829
he's in that three-point stance again
and we know that the line of gravity is

448
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
and we know that the line of gravity is
 

449
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,350
and we know that the line of gravity is
a theoretical line from his Center

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,269
my opinion I better I should probably
kick them or strike them what I mean

492
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:35,279
kick them or strike them what I mean
 

493
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,790
kick them or strike them what I mean
directly is that my

494
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
directly is that my
 

495
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,829
directly is that my
hands will be able to remain contact

496
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:42,839
hands will be able to remain contact
 

497
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,350
hands will be able to remain contact
with what I'm

498
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:44,360
with what I'm
 

499
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,590
with what I'm
moving but keep and thereby directly

500
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
moving but keep and thereby directly

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
move his line of gravity out okay so for
 

503
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,350
move his line of gravity out okay so for
example let's say I I ballistically move

504
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:56,360
example let's say I I ballistically move
 

505
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,430
example let's say I I ballistically move
your line of gravity and then you move

506
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:58,440
your line of gravity and then you move
 

507
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,069
your line of gravity and then you move
it back back in afterwards do you see

508
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:01,079
it back back in afterwards do you see
 

509
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,990
it back back in afterwards do you see
but as I'm doing this now move it back

510
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,000
but as I'm doing this now move it back
 

511
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,990
but as I'm doing this now move it back
nope back in there you go my hands are

512
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
nope back in there you go my hands are
 

513
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,150
nope back in there you go my hands are
in the way you get that which means I'm

514
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,160
in the way you get that which means I'm
 

515
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,150
in the way you get that which means I'm
actively moving that line of gravity

516
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
actively moving that line of gravity
 

517
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,030
actively moving that line of gravity

so when I'm out here

528
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,040
so when I'm out here
 

529
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,550
so when I'm out here
and you

530
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:31,560
and you
 

531
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,310
and you
watch where do I actively go and you can

532
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:35,320
watch where do I actively go and you can
 

533
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,030
watch where do I actively go and you can
see that this hand I don't know it feels

534
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
see that this hand I don't know it feels
 

535
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,350

like it's near his foot is it near his

536
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
like it's near his foot is it near his

foot on this plane do you see that but

538
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
foot on this plane do you see that but
 

539
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,590
foot on this plane do you see that but
not past his foot and therefore once I

540
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
not past his foot and therefore once I
 

541
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,590
not past his foot and therefore once I
run out of engine he'll come back into

542
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:50,600
run out of engine he'll come back into
 

543
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,269
run out of engine he'll come back into

never really affects the hips so you're

560
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,320
never really affects the hips so you're
 

561
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,350
never really affects the hips so you're
going to look I'm going to maybe do it

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:16,360
going to look I'm going to maybe do it
 

563
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,990
going to look I'm going to maybe do it
the cha Sensei version you

564
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,000
the cha Sensei version you
 

565
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,990
the cha Sensei version you
see and let's take this is where I

566
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,000
see and let's take this is where I
 

567
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,590
see and let's take this is where I
feel the tension in there at this point

568
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
feel the tension in there at this point
 

569
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,910
feel the tension in there at this point
in space okay and now here as I go don't

570
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:28,920
in space okay and now here as I go don't
 

571
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,749
in space okay and now here as I go don't
let me break your shoulder but it's

572
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:30,759
let me break your shoulder but it's
 

573
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,230
let me break your shoulder but it's
about here that that that hip on this

574
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:33,240
about here that that that hip on this
 

575
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,749
about here that that that hip on this
side starts to be affected you see

576
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:35,759
side starts to be affected you see
 

577
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,150
side starts to be affected you see
that so let's go back to your stance

578
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,160
that so let's go back to your stance
 

579
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,310
that so let's go back to your stance
there I

580
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
there I
 

581
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,710
there I
am plotted in

582
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:42,720
am plotted in
 

583
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,310
am plotted in
space and let's see how far I have to

584
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:45,320
space and let's see how far I have to
 

585
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,949
space and let's see how far I have to
move it past that before it starts to

586
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:47,959
move it past that before it starts to
 

587
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,110
move it past that before it starts to
affect the hips okay all the way out

588
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,120
affect the hips okay all the way out
 

589
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,829
affect the hips okay all the way out
here Plott it in space come

590
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:55,839

 

591
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,990

back and I'm right at the edge I need to

592
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
back and I'm right at the edge I need to
 

593
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,350
back and I'm right at the edge I need to
go way past there do you guys see

594
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:04,360
go way past there do you guys see
 

595
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,230
go way past there do you guys see
that what usually happens is he just

596
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,240
that what usually happens is he just
 

597
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,150
that what usually happens is he just
goes with the cubes and it look like

598
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,160
goes with the cubes and it look like
 

599
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,990
goes with the cubes and it look like
that arm was doing something but it's

600
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,000
that arm was doing something but it's
 

601
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,189
that arm was doing something but it's
not

602
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
not
 

603
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,110
not
okay

604
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,120
okay
 

605
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,550
okay
so we have to do a couple things for the

606
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:21,560
so we have to do a couple things for the
 

607
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,269
so we have to do a couple things for the
for the mul

608
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279
for the mul
 

609
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,590
for the mul
version is I have to find room for my

610
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
version is I have to find room for my
 

611
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,509
version is I have to find room for my
Emi and I need to add more angles into

612
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:31,519
Emi and I need to add more angles into
 

613
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,509
Emi and I need to add more angles into
this shoulder so that it impacts more

614
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
this shoulder so that it impacts more
 

615
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,230
this shoulder so that it impacts more
his line of gravity so instead of going

616
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
his line of gravity so instead of going
 

617
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,829
his line of gravity so instead of going
this way I'm going to go this way you

618
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
this way I'm going to go this way you
 

619
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,629
this way I'm going to go this way you
see that and then his head I'm going to

620
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:45,639
see that and then his head I'm going to
 

621
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,350
see that and then his head I'm going to
help bring it closer which allows this

622
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:48,360
help bring it closer which allows this
 

623
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,550
help bring it closer which allows this
to affect that hip sooner

624
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
to affect that hip sooner
 

625
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,430
to affect that hip sooner
okay he's

626
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:54,440
okay he's
 

627
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,309
okay he's
down you're

628
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:56,319
down you're
 

629
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:00,470
down you're
here I'm going to enter on on the

630
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
here I'm going to enter on on the
 

631
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,749
here I'm going to enter on on the
curve so there's room and I

632
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:04,759
curve so there's room and I
 

633
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,910
curve so there's room and I
pull don't go that way go this

634
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:08,920
pull don't go that way go this
 

635
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,790
pull don't go that way go this
way and I'll affect that hit which hit

636
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
way and I'll affect that hit which hit
 

637
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,069
way and I'll affect that hit which hit
back down this

638
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:15,079
back down this
 

639
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:19,509
back down this
hit so here I come in and I start to

640
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
hit so here I come in and I start to
 

641
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,230
hit so here I come in and I start to
turn this this way as I turn it I make

642
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:23,240
turn this this way as I turn it I make
 

643
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,350
turn this this way as I turn it I make
space for

644
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:24,360
space for
 

645
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,749
space for
me and I affect that hip all right let's

646
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:27,759
me and I affect that hip all right let's
 

647
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,030
me and I affect that hip all right let's
try that one for

648
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
try that one for
 

649
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,470
try that one for
this is dealing with the most

650
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:31,480
this is dealing with the most
 

651
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,480
this is dealing with the most
mechanically
