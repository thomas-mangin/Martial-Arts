00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,110

uh let's look at the principle okay so

10
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
uh let's look at the principle okay so
 

11
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,309
uh let's look at the principle okay so

Kori cross you you always going to

14
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
Kori cross you you always going to
 

15
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,670
Kori cross you you always going to
have cuz you always should is this angle

16
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:48,680
have cuz you always should is this angle
 

17
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,830
have cuz you always should is this angle
of

18
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:49,840
of
 

19
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,949
of
cancellation okay so the angle

20
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:51,959
cancellation okay so the angle
 

21
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,869
cancellation okay so the angle
cancellation is that it's going to draw

22
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
cancellation is that it's going to draw
 

23
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,110
cancellation is that it's going to draw
a diagonal through his three planes so

24
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
a diagonal through his three planes so
 

25
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,070
a diagonal through his three planes so
depth it's pull it's going this way okay

26
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,080
depth it's pull it's going this way okay
 

27
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,030
depth it's pull it's going this way okay
and then height there's some lower

28
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
and then height there's some lower
 

29
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,550
and then height there's some lower
lowering to it and then obviously width

30
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:07,560
lowering to it and then obviously width
 

31
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,190
lowering to it and then obviously width
there's some horizontal to it okay so

32
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,200
there's some horizontal to it okay so
 

33
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,309
there's some horizontal to it okay so
we're here for example you

34
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
we're here for example you
 

35
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,229
we're here for example you
see not our technique this

36
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
see not our technique this
 

37
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,390
see not our technique this
way you have to get that angle

38
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
way you have to get that angle
 

39
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,869
way you have to get that angle
cancellation first it has to go through

40
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:19,879
cancellation first it has to go through
 

41
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,430
cancellation first it has to go through
all three zones okay what that does is

42
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
all three zones okay what that does is
 

43
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,350
all three zones okay what that does is
that sets up a zon Sanctuary momentarily

44
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:28,360
that sets up a zon Sanctuary momentarily
 

45
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,429
that sets up a zon Sanctuary momentarily
where you can enter

46
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:31,439
where you can enter
 

47
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:37,429
where you can enter
without his weapons both facing you you

48
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:37,439
without his weapons both facing you you
 

49
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,030
without his weapons both facing you you
see that side of his body those weapons

50
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
see that side of his body those weapons
 

51
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,990
see that side of his body those weapons
are on the other side of this

52
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
are on the other side of this
 

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,990
are on the other side of this
side this side was being directly

54
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,000
side this side was being directly
 

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,589
side this side was being directly
impacted by the angle cancellation and

56
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:50,599
impacted by the angle cancellation and
 

57
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,589
impacted by the angle cancellation and
then I've smothered them as I'm doing

58
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
then I've smothered them as I'm doing
 

59
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,550
then I've smothered them as I'm doing
this movement this is where this is

60
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:55,560
this movement this is where this is
 

61
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,670
this movement this is where this is
where I am okay so there'd be downward

62
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680
where I am okay so there'd be downward
 

63
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,630
where I am okay so there'd be downward
pressure on that leg from the

64
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:01,640
pressure on that leg from the
 

65
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,710
pressure on that leg from the
pull with my body here with my head in

66
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
pull with my body here with my head in
 

67
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,110
pull with my body here with my head in
front and my shoulder in the back it

68
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
front and my shoulder in the back it
 

69
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,710
front and my shoulder in the back it
can't really turn towards me okay so

70
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:09,720
can't really turn towards me okay so
 

71
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,589
can't really turn towards me okay so
there's width pressure and then because

72
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:12,599
there's width pressure and then because
 

73
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,590
there's width pressure and then because
I'm at the angle when I start to dry I'm

74
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:16,600
I'm at the angle when I start to dry I'm
 

75
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,469
I'm at the angle when I start to dry I'm
attacking the depth from that same zone

76
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
attacking the depth from that same zone
 

77
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,430
attacking the depth from that same zone
of sanctuary you guys as opposed to your

78
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
of sanctuary you guys as opposed to your
 

79
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,390
of sanctuary you guys as opposed to your
here your front this is even even

80
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:23,400
here your front this is even even
 

81
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,909
here your front this is even even
there's no Advantage here so you want an

82
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
there's no Advantage here so you want an
 

83
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,029
there's no Advantage here so you want an
angal cancellation through his three

84
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:28,039
angal cancellation through his three
 

85
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:31,710
angal cancellation through his three
zones and then you want to be at an

86
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:31,720
zones and then you want to be at an
 

87
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,469
zones and then you want to be at an
angle to his spine line you don't want

88
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
angle to his spine line you don't want
 

89
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,830
angle to his spine line you don't want
to be in front of him you want to

90
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
to be in front of him you want to
 

91
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,710
to be in front of him you want to
capitalize upon the Zone Sanctuary that

92
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
capitalize upon the Zone Sanctuary that
 

93
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,189
capitalize upon the Zone Sanctuary that
you generated from the angle

94
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:40,199
you generated from the angle
 

95
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,430
you generated from the angle
cancellation okay so the arm drag like

96
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
cancellation okay so the arm drag like
 

97
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,350
cancellation okay so the arm drag like
all codori techniques does that so he

98
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:46,360
all codori techniques does that so he
 

99
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,430
all codori techniques does that so he
goes he he's he's coming in he goes for

100
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
goes he he's he's coming in he goes for
 

101
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,749

here I pull it I'm in that

104
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:55,960
here I pull it I'm in that
 

105
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,150
here I pull it I'm in that
position you tries the neck pank same

106
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,160
position you tries the neck pank same
 

107
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,990
position you tries the neck pank same
thing I go this way boom there it is

108

right there and I'm in that position
 

111
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,710
right there and I'm in that position
again he does the cross gra it's already

112
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:09,720
again he does the cross gra it's already
 

113
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,629
again he does the cross gra it's already
there that's easy that's just light out

114
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:11,639
there that's easy that's just light out
 

115
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,629

okay
um what else were you guys facing so the

120
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:19,319
um what else were you guys facing so the
 

121
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,110
um what else were you guys facing so the
two I got two choices here I can go to

122
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,120
two I got two choices here I can go to
 

123
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,950
two I got two choices here I can go to
this arm drag right or I can take this

124
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
this arm drag right or I can take this
 

125
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,590
this arm drag right or I can take this
one and sha and take that arm Dr and I'm

126
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
one and sha and take that arm Dr and I'm
 

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,189
one and sha and take that arm Dr and I'm
in that same position okay but what I'm

128
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:30,199
in that same position okay but what I'm
 

129
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,189
in that same position okay but what I'm
not doing is going here and stay in here

130
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:34,199
not doing is going here and stay in here
 

131
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,110
not doing is going here and stay in here
and all that kind of

132
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,120
and all that kind of
 

133
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,590
and all that kind of
stuff I can move I don't want I don't

134
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
stuff I can move I don't want I don't
 

135
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,070
stuff I can move I don't want I don't
like what's going on there I can move

136
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
like what's going on there I can move
 

137
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,230
like what's going on there I can move
but once he goes to get it I go right

138
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
but once he goes to get it I go right
 

139
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,629
but once he goes to get it I go right
into that position whatever it is once

140
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:47,639
into that position whatever it is once
 

141
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:57,270
into that position whatever it is once
you goes to get it I go right into that

142
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280

 

143
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,670

position then you'll find the single leg

144
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:00,680
position then you'll find the single leg
 

145
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,189
position then you'll find the single leg
okay without fighting right no

146
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
okay without fighting right no
 

147
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,469
okay without fighting right no
contesting okay try it again just those

148
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
contesting okay try it again just those
 

149
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,830
contesting okay try it again just those
so he goes there's that one I go here

150
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:10,840
so he goes there's that one I go here
 

151
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,110
so he goes there's that one I go here
and I'm close drive drive at me drive
