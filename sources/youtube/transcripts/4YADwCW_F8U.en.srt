00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:35,270

you're trying to arm like this actually

4
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
you're trying to arm like this actually
 

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,080
you're trying to arm like this actually
an extension you can't do that you're do

not don't have it pushing stop pushing

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,010
not don't have it pushing stop pushing
 

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:48,280
not don't have it pushing stop pushing
now straight that's a pushy intention

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,290
now straight that's a pushy intention
 

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,079
now straight that's a pushy intention
you you're going like this you know push

12
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:51,089
you you're going like this you know push
 

13
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:54,430
you you're going like this you know push
and then you go like see how it shut up

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:54,440
and then you go like see how it shut up
 

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,869
and then you go like see how it shut up
you know pushing attention stop moving

16
00:00:59,869 --> 00:00:59,879
you know pushing attention stop moving
 

17
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,070
you know pushing attention stop moving
my arm like this isn't she should only

18
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
my arm like this isn't she should only
 

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,270
my arm like this isn't she should only
go there everything so that's where the

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:08,280
go there everything so that's where the

rotation happens now you can't confuse

22
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:13,979

this with a demon dog yet you stopped

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:16,650
this with a demon dog yet you stopped
 

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,530
this with a demon dog yet you stopped
pushing it so what's happening is you

26
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:18,540
pushing it so what's happening is you
 

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,969
pushing it so what's happening is you
want to take the camel but you don't

28
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:19,979
want to take the camel but you don't
 

29
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:20,930
want to take the camel but you don't
take a Kimmy

30
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:20,940
take a Kimmy
 

31
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,500

you receive Academy okay so when you go

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:24,510
you receive Academy okay so when you go
 

33
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,510
you receive Academy okay so when you go
like time for echidna you stop the

00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:26,520
like time for echidna you stop the
 

35

intention is to get it and then you go

36
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:28,680
intention is to get it and then you go
 

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,400
intention is to get it and then you go
get ready to go backwards okay but

38
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,410
get ready to go backwards okay but
 

39
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,920
get ready to go backwards okay but
that's a very low level so you have a

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:33,930
that's a very low level so you have a
 

41
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,679
that's a very low level so you have a
pushing intention you did it again

42
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:40,689

 

43
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:49,240

anytime you do it again - Chris so this

44
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,250
anytime you do it again - Chris so this
 

45
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,410
anytime you do it again - Chris so this
is what I have DC he's he's doing that

46
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:53,420
is what I have DC he's he's doing that
 

47
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,190
is what I have DC he's he's doing that
because all his arm is doing is this you

48
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
because all his arm is doing is this you
 

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,560
because all his arm is doing is this you
see that so it's travelling around the

50
00:01:59,560 --> 00:01:59,570
see that so it's travelling around the
 

51
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,960
see that so it's travelling around the
circumference of a circle do you see

52
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:01,970
circumference of a circle do you see
 

53
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,219
circumference of a circle do you see
that right can you see it now if so my

54
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:06,229
that right can you see it now if so my
 

55
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:08,109
that right can you see it now if so my
arm is a vector that's kind of do the

56
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:08,119
arm is a vector that's kind of do the
 

57
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,419
arm is a vector that's kind of do the
circle so why should it do anything but

58
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:10,429
circle so why should it do anything but
 

59
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:12,280
circle so why should it do anything but
just get stuck here okay

60
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,290
just get stuck here okay
 

61
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,890
just get stuck here okay
do you understand but when you guys go

62
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:14,900
do you understand but when you guys go
 

63
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:22,509
do you understand but when you guys go
like Tom Ford cami so he's here and he's

64
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:22,519
like Tom Ford cami so he's here and he's
 

65
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,970
like Tom Ford cami so he's here and he's
pushing you should just say that if you

66
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:27,980
pushing you should just say that if you
 

67
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,020
pushing you should just say that if you
can picture a ball right right and all

68
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,030
can picture a ball right right and all
 

69
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,089
can picture a ball right right and all
the ball is doing is turning and the

70
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:34,099
the ball is doing is turning and the
 

71
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,930
the ball is doing is turning and the
vectors coming through it's going to hit

72
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:36,940
vectors coming through it's going to hit
 

73
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,289
vectors coming through it's going to hit
the circumference here I had a right

74
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:41,299
the circumference here I had a right
 

75
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:43,750
the circumference here I had a right
angle so it's a conflict do you

76
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
angle so it's a conflict do you
 

77
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,650
angle so it's a conflict do you
understand okay so I need to find a way

78
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:47,660
understand okay so I need to find a way
 

79
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,819
understand okay so I need to find a way
of spinning his arm I do that a couple

80
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:51,829
of spinning his arm I do that a couple
 

81
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:57,490
of spinning his arm I do that a couple
ways so one way is that I'm not turning

82
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:57,500
ways so one way is that I'm not turning
 

83
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,759
ways so one way is that I'm not turning
like this when I get here I'm actually

84
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:00,769
like this when I get here I'm actually
 

85
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:07,780
like this when I get here I'm actually
pushing his arm so he comes in another

86
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:07,790
pushing his arm so he comes in another
 

87
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:13,569
pushing his arm so he comes in another
way I do it is I take my elbow and when

88
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:13,579
way I do it is I take my elbow and when
 

89
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,819
way I do it is I take my elbow and when
I can't get that you see he's strong

90
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:15,829
I can't get that you see he's strong
 

91
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:20,650
I can't get that you see he's strong
right there I lift it up so it's not a

92
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:20,660
right there I lift it up so it's not a
 

93
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,220
right there I lift it up so it's not a
ball that's turning like this it's a

94
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:24,230
ball that's turning like this it's a
 

95
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:34,020
ball that's turning like this it's a
ball that's turning both ways

96
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,030

 

97
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,480

then my foot maneuvers make up the rest

98
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,490
then my foot maneuvers make up the rest
 

99
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,070
then my foot maneuvers make up the rest
so if I feel it oh it's really strong

100
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
so if I feel it oh it's really strong
 

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,530
so if I feel it oh it's really strong
here then look I take off the energy so

102
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:43,540
here then look I take off the energy so
 

103
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,610
here then look I take off the energy so
he's pushy

104
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:44,620
he's pushy
 

105
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,530
he's pushy
let's pushing me back as he's pushing me
