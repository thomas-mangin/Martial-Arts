00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:03,919
this one but we do the weapons
 

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,789
this one but we do the weapons
to develop targets that's the only

4
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:06,799
to develop targets that's the only
 

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,310
to develop targets that's the only
reason we should be doing it

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,320
reason we should be doing it
 

7
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,549
reason we should be doing it
it might give us we might have a lot of

8
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
it might give us we might have a lot of
 

9
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,509
it might give us we might have a lot of
fun

10
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
fun
 

11
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,310

but what you're doing is

12
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:16,320
but what you're doing is
 

13
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,269
but what you're doing is
some some of you are doing this you're

14
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
some some of you are doing this you're
 

15
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,269
some some of you are doing this you're
just replacing your feet

16
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279

 

17
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,429

and not going to the side

18
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
and not going to the side
 

19
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,990
and not going to the side
you're just going

20
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000

 

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,870

to see that hands to keep them still but

22
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:36,880
to see that hands to keep them still but
 

23
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,110
to see that hands to keep them still but
you're just

24
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
you're just
 

25
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,869
you're just
so you're not going anywhere so it's

26
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
so you're not going anywhere so it's
 

27
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,790
so you're not going anywhere so it's
like going backwards to go forward

28
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
like going backwards to go forward
 

29
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,830
like going backwards to go forward
there's no there's no

30
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
there's no there's no
 

31
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,750
there's no there's no
pen work there in the ken

32
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
pen work there in the ken
 

33
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,229
pen work there in the ken
when we receive we come here and we

34
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
when we receive we come here and we
 

35
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,830
when we receive we come here and we
i won't say drag but it it gathers

36
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:57,840
i won't say drag but it it gathers
 

37
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,110
i won't say drag but it it gathers
across

38
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
across
 

39
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,740
across
so we receive a person's cane

40
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:01,750
so we receive a person's cane
 

41
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,830
so we receive a person's cane
[Music]

42
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840

 

43
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,070

and we sweep this across this is where

44
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
and we sweep this across this is where
 

45
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,910
and we sweep this across this is where
it comes from

46
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:09,920
it comes from
 

47
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,630
it comes from
so we gather sorry

48
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640

 

49
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,710

that's too much because it it's like in

50
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
that's too much because it it's like in
 

51
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,469
that's too much because it it's like in
the world it's been too big our action

52
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
the world it's been too big our action
 

53
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,310
the world it's been too big our action
but if we go

54
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
but if we go
 

55
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,550
but if we go
so this is where this technique comes

56
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
so this is where this technique comes
 

57
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,230
so this is where this technique comes
it comes here

58
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240

 

59
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:50,230

so it comes from

60
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240

 

61
00:01:50,240 --> 00:02:15,430

now the camera can't see my

62
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440

 

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,229

has one triangle i sweep along the

64
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
has one triangle i sweep along the
 

65
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,229
has one triangle i sweep along the
bottom of the triangle

66
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
bottom of the triangle
 

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,350
bottom of the triangle
there's the other triangle

68
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,360
there's the other triangle
 

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:35,430
there's the other triangle
this is not a triangle

70
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440

 

71
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,430

circular triangular circular square

72
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
circular triangular circular square
 

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,920
