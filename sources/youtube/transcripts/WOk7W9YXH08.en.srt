a baby oh yeah you he looks like his
 

167
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,749
a baby oh yeah you he looks like his
grandfather or he looks like his mother

168
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:34,759
grandfather or he looks like his mother
 

169
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:39,950
grandfather or he looks like his mother
or all these things so so we

170
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:39,960
or all these things so so we
 

171
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,950
or all these things so so we
are an

172
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:41,960
are an
 

173
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,150
are an
accumulation of our ancestors and we're

174
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,160
accumulation of our ancestors and we're
 

175
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,469
accumulation of our ancestors and we're
carrying all those genes in in

176
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
carrying all those genes in in
 

177
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,110
carrying all those genes in in
us and therefore perhaps it was one of

178
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
us and therefore perhaps it was one of
 

179
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,189
us and therefore perhaps it was one of
them that is causing this uh depression

180
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:58,199
them that is causing this uh depression
 

181
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,590
them that is causing this uh depression
and and ton Gene may not be a depressive

182
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:02,600
and and ton Gene may not be a depressive
 

183
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,950
and and ton Gene may not be a depressive

say in the middle of a seesaw where I'm

244
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
say in the middle of a seesaw where I'm
 

245
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,309
say in the middle of a seesaw where I'm
not in a meditative state but I'm not in

246
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:57,319
not in a meditative state but I'm not in
 

247
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,270
not in a meditative state but I'm not in
an awakened state in the room that I'm

248
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
an awakened state in the room that I'm
 

249
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,510
an awakened state in the room that I'm
chosen to sit sit

250
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:04,520
chosen to sit sit
 

251
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,270
chosen to sit sit
in at that point I think we all have the

252
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:08,280
in at that point I think we all have the
 

253
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,150
in at that point I think we all have the
voice in our head that talks to us and

254
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,160
voice in our head that talks to us and
 

255
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,629
voice in our head that talks to us and
as I said earlier pictures of things

256
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:13,639
as I said earlier pictures of things
 

257
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,469
as I said earlier pictures of things
come to us and it's all created in the

258
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479

 

259
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,990

mind

260
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
mind
 

261
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,869
mind
so I decided the voice in my head that

262
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:23,879
so I decided the voice in my head that
 

263
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,029
so I decided the voice in my head that
isn't a voice at all it's your own voice

264
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
isn't a voice at all it's your own voice
 

265
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,029
isn't a voice at all it's your own voice
isn't it you know it's it's the voice

266
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
isn't it you know it's it's the voice
 

267
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,550
isn't it you know it's it's the voice
that you

268
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:31,560

 

269
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,150

you have in there it's not not not a

270
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,160
you have in there it's not not not a
 

271
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,110
you have in there it's not not not a
secondary thing that you've obtained and

272
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120

 

273
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,510

um so I decided I'd have a conversation

274
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:44,520
um so I decided I'd have a conversation
 

275
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,309
um so I decided I'd have a conversation
with the voice in my head and I asked

276
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
with the voice in my head and I asked
 

277
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,510
with the voice in my head and I asked
why do I get

278
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:50,520
why do I get
 

279
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,589
why do I get
depressed and I have to ask it calmly

00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
depressed and I have to ask it calmly
 

281
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,790
depressed and I have to ask it calmly
because I'm on the middle of the Seesaw

282
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:55,800

00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:51,800
tree and they research and the
 

601
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,550
tree and they research and the
information they get is normally about

00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
information they get is normally about
 

603
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,430
information they get is normally about
the person and you can do that if you

604
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
the person and you can do that if you
 

605
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,069
the person and you can do that if you
you so wish I don't follow that theory

606
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:01,079
you so wish I don't follow that theory
 

607
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,750
you so wish I don't follow that theory
I'd rather follow um and give it time

608
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:04,760
I'd rather follow um and give it time
 

609
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,309
I'd rather follow um and give it time
that I have available in

610
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
that I have available in
 

611
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,949
that I have available in
myself so I hope this

612
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
myself so I hope this
 

613
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,789
myself so I hope this
helps

614
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
helps
 

615
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,189
helps
um so in brief if there's things you

616
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:17,199
um so in brief if there's things you
 

617
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,549
um so in brief if there's things you
don't like about

618
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:19,559
don't like about
 

619
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,870
don't like about
yourself and you question if that is

620
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:22,880
yourself and you question if that is
 

621
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,510
yourself and you question if that is
really you that is this disruptive

622
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:26,520
really you that is this disruptive
 

623
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,070
really you that is this disruptive
person or if

624
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
person or if
 

625
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,549
person or if
you're a kind person and your Gene is a

626
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:33,559
you're a kind person and your Gene is a
 

627
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:36,270
you're a kind person and your Gene is a
disruptive one I would hopefully not be

628
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:36,280
disruptive one I would hopefully not be
 

629
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,029
disruptive one I would hopefully not be
encouraging you to become the disruptive

630
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:40,039
encouraging you to become the disruptive
 

631
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:42,830
encouraging you to become the disruptive
person because I think that who I'm

632
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:42,840
person because I think that who I'm
 

633
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,590
person because I think that who I'm
speaking to will only be people that

634
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
speaking to will only be people that
 

635
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,710
speaking to will only be people that
will want to find a better you find your

636
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:49,720
will want to find a better you find your
 

637
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,710
will want to find a better you find your
