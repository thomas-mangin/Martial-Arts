00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,070

nor am i

2
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
nor am i
 

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,310
nor am i
walking how i imagined

4
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320

 

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,990

that samurai would walk

6
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000

 

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,750

just bend your knees

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760

 

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,950

so

10
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960

 

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,110

he's got some resistance and if i just

12
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
he's got some resistance and if i just
 

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,389
he's got some resistance and if i just
try to walk he'll

14
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
try to walk he'll
 

15
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,590
try to walk he'll
catch my center of gravity as i'm going

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
catch my center of gravity as i'm going
 

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,470
catch my center of gravity as i'm going
forward so i have to establish

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
forward so i have to establish
 

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,069
forward so i have to establish
single footed points

20
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:02,079

 

21
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,990

so each each step is a culture

22
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
so each each step is a culture
 

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,990
so each each step is a culture
projection

24
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
projection
 

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:22,630
projection
not walking into free space or

26
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640

 

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,630

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:40,150
line
and he matches it

68
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160

 

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,550

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
okay so working with the same charge
 

79
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,309
okay so working with the same charge
notion the yo

80
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
notion the yo
 

81
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,750

so right now uh we're too close
 

85
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,990
so right now uh we're too close
so i have to pay attention to the mod i

so i have to pay attention to the mod i
 

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,350
so i have to pay attention to the mod i
still have the same measuring

88
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
still have the same measuring
 

89
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,869
still have the same measuring
drill okay so in other words like oh

and not any kind of grappling situation
and he goes into his hands or something

106
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
and he goes into his hands or something
 

107
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,830
and he goes into his hands or something
you get it so i have to be in that sweet

108
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
you get it so i have to be in that sweet
 

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,110
you get it so i have to be in that sweet
spot

110
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
spot
 

111
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,070
spot
now if i'm out here then i'm not a

112
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
now if i'm out here then i'm not a
 

113
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,949
now if i'm out here then i'm not a
threat to him

114
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
threat to him
 

115
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,789
threat to him
that's why it's a sweet spot i can't be

116
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
that's why it's a sweet spot i can't be
 

117
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,509
that's why it's a sweet spot i can't be
too close and i can't be too far

118
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
too close and i can't be too far
 

119
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,710
too close and i can't be too far
so i'm out i'm in this perfect spot

120
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
so i'm out i'm in this perfect spot
 

121
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,710
so i'm out i'm in this perfect spot
where he wants to fight with the weapon

122
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
where he wants to fight with the weapon
 

123
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,309
where he wants to fight with the weapon
he does not want to fight

124
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
he does not want to fight
 

125
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,469
he does not want to fight
with his uh body yard but i can hit him

00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
with his uh body yard but i can hit him
 

127
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,749
with his uh body yard but i can hit him
or he can hit me within a ski range

128
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
or he can hit me within a ski range
 

129
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,870
or he can hit me within a ski range
alright so now comes the problem

130
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
alright so now comes the problem
 

131
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,150
alright so now comes the problem
how do i move there

132
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
how do i move there
 

133
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,390
how do i move there
most people take the line of gravity

134
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
most people take the line of gravity
 

135
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,749
most people take the line of gravity
between their feet like that

136
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
between their feet like that
 

137
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,390
between their feet like that
so you can look at it you're going out

138
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
so you can look at it you're going out
 

139
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,030
so you can look at it you're going out
and then

140
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
and then
 

141
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,749
and then
down out and then down

142
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
down out and then down
 

143
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,150
down out and then down
and instead i have to establish that

144
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
and instead i have to establish that
 

145
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,670
and instead i have to establish that
ground vector

146
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
ground vector
 

147
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,189
ground vector
i have to drop down and then

148
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
i have to drop down and then
 

149
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,469
i have to drop down and then
out so it's the exact opposite i go down

150
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
out so it's the exact opposite i go down
 

151
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,030
out so it's the exact opposite i go down
and then i go out so first let's look

152
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
and then i go out so first let's look
 

153
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,150
and then i go out so first let's look
you're going to be

154
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
you're going to be
 

155
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,189
you're going to be
stressed on the end of my web okay i'm

156
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
stressed on the end of my web okay i'm
 

157
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,230
stressed on the end of my web okay i'm
gonna try

158
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
gonna try
 

159
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,390
gonna try
to do the other one and again you have

160
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
to do the other one and again you have
 

161
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,830
to do the other one and again you have
the same problem that you'll have in

162
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
the same problem that you'll have in
 

163
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,550
the same problem that you'll have in
saigon

164
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
saigon
 

165
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,350
saigon
you won't be able to go forward you have

166
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
you won't be able to go forward you have
 

167
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,510
you won't be able to go forward you have
to establish the ground vector

168
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
to establish the ground vector
 

169
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,550
to establish the ground vector
down and then you can go forward with

170
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
down and then you can go forward with
 

171
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,110
down and then you can go forward with
the coq projection

172
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
the coq projection
 

173
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,790
the coq projection
so if i get caught in the middle

174
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
so if i get caught in the middle
 

175
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,870
so if i get caught in the middle
boom i'm actually not going to do what i

176
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
boom i'm actually not going to do what i
 

177
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,110
boom i'm actually not going to do what i
think i'm going to do

178
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
think i'm going to do
 

179
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,510
think i'm going to do
but there's a range variation that

180
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
but there's a range variation that
 

181
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,870
but there's a range variation that
happens too

182
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
happens too
 

183
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,909
happens too
when you go i'll move the little side

184
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
when you go i'll move the little side
 

185
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,710
when you go i'll move the little side
when i go out and then down i can't

186
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
when i go out and then down i can't
 

187
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,790
when i go out and then down i can't
really penetrate that far

188
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
really penetrate that far
 

189
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,070
really penetrate that far
because i don't get that thrust into the

190
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
because i don't get that thrust into the
 

191
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,189
because i don't get that thrust into the
movement

192
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
movement
 

193
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,230
movement
so instead i'm going down

194
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
so instead i'm going down
 

195
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,550
so instead i'm going down
home and then you can see my weapon can

196
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
home and then you can see my weapon can
 

197
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,370
home and then you can see my weapon can
do its job

198
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:43,380
do its job
 

199
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,270
do its job

201
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,469

so we add that movement to the drill

202
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
so we add that movement to the drill
 

203
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,830
so we add that movement to the drill
okay so he's going to give

204
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
okay so he's going to give
 

205
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,830
okay so he's going to give
go from this neutral to give the opening

206
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
go from this neutral to give the opening
 

207
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,230
go from this neutral to give the opening
he's going to adopt that position and

208
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
he's going to adopt that position and
 

209
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,230
he's going to adopt that position and
the opening happens

210
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
the opening happens
 

211
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,189
the opening happens
there so that is where i start my

212
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
there so that is where i start my

i'm reading his body

238
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400

 

239
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,029

okay let's go he's doing that drill and

240
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
okay let's go he's doing that drill and
 

241
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,550
okay let's go he's doing that drill and
i'm going to bring another training

242
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
i'm going to bring another training
 

243
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,870
i'm going to bring another training
aspect into it

244
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
aspect into it
 

245
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,950
aspect into it
uh so i'm gonna give the opening go to

246
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
uh so i'm gonna give the opening go to
 

247
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,510
uh so i'm gonna give the opening go to
and uh i'm going to ride this one

248
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520

 

249
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,790

so i'm not gonna go like this

i want to i want to increase
 

253
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:28,390
i want to i want to increase
my measuring capacity

254
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400

 

255
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,150

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520

 

259
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,589

that would be a mismanagement

260
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599

 

261
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,350

but so is this i want to get used to

262
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
but so is this i want to get used to
 

263
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,710
but so is this i want to get used to
staying

264
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
staying
 

265
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,150
staying
in the crucible

266
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160

 

267
00:07:48,160 --> 00:08:01,029

i want to hang out there

268
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,039

 

269
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:09,670

you can go go

270
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680

 

271
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,510

okay let's go okay so

272
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
okay let's go okay so
 

273
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,469
okay let's go okay so
that last drill is about an acceptance

274
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
that last drill is about an acceptance
 

275
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,909
that last drill is about an acceptance
of the violence so

276
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
of the violence so
 

277
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,029
of the violence so
if he's coming this is not accepting it

278
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
if he's coming this is not accepting it
 

279
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,390
if he's coming this is not accepting it
he's still trying to be safe okay

280
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
he's still trying to be safe okay
 

281
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,510
he's still trying to be safe okay
he goes i'm just riding this thing

282
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520

 

283
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,350

so somewhere you are he goes and you're

284
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
so somewhere you are he goes and you're
 

285
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,949
so somewhere you are he goes and you're
here why didn't you go this extra far

286
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959

 

287
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,310

just be right here is there

288
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320

 

289
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,870

is i'm going to use that skill which is

290
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
is i'm going to use that skill which is
 

291
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,710
is i'm going to use that skill which is
more of an emotional acceptance of

292
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
more of an emotional acceptance of
 

293
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,070
more of an emotional acceptance of
what's happening

294
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
what's happening
 

295
00:08:50,080 --> 00:09:06,710
what's happening
uh to be in and do ushito tencon

296
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720

 

297
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,190

i want to lure him in

298
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200

 

299
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,389

not moving make him not want to do it

300
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
not moving make him not want to do it
 

301
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:39,269
not moving make him not want to do it
i lure him

302
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:39,279

 

303
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,190

then we go slow for the details

304
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
then we go slow for the details
 

305
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,710
then we go slow for the details
up

306
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720

 

307
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,949

up turn your palms

308
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
up turn your palms
 

309
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,829
up turn your palms
not straight turn your palms this is

310
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
not straight turn your palms this is
 

311
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,190
not straight turn your palms this is
basically

312
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
basically
 

313
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:07,350
basically
show man wrist turn

314
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360

 

315
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,310

single pivot point then you're out of

316
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
single pivot point then you're out of
 

317
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,430
single pivot point then you're out of
the way

318
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440

 

319
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,190

then the timing can't be he goes

320
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
then the timing can't be he goes
 

321
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:35,190
then the timing can't be he goes
wait then i go

322
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200

 

323
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,430

so it's not realistic

324
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440

 

325
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,949

um or let's just say it's delusional

326
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
um or let's just say it's delusional
 

327
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,990
um or let's just say it's delusional
that i afford myself a superior

328
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
that i afford myself a superior
 

329
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,630
that i afford myself a superior
speed and give him an inferior speed

330
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
speed and give him an inferior speed
 

331
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,670
speed and give him an inferior speed
so if i'm doing two steps to their one

332
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
so if i'm doing two steps to their one
 

333
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,190
so if i'm doing two steps to their one
step

334
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
step
 

335
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,190
step
this is not sound reasoning okay

336
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
this is not sound reasoning okay
 

337
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,470
this is not sound reasoning okay
so when i if i go here

338
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
so when i if i go here
 

339
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,590
so when i if i go here
and i go one and you go

340
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
and i go one and you go
 

341
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,590
and i go one and you go
two i i will be a b behind so let's say

342
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
two i i will be a b behind so let's say
 

343
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:26,949
two i i will be a b behind so let's say
he's going to double ski he won't

344
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:26,959

 

345
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:34,310

stay in the same rhythm okay

346
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320

 

347
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,790

we'll go we'll do the other one okay

348
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
we'll go we'll do the other one okay
 

349
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,230
we'll go we'll do the other one okay
we'll just stay slow so you can

350
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
we'll just stay slow so you can
 

351
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:45,990
we'll just stay slow so you can
slow slow okay one

352
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000

 

353
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,430

okay um

354
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
okay um
 

355
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,670
okay um
let's also look at another one

356
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
let's also look at another one
 

357
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,790
let's also look at another one
a worse one i'm going to do

358
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
a worse one i'm going to do
 

359
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,110
a worse one i'm going to do
three so you can see what it is he does

360
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
three so you can see what it is he does
 

361
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,990
three so you can see what it is he does
his ski

362
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
his ski
 

363
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,030
his ski
and i'm going to go one two

364
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
and i'm going to go one two
 

365
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,629
and i'm going to go one two
three do you see again so you can see

366
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
three do you see again so you can see
 

367
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,389
three do you see again so you can see
one i'm sorry

368
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399

 

369
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,550

one two three

370
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
one two three
 

371
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,190
one two three
then kill double ski on that one

372
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,200

 

373
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,110

got the idea okay so what we're doing

374
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
got the idea okay so what we're doing
 

375
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,829
got the idea okay so what we're doing
with the shiro tencon

376
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
with the shiro tencon
 

377
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,310
with the shiro tencon
is uh he's coming in and the game goes

378
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
is uh he's coming in and the game goes
 

379
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,430
is uh he's coming in and the game goes
slow

380
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
slow
 

381
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,069
slow
so when i i'm luring him into the

382
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
so when i i'm luring him into the
 

383
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,590
so when i i'm luring him into the
initial ski

384
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600
initial ski
 

385
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,870
initial ski
and i'm shifting off the line

386
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
and i'm shifting off the line
 

387
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,670
and i'm shifting off the line
all i gotta do now is rotate and he's

388
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:43,680
all i gotta do now is rotate and he's
 

389
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,550
all i gotta do now is rotate and he's
missed

390
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560
missed
 

391
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,790
missed
do you see

392
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800

 

393
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,629

so we'll do it on the other side

394
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639

 

395
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,069

okay so when i establish the rear

396
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
okay so when i establish the rear
 

397
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,310
okay so when i establish the rear
vector i'm moving to the right

398
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
vector i'm moving to the right
 

399
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,710
vector i'm moving to the right
he goes and then i rotate on that rear

400
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
he goes and then i rotate on that rear
 

401
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,190
he goes and then i rotate on that rear
vector

402
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
vector
 

403
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,870
vector
he's missed this step is not for

404
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
he's missed this step is not for
 

405
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,550
he's missed this step is not for
deviation

406
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
deviation
 

407
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,790
deviation
this step is for acquiring the new line

408
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800
this step is for acquiring the new line
 

409
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,829
this step is for acquiring the new line
of attack

410
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
of attack
 

411
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,150
of attack
the deviation already happened

412
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
the deviation already happened
 

413
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,509
the deviation already happened
on here one

414
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
on here one
 

415
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:31,990
on here one
two

416
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000

 

417
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,110

do you see then

418
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120

 

419
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,189

on the go watch what i'm doing

420
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199

 

421
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:47,350

i already put the right hand in place

422
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360

 

423
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,110

i don't leave it here then i'm going to

424
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
i don't leave it here then i'm going to
 

425
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,470
i don't leave it here then i'm going to
try to move it boom

426
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
try to move it boom
 

427
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,710
try to move it boom
it'll tend to get twisted up let's do

428
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
it'll tend to get twisted up let's do
 

429
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,150
it'll tend to get twisted up let's do
that first

430
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
that first
 

431
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,750
that first
on here and right here you're twisted up

432
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,760
on here and right here you're twisted up
 

433
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,750
on here and right here you're twisted up
half body on the other one your initial

434
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
half body on the other one your initial
 

435
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,590
half body on the other one your initial
stance in essence

436
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600

 

437
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,069

so bring the weapon to

438
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079

 

439
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,269

with you to you home

440

showman turn your wrist
 

445
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:28,829
showman turn your wrist
and you have your kesa

446
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839

 

447
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:35,269

um

448
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279

 

449
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,230

so don't get hung up on this block it's

450
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,240
so don't get hung up on this block it's
 

451
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,110
so don't get hung up on this block it's
not a block

452
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120

 

453
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,870

the deviation already made him miss okay

454
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
the deviation already made him miss okay
 

455
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,269
the deviation already made him miss okay
so instead prep your weapon boom deviate

456
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
so instead prep your weapon boom deviate
 

457
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,990
so instead prep your weapon boom deviate
boom

458
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000

 

459
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,949

we don't block so i don't need this

460
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
we don't block so i don't need this
 

461
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,870
we don't block so i don't need this
movement there

462
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
movement there
 

463
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,350
movement there
i'm not hitting his hands i'm going for

464
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
i'm not hitting his hands i'm going for
 

465
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,990
i'm not hitting his hands i'm going for
his head

466
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000

 

467
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,350

so okay the deviations

468
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
so okay the deviations
 

469
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,590
so okay the deviations
okay try it okay another beginner

470
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
okay try it okay another beginner
 

471
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,350
okay try it okay another beginner
mistake

472
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
mistake
 

473
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,670
mistake
is he's coming in and you were told i'm

474
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
is he's coming in and you were told i'm
 

475
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,949
is he's coming in and you were told i'm
not hitting his hands

476
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
not hitting his hands
 

477
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,949
not hitting his hands
and i'm i'm baiting him in so i don't

478
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959
and i'm i'm baiting him in so i don't
 

479
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,790
and i'm i'm baiting him in so i don't
want to i don't want to deflect his

480
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:24,800
want to i don't want to deflect his
 

481
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,750
want to i don't want to deflect his
weapon

482
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:25,760
weapon
 

483
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,110
weapon
and so your solution is that you

484
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
and so your solution is that you
 

485
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,550
and so your solution is that you
take your weapon here you see

486
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
take your weapon here you see
 

487
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,910
take your weapon here you see
and this is not this is not very strong

488
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:35,920
and this is not this is not very strong
 

489
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,629
and this is not this is not very strong
so i want that angle i want the angle

490
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
so i want that angle i want the angle
 

491
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,509
so i want that angle i want the angle
instead

492
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
instead
 

493
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,550
instead
okay so i'm here like this

494
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,560
okay so i'm here like this
 

495
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,389
okay so i'm here like this
and he pushes my leash see i can't get

496
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
and he pushes my leash see i can't get
 

497
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,389
and he pushes my leash see i can't get
it but if i come underneath

498
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
it but if i come underneath
 

499
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,189
it but if i come underneath
there's more integrity to the weapon

500
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199
there's more integrity to the weapon
 

501
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,030
there's more integrity to the weapon
second point on that

502
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
second point on that
 

503
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,710
second point on that
is i'm already performing the kesa

504
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
is i'm already performing the kesa
 

505
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,749
is i'm already performing the kesa
so we'll just get there okay so

506
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:57,759
so we'll just get there okay so
 

507
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,110
so we'll just get there okay so
the kesa is hidden here okay

508
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120
the kesa is hidden here okay
 

509
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,230
the kesa is hidden here okay
and that that's my angle

510
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
and that that's my angle
 

511
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,389
and that that's my angle
and so this is the plane that i want to

512
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:06,399
and so this is the plane that i want to
 

513
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,150
and so this is the plane that i want to
work on

514
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
work on
 

515
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,430
work on
so when i come around to here

516
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
so when i come around to here
 

517
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,069
so when i come around to here
