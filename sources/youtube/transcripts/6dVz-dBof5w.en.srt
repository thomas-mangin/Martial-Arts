down you're going to get stabbed for it
probably multiple times and probably

probably multiple times and probably
 

97
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,850
probably multiple times and probably
fatally so your takedown cost you

98
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:56,860
fatally so your takedown cost you
 

99

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,250
it and this is true we don't and you see
 

135
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,070
it and this is true we don't and you see
I ghetto people in claim situation they

I ghetto people in claim situation they
 

137
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,660
I ghetto people in claim situation they
don't do well right so there's some

138
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:38,670

don't see clench work the reasons simple
 

161
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,620
don't see clench work the reasons simple
it's not because clinch work is not

162
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:03,630
it's not because clinch work is not
 

163
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,480
it's not because clinch work is not
important it's because if we get into a

164
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,490
important it's because if we get into a
 

165
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,910
important it's because if we get into a
clinch we're not going to be able to get

166
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
clinch we're not going to be able to get
 

167
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,470
clinch we're not going to be able to get
out before another person you come in

168
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:09,480
out before another person you come in
 

169
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,690
out before another person you come in
and hurt us right so when we lose the

170
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:11,700
and hurt us right so when we lose the
 

171
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,580
and hurt us right so when we lose the
autonomy right we get down into the

172
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:13,590
autonomy right we get down into the
 

173
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,690
autonomy right we get down into the
clinch and start working on the

174
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:14,700
clinch and start working on the
 

175
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,610
clinch and start working on the
Reez dealing with one person which is

176
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:16,620
Reez dealing with one person which is
 

177
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,160
Reez dealing with one person which is
good in a one-on-one match it opens us

178
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,170
good in a one-on-one match it opens us
 

179
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,990
good in a one-on-one match it opens us
up to be attacked by another person now

180
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,000
up to be attacked by another person now
 

181
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,630
up to be attacked by another person now
this doesn't mean that we cannot be

182
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:23,640
this doesn't mean that we cannot be
 

183
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,950
this doesn't mean that we cannot be
clinched and that that wouldn't be bad

184
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:24,960
clinched and that that wouldn't be bad
 

185
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,020
clinched and that that wouldn't be bad
for a multiple tacker situation what it

186
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,030
for a multiple tacker situation what it
 

187
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,400
for a multiple tacker situation what it
means is we spend a lot of time trying

188
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,410
means is we spend a lot of time trying
 

189
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,560
means is we spend a lot of time trying
to avoid the clinch so we don't have

190
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:30,570
to avoid the clinch so we don't have
 

191
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,260
to avoid the clinch so we don't have
throws that come from a clinch situation

192
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,270
throws that come from a clinch situation
 

193
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,510
throws that come from a clinch situation
we have throws that come pre clinch we

194
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:35,520
we have throws that come pre clinch we
 

195
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,160
we have throws that come pre clinch we
have escapes to keep us from getting

196
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,170
have escapes to keep us from getting
 

197
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,690
have escapes to keep us from getting
into the clinch so we don't have clinch

198
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:38,700
into the clinch so we don't have clinch
 

199
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,030
into the clinch so we don't have clinch
escapes too late then but we have pre

200
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
escapes too late then but we have pre
 

201
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,770
escapes too late then but we have pre
clinch escapes we have escapes that are

202
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:42,780
clinch escapes we have escapes that are
 

203
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,910
clinch escapes we have escapes that are
designed to get us out of a situation

204
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
designed to get us out of a situation
 

205
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,310
designed to get us out of a situation
before the clinch even happens and in

206
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:46,320
before the clinch even happens and in
 

207
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,690
before the clinch even happens and in
just being a foregone conclusion that if

208
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:47,700
just being a foregone conclusion that if
 

209
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,460
just being a foregone conclusion that if
we're clinched it's going to be too late

210
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,470
we're clinched it's going to be too late
 

211
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,690
we're clinched it's going to be too late
right so it doesn't matter how good I am

212
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:50,700
right so it doesn't matter how good I am
 

213
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,970
right so it doesn't matter how good I am
in the clinch it takes too long from a

214
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:52,980
in the clinch it takes too long from a
 

215
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,700
in the clinch it takes too long from a
clinch to deal with multiple attackers

216
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:55,710
clinch to deal with multiple attackers
 

217
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,470
clinch to deal with multiple attackers
so why it's been a lot of my time

218
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:57,480
so why it's been a lot of my time
 

219
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,030
so why it's been a lot of my time
working on the clinch when I'm going to

220
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
working on the clinch when I'm going to
 

221
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,150
working on the clinch when I'm going to
always be facing multiple attackers

222
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,160
always be facing multiple attackers
 

223
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,620
always be facing multiple attackers
another criticism you see of I kiddo is

224
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:03,630
another criticism you see of I kiddo is
 

225
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,530
another criticism you see of I kiddo is
why do I canoga spend so much time on

226
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:06,540
why do I canoga spend so much time on
 

227
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,240
why do I canoga spend so much time on
wrist grabs and wrist grab seem like a

228
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,250
wrist grabs and wrist grab seem like a
 

229
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,650
wrist grabs and wrist grab seem like a
very silly attack that doesn't happen

230
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:09,660
very silly attack that doesn't happen
 

231
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,560
very silly attack that doesn't happen
that much it's not a very solid attack

232
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:12,570
that much it's not a very solid attack
 

233
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,090
that much it's not a very solid attack
so why do we spend a lot of time with

234
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,100
so why do we spend a lot of time with
 

235
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,130
so why do we spend a lot of time with
that what I just said about the pre

236
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,140
that what I just said about the pre
 

237
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,380
that what I just said about the pre
clinch applies to that and also another

238
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:18,390
clinch applies to that and also another
 

239
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,030
clinch applies to that and also another
important factor when we look at weapons

240
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,040
important factor when we look at weapons
 

241
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,190
important factor when we look at weapons
applies to this so if I have a weapon in

242
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,200
applies to this so if I have a weapon in
 

243
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,770
applies to this so if I have a weapon in
my hand if you don't control the weapon

244
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:24,780
my hand if you don't control the weapon
 

245
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,410
my hand if you don't control the weapon
I'm

246
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:25,420
I'm
 

247
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,150
I'm
to use the weapon on you so for example

248
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,160
to use the weapon on you so for example
 

249
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,340
to use the weapon on you so for example
if you want a box with me and I have a

250
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:29,350
if you want a box with me and I have a
 

251
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,320
if you want a box with me and I have a
knife I'm going to use the knife on you

252
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,330
knife I'm going to use the knife on you
 

253
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,720
knife I'm going to use the knife on you
likely even if you're better at hitting

254
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:33,730
likely even if you're better at hitting
 

255
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,700
likely even if you're better at hitting
me that I am in hitting you every hit I

256
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:35,710
me that I am in hitting you every hit I
 

257
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,410
me that I am in hitting you every hit I
make on you is going to be far more

258
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:37,420
make on you is going to be far more
 

259
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,270
make on you is going to be far more
effective than the hits you make on me

260
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
effective than the hits you make on me
 

261
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,950
effective than the hits you make on me
right so my strikes with the weapon are

262
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
right so my strikes with the weapon are
 

263
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,240
right so my strikes with the weapon are
going to be more powerful than your

264
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,250
going to be more powerful than your
 

265
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,900
going to be more powerful than your
strikes unarmed so that doesn't mean

266
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:45,910
strikes unarmed so that doesn't mean
 

267
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,390
strikes unarmed so that doesn't mean
that the boxing is not valid what it

268
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
that the boxing is not valid what it
 

269
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,680
that the boxing is not valid what it
means is within our context you you need

270
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:52,690
means is within our context you you need
 

271
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,970
means is within our context you you need
to control my weapon hand if you can't

272
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:53,980
to control my weapon hand if you can't
 

273
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,740
to control my weapon hand if you can't
control my weapon hand you're not going

274
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:55,750
control my weapon hand you're not going
 

275
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,900
control my weapon hand you're not going
to be a very effective against me so for

276
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:57,910
to be a very effective against me so for
 

277
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,330
to be a very effective against me so for
me if I have a weapon you grabbing my

278
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:00,340
me if I have a weapon you grabbing my
 

279
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,400
me if I have a weapon you grabbing my
wrist is a serious problem the reason

280
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,410
wrist is a serious problem the reason
 

281
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,720
wrist is a serious problem the reason
serious problems because now you control

282
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:03,730
serious problems because now you control
 

283
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,370
serious problems because now you control
my weapon now every time you hit me I

284
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:05,380
my weapon now every time you hit me I
 

285
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,330
my weapon now every time you hit me I
can't hit you back because you're

286
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:06,340
can't hit you back because you're
 

287
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,040
can't hit you back because you're
controlling my weapon hand so you're

288
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,050
controlling my weapon hand so you're
 

289
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,930
controlling my weapon hand so you're
going to hit me I cannot use my weapon I

290
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:09,940
going to hit me I cannot use my weapon I
 

291
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,370
going to hit me I cannot use my weapon I
don't have an advantage anymore so it's

292
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:11,380
don't have an advantage anymore so it's
 

293
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,410
don't have an advantage anymore so it's
important to learn lots of ways to clear

294
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:13,420
important to learn lots of ways to clear
 

295
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,150
important to learn lots of ways to clear
my weapon hand and use your desire to

296
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,160
my weapon hand and use your desire to
 

297
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,580
my weapon hand and use your desire to
hold my weapon against you to trap your

298
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,590
hold my weapon against you to trap your
 

299
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,650
hold my weapon against you to trap your
mind with your desire to hold my weapon

300
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:19,660
mind with your desire to hold my weapon
 

301
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,230
mind with your desire to hold my weapon
and use that against you so these are

302
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
and use that against you so these are
 

303
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,820
and use that against you so these are
just a few specifics and we'll cover

304
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:23,830
just a few specifics and we'll cover
 

305
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,620
just a few specifics and we'll cover
more in other videos later I just want

306
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:25,630
more in other videos later I just want
 

307
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,580
more in other videos later I just want
to give you a few right now so you can

308
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:26,590
to give you a few right now so you can
 

309
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,560
to give you a few right now so you can
kind of get an idea of why techniques

310
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:28,570
kind of get an idea of why techniques
 

311
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,390
kind of get an idea of why techniques
for one system might not be effective

312
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
for one system might not be effective
 

313
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,460
for one system might not be effective
for another because of our contextual

314
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:32,470
for another because of our contextual
 

315
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,230
for another because of our contextual
differences so I hope this helped

316
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
differences so I hope this helped
 

317
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,270
differences so I hope this helped
clarify marshal context for you why

318
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:36,280
clarify marshal context for you why
 

319
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,620
clarify marshal context for you why
