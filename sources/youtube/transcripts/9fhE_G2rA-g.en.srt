39
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,930
but you see that doesn't sit with me
because I was in the era where

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,570
I've got those or please go past Ronnie
if I sort of if I say please go past but

170
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:47,580
if I sort of if I say please go past but
 

171
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,250
if I sort of if I say please go past but
I've got to do this technique so I can't

172
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:49,260
I've got to do this technique so I can't
 

173
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,050
I've got to do this technique so I can't
leave too much space

174
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:51,060
leave too much space
 

175
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,570
leave too much space
then I'm not believing in

176
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:53,580

from coming in and just keeping enough
 

189
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:15,890
from coming in and just keeping enough
there that

190
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:15,900

 

191

through being me
 

199
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,510
through being me
and not realizing oh blimey I've heard

200
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
and not realizing oh blimey I've heard
 

201

203
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,670
him say that so many times I didn't
realize the essence of it

204
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680

 

205
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,530

all right control come up

206
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:41,540
all right control come up
 

207
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,490
all right control come up
come up

208
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:45,500

 

209
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,770

I'll keep coming don't don't get don't

210
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:48,780
I'll keep coming don't don't get don't
 

211
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,550
I'll keep coming don't don't get don't
get tired

212
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560

 

213
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,129

all right you don't know what's going on

214
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:55,139
all right you don't know what's going on
 

215
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,430
all right you don't know what's going on
in my head and I'm like I'm like Fork

216
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:58,440
in my head and I'm like I'm like Fork
 

217
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,290
in my head and I'm like I'm like Fork
lightning I'm down there I'm going

218
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:03,300

 

219
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,930

I'm working out every twitch he's doing

220
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:05,940
I'm working out every twitch he's doing
 

221
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,710
I'm working out every twitch he's doing
I'm working out electrical angle

222
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:09,720
I'm working out electrical angle
 

223
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,590
I'm working out electrical angle
all right so a bit too heavy for today

224
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:12,600
all right so a bit too heavy for today
 

225
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,670
all right so a bit too heavy for today
isn't it but

226
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:16,680

 

227
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,749

so if you think you're turning over but

228
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:20,759
so if you think you're turning over but
 

229
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,450
so if you think you're turning over but
then it goes over that way a little bit

230
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:23,460
then it goes over that way a little bit
 

231
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,310
then it goes over that way a little bit
you're not actually getting out the way

232
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,320
you're not actually getting out the way
 

233
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,650
you're not actually getting out the way
because then you bring it back here

234
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:27,660
because then you bring it back here
 

235
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,950
because then you bring it back here
and it might be subtle but that's what

236
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
and it might be subtle but that's what
 

237
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,990
and it might be subtle but that's what
as a teacher I'm trying to give you

238
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000

 

239
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,409

subtlety

240
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:39,419

 

241
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,930

okay so we'll try again

242
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:41,940
okay so we'll try again
 

243
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,150
okay so we'll try again
you don't have to think exactly what I

244
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
you don't have to think exactly what I
 

245
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,550
you don't have to think exactly what I
think but you know make sure you're not

246
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
think but you know make sure you're not
 

247
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,650
think but you know make sure you're not
in their way they should they should be

248
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:48,660
in their way they should they should be
 

249
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,590
in their way they should they should be
able to keep going and you should be

250
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
able to keep going and you should be
 

251
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,350
able to keep going and you should be
able to do the technique

252
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:54,360
able to do the technique
 

253
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,510
able to do the technique
there's this one

254
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:56,520
there's this one
 

255
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,070
there's this one
there's this one well I'm still getting

256
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
there's this one well I'm still getting
 

257
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,249
there's this one well I'm still getting
out the way but the right time in that

258
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:01,259
out the way but the right time in that
 

259
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,230
out the way but the right time in that
one comes in

260
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,240
one comes in
 

261
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,330
one comes in
so you can play around I don't care how

262
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:05,340
so you can play around I don't care how
 

263
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,189
so you can play around I don't care how
many variations I say I normally see a

264
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
many variations I say I normally see a
 

265
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,810
many variations I say I normally see a
lot of variations when you're trying to

266
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:08,820
lot of variations when you're trying to
 

267
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,170
lot of variations when you're trying to
do it my way anyhow

268
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,180

 

269
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,840

thank you
