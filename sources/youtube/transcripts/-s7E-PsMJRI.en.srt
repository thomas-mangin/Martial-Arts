how this actually plays out in live

78
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
how this actually plays out in live
 

79
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,789
how this actually plays out in live
situations

80
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
situations
 

81
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,469
situations
here we go all right there's no such

82
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
here we go all right there's no such
 

83
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,670
here we go all right there's no such
thing as a knife fight

84
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
thing as a knife fight
 

85
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,749
thing as a knife fight
what does that mean so it's provocative

86
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
what does that mean so it's provocative
 

87
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,109
what does that mean so it's provocative
language on purpose

88
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
language on purpose
 

89
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,030
language on purpose
i'm not saying that there's never been

90
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
i'm not saying that there's never been
 

91
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,230
i'm not saying that there's never been
situations where

92
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
situations where
 

93
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,910
situations where
two people have knives and they attack

94
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
two people have knives and they attack
 

95
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,830
two people have knives and they attack
each other that has certainly happened

96
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
each other that has certainly happened
 

97
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,950
each other that has certainly happened
but it's not the same as a fist fight or

98
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
but it's not the same as a fist fight or
 

99
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,710
but it's not the same as a fist fight or
a sword fight and so when we say

100
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
a sword fight and so when we say
 

101
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,149
a sword fight and so when we say
knife fighting we have a tendency to

102
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
knife fighting we have a tendency to
 

103
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,149
knife fighting we have a tendency to
drop this idea of two people dueling

104
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
drop this idea of two people dueling
 

105
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,590
drop this idea of two people dueling
like they would in a boxing match

106
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
like they would in a boxing match
 

107
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,190
like they would in a boxing match
or like they might do with swords but

108
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
or like they might do with swords but
 

109
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,630
or like they might do with swords but
knives are very different for

110
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
knives are very different for
 

111
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,710
knives are very different for
a really important reason so a knife

112
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
a really important reason so a knife
 

113
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,230
a really important reason so a knife
fight doesn't really exist there's only

114
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
fight doesn't really exist there's only
 

115
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,749
fight doesn't really exist there's only
kind of two people murdering each other

116
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
kind of two people murdering each other
 

117
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,469
kind of two people murdering each other
with knives

118
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
with knives
 

119
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,510
with knives
and we're going to talk about that you

120
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
and we're going to talk about that you
 

121
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,670
and we're going to talk about that you
can see we've decked maya and josh out

122
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
can see we've decked maya and josh out
 

123
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,190
can see we've decked maya and josh out
in super sweet outfits here so we can

124
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
in super sweet outfits here so we can
 

125
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,069
in super sweet outfits here so we can
see how that plays

126
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
see how that plays
 

127
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,670
see how that plays
out we're gonna do some live training

128
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
out we're gonna do some live training
 

129
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,190
out we're gonna do some live training
before this video is over but

130
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
before this video is over but
 

131
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,469
before this video is over but
first we're gonna do some theory and

132
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
first we're gonna do some theory and
 

133
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,389
first we're gonna do some theory and
talk about what i mean by there's no

134
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
talk about what i mean by there's no
 

135
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,069
talk about what i mean by there's no
such thing as a knife fight so if i was

136
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
such thing as a knife fight so if i was
 

137
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,910
such thing as a knife fight so if i was
fist fighting here with maya so we're

138
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
fist fighting here with maya so we're
 

139
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,310
fist fighting here with maya so we're
here in a fist fight if we are roughly

140
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
here in a fist fight if we are roughly
 

141
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,429
here in a fist fight if we are roughly
the same size

142
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
the same size
 

143
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,309
the same size
every time i hit maya maya can hit me

144
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
every time i hit maya maya can hit me
 

145
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,150
every time i hit maya maya can hit me
back right so uh we hit each other back

146
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
back right so uh we hit each other back
 

147
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,390
back right so uh we hit each other back
okay now that means that we would just

148
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
okay now that means that we would just
 

149
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,390
okay now that means that we would just
be pounding each other to oblivion

150
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
be pounding each other to oblivion
 

151
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,670
be pounding each other to oblivion
and it would be terrible and so that

152
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
and it would be terrible and so that
 

153
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,030
and it would be terrible and so that
really wouldn't be a fight the reason

154
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
really wouldn't be a fight the reason
 

155
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,949
really wouldn't be a fight the reason
it's a fight is because one person can

156
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
it's a fight is because one person can
 

157
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,110
it's a fight is because one person can
resist the shots of another

158
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
resist the shots of another
 

159
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,710
resist the shots of another
so for example if maya were to hit me

160
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
so for example if maya were to hit me
 

161
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,190
so for example if maya were to hit me
and i were to return shot here maya can

162
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
and i were to return shot here maya can
 

163
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,229
and i were to return shot here maya can
cover and her

164
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
cover and her
 

165
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,949
cover and her
arm has the ability to resist my blow so

166
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
arm has the ability to resist my blow so
 

167
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,830
arm has the ability to resist my blow so
i can't hit her as hard as she hits me

168
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
i can't hit her as hard as she hits me
 

169
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,910
i can't hit her as hard as she hits me
and the the kind of superficial damage

170
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
and the the kind of superficial damage
 

171
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,030
and the the kind of superficial damage
she would take on her arms

172
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
she would take on her arms
 

173
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,550
she would take on her arms
doesn't compare to the damage that i

174
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
doesn't compare to the damage that i
 

175
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,390
doesn't compare to the damage that i
would take on my body or on my face

176
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
would take on my body or on my face
 

177
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,110
would take on my body or on my face
so it's a fight because one person can

178
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
so it's a fight because one person can
 

179
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,550
so it's a fight because one person can
use

180
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
use
 

181
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,350
use
the ability to resist damage and deal

182
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
the ability to resist damage and deal
 

183
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,110
the ability to resist damage and deal
greater damage so we're fighting it out

184
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
greater damage so we're fighting it out
 

185
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,390
greater damage so we're fighting it out
we're resisting each other's what's

186
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
we're resisting each other's what's
 

187
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,270
we're resisting each other's what's
happening

188
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
happening
 

189
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,430
happening
but we can have a resistance and an

190
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
but we can have a resistance and an
 

191
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,790
but we can have a resistance and an
attack and it can kind of go back and

192
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
attack and it can kind of go back and
 

193
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,390
attack and it can kind of go back and
forth and so we can really have a

194
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
forth and so we can really have a
 

195
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,070
forth and so we can really have a
struggle with that okay

196
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
struggle with that okay
 

197
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,509
struggle with that okay
if i had swords with josh movie magic

198
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
if i had swords with josh movie magic
 

199
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,149
if i had swords with josh movie magic
all right

200
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
all right
 

201
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,830
all right
so if we were talking about a sword

202
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
so if we were talking about a sword
 

203
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,509
so if we were talking about a sword
fight how does a sword fight different

204
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
fight how does a sword fight different
 

205
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,550
fight how does a sword fight different
than that right so

206
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
than that right so
 

207
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,550
than that right so
if josh had a sword and i had a sword

208
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
if josh had a sword and i had a sword
 

209
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,710
if josh had a sword and i had a sword
these weapons are long so we got really

210
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
these weapons are long so we got really
 

211
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,710
these weapons are long so we got really
really long weapons here all right so

212
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
really long weapons here all right so
 

213
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,390
really long weapons here all right so
now the same rule applies because it's

214
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
now the same rule applies because it's
 

215
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,790
now the same rule applies because it's
just a rule of range that if we've got

216
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
just a rule of range that if we've got
 

217
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,670
just a rule of range that if we've got
if we're equipped

218
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
if we're equipped
 

219
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,949
if we're equipped
roughly the same every time i hit josh

220
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
roughly the same every time i hit josh
 

221
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,110
roughly the same every time i hit josh
josh can hit me so this is bad this way

222
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
josh can hit me so this is bad this way
 

223
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,309
josh can hit me so this is bad this way
if we fought like that

224
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
if we fought like that
 

225
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,509
if we fought like that
that would just be us murdering each

226
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
that would just be us murdering each
 

227
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,630
that would just be us murdering each
other wouldn't really be a fight there's

228
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
other wouldn't really be a fight there's
 

229
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,229
other wouldn't really be a fight there's
no way to resist that just

230
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
no way to resist that just
 

231
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,229
no way to resist that just
us murdering each other with swords but

232
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
us murdering each other with swords but
 

233
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,149
us murdering each other with swords but
because of the way the sword works

234
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
because of the way the sword works
 

235
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,070
because of the way the sword works
if josh were to take a high line attack

236
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
if josh were to take a high line attack
 

237
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,789
if josh were to take a high line attack
on me and i returned this shot towards

238
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
on me and i returned this shot towards
 

239
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,550
on me and i returned this shot towards
josh's head you can see he naturally has

240
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
josh's head you can see he naturally has
 

241
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,190
josh's head you can see he naturally has
a defense

242
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
a defense
 

243
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,949
a defense
that's because the length of this sword

244
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
that's because the length of this sword
 

245
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,630
that's because the length of this sword
will take care of that now because of

246
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
will take care of that now because of
 

247
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,990
will take care of that now because of
the angles of his body

248
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
the angles of his body
 

249
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,190
the angles of his body
that he can take when he takes a high

250
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
that he can take when he takes a high
 

251
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,350
that he can take when he takes a high
line attack if i swipe at his low body

252
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
line attack if i swipe at his low body
 

253
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,670
line attack if i swipe at his low body
you can see i can miss his low body

254
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
you can see i can miss his low body
 

255
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,750
you can see i can miss his low body
right so i can't attack his low body

256
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
right so i can't attack his low body
 

257
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,190
right so i can't attack his low body
because i'm not long enough anymore

258
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
because i'm not long enough anymore
 

259
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,470
because i'm not long enough anymore
right that's because he has a better

260
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
right that's because he has a better
 

261
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,589
right that's because he has a better
geometric angle than i have however

262
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
geometric angle than i have however
 

263
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,270
geometric angle than i have however
head because the sword can defend his

264
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
head because the sword can defend his
 

265
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,270
head because the sword can defend his
head so that means in a sword fight

266
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
head so that means in a sword fight
 

267
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,670
head so that means in a sword fight
josh can really strategically place his

268
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
josh can really strategically place his
 

269
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,470
josh can really strategically place his
shots

270
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
shots
 

271
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,670
shots
so that way i can't return as powerful a

272
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
so that way i can't return as powerful a
 

273
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,350
so that way i can't return as powerful a
blow as he returns towards me

274
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
blow as he returns towards me
 

275
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,550
blow as he returns towards me
and so instead of us just being

276
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
and so instead of us just being
 

277
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,229
and so instead of us just being
murdering each other with swords we can

278
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
murdering each other with swords we can
 

279
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,670
murdering each other with swords we can
actually have a fight one person can

280
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
actually have a fight one person can
 

281
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,349
actually have a fight one person can
resist the blows of another person and

282
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
resist the blows of another person and
 

283
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,030
resist the blows of another person and
we can have a struggle that goes on for

284
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
we can have a struggle that goes on for
 

285
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,830
we can have a struggle that goes on for
a while right so

286
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
a while right so
 

287
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,830
a while right so
that ability to resist is what makes the

288
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
that ability to resist is what makes the
 

289
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,310
that ability to resist is what makes the
fighting happen now if we had knives

290
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
fighting happen now if we had knives
 

291
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,469
fighting happen now if we had knives
then now knives more movie magic so

292
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
then now knives more movie magic so
 

293
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,230
then now knives more movie magic so
knives will be different right so

294
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
knives will be different right so
 

295
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,990
knives will be different right so
because of the rules of range if we're

296
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
because of the rules of range if we're
 

297
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,670
because of the rules of range if we're
equipped roughly the same

298
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
equipped roughly the same
 

299
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,670
equipped roughly the same
every time i'm in range to attack josh

300
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
every time i'm in range to attack josh
 

301
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,510
every time i'm in range to attack josh
josh is in range to attack me okay

302
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
josh is in range to attack me okay
 

303
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,510
josh is in range to attack me okay
with knives because the weapon's so

304
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
with knives because the weapon's so
 

305
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,830
with knives because the weapon's so
short i can't create natural opposition

306
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
short i can't create natural opposition
 

307
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,310
short i can't create natural opposition
right so

308
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
right so
 

309
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,150
right so
look i might be able to take a superior

310
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
look i might be able to take a superior
 

311
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,670
look i might be able to take a superior
angle right so i've cut josh and josh

312
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
angle right so i've cut josh and josh
 

313
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,350
angle right so i've cut josh and josh
can't get my low line right can't get my

314
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
can't get my low line right can't get my
 

315
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,350
can't get my low line right can't get my
low line but he can get my high line

316
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
low line but he can get my high line
 

317
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,430
low line but he can get my high line
because nothing's stopping his arm right

318
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
because nothing's stopping his arm right
 

319
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,550
because nothing's stopping his arm right
so there's no

320
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
so there's no
 

321
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,710
so there's no
lengthy weapon in there to stop him from

322
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
lengthy weapon in there to stop him from
 

323
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,390
lengthy weapon in there to stop him from
making a high line so i can take

324
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
making a high line so i can take
 

325
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,870
making a high line so i can take
nice good angles but the angles really

326
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
nice good angles but the angles really
 

327
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,710
nice good angles but the angles really
don't save me from him being able to

328
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
don't save me from him being able to
 

329
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,670
don't save me from him being able to
counter attack

330
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
counter attack
 

331
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,230
counter attack
now people who are really into knife

332
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
now people who are really into knife
 

333
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,909
now people who are really into knife
work will will argue that there are

334
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
work will will argue that there are
 

335
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,670
work will will argue that there are
really good angles you can take those

336
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
really good angles you can take those
 

337
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,590
really good angles you can take those
angles are super fine angles

338
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
angles are super fine angles
 

339
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,749
angles are super fine angles
and so while it might be possible for

340
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
and so while it might be possible for
 

341
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,150
and so while it might be possible for
some elite expert to get to that

342
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
some elite expert to get to that
 

343
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,070
some elite expert to get to that
level you're probably never going to

344
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
level you're probably never going to
 

345
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,510
level you're probably never going to
right if you have a regular nine to five

346
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
right if you have a regular nine to five
 

347
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,189
right if you have a regular nine to five
job and you're doing normal life stuff

348
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
job and you're doing normal life stuff
 

349
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,790
job and you're doing normal life stuff
and you train martial arts on the side a

350
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
and you train martial arts on the side a
 

351
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,830
and you train martial arts on the side a
little you're probably never going to

352
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
little you're probably never going to
 

353
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,189
little you're probably never going to
reach this elite level

354
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
reach this elite level
 

355
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,790
reach this elite level
i would argue that that elite level

356
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
i would argue that that elite level
 

357
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,629
i would argue that that elite level
really doesn't exist but that's a little

358
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
really doesn't exist but that's a little
 

359
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,909
really doesn't exist but that's a little
argument we could have

360
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
argument we could have
 

361
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,710
argument we could have
the truth though is in a general sense

362
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
the truth though is in a general sense
 

363
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,230
the truth though is in a general sense
you're not going to be able to stop

364
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
you're not going to be able to stop
 

365
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,150
you're not going to be able to stop
that weapon because they're they're both

366
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
that weapon because they're they're both
 

367
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,749
that weapon because they're they're both
short weapons right so we can't really

368
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
short weapons right so we can't really
 

369
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,189
short weapons right so we can't really
have a fight what basically just happens

370
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
have a fight what basically just happens
 

371
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,310
have a fight what basically just happens

little cut
 

383
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,790
little cut
that can happen but that's a roll of the

384
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
that can happen but that's a roll of the
 

385
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,909
that can happen but that's a roll of the
dice and we don't want to look at those

386
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
dice and we don't want to look at those
 

387

rolls of the dice
 

389
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,629
rolls of the dice
at least as much as we can get away from

390
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
at least as much as we can get away from
 

391
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,230
at least as much as we can get away from
looking at him okay so now

392
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
looking at him okay so now
 

393
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,310
looking at him okay so now
let's put together a live situation

394
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
let's put together a live situation
 

395
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,790
let's put together a live situation
where josh and maya have a knife fight

396
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
where josh and maya have a knife fight
 

397
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,070
where josh and maya have a knife fight
and we're going to do it with markers so

398
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
and we're going to do it with markers so
 

399
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,830
and we're going to do it with markers so
that way you can see what kind of damage

400
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
that way you can see what kind of damage
 

401
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,270
that way you can see what kind of damage
they end up doing to each other

402

they end up doing to each other
 

403
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,790
they end up doing to each other
but we're going to see how it turns out

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,710
depending on how intense that was
probably wasn't a lethal shot

660
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
probably wasn't a lethal shot
 

661
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,110
probably wasn't a lethal shot
seems scary but a rib cage is right here

that's where the cut is
probably going to survive that right we

666
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
probably going to survive that right we
 

667
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,509
probably going to survive that right we
got a cut here

not bad okay now this is deadly and you
 

673
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,350
not bad okay now this is deadly and you
can see

674
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
can see
 

675
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,030
can see
that's a pretty heavy marker now an

676
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
that's a pretty heavy marker now an
 

677
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,150
that's a pretty heavy marker now an
important thing to understand when

678
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
important thing to understand when
 

679
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,350
important thing to understand when
you're looking at marker stuff

680
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
you're looking at marker stuff
 

681
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,829
you're looking at marker stuff
is a marker a really light trace marks

682
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
is a marker a really light trace marks
 

683
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,230
is a marker a really light trace marks
you almost as much as a heavy trace a

684
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
you almost as much as a heavy trace a
 

685
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,990
you almost as much as a heavy trace a
nice different right a light trace

now there's a really light one right
 

699
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:03,829
now there's a really light one right
here that probably would have just

700
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
here that probably would have just
 

701
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,030
here that probably would have just
barely grazed her skin because it's

702

barely grazed her skin because it's
 

703
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,829
barely grazed her skin because it's
barely there

00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
barely there
 

705
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,350
barely there
you can see the intensity came there and

706
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
you can see the intensity came there and
 

707
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,110
you can see the intensity came there and
it lightened up this one's a pretty

708
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
it lightened up this one's a pretty
 

709
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,870
it lightened up this one's a pretty
decent shot hard to tell because it's

710
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
decent shot hard to tell because it's
 

711
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,269
decent shot hard to tell because it's
not

712
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
not
 

713
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,870
not
super heavy so it could have been a good

714
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
super heavy so it could have been a good
 

715
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,790
super heavy so it could have been a good
cut this would definitely be

716
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
cut this would definitely be
 

717
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,350

be damaging for maya okay back here we

718
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
be damaging for maya okay back here we
 

719
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,190
be damaging for maya okay back here we
have a cut back here this is probably

720
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
have a cut back here this is probably
 

721
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,550
have a cut back here this is probably
not going to stop my at all

722
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
not going to stop my at all
 

723
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,710
not going to stop my at all
the cut back here all boney probably not

724
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
the cut back here all boney probably not
 

725
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,910
the cut back here all boney probably not
going to stop mine now this is not going

726
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
going to stop mine now this is not going

going to stop mine now this is not going
to be fun don't get me wrong but

728
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
to be fun don't get me wrong but
 

729
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,790
to be fun don't get me wrong but
she's probably going to keep functioning

730
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
she's probably going to keep functioning
 

731
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,389
she's probably going to keep functioning
this is a little worrisome right because

732
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
this is a little worrisome right because
 

733
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,310
this is a little worrisome right because
we're near the tricep and deltoid so

734
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
we're near the tricep and deltoid so
 

735
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,389
we're near the tricep and deltoid so
if it got deep right here we can see a

736
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
if it got deep right here we can see a
 

737
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,509
if it got deep right here we can see a
nice deep spot

738
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
nice deep spot
 

739
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,110
nice deep spot
and then after this it kind of scutters

740
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
and then after this it kind of scutters
 

741
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,269
and then after this it kind of scutters
off so it might have been a serious shot

742
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
off so it might have been a serious shot
 

743
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,949
off so it might have been a serious shot
maybe not a serious shot

744
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
maybe not a serious shot
 

745
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,030
maybe not a serious shot
on our arms here we have a cut back here

on our arms here we have a cut back here
 

747
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,350
on our arms here we have a cut back here
again near the tricep a little bit scary

748
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
again near the tricep a little bit scary
 

749
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,430
again near the tricep a little bit scary
um we have a cut inside here anything on

this side oh up here on the hands we
have lots of little shots any of this

762
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
have lots of little shots any of this
 

763
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,949

cost her the functionality of her hand
 

769
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,550
cost her the functionality of her hand
okay on this side this is not a terrible

770
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
okay on this side this is not a terrible
 

771
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,269
okay on this side this is not a terrible
shot at all

775
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,470
this bicep shot's a little worrisome
right so this might keep her from using

776
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
right so this might keep her from using
 

777
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,750
right so this might keep her from using
her arm correctly

778
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
her arm correctly
 

779
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,990

780
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
this deltoid shot might not be too good
 

781
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,269
this deltoid shot might not be too good
and there's a deep spot there which

782

and there's a deep spot there which
 

783
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,710
and there's a deep spot there which
means that really came in

probably a nothing right so
 

789
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,150
probably a nothing right so
so that's that's you can see that's what

00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
okay so important thing to understand
 

809
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,350
okay so important thing to understand
here when maya's

really hard for people looking at modern
martial arts to understand what the goal

821
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,949
martial arts to understand what the goal
would be because

822
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
would be because
 

823
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,470
would be because
the the mindset is just well we got to

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,670
the the mindset is just well we got to
get in there and dominate someone

826

get in there and dominate someone
 

827
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,870
get in there and dominate someone
somehow so

828
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
somehow so

are you going to be doing that well if
 

833
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,110
are you going to be doing that well if
someone were to attack you in that

one of three things
 

843
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,190
one of three things
either one make a clean escape right so

844
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
either one make a clean escape right so
 

845
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,150

order to actually escape
 

853
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,030
order to actually escape
the attack so that's one thing you're

854
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
the attack so that's one thing you're
 

855
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,629
the attack so that's one thing you're
trying to do buy yourself time to get

856
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
trying to do buy yourself time to get
 

857
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,509

two someone else to intervene right so

860
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
two someone else to intervene right so
 

861
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,150
two someone else to intervene right so
someone sees it the cops have been

called someone arrives
that's probably not high percentage

866
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
that's probably not high percentage
 

867
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,509
that's probably not high percentage
there but that also could be why you're

868
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
there but that also could be why you're
 

869
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,949
there but that also could be why you're
buying yourself time you can't make your

870
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
buying yourself time you can't make your
 

871
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,629
buying yourself time you can't make your

escape you're just trying to survive as
 

873
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,590
escape you're just trying to survive as
long as possible

874
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600

you get to a superior weapon platform
 

881
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:29,910
you get to a superior weapon platform

right
 

883
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,829
right
so in a modern era what might that look

884
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:32,839
so in a modern era what might that look
 

885
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,490
so in a modern era what might that look
like

886
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:35,500
like

well that was interesting let's see how
she looks okay so here's what it looks

892
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:55,839
she looks okay so here's what it looks
 

893
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,389
she looks okay so here's what it looks
like after maya and the firearm so

894
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
like after maya and the firearm so
 

895
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,910
like after maya and the firearm so
here to here remember it's probably

896
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
here to here remember it's probably
 

897
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,269
here to here remember it's probably
pretty safe it'd have to be a pretty

898
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
pretty safe it'd have to be a pretty
 

899
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,990
pretty safe it'd have to be a pretty

serious shot to get in past this sternum
we got a carotid up here so this is bad

902
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
we got a carotid up here so this is bad
 

903
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,509
we got a carotid up here so this is bad
news right so if it either gets the

904
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
news right so if it either gets the
 

905
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,110
news right so if it either gets the
carotid artery or the esophagus it's

906
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
carotid artery or the esophagus it's
 

907
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,069
carotid artery or the esophagus it's
probably

908
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
probably
 

909
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,910
probably
fight ending for her right we don't have

910
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
fight ending for her right we don't have

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
we have a shot here shot here
 

915
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,350
we have a shot here shot here
insignificant this is probably

916
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
insignificant this is probably
 

917
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,509
insignificant this is probably
um an eviscerating shot right and you

918
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
um an eviscerating shot right and you
 

919
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,110
um an eviscerating shot right and you
can see from here it's heavy

920
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
can see from here it's heavy
 

921
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,870
can see from here it's heavy
right that's a heavy shot so this is

922
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
right that's a heavy shot so this is
 

923
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,949
right that's a heavy shot so this is
probably guts spilling out kind of stuff

924
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
probably guts spilling out kind of stuff
 

925
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,550
probably guts spilling out kind of stuff
this is deadly right so you got your

926
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
this is deadly right so you got your
 

927
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,470
this is deadly right so you got your
ilia artery down here this is all bad

928
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480
ilia artery down here this is all bad
 

929
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,990
ilia artery down here this is all bad
news down here so this is all really

930
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
news down here so this is all really
 

931
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,670
news down here so this is all really
dangerous for maya so those are horrible

932
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
dangerous for maya so those are horrible
 

933
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,670
dangerous for maya so those are horrible
horrible shots here your deltoid this

934
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
horrible shots here your deltoid this
 

935
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,509
horrible shots here your deltoid this
might maybe a fairly functional shot

936
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
might maybe a fairly functional shot
 

937
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,870
might maybe a fairly functional shot
here on the back of the hand right if

938
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880
here on the back of the hand right if
 

939
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,710
here on the back of the hand right if
this that knife got in too deep here

940
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:38,720
this that knife got in too deep here
 

941
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,389
this that knife got in too deep here
that would be a bad shot for maya we

942
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
that would be a bad shot for maya we
 

943
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,750
that would be a bad shot for maya we
don't have any defensive wounds right

944
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
don't have any defensive wounds right
 

945
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,230
don't have any defensive wounds right
here

946
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
here
 

947
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,110
here
this is a nothing shot this is probably

948
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
this is a nothing shot this is probably
 

949
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,710
this is a nothing shot this is probably
not that horrible although we are close

950
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
not that horrible although we are close
 

951
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,310
not that horrible although we are close
to the axillary artery so it's a little

952
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,320
to the axillary artery so it's a little
 

953
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,030
to the axillary artery so it's a little
bit dangerous

954
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
bit dangerous
 

955
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,269
bit dangerous
um but this is mostly all rib cage stuff

956
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
um but this is mostly all rib cage stuff
 

957
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,310
um but this is mostly all rib cage stuff
right okay

958
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
right okay
 

959
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,590
right okay
and then this is that shot we talked

960
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600
and then this is that shot we talked
 

961
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,590
and then this is that shot we talked
about earlier on this side defensive

962
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:55,600
about earlier on this side defensive
 

963
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,110
about earlier on this side defensive
wounds right so a little scary because

964
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
wounds right so a little scary because
 

965
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,990
wounds right so a little scary because
it's near the tricep

966
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
it's near the tricep
 

967
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,750
it's near the tricep
but it's not this is all bony this is

968
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
but it's not this is all bony this is
 

969
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,509
but it's not this is all bony this is
all bony these would all be fine shots

970
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
all bony these would all be fine shots
 

971
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,030
all bony these would all be fine shots
this is a little worrisome right so this

972
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
this is a little worrisome right so this
 

973
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,389
this is a little worrisome right so this
is going to be arterial we're going to

974
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,399
is going to be arterial we're going to
 

975
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,509
is going to be arterial we're going to
have some serious bleeding

976
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
have some serious bleeding
 

977
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,430
have some serious bleeding
and this bicep shot and that's grazing

978
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
and this bicep shot and that's grazing
 

979
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,430
and this bicep shot and that's grazing
so probably wasn't a very deep wound but

980
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
so probably wasn't a very deep wound but
 

981
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,110
so probably wasn't a very deep wound but
bicep's super worrying because she loses

982
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120
bicep's super worrying because she loses
 

983
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,389
bicep's super worrying because she loses
functionality of her arm

984
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
functionality of her arm
 

985
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,470
functionality of her arm
so that was with her trying to use a

986
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
so that was with her trying to use a
 

987
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,310
so that was with her trying to use a
pistol to defend herself against someone

988
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
pistol to defend herself against someone
 

989
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,949
pistol to defend herself against someone
coming in

990
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
coming in
 

991
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,470
coming in
with a knife and just slashing like

992
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
with a knife and just slashing like
 

993
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,030
with a knife and just slashing like
crazy okay so those are the three ideas

994
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
crazy okay so those are the three ideas
 

995
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,470
crazy okay so those are the three ideas
when you're using the ikea strategy

996
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
when you're using the ikea strategy
 

997
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,430
when you're using the ikea strategy
that's what you're trying to do and i

998
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,440
that's what you're trying to do and i
 

999
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,629
that's what you're trying to do and i
know you're not trying to dominate the

1000
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
know you're not trying to dominate the
 

1001
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,269
know you're not trying to dominate the
other guy

1002
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
other guy
 

1003
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,550
other guy
and this is why it's really hard to

1004
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
and this is why it's really hard to
 

1005
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,990
and this is why it's really hard to
understand aikido from a perspective

1006
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
understand aikido from a perspective
 

1007
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,430
understand aikido from a perspective
where you want to fight with someone

1008
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
where you want to fight with someone
 

1009
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,870
where you want to fight with someone
and aikido we don't want to fight we

1010
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
and aikido we don't want to fight we
 

1011
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,389
and aikido we don't want to fight we
it's already a foregone conclusion the

1012
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
it's already a foregone conclusion the
 

1013
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,389
it's already a foregone conclusion the
other person is stronger better armed

1014
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
other person is stronger better armed
 

1015
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,590
other person is stronger better armed
there's more of them whatever

1016
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
there's more of them whatever
 

1017
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,030
there's more of them whatever
they're in better shape than we are and

1018
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
they're in better shape than we are and
 

1019
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,389
they're in better shape than we are and
so we can't fight with them we just

1020
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
so we can't fight with them we just
 

1021
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,990
so we can't fight with them we just
can't afford to fight with them all

1022
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
can't afford to fight with them all
 

1023
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,629
can't afford to fight with them all
right now

1024
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
right now
 

1025
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,710
right now
what would happen if maya tried to use

1026
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:43,720
what would happen if maya tried to use
 

1027
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,069
what would happen if maya tried to use
jiu-jitsu on josh so

1030
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
maya's going to try and use jiu-jitsu
 

1031
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,430
maya's going to try and use jiu-jitsu
grappling right so maybe jiu-jitsu is a

1032
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
grappling right so maybe jiu-jitsu is a
 

1033
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,710
grappling right so maybe jiu-jitsu is a
bad thing to say but we practice

1034
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,720
bad thing to say but we practice
 

1035
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,069
bad thing to say but we practice
japanese jiu jitsu here so

1036
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
japanese jiu jitsu here so
 

1037

japanese jiu jitsu here so
so what would jiu-jitsu or some kind of

1038
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
so what would jiu-jitsu or some kind of
 

1039
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,829
so what would jiu-jitsu or some kind of
some kind of clinch work grappling look

1040
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
some kind of clinch work grappling look
 

1041
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,310
some kind of clinch work grappling look
like

1042
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
like
 

1043
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,150
like
when maya tries to use that against a

1044
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
when maya tries to use that against a
 

1045
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:12,850
when maya tries to use that against a
guy with a knife

1046
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:12,860

 

1047
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:29,590

[Music]

1048
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
[Music]
 

1049
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,389
[Music]
good job time okay so this is what it

1050
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
good job time okay so this is what it
 

1051
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,550
good job time okay so this is what it
looks like after maya tried to jiu jitsu

1052
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
looks like after maya tried to jiu jitsu
 

1053
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,069
looks like after maya tried to jiu jitsu
josh right so she tried to use

1054
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
josh right so she tried to use
 

1055
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,550
josh right so she tried to use
armed grappling or unarmed in her case

1056
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
armed grappling or unarmed in her case
 

1057
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,990
armed grappling or unarmed in her case
but to deal with the knife she tried to

1058
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
but to deal with the knife she tried to
 

1059
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,829
but to deal with the knife she tried to
grapple with josh while he's got a knife

1060
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
grapple with josh while he's got a knife
 

1061
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,509
grapple with josh while he's got a knife
and this is what she looks like after

1062
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
and this is what she looks like after
 

1063
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,310
and this is what she looks like after
that right

1064
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
that right
 

1065
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,629
that right
okay so these are probably superficial

1066
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
okay so these are probably superficial
 

1067
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,990
okay so these are probably superficial
all all

1068
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
all all
 

1069
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,990
all all
rib cage protected this one would

1070
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
rib cage protected this one would
 

1071
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,749
rib cage protected this one would
normally be superficial but if you look

1072
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
normally be superficial but if you look
 

1073
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,269
normally be superficial but if you look
it's maybe hard to see on camera but

1074
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
it's maybe hard to see on camera but
 

1075
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,110
it's maybe hard to see on camera but
it's really deep which means that was

1076
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,120
it's really deep which means that was
 

1077
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,949
it's really deep which means that was
probably a really severe stab that might

1078
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
probably a really severe stab that might
 

1079
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:57,749
probably a really severe stab that might
have got through

1080
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
have got through
 

1081
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,509
have got through
her chest right and so that would be

1082
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
her chest right and so that would be
 

1083
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,870
her chest right and so that would be
that could be a potentially very very

1084
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880
that could be a potentially very very
 

1085
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,509
that could be a potentially very very
dangerous

1086
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
dangerous
 

1087
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,509
dangerous
all the way to here pretty pretty safe

1088
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
all the way to here pretty pretty safe
 

1089
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,029
all the way to here pretty pretty safe
stuff right so this is not going to be

1090
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
stuff right so this is not going to be
 

1091
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,029
stuff right so this is not going to be
horrible not fun but this will all

1092
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039
horrible not fun but this will all
 

1093
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,710
horrible not fun but this will all
murder her right so this is this is

1094
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
murder her right so this is this is
 

1095
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,230
murder her right so this is this is
probably all death right so

1096
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,240
probably all death right so
 

1097
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,669
probably all death right so
maybe not death in the moment she might

1098
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:11,679
maybe not death in the moment she might
 

1099
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,350
maybe not death in the moment she might
have kept on fighting and she might have

1100
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
have kept on fighting and she might have
 

1101
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,789
have kept on fighting and she might have
got to the hospital on time

1102
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
got to the hospital on time
 

1103
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,949
got to the hospital on time
but this is all serious traumatic injury

1104
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
but this is all serious traumatic injury
 

1105
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,189
but this is all serious traumatic injury
right and if not she's probably gonna

1106
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
right and if not she's probably gonna
 

1107
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,949
right and if not she's probably gonna
have some infections all kinds of things

1108
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
have some infections all kinds of things
 

1109
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,870
have some infections all kinds of things
going on very life-threatening dangerous

1110
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:22,880
going on very life-threatening dangerous
 

1111
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,470
going on very life-threatening dangerous
so this whole area right here

1112
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
so this whole area right here
 

1113
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,230
so this whole area right here
is deadly and you can see she's really

1114
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
is deadly and you can see she's really
 

1115
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,390
is deadly and you can see she's really
marked up tons of deep stabs and you can

1116
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
marked up tons of deep stabs and you can
 

1117
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,390
marked up tons of deep stabs and you can
see maybe can't see on the camera but

1118
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:30,400
see maybe can't see on the camera but
 

1119
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,390
see maybe can't see on the camera but
this is a deep marker right so which

1120
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
this is a deep marker right so which
 

1121
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,990
this is a deep marker right so which
means he really pushed that in

1122
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
means he really pushed that in
 

1123
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,430
means he really pushed that in
and the marker really got in these are

1124
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
and the marker really got in these are
 

1125
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,190
and the marker really got in these are
not superficial right so these are all

1126
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
not superficial right so these are all
 

1127
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,310
not superficial right so these are all
serious all the way down here

1128
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,320
serious all the way down here
 

1129
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,230
serious all the way down here
this is the top the the quads that would

1130
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
this is the top the the quads that would
 

1131
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,830
this is the top the the quads that would
be bad news right

1132
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:41,840
be bad news right
 

1133
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,990
be bad news right
her back look at this all cut up through

1134
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,000
her back look at this all cut up through
 

1135
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,029
her back look at this all cut up through
here now these aren't

1136
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
here now these aren't
 

1137
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,870
here now these aren't
this wouldn't be terrible at all but

1138
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
this wouldn't be terrible at all but
 

1139
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,950
this wouldn't be terrible at all but
this is where her kidney and liver exist

1140
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
this is where her kidney and liver exist
 

1141
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,390
this is where her kidney and liver exist
right so so that that these could

1142
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
right so so that that these could
 

1143
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,470
right so so that that these could
potentially be bad shots this is all not

1144
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
potentially be bad shots this is all not
 

1145
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,470
potentially be bad shots this is all not
not bad shots at all right okay now look

but so you know she didn't get to defend

1156
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
but so you know she didn't get to defend

took it all right here right and the
 

1161
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,150
took it all right here right and the
reason for that is because uh that

1162
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
reason for that is because uh that
 

1163
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,750
reason for that is because uh that
clinch that josh was able to use

1164
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
clinch that josh was able to use
 

1165
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,270
clinch that josh was able to use
was a lot of times able to neutralize

1166
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
was a lot of times able to neutralize
 

1167
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,470
was a lot of times able to neutralize
maya from getting her arms where she

1168
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
maya from getting her arms where she
 

1169
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:12,950
maya from getting her arms where she
wanted

1170
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
wanted
 

1171
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,470
wanted
and maya was more worried about trying

1172
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
and maya was more worried about trying
 

1173
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,070
and maya was more worried about trying
to hold josh's body

1174
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
to hold josh's body
 

1175
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,470
to hold josh's body
than stop josh's arms right so when you

1176
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
than stop josh's arms right so when you
 

1177
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,470
than stop josh's arms right so when you
switch into that jiu jitsu mentality

1178
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:20,480
switch into that jiu jitsu mentality
 

1179
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,990
switch into that jiu jitsu mentality
it's a different kind of animal that's

1180
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
it's a different kind of animal that's
 

1181
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,110
it's a different kind of animal that's
going on right so

1182
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
going on right so
 

1183
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,350
going on right so
so i you can look at this for yourself i

1184
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,360
so i you can look at this for yourself i
 

1185
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,710
so i you can look at this for yourself i
personally probably wouldn't recommend

1186
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
personally probably wouldn't recommend
 

1187
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,630
personally probably wouldn't recommend
trying to grapple with someone who has a

1188
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
trying to grapple with someone who has a
 

1189
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,270
trying to grapple with someone who has a
knife

1190
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,280
knife
 

1191
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,029
knife
and this is what maya looks like after

1192
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
and this is what maya looks like after
 

1193
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,110
and this is what maya looks like after
that okay so now

1194
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
that okay so now
 

1195
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,350
that okay so now
we're going to see what happens if maya

1196
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
we're going to see what happens if maya
 

1197
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,029
we're going to see what happens if maya
were to happen to have

1198
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
were to happen to have
 

1199
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,270
were to happen to have
a long weapon what is she what if she

1200
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280
a long weapon what is she what if she
 

1201
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,870
a long weapon what is she what if she
had a long weapon available to her right

1202
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
had a long weapon available to her right
 

1203
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,789
had a long weapon available to her right
and so this weapon's about four times

1204
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
and so this weapon's about four times
 

1205
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,310
and so this weapon's about four times
the length of josh's knife

1206
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
the length of josh's knife
 

1207
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,909
the length of josh's knife
so what kind of advantages would she

1208
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
so what kind of advantages would she
 

1209
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,270
so what kind of advantages would she
gain if she had a long weapon like a

1210
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
gain if she had a long weapon like a
 

1211
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,909
gain if she had a long weapon like a
baton

1212
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
baton
 

1213
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,350
baton
or was able to pick up a stick or

something like that how does that look

1216
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,330

time well that was interesting let's see

1220
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:23,840
time well that was interesting let's see
 

1221
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,110
time well that was interesting let's see
how she looks

1222
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
how she looks
 

1223
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,029

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,160
that's interesting to think about
 

1247
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,669

pretty bony probably would have been
 

1253
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,150
pretty bony probably would have been
okay but i mean it wouldn't have been a

1254
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
okay but i mean it wouldn't have been a

1325
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,390
here so we can get serious for a second
so you need to take in the stuff you

1326
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:54,400
so you need to take in the stuff you
 

1327
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,390
so you need to take in the stuff you
just saw and understand that was a very

1328
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400
just saw and understand that was a very
 

1329
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,590
just saw and understand that was a very
unscientific demonstration and all this

1330
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
unscientific demonstration and all this
 

1331
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,789
unscientific demonstration and all this
stuff you guys should be doing it for

1332
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799
stuff you guys should be doing it for
 

1333
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,149
stuff you guys should be doing it for
yourself so

1334
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:02,159
yourself so
 

1335
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,070
yourself so
we're not the last word on this for sure

1336
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
we're not the last word on this for sure
 

1337
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,110
we're not the last word on this for sure
you should be doing these kinds of

1338
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,120
you should be doing these kinds of
 

1339
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,070
you should be doing these kinds of
drills and

1340
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
drills and
 

1341
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,390
drills and
understand what these drills are showing

1342
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
understand what these drills are showing
 

1343
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,909
understand what these drills are showing
you and teaching you personally

1344
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
you and teaching you personally
 

1345
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,230
you and teaching you personally
um but this is a we're showing you some

1346
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
um but this is a we're showing you some
 

1347
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,750
um but this is a we're showing you some
drills that you can try and kind of

1348
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
drills that you can try and kind of
 

1349
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,270
drills that you can try and kind of
maybe some ways to work through things

1350
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,280
maybe some ways to work through things
 

1351
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,430
maybe some ways to work through things
all right so now you're seeing that when

1352
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:17,440
all right so now you're seeing that when
 

1353
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,430
all right so now you're seeing that when
someone has a superior

1354
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440
someone has a superior
 

1355
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,350
someone has a superior
force right like a weapon or like a

1356
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
force right like a weapon or like a
 

1357
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,870
force right like a weapon or like a
knife and a knife is a superior force

1358
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
knife and a knife is a superior force
 

1359
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,590
knife and a knife is a superior force
because

1360
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600
because
 

1361
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,510
because
uh our body really can't resist the

1362
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
uh our body really can't resist the
 

1363
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,789
uh our body really can't resist the
knife you know if you put yourself

1364
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
knife you know if you put yourself
 

1365
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,549
knife you know if you put yourself
up to block the knife's gonna go through

1366
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
up to block the knife's gonna go through
 

1367
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,149
up to block the knife's gonna go through
you and it's going to cause you damage

1368
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
you and it's going to cause you damage
 

1369
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,149
you and it's going to cause you damage
so we can't really resist that

1370
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:32,159
so we can't really resist that
 

1371
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,110
so we can't really resist that
when you're trying to resist a superior

1372
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
when you're trying to resist a superior
 

1373
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,590
when you're trying to resist a superior
force

1374
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
force
 

1375
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,110
force
you're going to lose okay so when maya

1376
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,120
you're going to lose okay so when maya
 

1377
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,350
you're going to lose okay so when maya
and josh squared up and she tried to use

1378
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,360
and josh squared up and she tried to use
 

1379
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,510
and josh squared up and she tried to use
her knife to fight his knife and

1380
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:43,520
her knife to fight his knife and
 

1381
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,190
her knife to fight his knife and
there's going to be a duel you see that

1382
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,200
there's going to be a duel you see that
 

1383
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,789
there's going to be a duel you see that
just sounded out bad for both of them it

1384
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
just sounded out bad for both of them it
 

1385
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,470
just sounded out bad for both of them it
was a mutual murdering right

1386
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,480
was a mutual murdering right
 

1387
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,470
was a mutual murdering right
when maya decided to try and use

1388
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
when maya decided to try and use
 

1389
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,830
when maya decided to try and use
grappling arts so she's going to use

1390
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840
grappling arts so she's going to use
 

1391
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,669
grappling arts so she's going to use
some kind of grappling to get josh

1392
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:53,679
some kind of grappling to get josh
 

1393
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,350
some kind of grappling to get josh
that also turned out really really bad

1394
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:55,360
that also turned out really really bad
 

1395
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,029
that also turned out really really bad
for her right so now it's a roll of the

1396
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039
for her right so now it's a roll of the
 

1397
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,630
for her right so now it's a roll of the
dice maybe she'd get lucky and get a

1398
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:58,640
dice maybe she'd get lucky and get a
 

1399
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,750
dice maybe she'd get lucky and get a
disarm or something

1400
00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
disarm or something
 

1401
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,190
disarm or something
but in there she didn't and maya

1402
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
but in there she didn't and maya
 

1403
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,789
but in there she didn't and maya
practices disarms quite a bit

1404
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:02,799
practices disarms quite a bit
 

1405
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,430
practices disarms quite a bit
um so it's probably most likely what's

1406
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,440
um so it's probably most likely what's
 

1407
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,789
um so it's probably most likely what's
gonna happen if you try and dominate

1408
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:06,799
gonna happen if you try and dominate
 

1409
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,710
gonna happen if you try and dominate
with grappling you're probably gonna get

1410
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:08,720
with grappling you're probably gonna get
 

1411
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,990
with grappling you're probably gonna get
stabbed a bunch as well

1412
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,000
stabbed a bunch as well
 

1413
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,870
stabbed a bunch as well
and that could be life-changing right um

1414
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:12,880
and that could be life-changing right um
 

1415
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,470
and that could be life-changing right um
i think personally and you should look

1416
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,480
i think personally and you should look
 

1417
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,310
i think personally and you should look
at the shirts

1418
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
at the shirts
 

1419
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,070
at the shirts
and you should look at the video and you

1420
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,080
and you should look at the video and you
 

1421
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,669
and you should look at the video and you
should decide for yourself what you

1422
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:19,679
should decide for yourself what you
 

1423
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,190
should decide for yourself what you
think looks best and then more than that

1424
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,200
think looks best and then more than that
 

1425
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,230
think looks best and then more than that
more importantly than that you should be

1426
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,240
more importantly than that you should be
 

1427
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,830
more importantly than that you should be
trying these drills on your own but

1428
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:23,840
trying these drills on your own but
 

1429
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,149
trying these drills on your own but
to me the aikido strategy turned out

1430
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:26,159
to me the aikido strategy turned out
 

1431
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,070
to me the aikido strategy turned out
really the best and the reason for that

1432
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080
really the best and the reason for that
 

1433
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,789
really the best and the reason for that
is because

1434
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
is because
 

1435
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,870
is because
you're not trying to engage with a force

1436
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:30,880
you're not trying to engage with a force
 

1437
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,710
you're not trying to engage with a force
that's superior to you

1438
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
that's superior to you
 

1439
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,590
that's superior to you
and that's an important thing to

1440
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:33,600
and that's an important thing to
 

1441
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,710
and that's an important thing to
understand because we live in a world

1442
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,720
understand because we live in a world
 

1443
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,070
understand because we live in a world
where it's all about dominating the

1444
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
where it's all about dominating the
 

1445
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,190
where it's all about dominating the
other person

1446
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
other person
 

1447
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,950
other person
in aikido we don't want a dominating way

1448
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
in aikido we don't want a dominating way
 

1449
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,230
in aikido we don't want a dominating way
we just don't want to be

1450
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,240
we just don't want to be
 

1451
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,070
we just don't want to be
injured and hurt ourselves and you see

1452
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,080
injured and hurt ourselves and you see
 

1453
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,830
injured and hurt ourselves and you see
when maya used aikido

1454
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
when maya used aikido
 

1455
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,230
when maya used aikido
unarmed the shirt had a look when she

1456
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,240
unarmed the shirt had a look when she
 

1457
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,270
unarmed the shirt had a look when she
used aikido

1458
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280
used aikido
 

1459
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,190
used aikido
armed with a pistol and when she used

1460
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,200
armed with a pistol and when she used
 

1461
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,830
armed with a pistol and when she used
aikido armed with a longer weapon

1462
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
aikido armed with a longer weapon
 

1463
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,510
aikido armed with a longer weapon
you can see how those all turned out

1464
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,520
you can see how those all turned out
 

1465
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,029
you can see how those all turned out
right and she she did

1466
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
right and she she did
 

1467
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,270
right and she she did
better in my opinion she had fewer

1468
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
better in my opinion she had fewer
 

1469
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,950
better in my opinion she had fewer
severe injuries when she was doing that

1470
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:58,960

enough rounds on josh to stop him
before she got closer to him likely and
