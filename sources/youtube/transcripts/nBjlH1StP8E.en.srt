00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,230
so you're
still doing inward spirals

10
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
still doing inward spirals
 

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,550
still doing inward spirals
this is one

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
this is one
 

13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,310
this is one
this get on

00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,760
it starts
 

21
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,510
it starts
and then goes that way

22
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520

 

23
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,950

it's not going like this

24
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960

 

25
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,069

this way

26
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079

 

27
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,510

here

28
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520

31
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,590

this will make no sense with the knife

32
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
this will make no sense with the knife
 

33
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,389

no displacement

188
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400

 

189
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,990

okay again you're not trying to bend

190
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
okay again you're not trying to bend
 

191
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,070
okay again you're not trying to bend
someone backwards you're not trying to

192
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
someone backwards you're not trying to
 

193
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,230
someone backwards you're not trying to
bend him back that's not going to work

194
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
bend him back that's not going to work
 

195
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,390
bend him back that's not going to work
no one does that

196
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400

 

197
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,150

you have to get used to only

198
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
you have to get used to only
 

199
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,950
you have to get used to only
accomplishing minor minor tilts minor

200
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
accomplishing minor minor tilts minor
 

201
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,749
accomplishing minor minor tilts minor
tilts that's all i need

202
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
tilts that's all i need
 

203
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,430
tilts that's all i need
the rest of it happens with the body

204
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
the rest of it happens with the body
 

205
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,510
the rest of it happens with the body
lock and the kazushi powder

206
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
lock and the kazushi powder
 

207
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,469
lock and the kazushi powder
okay

208
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
okay
 

209
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,629
okay
so that's why there's no reason to go

210
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
so that's why there's no reason to go
 

211
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,309
so that's why there's no reason to go
like this

212
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319

 

213
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,070

you're not trying to get him to spin

214
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
you're not trying to get him to spin
 

215
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,710
you're not trying to get him to spin
around and you're going no no that

216
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
around and you're going no no that
 

217
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,430
around and you're going no no that
doesn't happen

218
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
doesn't happen
 

219
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,309
doesn't happen
minor body lock that was all i need

220
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
minor body lock that was all i need
 

221
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,390
minor body lock that was all i need
now his face is open

222
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
now his face is open
 

223
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,909
now his face is open
and now i lock his body with my body

224
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919

 

225
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,230

and i displaced his base

226
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
and i displaced his base
 

227
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,430
and i displaced his base
so

228
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
so
 

229
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,590
so
that was all i needed right here

230
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
that was all i needed right here
 

231
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,029
that was all i needed right here
don't go no he's not bent over enough

232
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
don't go no he's not bent over enough
 

233
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,830
don't go no he's not bent over enough
all you need is that now his face is

234
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
all you need is that now his face is
 

235
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,469
all you need is that now his face is
open now this angle back here is open

236
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479

 

237
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,270

in through his base

238
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280

 

239
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,150

boom in body lock body law

240
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160

 

241
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,430

this is the homo lateral body lock okay

242
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
this is the homo lateral body lock okay
 

243
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,110
this is the homo lateral body lock okay
with the outer spiral

244
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120

 

245
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,589

is the homolauro body lock

246
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
is the homolauro body lock
 

247
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,909
is the homolauro body lock
with the inverse spiral

248
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919

 

249
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,029

again

250
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
again
 

251
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,430
again
not this big banding

252
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
not this big banding
 

253
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,390
not this big banding
and then you come in

254
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400

 

255
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,870

that was it he's in it i'm gonna hit the

256
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
that was it he's in it i'm gonna hit the
 

257
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:44,469
that was it he's in it i'm gonna hit the
body lock

258
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479

 

259
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,749

that was it

260
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
that was it
 

261
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:56,950
that was it
i'll lock the body

262
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960

 

263
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,070

and this of course if he's going fast

264
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
and this of course if he's going fast
 

265
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,270
and this of course if he's going fast
enough

266
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,280
enough
 

267
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,710
enough
forces can

268
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
forces can
 

269
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,990
forces can
create a body lock due to the inertia

270
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
create a body lock due to the inertia
 

271
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,589
create a body lock due to the inertia
he's going to he's so much of him is

272
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
he's going to he's so much of him is
 

273
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,790
he's going to he's so much of him is
going that way the inertia

274
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
going that way the inertia
 

275
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,510
going that way the inertia
will lock his body it can't happen but

276
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
will lock his body it can't happen but
 

277
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,710
will lock his body it can't happen but
in training

278
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
in training
 

279
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,510
in training
now

280
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
now
 

281
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,390
now
in training it's uchikomi you're going

282
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
in training it's uchikomi you're going
 

283
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,469
in training it's uchikomi you're going
to hit his hip with your hips boom

284
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479

 

285
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,909

body

286

not here

288
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
not here
 

289
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,149
not here
not there

290
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159

 

291
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:57,110

that's his body now

292
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120

 

293
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,710

okay

294
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
okay
 

295
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,350
okay
so the body so this was the knife

296
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
so the body so this was the knife
 

297
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:15,190
so the body so this was the knife
movement right the knife's in my hand

298
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200

 

299
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,430

so if my body attacks

300
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440

 

301
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,870

here

302
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
here
 

303
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,990
here
this hand does not go back

304
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
this hand does not go back
 

305
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,910
this hand does not go back
his hand goes down

306
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920

 

307
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,829

down

308
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839

 

309
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,030

don't try to push him don't try to make

310
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
don't try to push him don't try to make
 

311
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,389
don't try to push him don't try to make
him go into the painting that you are

312
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
him go into the painting that you are
 

313
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,350
him go into the painting that you are
imagining so don't take the end of the

314
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
imagining so don't take the end of the
 

315
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,110
imagining so don't take the end of the
technique don't this is painting the

316
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
technique don't this is painting the
 

317
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,550
technique don't this is painting the
antenna i'm going backwards

318
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
antenna i'm going backwards
 

319
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,550
antenna i'm going backwards
you're not throwing backwards

320
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
you're not throwing backwards
 

321
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,630
you're not throwing backwards
you're spinning his body

322
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
you're spinning his body
 

323
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,030
you're spinning his body
you're spinning his body

324
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
you're spinning his body
 

325
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,670
you're spinning his body
moving

326
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680

 

327
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,949

so we're going to do just that half okay

328
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
so we're going to do just that half okay
 

329
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,430
so we're going to do just that half okay
and again we want some conditioning so

330
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
and again we want some conditioning so
 

331
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,509
and again we want some conditioning so
i'm going to tank on

332
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
i'm going to tank on
 

333
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:13,030
i'm going to tank on
and that hand is going to go here oh

334
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040

 

335
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,790

you do this rod

336
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
you do this rod
 

337
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,630
you do this rod
you're going to go to your outward

338
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
you're going to go to your outward
 

339
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,210
you're going to go to your outward
outside

340
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:23,220

 

341
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:58,870

[Music]

342
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880

 

343
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:16,550

jacked up

344
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560

 

345
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,470

so we're not going up we're just

346
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
so we're not going up we're just
 

347
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,910
so we're not going up we're just
focusing on the bottom part okay

348
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
focusing on the bottom part okay
 

349
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,389
focusing on the bottom part okay
okay so now you have to resist your

350
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
okay so now you have to resist your
 

351
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,509
okay so now you have to resist your
temptation

352
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519

 

353
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,750

don't make it go by don't make it go

354
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
don't make it go by don't make it go
 

355
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,750
don't make it go by don't make it go
back you you make it go back then you

356
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
back you you make it go back then you
 

357
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,670
back you you make it go back then you
start doing the the inward spiral you

358
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
start doing the the inward spiral you
 

359
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,350
start doing the the inward spiral you
start doing the inward spot you're

360
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
