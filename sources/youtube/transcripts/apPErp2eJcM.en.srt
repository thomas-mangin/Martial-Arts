00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,549

[Music]

2
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559

 

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,030

Okay. So, let's first talk about again.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,040
Okay. So, let's first talk about again.
 

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,990
Okay. So, let's first talk about again.
So, here's here's the thing.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
So, here's here's the thing.
 

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,710
So, here's here's the thing.
Um,

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
Um,
 

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,390
Um,
like we know that I'm ground vectoring,

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,400
like we know that I'm ground vectoring,
 

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,990
like we know that I'm ground vectoring,
right? Does that make sense? And um are

12
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
right? Does that make sense? And um are
 

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,470
right? Does that make sense? And um are
you all right? Okay. All right.

14
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480

 

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,510

We know the discourse is like let the

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
We know the discourse is like let the
 

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,990
We know the discourse is like let the
energy in and then you're trying to

18
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
energy in and then you're trying to
 

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,590
energy in and then you're trying to
vector it down. Okay. And yesterday we

20
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
vector it down. Okay. And yesterday we
 

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,310
vector it down. Okay. And yesterday we
were trying this drill

22
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
were trying this drill
 

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,310
were trying this drill
and it started to expose this rotational

24
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
and it started to expose this rotational
 

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,910
and it started to expose this rotational
integrity and then this top of the quad

26
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
integrity and then this top of the quad
 

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,910
integrity and then this top of the quad
integrity. Okay,

28
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920

 

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,350

but here's the thing.

30
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
but here's the thing.
 

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,270
but here's the thing.
If my when I do the hand drills, it

32
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
If my when I do the hand drills, it
 

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,149
If my when I do the hand drills, it
wasn't so exposable, right? Wasn't so

34
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
wasn't so exposable, right? Wasn't so
 

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,149
wasn't so exposable, right? Wasn't so
sensible.

36
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
sensible.
 

37
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,910
sensible.
But if my hand is staying still like

38
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
But if my hand is staying still like
 

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,910
But if my hand is staying still like
she's pushing, do you see? And I'm not

40
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
she's pushing, do you see? And I'm not
 

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,789
she's pushing, do you see? And I'm not
doing this. She's pushing and I'm not

42
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
doing this. She's pushing and I'm not
 

43
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,830
doing this. She's pushing and I'm not
doing that. Do you get that?

44
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:27,840
doing that. Do you get that?
 

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,910
doing that. Do you get that?
If my hand stays still, then what else

46
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
If my hand stays still, then what else
 

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,429
If my hand stays still, then what else
stays still is my shoulder. Do you get

48
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
stays still is my shoulder. Do you get
 

49
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,630
stays still is my shoulder. Do you get
that? Like the shoulder has to move to

50
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
that? Like the shoulder has to move to
 

51
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,749
that? Like the shoulder has to move to
do those other things.

52
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
do those other things.
 

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,149
do those other things.
So somewhere

54
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
So somewhere
 

55
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,149
So somewhere
in there

56
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
in there
 

57
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,670
in there
is

58
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680

 

59
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,590

a very

60
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
a very
 

61
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,230
a very
hard thing to understand because we are

62
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
hard thing to understand because we are
 

63
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,590
hard thing to understand because we are
somehow in the placing of my hand there

64
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
somehow in the placing of my hand there
 

65
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,310
somehow in the placing of my hand there
I'm able to stabilize the shoulder. Do

66
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
I'm able to stabilize the shoulder. Do
 

67
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,270
I'm able to stabilize the shoulder. Do
you see that? But without my hand there

68
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
you see that? But without my hand there
 

69
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,190
you see that? But without my hand there
then I can't stabilize the shoulder. So

70
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
then I can't stabilize the shoulder. So
 

71
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,550
then I can't stabilize the shoulder. So
there's a lot of just

72
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
there's a lot of just
 

73
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,470
there's a lot of just
almost like faith like you're not

74
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
almost like faith like you're not
 

75
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,550
almost like faith like you're not
believing it. Do do you know what I

76
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
believing it. Do do you know what I
 

77
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,309
believing it. Do do you know what I
mean? Like maybe if you picture your

78
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
mean? Like maybe if you picture your
 

79
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,110
mean? Like maybe if you picture your
hand there and she's pushing and you

80
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
hand there and she's pushing and you
 

81
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,830
hand there and she's pushing and you
could get more the same idea. Do do you

82
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
could get more the same idea. Do do you
 

83
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,630
could get more the same idea. Do do you
understand? Okay. So we'll try that. Um,

84
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
understand? Okay. So we'll try that. Um,
 

85
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,070
understand? Okay. So we'll try that. Um,
but some of you already experience the

86
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
but some of you already experience the
 

87
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,309
but some of you already experience the
difference between

88
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
difference between
 

89
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,350
difference between
the force coming in and going down and

90
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
the force coming in and going down and
 

91
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,309
the force coming in and going down and
me just pushing back on it. Okay.

92
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
me just pushing back on it. Okay.
 

93
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,910
me just pushing back on it. Okay.
What happens when you stand

94
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
What happens when you stand
 

95
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,070
What happens when you stand
and particularly when you're not ground

96
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
and particularly when you're not ground
 

97
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,150
and particularly when you're not ground
vectoring on the back foot, when your

98
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
vectoring on the back foot, when your
 

99
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,830
vectoring on the back foot, when your
line of gravity is between your two

100
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
line of gravity is between your two
 

101
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,710
line of gravity is between your two
feet, you have a bracing angle. Do do

102
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
feet, you have a bracing angle. Do do
 

103
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,190
feet, you have a bracing angle. Do do
you get that? But when we're seated, we

104
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
you get that? But when we're seated, we
 

105
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,430
you get that? But when we're seated, we
we can't we don't have a bracing angle.

106
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
we can't we don't have a bracing angle.
 

107
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,869
we can't we don't have a bracing angle.
Okay? It's a it's a very good reason why

108
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
Okay? It's a it's a very good reason why
 

109
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,630
Okay? It's a it's a very good reason why
you do suadiwaza because you will not

110
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
you do suadiwaza because you will not
 

111
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,110
you do suadiwaza because you will not
use bracing angles. Okay? It's harder to

112
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
use bracing angles. Okay? It's harder to
 

113
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,190
use bracing angles. Okay? It's harder to
use bracing angles. Um

114
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
use bracing angles. Um
 

115
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,949
use bracing angles. Um
so if I'm here and she's she's pushing

116
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
so if I'm here and she's she's pushing
 

117
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,509
so if I'm here and she's she's pushing
on me and I try to brace on that that

118
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
on me and I try to brace on that that
 

119
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,830
on me and I try to brace on that that
whatever that point is. You see, I'm

120
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
whatever that point is. You see, I'm
 

121
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,789
whatever that point is. You see, I'm
trying to brace on that point. If she

122
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
trying to brace on that point. If she
 

123
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,509
trying to brace on that point. If she
can outy yong me, then you you get

124
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
can outy yong me, then you you get
 

125
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,190
can outy yong me, then you you get
picked up like you guys are

126
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
picked up like you guys are
 

127
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,390
picked up like you guys are
experiencing. Do you see? And um

128
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
experiencing. Do you see? And um
 

129
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,149
experiencing. Do you see? And um
the reaction is to flex more, right? To

130
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
the reaction is to flex more, right? To
 

131
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,509
the reaction is to flex more, right? To
try to hold the place more. But as you

132
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
try to hold the place more. But as you
 

133
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,149
try to hold the place more. But as you
as you try to hold your legs more, it

134
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
as you try to hold your legs more, it
 

135
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,990
as you try to hold your legs more, it
just makes you more lever and you you

136
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
just makes you more lever and you you
 

137
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,190
just makes you more lever and you you
you get lighter to her. Okay? Does that

138
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
you get lighter to her. Okay? Does that
 

139
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,990
you get lighter to her. Okay? Does that
make sense? Okay. So,

140
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
make sense? Okay. So,
 

141
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,509
make sense? Okay. So,
um, we're going to do the two drills,

142
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
um, we're going to do the two drills,
 

143
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,509
um, we're going to do the two drills,
the previous one and then the one where

144
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
the previous one and then the one where
 

145
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,550
the previous one and then the one where
we're going to fake your your arm. Okay?

146
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
we're going to fake your your arm. Okay?
 

147
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,830
we're going to fake your your arm. Okay?
I don't I don't know if you've seen

148
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
I don't I don't know if you've seen
 

149
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,149
I don't I don't know if you've seen
those experiments. Have you seen these

150
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
those experiments. Have you seen these
 

151
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,030
those experiments. Have you seen these
experiments where they have a person

152
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
experiments where they have a person
 

153
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,990
experiments where they have a person
um uh with a curtain right down the

154
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000
um uh with a curtain right down the
 

155
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,110
um uh with a curtain right down the
middle and they have them put their arm

156
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
middle and they have them put their arm
 

157
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,350
middle and they have them put their arm
on here and then they have a fake arm.

158
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
on here and then they have a fake arm.
 

159
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,270
on here and then they have a fake arm.
They know it's a fake arm. Do you see

160
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
They know it's a fake arm. Do you see
 

161
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,950
They know it's a fake arm. Do you see
that? But as they're touching the fake

162
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
that? But as they're touching the fake
 

163
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,070
that? But as they're touching the fake
arm with the feather, they're touching

164
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
arm with the feather, they're touching
 

165
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,950
arm with the feather, they're touching
the real arm with the feather. And they

166
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
the real arm with the feather. And they
 

167
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,310
the real arm with the feather. And they
just keep doing these various

168
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
just keep doing these various
 

169
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,950
just keep doing these various
experiments to where they hit the fake

170
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
experiments to where they hit the fake
 

171
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,110
experiments to where they hit the fake
arm with a hammer and they're like, "Ah,

172
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
arm with a hammer and they're like, "Ah,
 

173
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,430
arm with a hammer and they're like, "Ah,
like they get a pain response." Okay. Um

174
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
like they get a pain response." Okay. Um
 

175
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,830
like they get a pain response." Okay. Um
to me what this is telling me is there

176
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
to me what this is telling me is there
 

177
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,310
to me what this is telling me is there
is this for lack of a better word a

178
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
is this for lack of a better word a
 

179
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,270
is this for lack of a better word a
subconscious aspect to all this which is

180
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
subconscious aspect to all this which is
 

181
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,670
subconscious aspect to all this which is
why you have to use metaphysical

182
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
why you have to use metaphysical
 

183
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,270
why you have to use metaphysical
discourses because we can't tap into it

184
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
discourses because we can't tap into it
 

185
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,110
discourses because we can't tap into it
through scientific discourse because

186
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
through scientific discourse because
 

187
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,590
through scientific discourse because
that's not our subconscious. Okay. So

188
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
that's not our subconscious. Okay. So
 

189
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,189
that's not our subconscious. Okay. So
we'll play with that and see if it gets

190
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
we'll play with that and see if it gets
 

191
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,790
we'll play with that and see if it gets
us anywhere. All right. Um, so the first

192
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
us anywhere. All right. Um, so the first
 

193
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,310
us anywhere. All right. Um, so the first
drill that we did is a kind of gradual

194
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
drill that we did is a kind of gradual
 

195
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,629
drill that we did is a kind of gradual
pressure because we know on you guys if

196
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
pressure because we know on you guys if
 

197
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,950
pressure because we know on you guys if
she if she just comes in and pushes me

198
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
she if she just comes in and pushes me
 

199
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,270
she if she just comes in and pushes me
real hard, you're I'm I'm going to do

200
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
real hard, you're I'm I'm going to do
 

201
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,390
real hard, you're I'm I'm going to do
that other thing. Okay. So, just a

202
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
that other thing. Okay. So, just a
 

203
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,390
that other thing. Okay. So, just a
gradual pressure. She just first with

204
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
gradual pressure. She just first with
 

205
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,469
gradual pressure. She just first with
touch and then like zen and you'll

206
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
touch and then like zen and you'll
 

207
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,029
touch and then like zen and you'll
you'll you'll feel it if you can. Okay.

208
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
you'll you'll feel it if you can. Okay.
 

209
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,310
you'll you'll feel it if you can. Okay.
You'll feel me drop

210
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320

 

211
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,029

and then she'll increase the pressure

212
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
and then she'll increase the pressure
 

213
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,550
and then she'll increase the pressure
and with each pressure I am particularly

214
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
and with each pressure I am particularly
 

215
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,029
and with each pressure I am particularly
know that my hands my arms never had

216
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
know that my hands my arms never had
 

217
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,749
know that my hands my arms never had
anything to do with it. So release that

218
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
anything to do with it. So release that
 

219
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,150
anything to do with it. So release that
tension

220
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
tension
 

221
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,469
tension
and then my legs

222
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
and then my legs
 

223
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,550
and then my legs
they don't have anything to do with it.

224
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
they don't have anything to do with it.
 

225
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:07,670
they don't have anything to do with it.
So I release that tension

226
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680

 

227
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,830

and she's gradually

228
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
and she's gradually
 

229
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:25,510
and she's gradually
increasing the pressure.

230
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520

 

231
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,749

Okay,

232
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
Okay,
 

233
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,510
Okay,
she's pushing pretty good there at the

234
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
she's pushing pretty good there at the
 

235
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,790
she's pushing pretty good there at the
end, right? Okay. And then the next

236
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
end, right? Okay. And then the next
 

237
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,710
end, right? Okay. And then the next
drill

238
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
drill
 

239
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,469
drill
is

240
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
is
 

241
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,350
is
you'll you'll have your hands like

242
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
you'll you'll have your hands like
 

243
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,510
you'll you'll have your hands like
you're trying to keep extension. Okay,

244
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
you're trying to keep extension. Okay,
 

245
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,150
you're trying to keep extension. Okay,
got it? You're gonna have to use your

246
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
got it? You're gonna have to use your
 

247
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,309
got it? You're gonna have to use your
imagination like someone's pushing on

248
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
imagination like someone's pushing on
 

249
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,950
imagination like someone's pushing on
your hands and she'll do the same

250
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
your hands and she'll do the same
 

251
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,189
your hands and she'll do the same
gradual pressure

252
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
gradual pressure
 

253
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,909
gradual pressure
and you keep when you feel this pressure

254
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
and you keep when you feel this pressure
 

255
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,710
and you keep when you feel this pressure
I want you to in your mind extend your

256
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
I want you to in your mind extend your
 

257
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,589
I want you to in your mind extend your
arms your arms out. Do you get it? So

258
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
arms your arms out. Do you get it? So
 

259
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,150
arms your arms out. Do you get it? So
don't keep your arms long. And she keeps

260
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
don't keep your arms long. And she keeps
 

261
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,909
don't keep your arms long. And she keeps
going.

262
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
going.
 

263
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,430
going.
When you feel like, oh, that's where I

264
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
When you feel like, oh, that's where I
 

265
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,029
When you feel like, oh, that's where I
want to flex. Instead, I want you to

266
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
want to flex. Instead, I want you to
 

267
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:15,589
want to flex. Instead, I want you to
reach out.

268
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599

 

269
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,790

Okay. For me, I can't release as much

270
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
Okay. For me, I can't release as much
 

271
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,390
Okay. For me, I can't release as much
because

272
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
because
 

273
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,029
because
I'm consciously trying to to reach out.

274
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
I'm consciously trying to to reach out.
 

275
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,029
I'm consciously trying to to reach out.
Do you know what I mean? I could feel

276
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
Do you know what I mean? I could feel
 

277
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,150
Do you know what I mean? I could feel
I'm not as dropping. Okay. But let's see

278
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
I'm not as dropping. Okay. But let's see
 

279
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,070
I'm not as dropping. Okay. But let's see
what happens with you guys. Okay. All

280
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
what happens with you guys. Okay. All
 

281
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,309
what happens with you guys. Okay. All
right. Let's try it. And we know we know

282
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
right. Let's try it. And we know we know
 

283
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,350
right. Let's try it. And we know we know
what's happening when I get pushed over.

284
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
what's happening when I get pushed over.
 

285
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,510
what's happening when I get pushed over.
I'm flexing. I made a lever out of my

286
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
I'm flexing. I made a lever out of my
 

287
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,990
I'm flexing. I made a lever out of my
body. Okay. Try it. Okay. And uh

288
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
body. Okay. Try it. Okay. And uh
 

289
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,950
body. Okay. Try it. Okay. And uh
comments or observations?

290
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
comments or observations?
 

291
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,670
comments or observations?
Yes.

292

Yes.
 

293
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,589
Yes.
I noticed this more on the second than

294
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
I noticed this more on the second than
 

295
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,350
I noticed this more on the second than
the first, but I think it was there

296
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
the first, but I think it was there
 

297
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,070
the first, but I think it was there
second time through. Uh I think it was

298
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
second time through. Uh I think it was
 

299
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,710
second time through. Uh I think it was
there both that there was a pressure at

300
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
there both that there was a pressure at
 

301
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,749
there both that there was a pressure at
which this And that part of the back

302
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
which this And that part of the back
 

303
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,950
which this And that part of the back
especially became flex and I couldn't

304
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
especially became flex and I couldn't
 

305
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,670
especially became flex and I couldn't
release out of that and then immediately

306
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
release out of that and then immediately
 

307
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,749
release out of that and then immediately
starting.

308
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759

 

309

Okay.
All right. Uh let's

312
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
All right. Uh let's
 

313
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,309
All right. Uh let's
let's try this. Okay.

314
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
let's try this. Okay.
 

315
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,629
let's try this. Okay.
Um

316
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639

 

317
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,790

I'm trying to try to see how how we can

318
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
I'm trying to try to see how how we can
 

319
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,629
I'm trying to try to see how how we can
do this. Okay. and you come around me.

Uh you're going to you're going to put
 

325
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,790
Uh you're going to you're going to put
your hands from behind me on my

326
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
your hands from behind me on my
 

327
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,630
your hands from behind me on my
midsection. Don't don't squeeze me

328
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
midsection. Don't don't squeeze me
 

329
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,590
midsection. Don't don't squeeze me
though. Okay. Just kind of light. Okay.

330
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
though. Okay. Just kind of light. Okay.
 

331
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,550
though. Okay. Just kind of light. Okay.
And uh

332
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
And uh
 

333
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,230
And uh
because you do need that structural

334
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
because you do need that structural
 

335
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,350
because you do need that structural
integrity in in the in this midsection

336
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
integrity in in the in this midsection
 

337
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,470
integrity in in the in this midsection
because it's the top of the qua. Do do

338
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
because it's the top of the qua. Do do
 

339
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,949
because it's the top of the qua. Do do
you understand? Okay. What you should

340
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
you understand? Okay. What you should
 

341
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,590
you understand? Okay. What you should
feel is when you'll feel like uh I'm

342
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
feel is when you'll feel like uh I'm
 

343
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,190
feel is when you'll feel like uh I'm
going to do it externally. You'll feel

344
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
going to do it externally. You'll feel
 

345
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,070
going to do it externally. You'll feel
something like that. Okay. And when she

346
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
something like that. Okay. And when she
 

347
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,790
something like that. Okay. And when she
feels that, you're going to feel this.

348
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
feels that, you're going to feel this.
 

349
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,310
feels that, you're going to feel this.
Okay.

350
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
Okay.
 

351
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,310
Okay.
All right. So, we're doing drill one

352
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
All right. So, we're doing drill one
 

353
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,870
All right. So, we're doing drill one
again. She starts to to press.

354
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880

 

355
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,350

Did you feel it drop? Yes. And then, did

356
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
Did you feel it drop? Yes. And then, did
 

357
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,430
Did you feel it drop? Yes. And then, did
you feel it get big? Yes. Okay. Do you

358
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
you feel it get big? Yes. Okay. Do you
 

359
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,110
you feel it get big? Yes. Okay. Do you
see it? So now I have this huge thing in

360
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
see it? So now I have this huge thing in
 

361
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,870
see it? So now I have this huge thing in
the middle

362
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
the middle
 

363
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,910
the middle
that you can keep pushing

364
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
that you can keep pushing
 

365
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,389
that you can keep pushing
it. It it cannot it cannot do this. I I

366
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
it. It it cannot it cannot do this. I I
 

367
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,310
it. It it cannot it cannot do this. I I
have to let it go. So I'll do that and

368
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
have to let it go. So I'll do that and
 

369
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,430
have to let it go. So I'll do that and
you'll you'll feel it get small again.

370
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
you'll you'll feel it get small again.
 

371
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,070
you'll you'll feel it get small again.
Okay. So you're going to you you're

372
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
Okay. So you're going to you you're
 

373
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,829
Okay. So you're going to you you're
going to feel for the drop. When she

374
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
going to feel for the drop. When she
 

375
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,670
going to feel for the drop. When she
feels that drop, you'll feel you'll feel

376
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
feels that drop, you'll feel you'll feel
 

377
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,070
feels that drop, you'll feel you'll feel
that. Okay. There's the drop.

378
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
that. Okay. There's the drop.
 

379
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,190
that. Okay. There's the drop.
And then I'm going to un unhinge that

380
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
And then I'm going to un unhinge that
 

381
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,389
And then I'm going to un unhinge that
top claw and you'll feel that it got

382
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
top claw and you'll feel that it got
 

383
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,990
top claw and you'll feel that it got
smaller. Okay. So

384
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
smaller. Okay. So
 

385
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,389
smaller. Okay. So
what this that's your lower tand she

386
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
what this that's your lower tand she
 

387
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,190
what this that's your lower tand she
goes there goes that it's right it's

388
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
goes there goes that it's right it's
 

389
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,110
goes there goes that it's right it's
right when she pushes she's forming it

390
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
right when she pushes she's forming it
 

391
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,550
right when she pushes she's forming it
in a way. And now I have this she can

392
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
in a way. And now I have this she can
 

393
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,190
in a way. And now I have this she can
keep pushing. I have this thing that you

394
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
keep pushing. I have this thing that you
 

395
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,269
keep pushing. I have this thing that you
just you're not going to be able to ever

396
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
just you're not going to be able to ever
 

397
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,230
just you're not going to be able to ever
bend backwards. Do you see? And the

398
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
bend backwards. Do you see? And the
 

399
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,990
bend backwards. Do you see? And the
interesting part, you can see that the

400
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
interesting part, you can see that the
 

401
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,310
interesting part, you can see that the
more she's pushing, the bigger it's

402
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
more she's pushing, the bigger it's
 

403
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,470
more she's pushing, the bigger it's
getting. Okay. And now I'm going to

404
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
getting. Okay. And now I'm going to
 

405
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,790
getting. Okay. And now I'm going to
release that that back line, the Ming

406
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
release that that back line, the Ming
 

407
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,150
release that that back line, the Ming
men line. So I dropped more and it got

408
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
men line. So I dropped more and it got
 

409
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,509
men line. So I dropped more and it got
bigger. Do you see? And then there's

410
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
bigger. Do you see? And then there's
 

411
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,310
bigger. Do you see? And then there's
there's just no way that it because it

412
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
there's just no way that it because it
 

413
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,550
there's just no way that it because it
doesn't have a hinge now. And now I can

414
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
doesn't have a hinge now. And now I can
 

415
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,430
doesn't have a hinge now. And now I can
I can move wherever. Okay.

416
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
I can move wherever. Okay.
 

417
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,030
I can move wherever. Okay.
So I do want that.

418
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
So I do want that.
 

419
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,670
So I do want that.
I understand that there's that top

420
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
I understand that there's that top
 

421
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,150
I understand that there's that top
hinge,

422
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
hinge,
 

423
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,710
hinge,
but we don't want to flex.

424
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
but we don't want to flex.
 

425
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,550
but we don't want to flex.
We want the pressure to build and the

426
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
We want the pressure to build and the
 

427
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,389
We want the pressure to build and the
pressure will build by releasing the

428
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
pressure will build by releasing the
 

429
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,150
pressure will build by releasing the
tension. Okay, that that is yes, there's

430
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
tension. Okay, that that is yes, there's
 

431
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,150
tension. Okay, that that is yes, there's
an architectural

432
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
an architectural
 

433
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,230
an architectural
fulfillment that has to happen. It just

434
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
fulfillment that has to happen. It just
 

435
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,949
fulfillment that has to happen. It just
doesn't happen by the flexing which

436
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
doesn't happen by the flexing which
 

437
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,910
doesn't happen by the flexing which
shrinks the tanden. Okay. Um

438
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
shrinks the tanden. Okay. Um
 

439
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,829
shrinks the tanden. Okay. Um
there's things I can do with this. So I

440
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
there's things I can do with this. So I
 

441
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,990
there's things I can do with this. So I
kind of hinted at it that I can I can

442
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
kind of hinted at it that I can I can
 

443
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,710
kind of hinted at it that I can I can
move now wherever. Okay. So when I go

444
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
move now wherever. Okay. So when I go
 

445
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,630
move now wherever. Okay. So when I go
forward

446
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
forward
 

447
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,670
forward
physically what do you know happens to

448
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
physically what do you know happens to
 

449
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,790
physically what do you know happens to
the force value at contact it should

450
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
the force value at contact it should
 

451
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,710
the force value at contact it should
increase because the imposing energy

452
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
increase because the imposing energy
 

453
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,590
increase because the imposing energy
right but that energy is just going down

454
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
right but that energy is just going down
 

455
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,030
right but that energy is just going down
now do you see into that tanden and so I

456
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
now do you see into that tanden and so I
 

457
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,350
now do you see into that tanden and so I
don't feel the the increase but she

458
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
don't feel the the increase but she
 

459
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,870
don't feel the the increase but she
feels like that is getting

460
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
feels like that is getting
 

461
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,269
feels like that is getting
powerful. She feels the force. Do do you

462
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
powerful. She feels the force. Do do you
 

463
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,590
powerful. She feels the force. Do do you
get what I'm saying? Okay. So, and uh

464
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
get what I'm saying? Okay. So, and uh
 

465
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,590
get what I'm saying? Okay. So, and uh
that's the difference between external

466
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
that's the difference between external
 

467
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,190
that's the difference between external
internal.

468
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
internal.
 

469
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,590
internal.
So, for example, what you'll see in a

470
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
So, for example, what you'll see in a
 

471
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,670
So, for example, what you'll see in a
lot of Iikido people, a lot like even O

472
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
lot of Iikido people, a lot like even O
 

473
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,069
lot of Iikido people, a lot like even O
Sensei, he he he would do it all from

474
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
Sensei, he he he would do it all from
 

475
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,870
Sensei, he he he would do it all from
here, but I have a bum knee. When you do

476
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:04,880
here, but I have a bum knee. When you do
 

477
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,829
here, but I have a bum knee. When you do
it from from cross-legged,

478
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
it from from cross-legged,
 

479
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,550
it from from cross-legged,
you can lean more forward. Do do you get

480
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
you can lean more forward. Do do you get
 

481
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,150
you can lean more forward. Do do you get
what I'm saying? Kind of like how Ellie

482
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
what I'm saying? Kind of like how Ellie
 

483
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,750
what I'm saying? Kind of like how Ellie
does it. She she can lean very forward.

484
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
does it. She she can lean very forward.
 

485
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,150
does it. She she can lean very forward.
In sea you can't you can't lean as as

486
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
In sea you can't you can't lean as as
 

487
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,030
In sea you can't you can't lean as as
far forward. So you see uh so that I

488
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
far forward. So you see uh so that I
 

489
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,910
far forward. So you see uh so that I
like the sea better regardless

490
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
like the sea better regardless
 

491
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,710
like the sea better regardless
but some people will do it in sea and

492
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
but some people will do it in sea and
 

493
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,949
but some people will do it in sea and
you'll see that they'll come they anchor

494
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
you'll see that they'll come they anchor
 

495
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,710
you'll see that they'll come they anchor
here. Do you see this is a physical

496
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
here. Do you see this is a physical
 

497
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,030
here. Do you see this is a physical
um reinforcing of my position. Okay. So

498
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
um reinforcing of my position. Okay. So
 

499
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,310
um reinforcing of my position. Okay. So
when she pushes I I

500
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
when she pushes I I
 

501
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,350
when she pushes I I
push up on her. Do you see? She pushes

502
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
push up on her. Do you see? She pushes
 

503
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,670
push up on her. Do you see? She pushes
and I keep pushing up on her. She pushes

504
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
and I keep pushing up on her. She pushes
 

505
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,150
and I keep pushing up on her. She pushes
and I keep pushing up on her, but I

506
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
and I keep pushing up on her, but I
 

507
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,030
and I keep pushing up on her, but I
cannot move from here. I cannot get up.

508
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
cannot move from here. I cannot get up.
 

509
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,509
cannot move from here. I cannot get up.
I push towards her and it's just

510
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
I push towards her and it's just
 

511
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,389
I push towards her and it's just
increasing the yong value, but I can't

512
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
increasing the yong value, but I can't
 

513
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,590
increasing the yong value, but I can't
go past past it. Do do you understand?

514
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
go past past it. Do do you understand?
 

515
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,870
go past past it. Do do you understand?
So it's the same thing when you brace in

516
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
So it's the same thing when you brace in
 

517
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,110
So it's the same thing when you brace in
your tachiwaza

518
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
your tachiwaza
 

519
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,670
your tachiwaza
you're getting pinned when when you do

520
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
you're getting pinned when when you do
 

521
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,389
you're getting pinned when when you do
that and you cannot move and that

522
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
that and you cannot move and that
 

523
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,790
that and you cannot move and that
doesn't make sense combatively. Okay. So

524
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
doesn't make sense combatively. Okay. So
 

525
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,230
doesn't make sense combatively. Okay. So
this will be the next discovery

526
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
this will be the next discovery
 

527
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,230
this will be the next discovery
learning. They're going to push. I just

528
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
learning. They're going to push. I just
 

529
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,269
learning. They're going to push. I just
have my hands underneath her elbows and

530
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
have my hands underneath her elbows and
 

531
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,590
have my hands underneath her elbows and
as she's driving you just keep lifting

532
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
as she's driving you just keep lifting
 

533
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,069
as she's driving you just keep lifting
up on on their elbows. Okay. It's not

534
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
up on on their elbows. Okay. It's not
 

535
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,069
up on on their elbows. Okay. It's not
that you're you're taking away. You'll

536
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
that you're you're taking away. You'll
 

537
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,670
that you're you're taking away. You'll
see that oh yeah that's pushing me down

538
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
see that oh yeah that's pushing me down
 

539
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,829
see that oh yeah that's pushing me down
and keeping me in place. Okay. But

540
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
and keeping me in place. Okay. But
 

541
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,629
and keeping me in place. Okay. But
you'll also see as as you go forward,

542
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
you'll also see as as you go forward,
 

543
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,470
you'll also see as as you go forward,
you can't really go forward on her.

544
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480
you can't really go forward on her.
 

545
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,230
you can't really go forward on her.
Okay. All right. So, let's try that

546
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
Okay. All right. So, let's try that
 

547
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,470
Okay. All right. So, let's try that
discovery learning. This is an external

548
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
discovery learning. This is an external
 

549
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,750
discovery learning. This is an external
uh gaining of positional integrity. Try.

550
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
uh gaining of positional integrity. Try.
 

551
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:52,310
uh gaining of positional integrity. Try.
Okay. Um what do you think?

552
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320

 

553
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,670

There's no going forward. You're like

554
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
There's no going forward. You're like
 

555
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,829
There's no going forward. You're like
stuck. We're in a stalemate. You see?

556
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:55,839
stuck. We're in a stalemate. You see?
 

557
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,389
stuck. We're in a stalemate. You see?
And so this is like uh why I say there's

558
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
And so this is like uh why I say there's
 

559
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,910
And so this is like uh why I say there's
really no non-contestation externally.

560
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
really no non-contestation externally.
 

561
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,430
really no non-contestation externally.
Do you know what I mean? Like you you

562
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
Do you know what I mean? Like you you
 

563
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,269
Do you know what I mean? Like you you
have you have to um you have to

564
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
have you have to um you have to
 

565
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,990
have you have to um you have to
deconstruct the dichotomy

566
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
deconstruct the dichotomy
 

567
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,389
deconstruct the dichotomy
um so that you're not pushing back on

568
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
um so that you're not pushing back on
 

569
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,069
um so that you're not pushing back on
them. They're pushing on you, but you're

570
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
them. They're pushing on you, but you're
 

571
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,310
them. They're pushing on you, but you're
not pushing on them. Okay. Now, what

572
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320
not pushing on them. Okay. Now, what
 

573
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,710
not pushing on them. Okay. Now, what
modern Iikido has done is go, "Well,

574
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
modern Iikido has done is go, "Well,
 

575
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,710
modern Iikido has done is go, "Well,
I'll just get out of the way." Do you

576
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
I'll just get out of the way." Do you
 

577
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,990
I'll just get out of the way." Do you
know what I mean? And so then they're

578
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,000
know what I mean? And so then they're
 

579
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,269
know what I mean? And so then they're
like, "I'm not pushing on you. I'm

580
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279
like, "I'm not pushing on you. I'm
 

581
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,030
like, "I'm not pushing on you. I'm
getting out of the way. But you, it

582
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
getting out of the way. But you, it
 

583
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,389
getting out of the way. But you, it
doesn't work. It doesn't function

584
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399
doesn't work. It doesn't function
 

585
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,949
doesn't work. It doesn't function
marshally. Um, it's too intellectual a

586
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
marshally. Um, it's too intellectual a
 

587
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,949
marshally. Um, it's too intellectual a
process that can't function at speed of

588
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
process that can't function at speed of
 

589
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,509
process that can't function at speed of
life. Which is why even in Kihon Waza,

590
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:37,519
life. Which is why even in Kihon Waza,
 

591
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,069
life. Which is why even in Kihon Waza,
they push back on the the UK. Do do you

592
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
they push back on the the UK. Do do you
 

593
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,910
they push back on the the UK. Do do you
know what I mean? Okay. All right. Well,

594
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
know what I mean? Okay. All right. Well,
 

595
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,629
know what I mean? Okay. All right. Well,
I'll show you another thing on um why

596
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
I'll show you another thing on um why
 

597
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,269
I'll show you another thing on um why
why this doesn't work. Okay. What what

598
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
why this doesn't work. Okay. What what
 

599
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,590
why this doesn't work. Okay. What what
the difference is.

600
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:51,600
the difference is.
 

601
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,910
the difference is.
So she is going to she's here. I let

602
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
So she is going to she's here. I let
 

603
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,470
So she is going to she's here. I let
that that thing form, right? And then

604
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,480
that that thing form, right? And then
 

605
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,870
that that thing form, right? And then
you can see that I can move anywhere.

606
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
you can see that I can move anywhere.
 

607
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,310
you can see that I can move anywhere.
Well, I can also move

608
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
Well, I can also move
 

609
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,189
Well, I can also move
this way. She's pushing. You see? And I

610
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
this way. She's pushing. You see? And I
 

611
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,269
this way. She's pushing. You see? And I
can move back.

612
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
can move back.
 

613
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,910
can move back.
When you do the other one and you're

614
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:11,920
When you do the other one and you're
 

615
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,910
When you do the other one and you're
here like this and you go back and

616
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
here like this and you go back and
 

617
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,069
here like this and you go back and
you're like, you're not coming back.

618
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
you're like, you're not coming back.
 

619
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,790
you're like, you're not coming back.
Okay? Do you get that? So you can't even

620
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
Okay? Do you get that? So you can't even
 

621
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,069
Okay? Do you get that? So you can't even
get your angles of deviation

622
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
get your angles of deviation
 

623
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,870
get your angles of deviation
uh because you're stuck. And so anytime

624
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:24,880
uh because you're stuck. And so anytime
 

625
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,509
uh because you're stuck. And so anytime
you do your any yield which is in the

626
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
you do your any yield which is in the
 

627
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,470
you do your any yield which is in the
art, you can't capitalize upon it. It's

628
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,480
art, you can't capitalize upon it. It's
 

629
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,030
art, you can't capitalize upon it. It's
just creating yin space that they f they

630
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
just creating yin space that they f they
 

631
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,230
just creating yin space that they f they
fulfill with their yong energy. Okay. So

632
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
fulfill with their yong energy. Okay. So
 

633
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,189
fulfill with their yong energy. Okay. So
we'll try I don't this again. She's

634
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
we'll try I don't this again. She's
 

635
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,829
we'll try I don't this again. She's
she's going to go you you guys probably

636
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
she's going to go you you guys probably
 

637
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,790
she's going to go you you guys probably
can't come back

638
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
can't come back
 

639
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,269
can't come back
now anyways. Do you get it?

640
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:47,279
now anyways. Do you get it?
 

641
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,189
now anyways. Do you get it?
But you can try this one. Your hair,

642
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199
But you can try this one. Your hair,
 

643
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,269
But you can try this one. Your hair,
she's you're you're stuck in place. I

644
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279
she's you're you're stuck in place. I
 

645
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,870
she's you're you're stuck in place. I
want you to disconnect it and you'll

646
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
want you to disconnect it and you'll
 

647
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,670
want you to disconnect it and you'll
see. Ah, everything fell apart. Okay.

648
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
see. Ah, everything fell apart. Okay.
 

649
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,670
see. Ah, everything fell apart. Okay.
You could probably try that one. Um,

650
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
You could probably try that one. Um,
 

651
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,870
You could probably try that one. Um,
since we're since we're here too, as

652
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
since we're since we're here too, as
 

653
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,389
since we're since we're here too, as
she's as she's driving and it forms and

654
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:06,399
she's as she's driving and it forms and
 

655
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,269
she's as she's driving and it forms and
I can go here.

656
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
I can go here.
 

657
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,470
I can go here.
Do do you get it? And I can come back.

658
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,480

 

659
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,990

I can go here as I go back too. Do you

660
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
I can go here as I go back too. Do you
 

661
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,749
I can go here as I go back too. Do you
see?

662
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
see?
 

663
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,990
see?
So, and again, none none of that's

664
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
So, and again, none none of that's
 

665
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,230
So, and again, none none of that's
possible. I don't I don't get to play

666
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
possible. I don't I don't get to play
 

667
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,829
possible. I don't I don't get to play
with all the contact points whether I'm

668
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
with all the contact points whether I'm
 

669
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,069
with all the contact points whether I'm
adhering or whether I'm projecting. I

670
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
adhering or whether I'm projecting. I
 

671
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,550
adhering or whether I'm projecting. I
just got this thing here that I can't do

672
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
just got this thing here that I can't do
 

673
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,949
just got this thing here that I can't do
anything with. Okay. So, your discovery

674
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
anything with. Okay. So, your discovery
 

675
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,310
anything with. Okay. So, your discovery
learning exercise is get get here. Okay.

676
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
learning exercise is get get here. Okay.
 

677
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,069
learning exercise is get get here. Okay.
Push push push push your chair. Okay.

678
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
Push push push push your chair. Okay.
 

679
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,829
Push push push push your chair. Okay.
She can't push me. And now I want you to

680
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
She can't push me. And now I want you to
 

681
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,110
She can't push me. And now I want you to
try to do that. And you're like, "Oh,

682
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
try to do that. And you're like, "Oh,
 

683
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,389
try to do that. And you're like, "Oh,
yeah.

684
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
yeah.
 

685
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,509
yeah.
Okay. And you know that's basically EQL.

686
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
Okay. And you know that's basically EQL.
 

687
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,870
Okay. And you know that's basically EQL.
You see every time we do the front

688
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880
You see every time we do the front
 

689
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,670
You see every time we do the front
inward kazushi, you're doing that. So

690
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
inward kazushi, you're doing that. So
 

691
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,269
inward kazushi, you're doing that. So
all your front inward kazushi

692
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
all your front inward kazushi
 

693
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,470
all your front inward kazushi
techniques, they don't actually

694
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
techniques, they don't actually
 

695
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,069
techniques, they don't actually
function. Okay. All right. Let's try

696
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
function. Okay. All right. Let's try
 

697
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,949
function. Okay. All right. Let's try
that discovery learning. Okay. All

698
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959
that discovery learning. Okay. All
 

699
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,110
that discovery learning. Okay. All
right. So you you guys can see this just

700
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
right. So you you guys can see this just
 

701
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,790
right. So you you guys can see this just
doesn't work. And there's more things

702
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:02,800
doesn't work. And there's more things
 

703
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,949
doesn't work. And there's more things
you can do.

704
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
you can do.
 

705
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,029
you can do.
Um because uh control and projection,

706
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,039
Um because uh control and projection,
 

707
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,390
Um because uh control and projection,
right? Or adhesion and projection. Um,

708
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
right? Or adhesion and projection. Um,
 

709
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,990
right? Or adhesion and projection. Um,
not only can you play with diff

710
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
not only can you play with diff
 

711
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,390
not only can you play with diff
different arms, but between those two

712
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
different arms, but between those two
 

713
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,069
different arms, but between those two
forces, you have multiple degrees. So,

714
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
forces, you have multiple degrees. So,
 

715
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,429
forces, you have multiple degrees. So,
you can um you can do an adhesion to

716
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
you can um you can do an adhesion to
 

717
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,590
you can um you can do an adhesion to
such a degree that it's actually

718
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
such a degree that it's actually
 

719
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,909
such a degree that it's actually
slippery slippery on them. And the other

720
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
slippery slippery on them. And the other
 

721
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,990
slippery slippery on them. And the other
one there's no just friction is just

722
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
one there's no just friction is just
 

723
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,390
one there's no just friction is just
freaking stuck on there. Okay? So, you

724
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
freaking stuck on there. Okay? So, you
 

725
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,990
freaking stuck on there. Okay? So, you
can't even do that. You can't play with

726
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
can't even do that. You can't play with
 

727
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,070
can't even do that. You can't play with
the variations in the force values.

728
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,080
the variations in the force values.
 

729
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,310
the variations in the force values.
Okay? All right. So, here's what we got

730
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,320
Okay? All right. So, here's what we got
 

731
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,549
Okay? All right. So, here's what we got
to do.

732
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559
to do.
 

733
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,390
to do.
We got to let go of all that external

734
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
We got to let go of all that external
 

735
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,150
We got to let go of all that external
stuff. It's not what we do. It's not

736
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160
stuff. It's not what we do. It's not
 

737
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,710
stuff. It's not what we do. It's not
what we want. Okay?

738
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
what we want. Okay?
 

739
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,350
what we want. Okay?
And so

740
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,360
And so
 

741
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,430
And so
you're you're going to task yourself

742
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
you're you're going to task yourself
 

743
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,270
you're you're going to task yourself
with that releasing. Okay? Careful of

744
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
with that releasing. Okay? Careful of
 

745
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,950
with that releasing. Okay? Careful of
the flexion.

746
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
the flexion.
 

747
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,310
the flexion.
You're going to you're going to release

748
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
You're going to you're going to release
 

749
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,430
You're going to you're going to release
and let the pressure build up. Okay?

750
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
and let the pressure build up. Okay?
 

751
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,390
and let the pressure build up. Okay?
It's not uncommon that these internals

752
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
It's not uncommon that these internals
 

753
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,710
It's not uncommon that these internals
that people uh give themselves

754
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720
that people uh give themselves
 

755
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,789
that people uh give themselves
hemorrhoids because they're they're

756
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
hemorrhoids because they're they're
 

757
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,190
hemorrhoids because they're they're
pushing to and it's not a pushing. I

758
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
pushing to and it's not a pushing. I
 

759
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,029
pushing to and it's not a pushing. I
didn't I didn't push that I release and

760
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
didn't I didn't push that I release and
 

761
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,950
didn't I didn't push that I release and
the pressure happens to me. Okay. Um so

762
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:18,960
the pressure happens to me. Okay. Um so
 

763
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,950
the pressure happens to me. Okay. Um so
don't don't do that because you'll hurt

764
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
don't don't do that because you'll hurt
 

765
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,270
don't don't do that because you'll hurt
yourself in the long run. Okay. All

766
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280
yourself in the long run. Okay. All
 

767
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,549
yourself in the long run. Okay. All
right. So, as you feel the pressure,

768
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
right. So, as you feel the pressure,
 

769
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,669
right. So, as you feel the pressure,
you're going to let your I want you to

770
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
you're going to let your I want you to
 

771
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,150
you're going to let your I want you to
let tissues drop like you felt me drop.

772
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,160
let tissues drop like you felt me drop.
 

773
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,950
let tissues drop like you felt me drop.
Do you see that? Okay. But you can't

774
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
Do you see that? Okay. But you can't
 

775
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,350
Do you see that? Okay. But you can't
drop like this. Do you understand?

776
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
drop like this. Do you understand?
 

777
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,230
drop like this. Do you understand?
Inside the frame you have right now,

778
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
Inside the frame you have right now,
 

779
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,549
Inside the frame you have right now,
you're going to let tissues drop. So,

780
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
you're going to let tissues drop. So,
 

781
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,390
you're going to let tissues drop. So,
we're just here and you let tissues

782
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
we're just here and you let tissues
 

783
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:54,150
we're just here and you let tissues
drop.

784
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160

 

785
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,150

Now, can you feel it dropping and coming

786
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,160
Now, can you feel it dropping and coming
 

787
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,390
Now, can you feel it dropping and coming
up and dropping and it's not your

788
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400
up and dropping and it's not your
 

789
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,510
up and dropping and it's not your
breath? It's not breath. It's just it's

790
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520
breath? It's not breath. It's just it's
 

791
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,909
breath? It's not breath. It's just it's
uh it's a release and then the habitual

792
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
uh it's a release and then the habitual
 

793
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,990
uh it's a release and then the habitual
tension that we carry around all day

794
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
tension that we carry around all day
 

795
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,630
tension that we carry around all day
unconsciously. I release it and it came

796
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
unconsciously. I release it and it came
 

797
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,789
unconsciously. I release it and it came
back. Okay?

798
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:10,799
back. Okay?
 

799
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,789
back. Okay?
But I'm telling you, the dropping

800
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:14,799
But I'm telling you, the dropping
 

801
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,510
But I'm telling you, the dropping
is closer to getting what we want and

802
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
is closer to getting what we want and
 

803
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,430
is closer to getting what we want and
it's the way to get what we want. Even

804
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:19,440
it's the way to get what we want. Even
 

805
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,950
it's the way to get what we want. Even
if it doesn't last. Do do you

806
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:20,960
if it doesn't last. Do do you
 

807
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,310
if it doesn't last. Do do you
understand? So I'm I don't know from 1

808
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,320
understand? So I'm I don't know from 1
 

809
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,070
understand? So I'm I don't know from 1
to 10, what would you say I'm pushing on

810
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
to 10, what would you say I'm pushing on
 

811
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,750
to 10, what would you say I'm pushing on
you right now? Okay. One or two. Okay. I

812
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:29,760
you right now? Okay. One or two. Okay. I
 

813
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,909
you right now? Okay. One or two. Okay. I
agree. All right. And that's enough

814
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
agree. All right. And that's enough
 

815
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,990
agree. All right. And that's enough
pressure for her to do this. Let it let

816
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
pressure for her to do this. Let it let
 

817
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,630
pressure for her to do this. Let it let
it go down.

818
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,640
it go down.
 

819
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,950
it go down.
And if when she feels it come back up,

820
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
And if when she feels it come back up,
 

821
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,110
And if when she feels it come back up,
she releases it again. Do do you

822
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,120
she releases it again. Do do you
 

823
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,510
she releases it again. Do do you
understand? Everyone understand? And

824
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
understand? Everyone understand? And
 

825
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,990
understand? Everyone understand? And
that that's the drill because that

826
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
that that's the drill because that
 

827
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,950
that that's the drill because that
releasing is all I'm doing. It's just

828
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
releasing is all I'm doing. It's just
 

829
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,270
releasing is all I'm doing. It's just
it's not coming back up. Okay. All

830
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
it's not coming back up. Okay. All
 

831
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,310
it's not coming back up. Okay. All
right. So, let's try that. Please

832
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
right. So, let's try that. Please
 

833
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,799
right. So, let's try that. Please
push around a one or two. Okay.
