mind is amazing several years back and

64
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,000
mind is amazing several years back and
 

65
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,070
mind is amazing several years back and
and I kind of feel stupid about that now

66
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,080
and I kind of feel stupid about that now
 

67
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,550
and I kind of feel stupid about that now
okay so as we know shanci position is

68
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:19,560
okay so as we know shanci position is
 

69
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,109
okay so as we know shanci position is
this position right okay if Josh were to

70
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:22,119
this position right okay if Josh were to
 

71
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:24,270
this position right okay if Josh were to
throw yokom manucci we're going to get

72
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,280
throw yokom manucci we're going to get
 

73
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,550
throw yokom manucci we're going to get
somehow like this right just throw it

74
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:25,560
somehow like this right just throw it
 

75
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,870
somehow like this right just throw it
off that back hand okay so we get

76
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
off that back hand okay so we get
 

77
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,310
off that back hand okay so we get
somehow like this right so the main

78
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:29,320
somehow like this right so the main
 

79
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,510
somehow like this right so the main
difference between Showman's stuff and

80
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:32,520
difference between Showman's stuff and
 

81
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,030
difference between Showman's stuff and
uh yokan stuff positionally is where my

82
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:36,040
uh yokan stuff positionally is where my
 

83
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,789
uh yokan stuff positionally is where my
arm is if he sticks his arm out stick

84
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
arm is if he sticks his arm out stick
 

85
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,270
arm is if he sticks his arm out stick
this one out okay if he sticks his arm

86
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:40,280
this one out okay if he sticks his arm
 

87
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,149
this one out okay if he sticks his arm
out this is yokan position stuff this is

88
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
out this is yokan position stuff this is
 

89
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,230
out this is yokan position stuff this is
showman position stuff yokan showman now

90
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,240
showman position stuff yokan showman now
 

91
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,950
showman position stuff yokan showman now
that might seem like who cares about it

92
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
that might seem like who cares about it
 

93
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,109
that might seem like who cares about it
but it's important because if you're

94
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:52,119
but it's important because if you're
 

95
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:53,950
but it's important because if you're
trying to understand the positions that

96
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:53,960
trying to understand the positions that
 

97
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,029
trying to understand the positions that
will follow after the attack knowing

98
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:57,039
will follow after the attack knowing
 

99
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,029
will follow after the attack knowing
that tells you a lot about the kinds of

100
00:01:59,029 --> 00:01:59,039
that tells you a lot about the kinds of
 

101
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,190
that tells you a lot about the kinds of
answers you're going to get get for

102
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,200
answers you're going to get get for
 

103
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,910
answers you're going to get get for
showman attacks and you're going to get

104
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
showman attacks and you're going to get
 

105
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,230
showman attacks and you're going to get
for yokan attacks so yokan attacks I'm

106
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
for yokan attacks so yokan attacks I'm
 

107
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,590
for yokan attacks so yokan attacks I'm
always going to be inside position which

108
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:06,600
always going to be inside position which
 

109
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,270
always going to be inside position which
means I'm going to be filling this or

110
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
means I'm going to be filling this or
 

111
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,470
means I'm going to be filling this or
finding a way to transition outside of

112
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:11,480
finding a way to transition outside of
 

113
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,589
finding a way to transition outside of
this and that's what I'm going to do

114
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:12,599
this and that's what I'm going to do
 

115
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,750
this and that's what I'm going to do
from all yokan stuff from showman stuff

116
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
from all yokan stuff from showman stuff
 

117
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,509
from all yokan stuff from showman stuff
I already have basically the good

118
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:17,519
I already have basically the good
 

119
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,229
I already have basically the good
position so everything I'm going to do

120
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:19,239
position so everything I'm going to do
 

121
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,070
position so everything I'm going to do
is going to be about keeping the good

122
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,080
is going to be about keeping the good
 

123
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,710
is going to be about keeping the good
position so not transitioning out of

124
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:23,720
position so not transitioning out of
 

125
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,550
position so not transitioning out of
that position but keeping the good

126
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:25,560
that position but keeping the good
 

127
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,949
that position but keeping the good
position and so this is kind of an

128
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
position and so this is kind of an
 

129
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,190
position and so this is kind of an
important thing to understand because if

130
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
important thing to understand because if
 

131
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,229
important thing to understand because if
you realize this this means that iido

132
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:31,239
you realize this this means that iido
 

133
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,790
you realize this this means that iido
has sets of answers for either side of

134
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:33,800
has sets of answers for either side of
 

135
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,509
has sets of answers for either side of
the arm right so meaning if I'm here

136
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:36,519
the arm right so meaning if I'm here
 

137
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,190
the arm right so meaning if I'm here
then I'm trained with all the techniques

138
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,200
then I'm trained with all the techniques
 

139
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,309
then I'm trained with all the techniques
that follow for yokan if I'm here I'm

140
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
that follow for yokan if I'm here I'm
 

141
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,350
that follow for yokan if I'm here I'm
trained with all the techniques for

142
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
trained with all the techniques for
 

143
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,229
trained with all the techniques for
showman which means if Josh were to take

144
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:43,239
showman which means if Josh were to take
 

145
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,350
showman which means if Josh were to take
the showman and move his arm around oh

146
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
the showman and move his arm around oh
 

147
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,949
the showman and move his arm around oh
now we have the answers for yokan right

148
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:47,959
now we have the answers for yokan right
 

149
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,589
now we have the answers for yokan right
if he was to try to do something else

150
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,599
if he was to try to do something else
 

151
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,910
if he was to try to do something else
right something weird like maybe cut my

152
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:50,920
right something weird like maybe cut my
 

153
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,910
right something weird like maybe cut my
belly or something oh now we have all

154
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:52,920
belly or something oh now we have all
 

155
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,550
belly or something oh now we have all
the transitions for the showman the

156
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
the transitions for the showman the
 

157
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,830
the transitions for the showman the
outside stuff right so understanding

158
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:56,840
outside stuff right so understanding
 

159
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,110
outside stuff right so understanding
that showman and yokan are inside and

160
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
that showman and yokan are inside and
 

161
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,589
that showman and yokan are inside and
outside very iations of that arm

162
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
outside very iations of that arm
 

163
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,789
outside very iations of that arm
suppression kind of thing right and it's

164
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:03,799
suppression kind of thing right and it's
 

165
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,270
suppression kind of thing right and it's
it's like a really weak arm suppression

166
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
it's like a really weak arm suppression
 

167
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,350
it's like a really weak arm suppression
because it's not eeko yet um it will

168
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
because it's not eeko yet um it will
 

169
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,589
because it's not eeko yet um it will
become EO as soon as we can but it's not

170
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
become EO as soon as we can but it's not
 

171
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,149
become EO as soon as we can but it's not
quite there yet so that's really the big

172
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
quite there yet so that's really the big
 

173
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,110
quite there yet so that's really the big
difference between showman and yokan and

174
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,120
difference between showman and yokan and
 

175
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,990
difference between showman and yokan and
I think if you let that kind of sit in

176
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,000
I think if you let that kind of sit in
 

177
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,350
I think if you let that kind of sit in
your mind for a minute you'll kind of

178
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:18,360
your mind for a minute you'll kind of
 

179
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,789
your mind for a minute you'll kind of
realize oh there's a lot of cool stuff

180
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:19,799
realize oh there's a lot of cool stuff
 

181
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,070
realize oh there's a lot of cool stuff
in there okay now with that said let's

182
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
in there okay now with that said let's
 

183
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,309
in there okay now with that said let's
real talk real quickly talk about what

184
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
real talk real quickly talk about what
 

185
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,869
real talk real quickly talk about what
yokan is and then next week I'll make

186
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:25,879
yokan is and then next week I'll make
 

187
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,309
yokan is and then next week I'll make
you a whole series of these guys um CU

188
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
you a whole series of these guys um CU
 

189
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,990
you a whole series of these guys um CU
they're fun to look at so um let me have

190
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
they're fun to look at so um let me have
 

191
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,110
they're fun to look at so um let me have
you switch H me for me okay so when Josh

192
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
you switch H me for me okay so when Josh
 

193
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,910
you switch H me for me okay so when Josh
comes in We have basically a couple

194
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
comes in We have basically a couple
 

195
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,390
comes in We have basically a couple
timings of things right so look if I

196
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:39,400
timings of things right so look if I
 

197
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,070
timings of things right so look if I
knew Josh was going to hit me and I was

198
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,080
knew Josh was going to hit me and I was
 

199
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,229
knew Josh was going to hit me and I was
Sin Sin no sin I was I was ahead but I

200
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:43,239
Sin Sin no sin I was I was ahead but I
 

201
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,990
Sin Sin no sin I was I was ahead but I
could I could act before he could act

202
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
could I could act before he could act
 

203
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,670
could I could act before he could act
then I could just enter straight into

204
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
then I could just enter straight into
 

205
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,910
then I could just enter straight into
this boom I could hit him right and so

206
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:48,920
this boom I could hit him right and so
 

207
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,429
this boom I could hit him right and so
we kind of talked about that last week

208
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:50,439
we kind of talked about that last week
 

209
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,350
we kind of talked about that last week
with the what what happens if someone

210
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:52,360
with the what what happens if someone
 

211
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,309
with the what what happens if someone
kind of stops and stutters steps right

212
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
kind of stops and stutters steps right
 

213
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,630
kind of stops and stutters steps right
well you should just attack before they

214
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:55,640
well you should just attack before they
 

215
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,030
well you should just attack before they
can attack because you know attack is

216
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
can attack because you know attack is
 

217
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,750
can attack because you know attack is
imminent and they've cut that distance

218
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:58,760
imminent and they've cut that distance
 

219
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,229
imminent and they've cut that distance
down and they're working into their

220
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
down and they're working into their
 

221
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,069
down and they're working into their
ideal distance and I want to attack them

222
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:02,079
ideal distance and I want to attack them
 

223
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:03,750
ideal distance and I want to attack them
before they get their ideal distance so

224
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
before they get their ideal distance so
 

225
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,910
before they get their ideal distance so
that's what would happen if I'm way

226
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:04,920
that's what would happen if I'm way
 

227
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,509
that's what would happen if I'm way
ahead now if I'm way way behind then

228
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:08,519
ahead now if I'm way way behind then
 

229
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:09,830
ahead now if I'm way way behind then
well if I'm way way behind this will

230
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
well if I'm way way behind this will
 

231
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,869
well if I'm way way behind this will
happen Okay that's way way behind I

232
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:11,879
happen Okay that's way way behind I
 

233
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,309
happen Okay that's way way behind I
didn't even realize there was a strike

234
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:13,319
didn't even realize there was a strike
 

235
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,390
didn't even realize there was a strike
coming and I got hit but one up from

coming and I got hit but one up from
 

237
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,069
coming and I got hit but one up from
that that we can actually work with is

238
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:17,079
that that we can actually work with is
 

239
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,789
that that we can actually work with is
simply this okay which is Udan Kaku and

simply this okay which is Udan Kaku and
 

241

simply this okay which is Udan Kaku and
that's just bringing my arms up now in

242
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
that's just bringing my arms up now in
 

243
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,230
that's just bringing my arms up now in
iido you should be training yourself and

244
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,240
iido you should be training yourself and
 

245
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,670
iido you should be training yourself and
your students all the time when their

246
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:24,680
your students all the time when their
 

247
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,469
your students all the time when their
arms rais your arms raised so when I see

248
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
arms rais your arms raised so when I see
 

249
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,070

his arms go up my arms go up and that

250
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
his arms go up my arms go up and that
 

251
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,950
his arms go up my arms go up and that
means I've already accounted for any arm

252
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:29,960
means I've already accounted for any arm
 

253
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,390
means I've already accounted for any arm
up stuff now if from the arm up position

254
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
up stuff now if from the arm up position
 

255
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,710
up stuff now if from the arm up position
he decides to attack low well he brings

256
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
he decides to attack low well he brings
 

257
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,350
he decides to attack low well he brings
his arms down and I bring my arms down

258
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:36,360
his arms down and I bring my arms down
 

259
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,070
his arms down and I bring my arms down
right so we go up together we come down

260
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
right so we go up together we come down
 

261
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,950
right so we go up together we come down
together and if we keep that my arms are

262
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:39,960
together and if we keep that my arms are
 

263
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,870
together and if we keep that my arms are
always going to be creating suppression

264
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:41,880
always going to be creating suppression
 

265
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,870
always going to be creating suppression
for whatever he comes with okay now

266
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
for whatever he comes with okay now
 

267
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,990
for whatever he comes with okay now
somewhere in the middle of those way way

268
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,000
somewhere in the middle of those way way
 

269
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,230
somewhere in the middle of those way way
ahead and way way behind we have the

270
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,240
ahead and way way behind we have the
 

271
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,790
ahead and way way behind we have the
other options if we're just come a

272
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
other options if we're just come a
 

273
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,990
other options if we're just come a
little closer for me if we're close we

274
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,000
little closer for me if we're close we
 

275
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,590
little closer for me if we're close we
can use the sugii entry and my teacher

276
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
can use the sugii entry and my teacher
 

277
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,350
can use the sugii entry and my teacher
calls this the direct entry right but

278
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
calls this the direct entry right but
 

279
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,029
calls this the direct entry right but
I'm going to sugii off my front step so

280
00:04:59,029 --> 00:04:59,039
I'm going to sugii off my front step so
 

281
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,029
I'm going to sugii off my front step so
as Josh comes in go here boom and I'm

282
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
as Josh comes in go here boom and I'm
 

283
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,430
as Josh comes in go here boom and I'm
hitting at Josh directly right so that

284
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
hitting at Josh directly right so that
 

285
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,510
hitting at Josh directly right so that
really only works well from a closer

286
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
really only works well from a closer
 

287
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,830
really only works well from a closer
position doesn't work well from regular

288
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
position doesn't work well from regular
 

289
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,510
position doesn't work well from regular
my ey because it's so far to go and so

290
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:10,520
my ey because it's so far to go and so
 

291
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,749
my ey because it's so far to go and so
what happens is when we get at regular

292
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
what happens is when we get at regular
 

293
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,749
what happens is when we get at regular
my ey not that I won't stop it but his

294
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
my ey not that I won't stop it but his
 

295
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,270
my ey not that I won't stop it but his
foot will make the full transition

296
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
foot will make the full transition
 

297
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,590
foot will make the full transition
through and this isn't that position

298
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
through and this isn't that position
 

299
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,710
through and this isn't that position
right so this is another position I have

300
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
right so this is another position I have
 

301
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,350
right so this is another position I have
to work with and we can talk about it

302
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,360
to work with and we can talk about it
 

303
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,070
to work with and we can talk about it
but it's not the ideal position so if

304
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
but it's not the ideal position so if
 

305
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,790
but it's not the ideal position so if
we're showing a form this isn't the way

306
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:23,800
we're showing a form this isn't the way
 

307
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,870
we're showing a form this isn't the way
we would do it so from from a closer

308
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:25,880
we would do it so from from a closer
 

309
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,390
we would do it so from from a closer
position I can generally get this off

310
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:27,400
position I can generally get this off
 

311
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,909
position I can generally get this off
before he can step that back foot and

312
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:28,919
before he can step that back foot and
 

313
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,230
before he can step that back foot and
that's going to set up most of the stuff

314
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
that's going to set up most of the stuff
 

315
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,670
that's going to set up most of the stuff
for the forms for that so that's still

316
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:32,680
for the forms for that so that's still
 

317

action okay now a little further away

320
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
action okay now a little further away
 

321
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,830
action okay now a little further away
from that and also um uh a little

322
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:40,840
from that and also um uh a little
 

323
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,150
from that and also um uh a little
further in distance and timing from that

324
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:43,160
further in distance and timing from that
 

325
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,150
further in distance and timing from that
is the aumi AI step so actually let me

326
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,160
is the aumi AI step so actually let me
 

327
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,950

in a lot of IO schools this blo looks

342
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,240
in a lot of IO schools this blo looks
 

343
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,990
in a lot of IO schools this blo looks
like

344
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
like
 

345
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,469

this okay that to me is just about
 

347
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:10,070
this okay that to me is just about
useless right so look and I come in we

348
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
useless right so look and I come in we
 

349
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,710
useless right so look and I come in we
go like this just like that okay so

350
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
go like this just like that okay so
 

351
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,070
go like this just like that okay so
that's I love to show that all the time

352
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,080
that's I love to show that all the time
 

353
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,550
that's I love to show that all the time
um in iido schools there is really not

354
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:17,560
um in iido schools there is really not
 

355
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,270
um in iido schools there is really not
Marshall application to that um I guess

356
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,280
Marshall application to that um I guess
 

357
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,990
Marshall application to that um I guess
he didn't hit me which is cool but

358
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
he didn't hit me which is cool but
 

359
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,270
he didn't hit me which is cool but
there's no reason for me to do that now

360
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,280
there's no reason for me to do that now
 

361
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,309
there's no reason for me to do that now
opposed to that is the way I teach it

362
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
opposed to that is the way I teach it
 

363
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,749
opposed to that is the way I teach it
which is direct step in and circle at

364
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:28,759
which is direct step in and circle at
 

365
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,950
which is direct step in and circle at
the end now direct step in what happens

366
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
the end now direct step in what happens
 

367
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,309
the end now direct step in what happens
is I get and just go Um to the beginning

368
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:33,319
is I get and just go Um to the beginning
 

369
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:36,230
is I get and just go Um to the beginning
of the action then stop so here I've

370
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
of the action then stop so here I've
 

371
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,950
of the action then stop so here I've
stepped where Josh is weak and I'm

372
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:37,960
stepped where Josh is weak and I'm
 

373
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,670
stepped where Josh is weak and I'm
applying Force directly to Josh so I'm

374
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
applying Force directly to Josh so I'm
 

375
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,270
applying Force directly to Josh so I'm
moving him away at the same time I'm

376
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
moving him away at the same time I'm
 

377
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,390
moving him away at the same time I'm
covering my head so if anything comes in

378
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:43,400
covering my head so if anything comes in
 

379
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,990
covering my head so if anything comes in
I I defend that so when he comes in I go

380
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
I I defend that so when he comes in I go
 

381
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,029
I I defend that so when he comes in I go
right at him and then I turn at an angle

382
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:48,039
right at him and then I turn at an angle
 

383
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,790
right at him and then I turn at an angle
at the end so I hit the perfect angle to

384
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:49,800
at the end so I hit the perfect angle to
 

385
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,309
at the end so I hit the perfect angle to
knock him off of me so instead of

386
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:51,319
knock him off of me so instead of
 

387
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,790
knock him off of me so instead of
dancing around in a circle which is

388
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:53,800
dancing around in a circle which is
 

389
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,629
dancing around in a circle which is
really useless Josh gets nothing for

390
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:55,639
really useless Josh gets nothing for
 

391
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,909
really useless Josh gets nothing for
that right I want to be attacking in

392
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
that right I want to be attacking in
 

393
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,189
that right I want to be attacking in
that defense right so that's what I'm

394
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
that defense right so that's what I'm
 

395
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,189
that defense right so that's what I'm
looking for changing the line with that

396
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
looking for changing the line with that
 

397
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,390
looking for changing the line with that
so those are the basic um yokan defenses

398
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
so those are the basic um yokan defenses
 

399
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,070
so those are the basic um yokan defenses
you're going to see in iido forms you're

400
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
you're going to see in iido forms you're
 

401
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,869
you're going to see in iido forms you're
going to see direct entry you're going

402
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:07,879
going to see direct entry you're going
 

403
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,189
going to see direct entry you're going
to see a receptive or yashi entry a

404
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
to see a receptive or yashi entry a
 

405
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,270
to see a receptive or yashi entry a
sugii entry or you're going to see just

406
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
sugii entry or you're going to see just
 

407
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,390
sugii entry or you're going to see just
UD sankaku arms up and some variation of

408
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:15,400
UD sankaku arms up and some variation of
 

409
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,350
UD sankaku arms up and some variation of
udis sanaku depending on the timing

410
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
udis sanaku depending on the timing
 

411
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,350
udis sanaku depending on the timing
other than that you're either going to

412
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,360
other than that you're either going to
 

413
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,550
other than that you're either going to
hit them before they hit or they're

414
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:19,560
hit them before they hit or they're
 

415
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,710
hit them before they hit or they're
going to hit you before you can do

416
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
going to hit you before you can do
 

417
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,909
going to hit you before you can do
anything so those are all the timings of

418
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:22,919
anything so those are all the timings of
 

419
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,790
anything so those are all the timings of
that okay now from those there's tons of

420
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
that okay now from those there's tons of
 

421
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,749
that okay now from those there's tons of
other stuff we're going to get in that

422
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
other stuff we're going to get in that
 

423
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,950
other stuff we're going to get in that
the next video right so if we're in this

424
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:27,960
the next video right so if we're in this
 

425
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,510
the next video right so if we're in this
uh yokan position remember like I said

426
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
uh yokan position remember like I said
 

427
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,710
uh yokan position remember like I said
said in the beginning anytime I'm inside

428
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:31,720
said in the beginning anytime I'm inside
 

429
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,749
said in the beginning anytime I'm inside
that's a that's a yokan position so I

430
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
that's a that's a yokan position so I
 

431
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,869
that's a that's a yokan position so I
can get high pass or called ukos

432
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:35,879
can get high pass or called ukos
 

433
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,790
can get high pass or called ukos
sometimes or low pass gate on barai

434
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:37,800
sometimes or low pass gate on barai
 

435
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,029
sometimes or low pass gate on barai
right so um I can get either of those

436
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:40,039
right so um I can get either of those
 

437
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,670
right so um I can get either of those
off of that and those will pretty much

438
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
off of that and those will pretty much
 

439
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,990
off of that and those will pretty much
make up all the

440
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,000
make up all the
 

441
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,189
make up all the
forms yeah pretty much make up all the

442
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
forms yeah pretty much make up all the
 

443
