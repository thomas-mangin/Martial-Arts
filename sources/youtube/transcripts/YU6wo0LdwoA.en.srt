1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:04,990

foreign

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:05,000

 

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,330

watch so already here in his

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:08,340
watch so already here in his
 

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,669
watch so already here in his
prescription he's gonna give me young

6
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:10,679
prescription he's gonna give me young
 

7
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,190
prescription he's gonna give me young
energy so I'm gonna internalize the

8
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
energy so I'm gonna internalize the
 

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,350
energy so I'm gonna internalize the
young energy and then I'm gonna move

10
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360
young energy and then I'm gonna move
 

11
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,710
young energy and then I'm gonna move
that young energy

12
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:21,720

 

13
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,009

so very simple but the spiral is already

14
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:25,019
so very simple but the spiral is already
 

15
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,470
so very simple but the spiral is already
there the spiral is already moving

16
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:27,480
there the spiral is already moving
 

17
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,450
there the spiral is already moving
around

18
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:32,460

 

19
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,569

let's just start

20
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:35,579

 

21
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,850

pull two steps like but you want the

22
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:37,860
pull two steps like but you want the
 

23
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,869
pull two steps like but you want the
turn Okay uh so I move my Center the

24
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:41,879
turn Okay uh so I move my Center the
 

25
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,709
turn Okay uh so I move my Center the
sand goes here this hand goes here

26
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:45,719
sand goes here this hand goes here
 

27
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,889
sand goes here this hand goes here
the sand is moving from this way starts

28
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:48,899
the sand is moving from this way starts
 

29
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,470
the sand is moving from this way starts
to tilt and this hand is accentuating

30
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:51,480
to tilt and this hand is accentuating
 

31
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,990
to tilt and this hand is accentuating
the tilt you see that tilt in his body

32
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
the tilt you see that tilt in his body
 

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:11,630
the tilt you see that tilt in his body
okay so that's what I moved internally

34
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:11,640

 

35
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:30,249

today let's try

36
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:30,259

 

37
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:34,010

okay so uh

38
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,020
okay so uh
 

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,249
okay so uh
on this hand you always want that tilt

40
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:37,259
on this hand you always want that tilt
 

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,550
on this hand you always want that tilt
so let's just look at the hammer okay

42
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:39,560
so let's just look at the hammer okay
 

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,149
so let's just look at the hammer okay
I'm gonna make his uh Center go uh in

44
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
I'm gonna make his uh Center go uh in
 

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,069
I'm gonna make his uh Center go uh in
down and get that elbow to go this way

46
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:49,079
down and get that elbow to go this way
 

47
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,350
down and get that elbow to go this way
and this hand is going to do the same

48
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
and this hand is going to do the same
 

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,530
and this hand is going to do the same
thing this way it does the same thing

50
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:54,540
thing this way it does the same thing
 

51
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,130
thing this way it does the same thing
now both hands are tilting both hands

52
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:58,140
now both hands are tilting both hands
 

53
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,630
now both hands are tilting both hands
are children

54
00:01:59,630 --> 00:01:59,640
are children
 

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,170
are children
don't just open

57
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,350

so in other words uh

58
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,360
so in other words uh
 

59
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,229
so in other words uh
you can't come in I'm controlling when
