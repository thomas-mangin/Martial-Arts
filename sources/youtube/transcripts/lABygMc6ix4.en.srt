that and if you pay attention we
 

778
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,230
that and if you pay attention we
actually have a division of UK because

00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:25,240
actually have a division of UK because
 

780
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,470
actually have a division of UK because
some of us can make that jump and some

right and then if you pay attention when
 

788
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,390
right and then if you pay attention when
we do the x

789
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
we do the x
 

790
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,789
we do the x

00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:46,559
the inside hand of the Contracting
 

796
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,270
the inside hand of the Contracting
Center back break P you see and we don't

797
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280
Center back break P you see and we don't
 

798
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,630
Center back break P you see and we don't
have any steps from the Contracting

799
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:52,640
have any steps from the Contracting
 

800
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,950
have any steps from the Contracting
Center back bre fall to the x pattern

801
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:55,960
Center back bre fall to the x pattern
 

802
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,950
Center back bre fall to the x pattern
inner hand you just have to get there

803
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960
inner hand you just have to get there
 

804
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,310
inner hand you just have to get there
you see and so it makes sense that

805
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:01,320
you see and so it makes sense that
 

806
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,470
