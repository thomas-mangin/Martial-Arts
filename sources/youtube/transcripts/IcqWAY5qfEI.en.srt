1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,269

so I said I said in the first film about

2
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:05,279
so I said I said in the first film about
 

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,289
so I said I said in the first film about
the

4
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:06,299
the
 

5
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,570
the
splitting of the two directions of the

6
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:08,580
splitting of the two directions of the
 

7
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,150
splitting of the two directions of the
hips the hips going this way the can

8
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:11,160
hips the hips going this way the can
 

9
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,650
hips the hips going this way the can
going that way

10
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:12,660
going that way
 

11
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,210
going that way
so I'd like to show you from some angles

12
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:17,220

 

13
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,029

you want mind to embodied to work

14
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:20,039
you want mind to embodied to work
 

15
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,929
you want mind to embodied to work
together so the the weapon is just a

16
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:23,939
together so the the weapon is just a
 

17
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,630
together so the the weapon is just a
training aid for you to learn better

18
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
training aid for you to learn better
 

19
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,769
training aid for you to learn better
timing and to improve your targets

20
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:30,779
timing and to improve your targets
 

21
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,770
timing and to improve your targets
all right it's not look it's a piece of

00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:33,780
all right it's not look it's a piece of
 

23
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,250
all right it's not look it's a piece of
wood it's not a sword you can

24
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:37,260
wood it's not a sword you can
 

25
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,549
wood it's not a sword you can
class at a sword if you wish for ethical

26
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
class at a sword if you wish for ethical
 

27
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,170
class at a sword if you wish for ethical
reasons it's it's a training aid okay so

28
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,180
reasons it's it's a training aid okay so
 

29
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,389
reasons it's it's a training aid okay so
you've got the fingers in you've got the

30
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:47,399
you've got the fingers in you've got the
 

31
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,369
you've got the fingers in you've got the
Gap in between your hands

32
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:49,379
Gap in between your hands
 

33
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,130
Gap in between your hands
and what you can do is you can just

34
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:52,140
and what you can do is you can just
 

35
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,770
and what you can do is you can just
start off

36
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:57,780

 

37
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,910

try to get the first sliding

38
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
try to get the first sliding
 

39
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:18,649
try to get the first sliding
the same time

40
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:18,659

 

41
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,109

back and forth back and forth

42
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
back and forth back and forth
 

43
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,910
back and forth back and forth
notice my hips

44
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
notice my hips
 

45
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,090
notice my hips
my hair said I'm turning as I said

46
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:29,100
my hair said I'm turning as I said
 

47
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,090
my hair said I'm turning as I said
earlier they're not twisting they're not

48
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:32,100
earlier they're not twisting they're not
 

49
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,690
earlier they're not twisting they're not
turning what I've got to get used to is

50
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:35,700
turning what I've got to get used to is
 

51
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,230
turning what I've got to get used to is
as this last part comes down and the

52
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:39,240
as this last part comes down and the
 

53
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,530
as this last part comes down and the
foot I've got the heel up I'm gonna

54
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:42,540
foot I've got the heel up I'm gonna
 

55
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:49,370
foot I've got the heel up I'm gonna
check the power of this

56
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:49,380

 

57
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,649

so I'm trying to first get the timing

58
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:51,659
so I'm trying to first get the timing
 

59
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,190
so I'm trying to first get the timing
with the hands and the sword okay and

60
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
with the hands and the sword okay and
 

61
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,270
with the hands and the sword okay and
then it's installed

62
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:58,280

 

63
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,130

and installed feet and hands feet and

64
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,140
and installed feet and hands feet and
 

65
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,949
and installed feet and hands feet and
sword feet and sword for your hands so

66
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
sword feet and sword for your hands so
 

67
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,110
sword feet and sword for your hands so
they'd hand saw

68
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
they'd hand saw
 

69
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,130
they'd hand saw
and so on

70
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,140
and so on
 

71
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,070
and so on
and build up that that swinging of the

72
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
and build up that that swinging of the
 

73
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,630
and build up that that swinging of the
king

74
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:17,640
king
 

75
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,490
king
okay

76
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:19,500
okay
 

77
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,840
okay
so we'll get to them

78
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:22,850
so we'll get to them
 

79
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:28,910
so we'll get to them

you and those around you if you had to
use it so this is what I've progressed

146
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:25,560
use it so this is what I've progressed
 

147
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,189
use it so this is what I've progressed
over the many many years to do this

148
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:28,199
over the many many years to do this
 

149
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,670
over the many many years to do this
footwork and get a timing so when the

150
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
footwork and get a timing so when the
 

151
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,390
footwork and get a timing so when the
foot the hands to the end point so does

152
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:35,400
foot the hands to the end point so does
 

153
