these thrusts tend to be most common and
 

57
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,630

typically a high thrust with both thumbs

62
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
typically a high thrust with both thumbs
 

63
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,830
typically a high thrust with both thumbs
pointing away from the thrusting end

64
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
pointing away from the thrusting end
 

65
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,750
pointing away from the thrusting end
this thrust can also be done behind and

66
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
this thrust can also be done behind and
 

67
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,429
this thrust can also be done behind and
transition easily into the first thrust

the third type is practice where both

thumbs are pointing inwards

thumbs are pointing inwards
 

75
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,510
thumbs are pointing inwards
due to the symmetry of the grip this

76
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
due to the symmetry of the grip this
 

77
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,429
due to the symmetry of the grip this
thrust transitions easily from side to

thrust transitions easily from side to
 

79
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,429
thrust transitions easily from side to
side and front to back

80
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
side and front to back
 

81
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,109

it is however one of the least used to

00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
it is however one of the least used to
 

83
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:21,910
it is however one of the least used to

84
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
us
 

85
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,310
us
and that's probably down to less options

86
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
and that's probably down to less options
 

87
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,390
and that's probably down to less options
to transition into all the movements

88
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
to transition into all the movements
 

89
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,149
to transition into all the movements
so this leads us to the fourth potential

90
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
so this leads us to the fourth potential
 

91
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,910
so this leads us to the fourth potential

pointing outwards now i know some of you

106
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
pointing outwards now i know some of you
 

107
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,590

will be thinking that looks awkward how

108
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
will be thinking that looks awkward how

can you possibly thrust from there well

110
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
can you possibly thrust from there well
 

111
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,510
can you possibly thrust from there well
if you take the front hand

112
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
if you take the front hand
 

113
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,830
if you take the front hand
and utilize it in the same sort of way

114
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
and utilize it in the same sort of way
 

115
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,670
and utilize it in the same sort of way
as the first bus and you take the

116
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
as the first bus and you take the
 

117
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,749
as the first bus and you take the
backhand and use it in the same sort of

118
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
backhand and use it in the same sort of
 

119
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,389

way as the second thrust

120

you end up

122
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
you end up
 

123
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,109
you end up
with a thrust

124
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
with a thrust
 

125
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,709
with a thrust
that could potentially work

126
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719

until then i want to hear your thoughts
 

137
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,229
until then i want to hear your thoughts
do you think this has got any potential

138
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
do you think this has got any potential
 

139
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,910
do you think this has got any potential
and is there any specific reasons why it

140
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
and is there any specific reasons why it
 

141
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,150
and is there any specific reasons why it
shouldn't be practiced

142
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
shouldn't be practiced
 

143
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,910
shouldn't be practiced
let me know in the comments

144
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
let me know in the comments
 

145
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,589
let me know in the comments
anyway until then
