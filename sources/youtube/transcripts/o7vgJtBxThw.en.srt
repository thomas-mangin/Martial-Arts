ground back bo
 

19
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,150
ground back bo
bo boom boom think about

20
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
bo boom boom think about
 

21
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,549
bo boom boom think about
your this is more angles as opposed to

22
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
your this is more angles as opposed to
 

23
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,549
your this is more angles as opposed to
hip rotation shoulder strength okay it's

24
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:35,559
hip rotation shoulder strength okay it's
 

25
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,950
hip rotation shoulder strength okay it's
more angles boom right up this middle

26
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
more angles boom right up this middle
 

27
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,670
more angles boom right up this middle
boom right through this side but your

28
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:42,680
boom right through this side but your
 

29
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:55,750
boom right through this side but your
your engine is still on the

00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760

 

31
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,910

ground okay let's

32
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920
ground okay let's
 

33
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,549
ground okay let's
try all right so when I'm holding the

to read it okay so you can see yeah I'm
fighting uh Southpaw here for me but it

42
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
fighting uh Southpaw here for me but it
 

43
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,710

boom get these angles 1 2

158
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000

 

159
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,150

3om okay let's

160
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160

 

161
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,270

go so
