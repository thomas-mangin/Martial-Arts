1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,669

so the question is why did you could get

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:03,679
so the question is why did you could get
 

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:04,630
so the question is why did you could get
up

4
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:04,640
up
 

5
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,470
up
and you mean and

6
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
and you mean and
 

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,589
and you mean and
so far we're at

8
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599

 

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,070

as i come around

10
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080

 

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,349

i don't i don't want him to do

12
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359
i don't i don't want him to do

a double leg or a single leg takedown go

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,310

the answer is not that anybody that goes

18
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
the answer is not that anybody that goes
 

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,709
the answer is not that anybody that goes
down

20
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719

21
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,430

tries to get up says that would not be

22
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440

24
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399

that's not good jiu jitsu i have

26
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
that's not good jiu jitsu i have
 

27
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,069
that's not good jiu jitsu i have

28
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
pressure here
 

29
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,630
pressure here
he should yield with that pressure and

30
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
he should yield with that pressure and
 

31
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,389
he should yield with that pressure and
go into newaza

32
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399
go into newaza
 

33
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,750
go into newaza
okay

34
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760

 

35
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,750

so so far in our reasoning we're like

36
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
so so far in our reasoning we're like
 

37
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,430
so so far in our reasoning we're like
well if i'm in a place where he does not

38
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
well if i'm in a place where he does not
 

39
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,510
well if i'm in a place where he does not
take me down

40
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520

 

41
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,549

then he has to go to plan b and can plan

42
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
then he has to go to plan b and can plan
 

43
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,270
then he has to go to plan b and can plan
b

44
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
b
 

45
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,870
b
b he sees height

46
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
b he sees height
 

47
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,990
b he sees height
okay so if i

48
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
okay so if i
 

49
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,350
okay so if i
stay in front of him at any point

50
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
stay in front of him at any point
 

51
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,230

the double leg single leg is going to be

52
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
the double leg single leg is going to be
 

53
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,190
the double leg single leg is going to be
viable

54
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200

 

55
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,950

so i have to stay in the back

56
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
so i have to stay in the back
 

57
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,190
so i have to stay in the back
so i'm in the back but if i stay here

58
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
so i'm in the back but if i stay here
 

59
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,990
so i'm in the back but if i stay here
he can go tight on the circle and get me

60
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
he can go tight on the circle and get me
 

61
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,390
he can go tight on the circle and get me
again

62
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
again
 

63
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,830
again
so staying in the back must be dynamic

64
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
so staying in the back must be dynamic
 

65
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,550
so staying in the back must be dynamic

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680

go he's going to get a tighter circle

72
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240

73
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,190

so i'll i'll inverse it

so i'll i'll inverse it
 

77
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:07,310

he keeps moving around forward

247
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,190

tactically inferior how do i do that
 

255
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,110

261
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,990

that's going to give you the rear naked

262
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
that's going to give you the rear naked
 

263
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,470
that's going to give you the rear naked

okay

296
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519

 

297
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,870

so he is trying to get his head

298
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
so he is trying to get his head
 

299
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,430
so he is trying to get his head
up and his hips away from me

up and his hips away from me
 

301
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,350
up and his hips away from me
so i lose the back mount

302
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360

 

303
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,750

but that means i have to expose that

304
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
but that means i have to expose that
 

305
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,870
but that means i have to expose that
then he realizes get his head up and get

306
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
then he realizes get his head up and get
 

307
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,750
then he realizes get his head up and get
his hips

308
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
his hips
 

309
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,470
his hips
out so i don't get hooks and all that

310
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480

 

311
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,790

and it's that energy that i use

312
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800

 

313
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,630

that we always do

314
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640

 

315
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,990

so i make his back bone a little cool

316
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
so i make his back bone a little cool
 

317
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:58,630
so i make his back bone a little cool
and then he

318
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640

 

319
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,590

321
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,310

it's as he's as he's trying to get his

322
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
it's as he's as he's trying to get his
 

323
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,870
it's as he's as he's trying to get his
hips underneath him and his head up

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
hips underneath him and his head up
 

325
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,710
hips underneath him and his head up

he gets rid of the backwards push or i

332
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
he gets rid of the backwards push or i
 

333
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:53,030

i don't feel any of this force because

348
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:16,639
i don't feel any of this force because
 

349
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,350

go back if i'm here
 

353
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,069
go back if i'm here
and he pushes push then i'll feel his

354

with zero pressure

376
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
with zero pressure
 

377
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,949
with zero pressure
do you see

378
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959

 

379
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,389

which is why the entry is so

380
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
which is why the entry is so
 

381
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:07,990
which is why the entry is so
easy the entry is easy

382
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000

 

383
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,670

if he was leaning on me

so you have to be at zero pressure when

388
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
so you have to be at zero pressure when
 

389
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,350
so you have to be at zero pressure when
you do the tilt

390
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
you do the tilt
