got to do it
so let's do it look again

58
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
so let's do it look again
 

59
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,830
so let's do it look again
so i'm looking at my

60
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,840
so i'm looking at my
 

61
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,950
so i'm looking at my
hand when it allows me to move in

62
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
hand when it allows me to move in
 

63
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,870

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,910
i can change
techniques

74
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920

 

75
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,710

so there's lots of variants

76
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
so there's lots of variants
 

77
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,429
so there's lots of variants
to this right so let's try again but

78
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
to this right so let's try again but
 

79
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,030
to this right so let's try again but
your hand is sometimes going on the back

80
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
your hand is sometimes going on the back
 

81
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,630
your hand is sometimes going on the back
of the head and then you're changing it

82
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
of the head and then you're changing it
 

83
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:50,230
of the head and then you're changing it
and you haven't got time it's got to be

84
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240

 

85
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,069

that's when it becomes beautiful i'm

86
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
that's when it becomes beautiful i'm
 

87
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,950
that's when it becomes beautiful i'm
going to get up i'm still locking down

i'm still locking the arm
 

91
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,789
i'm still locking the arm
so there's a whole package of what this

92
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
so there's a whole package of what this
 

93
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,429
so there's a whole package of what this
can do rather than what just these can

94
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
can do rather than what just these can
 

95
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,439
can do rather than what just these can
do
