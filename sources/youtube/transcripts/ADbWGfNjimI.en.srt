00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,050

now obviously there is some sort of

00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:57,060
now obviously there is some sort of
 

9
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:17,230
now obviously there is some sort of
tissue connection from this point

00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:17,240

 

11
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:24,650

so I threw the touch in tension able to

12
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:24,660
so I threw the touch in tension able to
 

13
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,170
so I threw the touch in tension able to

so I can't just aim it in the hallway
 

19
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,570
so I can't just aim it in the hallway
and I don't need a super grip to do it

20
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:37,580
and I don't need a super grip to do it
 

21

you're now finding it from here do you
 

83
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:06,200
you're now finding it from here do you
see this this way so it's just your

area of your body got it okay let's

90
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:17,700
area of your body got it okay let's
 

91
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,480
area of your body got it okay let's
let's bring that in I'm not going to go

92
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:20,490
let's bring that in I'm not going to go
 

93
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,180
let's bring that in I'm not going to go
around this

94
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,190
around this
 

95
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,840
around this
I'm going to

96
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:25,850

 

97
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,980

I'm moving this not not a figurative

thing I have to Center
 

101
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,540
thing I have to Center
okay now the mechanical assumption is

102
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:41,550
okay now the mechanical assumption is
 

103
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,890
okay now the mechanical assumption is
that their energy is going to go from me

104
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:45,900
that their energy is going to go from me
 

105
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,730
that their energy is going to go from me
and into his Center which now on this

106
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:49,740
and into his Center which now on this
 

107
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,200
and into his Center which now on this
place is sector

108
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,210
place is sector
 

109
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,340
place is sector
I will displace him if there's any

110
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,350
I will displace him if there's any
 

111
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,970
I will displace him if there's any
leakage of that energy they'll be less

112
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:57,980
leakage of that energy they'll be less
 

113
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,000
leakage of that energy they'll be less
displacement of the center okay so you

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,010
displacement of the center okay so you
 

115
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,270
displacement of the center okay so you
can think of it as a fire hose there the

116
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
can think of it as a fire hose there the
 

117
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,980
can think of it as a fire hose there the
hose is very full of pressure and it's

118
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:09,990
hose is very full of pressure and it's
 

119
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,380
hose is very full of pressure and it's
all going in the direction I wanted to

120
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:12,390
all going in the direction I wanted to
 

121
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,860
all going in the direction I wanted to
go if you start poking holes in that

122
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:15,870
go if you start poking holes in that
 

123
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,130
go if you start poking holes in that
hose it doesn't come out very powerful

124
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,140
hose it doesn't come out very powerful
 

125
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,650
hose it doesn't come out very powerful
at the other end that's very much like

126
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:24,660
at the other end that's very much like
 

127
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,319
at the other end that's very much like
in this

128
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:26,329
in this
 

129
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:30,559
in this
energy is being absorbed because I can't

130
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:30,569
energy is being absorbed because I can't
 

131
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:35,629
energy is being absorbed because I can't
hold that angle it's made to weep so I

132
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:35,639
hold that angle it's made to weep so I
 

133
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,419
hold that angle it's made to weep so I
go to here and I go to push it and it's

134
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:38,429
go to here and I go to push it and it's
 

135
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:41,569
go to here and I go to push it and it's
letting energy go out because my elbow

136
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:41,579
letting energy go out because my elbow
 

137
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,909
letting energy go out because my elbow
outside of my shoulder I start fine here

138
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:46,919
outside of my shoulder I start fine here
 

139
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,479
outside of my shoulder I start fine here
and I go like this and energy can't go

140
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:50,489
and I go like this and energy can't go
 

141
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:56,209
and I go like this and energy can't go
up because it's so weak going down if

142
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:56,219
up because it's so weak going down if
 

143
00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:01,639
up because it's so weak going down if
you look at these two pylons that's not

144
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:01,649
you look at these two pylons that's not
 

145
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:04,429
you look at these two pylons that's not
the you can wear spiral the inverse

00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:04,439
the you can wear spiral the inverse
 

147
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:09,499
the you can wear spiral the inverse
spiral is doing that shape so this can't

148
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:09,509
spiral is doing that shape so this can't
 

149
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:20,059

that
 

153
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,100
that
even if I was strong enough this is not

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,110
even if I was strong enough this is not
 

155
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,020
even if I was strong enough this is not
the pattern that's going to get me and

156
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,030
the pattern that's going to get me and
 

157
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,830
the pattern that's going to get me and
tactically sound even if I can

tactically sound even if I can
 

159
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,780
tactically sound even if I can
manipulate enough this is not tactically

160
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:35,790
manipulate enough this is not tactically
 

161
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,790
manipulate enough this is not tactically

00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:30,960
dichotomy be I'm I am aggressive and
 

529
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,710
dichotomy be I'm I am aggressive and
present or I'm timid and yielding got it

so yielding is not retreating

538
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:56,620
