00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:15,480
and uh he's inside my shoulder well that
 

13
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,170
and uh he's inside my shoulder well that
means my arm is outside my shoulder okay

14
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,180
means my arm is outside my shoulder okay
 

15
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,109
means my arm is outside my shoulder okay
and then he doesn't have a joint here on

and then he doesn't have a joint here on
 

17
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,750
and then he doesn't have a joint here on
the outside

okay
 

21
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,009
okay
in fact this is where I would boom I

22
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:28,019
in fact this is where I would boom I
 

23
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,230
in fact this is where I would boom I
might try for a break or something

24
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
might try for a break or something
 

25
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,350
might try for a break or something
so coming here on the outside and trying

26
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
so coming here on the outside and trying
 

27
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,049
so coming here on the outside and trying
to bend his arm is not going to happen

28
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:36,059
to bend his arm is not going to happen
 

29
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,470
to bend his arm is not going to happen
and even if you pay attention

30
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
and even if you pay attention
 

31
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,750
and even if you pay attention
Okay if you pay attention this joint is

32
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
Okay if you pay attention this joint is
 

33
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,450
Okay if you pay attention this joint is
not exactly

34
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:43,460
not exactly
 

35
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,330
not exactly
uh totally on on the 90 on the outside

36
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:47,340
uh totally on on the 90 on the outside
 

37
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,910
uh totally on on the 90 on the outside
it's kind of diagonally down do you see

38
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
it's kind of diagonally down do you see
 

39
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,250
it's kind of diagonally down do you see
that which means there's really no hinge

40
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:52,260
that which means there's really no hinge
 

41
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,529
that which means there's really no hinge
and it hurts really hard there's really

42
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:54,539
and it hurts really hard there's really
 

43
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,049
and it hurts really hard there's really
no hinge there either

44
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:57,059
no hinge there either
 

45
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,389
no hinge there either
see I don't know if you could pull this

46
00:00:59,389 --> 00:00:59,399
see I don't know if you could pull this
 

47
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,410
see I don't know if you could pull this
up

48
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:00,420
up
 

49
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,569
up
here's here's the fold of his elbow

50
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:02,579
here's here's the fold of his elbow
 

51
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,709
here's here's the fold of his elbow
right there

52
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:03,719
right there
 

53
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,810
right there
there's no hinge here

54
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:05,820
there's no hinge here
 

55
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,609
there's no hinge here
so when my arm comes from the outside

56
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:07,619
so when my arm comes from the outside
 

57
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,770
so when my arm comes from the outside
there's not there's no way I can bend

58
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:09,780
there's not there's no way I can bend
 

59
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,789
there's not there's no way I can bend
that arm

60
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
that arm
 

61
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,630
that arm
okay usually what happens is

62
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:17,640

 

63
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,670

so uh

64
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
so uh
 

65
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,090
so uh
I know I have to move so I have to move

66
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,100
I know I have to move so I have to move
 

67
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,969
I know I have to move so I have to move
just like always you see and that's that

68
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:25,979
just like always you see and that's that
 

69
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,109
just like always you see and that's that
void that is your chance to uh reconcile

70
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:30,119
void that is your chance to uh reconcile
 

71
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,870
void that is your chance to uh reconcile
your fears that you'll keep your spinal

72
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
your fears that you'll keep your spinal
 

73
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,950
your fears that you'll keep your spinal
displacing okay so I have to move so

74
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
displacing okay so I have to move so
 

75
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,090
displacing okay so I have to move so
that I'm at his uh we call that zero

76
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,100
that I'm at his uh we call that zero
 

77
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,390
that I'm at his uh we call that zero
pressure right he said he he he's not

78
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:44,400
pressure right he said he he he's not
 

79
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,569
pressure right he said he he he's not
I'm right at the edge you get it so for

80
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:47,579
I'm right at the edge you get it so for
 

81
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,530
I'm right at the edge you get it so for
example if I'm in here he's still got

82
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:51,540
example if I'm in here he's still got
 

83
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,670
example if I'm in here he's still got
some

84
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:52,680
some
 

85
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,030
some
if I'm all outside of it then it doesn't

86
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,040
if I'm all outside of it then it doesn't
 

87
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,069
if I'm all outside of it then it doesn't
work you have to be at a zero question

88
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
work you have to be at a zero question
 

89
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,490
work you have to be at a zero question
okay so that's there and what I'm going

90
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:01,500
okay so that's there and what I'm going
 

91
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,130

so
 

115
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,770
so
find that tension and look how I maybe

116
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:36,780
find that tension and look how I maybe
 

117
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,190
find that tension and look how I maybe
have to go to the inside let me see

118
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,200
have to go to the inside let me see
 

119
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,770
have to go to the inside let me see
maybe I have to go to the inside and

120
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:42,780
maybe I have to go to the inside and
 

121
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,309
maybe I have to go to the inside and
then I'm on I'm on where the joint is to
