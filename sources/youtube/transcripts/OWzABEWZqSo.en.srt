1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,750

okay uh so in the gu

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:03,760
okay uh so in the gu
 

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,510
okay uh so in the gu
you're you're coming and you're trying

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:05,520
you're you're coming and you're trying
 

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,869
you're you're coming and you're trying
to do the uh

6
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:06,879
to do the uh
 

7
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,509
to do the uh
goku nugget but when the person is

8
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
goku nugget but when the person is
 

9
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,790
goku nugget but when the person is
countering you

10
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
countering you
 

11
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,310
countering you
and you you lose you fail okay or

12
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
and you you lose you fail okay or
 

13
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,029
and you you lose you fail okay or
when we have the two attackers and

14
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
when we have the two attackers and
 

15
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,109
when we have the two attackers and
you're over here and you're trying to

16
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
you're over here and you're trying to
 

17
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,230
you're over here and you're trying to
muscle them you get pinned

18
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,240
muscle them you get pinned
 

19
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,310
muscle them you get pinned
and when you get pinned you get delayed

20
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320
and when you get pinned you get delayed
 

21
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,509
and when you get pinned you get delayed
and the second attacker catches you

22
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
and the second attacker catches you
 

23
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,830
and the second attacker catches you
okay so we're going to go into that

24
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:29,840
okay so we're going to go into that
 

25
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,029
okay so we're going to go into that
technique a little bit

26
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
technique a little bit
 

27
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,950
technique a little bit
and so let's just look at cokiehole

28
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960

 

29
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,150

and uh what's actually happening okay

30
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
and uh what's actually happening okay
 

31
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,869
and uh what's actually happening okay
so if he if i'm here

32
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
so if he if i'm here
 

33
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,310
so if he if i'm here
and i leverage him up

34
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
and i leverage him up
 

35
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,389
and i leverage him up
and then try to throw him

36
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399

 

37
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,830

we do that technique like this this is

38
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
we do that technique like this this is
 

39
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,110
we do that technique like this this is
now i have been pinned

40
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
now i have been pinned
 

41
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,030
now i have been pinned
second guy is going to catch me

42
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040

 

43
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,429

what we want to do instead is not have

44
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
what we want to do instead is not have
 

45
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,149
what we want to do instead is not have
two young

46
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
two young
 

47
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,990
two young
arms but one yin

48
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
arms but one yin
 

49
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,749
arms but one yin
arm okay

50
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759

 

51
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,870

so i keep his energy going on one side

52
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
so i keep his energy going on one side
 

53
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,109
so i keep his energy going on one side
that's what starts to tilt

54
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119

 

55
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,230

if you look here he's just and

56
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
if you look here he's just and
 

57
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,990
if you look here he's just and
so a lot of times when they're allowed

58
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
so a lot of times when they're allowed
 

59
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,270
so a lot of times when they're allowed
to counter

60
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
to counter
 

61
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,749
to counter
because his posture is not compromised

62
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
because his posture is not compromised
 

63
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,109
because his posture is not compromised
and he counters he can

64
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
and he counters he can
 

65
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,830
and he counters he can
he can do it especially when he lets go

66
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
he can do it especially when he lets go
 

67
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,190
he can do it especially when he lets go
double leg

68
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
double leg
 

69
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,950
double leg
oh then i'm in trouble

70
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960

 

71
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,469

so the best thing is just do jiu jitsu

72
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479
so the best thing is just do jiu jitsu
 

73
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,109
so the best thing is just do jiu jitsu
don't contest let the energy go by

74
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119

 

75
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,590

and you'll see one shoulder straight

76
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
and you'll see one shoulder straight
 

77
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,429
and you'll see one shoulder straight
places and he's already going into the

78
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
places and he's already going into the
 

79
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,990
places and he's already going into the
front position

80
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
front position
 

81
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,109
front position
but i

82
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
but i
 

83
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,670
but i
am not just gonna let let him swing out

84
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
am not just gonna let let him swing out
 

85
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,310
am not just gonna let let him swing out
of the way

86
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
of the way
 

87
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,590
of the way
so i'll show you what i mean okay uh

88
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
so i'll show you what i mean okay uh
 

89
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,710
so i'll show you what i mean okay uh
you can let go and he's not

90
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
you can let go and he's not
 

91
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,390
you can let go and he's not
coming forward it doesn't matter

92
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
coming forward it doesn't matter
 

93
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,750
coming forward it doesn't matter
he i have the adhesion okay so

94
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
he i have the adhesion okay so
 

95
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,869
he i have the adhesion okay so
it's not a passive i'm here and i get

96
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
it's not a passive i'm here and i get
 

97
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,390
it's not a passive i'm here and i get
out of the way you see

98
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
out of the way you see
 

99
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,430
out of the way you see
because he has control of his feet where

100
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
because he has control of his feet where
 

101
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,190
because he has control of his feet where
he steps

102
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
he steps
 

103
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,510
he steps
only the choreography goes ahead and

104
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
only the choreography goes ahead and
 

105
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,309
only the choreography goes ahead and
checks himself

106
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
checks himself
 

107
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,869
checks himself
but if i don't have his body he can do

108
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
but if i don't have his body he can do
 

109
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,790
but if i don't have his body he can do
whatever he wants right so he goes i'll

110
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
whatever he wants right so he goes i'll
 

111
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,070
whatever he wants right so he goes i'll
move out of the way he does whatever he

112
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
move out of the way he does whatever he
 

113
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,190
move out of the way he does whatever he
wants any counter

114
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200

 

115
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,430

so when we're not here i have to have

116
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
so when we're not here i have to have
 

117
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,750
so when we're not here i have to have
his body

118
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
his body
 

119
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,990
his body
so it is a yielding but there's an

120
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
so it is a yielding but there's an
 

121
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,509
so it is a yielding but there's an
adhesion which you guys should we're

122
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
adhesion which you guys should we're
 

123
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,630
adhesion which you guys should we're
going to show that

124
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
going to show that
 

125
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,200
going to show that
he's not pushing anymore and it doesn't

126
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,210

 

127
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,830

[Music]

128
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840
[Music]
 

129
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:15,610
[Music]
matter

130
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:15,620

 

131
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,430

[Music]

132
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440

 

133
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,710

this is different

134
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720

 

135
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,470

so usually they're coming forward that's

136
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480
so usually they're coming forward that's
 

137
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,830
so usually they're coming forward that's
when you would do the technique

138
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
when you would do the technique
 

139
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,589
when you would do the technique
but just becoming just because he's

140
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
but just becoming just because he's
 

141
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,309
but just becoming just because he's
coming forward don't just

142
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
coming forward don't just
 

143
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,589
coming forward don't just
keep him in perfect agency

144
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
keep him in perfect agency
 

145
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,990
keep him in perfect agency
so we're going to have him not come

146
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
so we're going to have him not come
 

147
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,789
so we're going to have him not come
forward

148
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
forward
 

149
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,550
forward
and i'm going to do

150
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560

 

151
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,229

the adhesion so yes it is a yielding

152
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
the adhesion so yes it is a yielding
 

153
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,350
the adhesion so yes it is a yielding
but it has integrity against other

154
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
but it has integrity against other
 

155
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,869
but it has integrity against other
angles

156
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879

 

157
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,229

okay let's go okay so as he's coming in

158
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
okay let's go okay so as he's coming in
 

159
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,869
okay let's go okay so as he's coming in
uh you can see i'm on this side of the

160
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
uh you can see i'm on this side of the
 

161
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,990
uh you can see i'm on this side of the
of the uh

162
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
of the uh
 

163
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,470
of the uh
action sorry in this case your one you

164
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
action sorry in this case your one you
 

165
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,190
action sorry in this case your one you
were right

166
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
were right
 

167
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,470
were right
okay i'm not on this side and then i'm

168
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
okay i'm not on this side and then i'm
 

169
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,509
okay i'm not on this side and then i'm
pushing

170
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519

 

171
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,789

so i i'm on this side of the thing you

172
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
so i i'm on this side of the thing you
 

173
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:29,510
so i i'm on this side of the thing you

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,950
of the front
inward kazushi so don't

342
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
inward kazushi so don't
 

343
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,110
inward kazushi so don't
do don't leave it up here because i did

344
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
do don't leave it up here because i did
 

345
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,029
do don't leave it up here because i did
have the adhesion but i didn't keep the

346
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
have the adhesion but i didn't keep the
 

347
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,390
have the adhesion but i didn't keep the
tilt going

348
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
tilt going
 

349
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,150
tilt going
so tilt tilt tilt tilt tilt down

350
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160

the easier it is for the hip to cross

354
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
the easier it is for the hip to cross
 

355
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,870
the easier it is for the hip to cross
over

00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
get him all the way into the kazushi so
 

363
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,070
get him all the way into the kazushi so
if i leave this here

364
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,080

left hip take that geometry from falling
so i'm going i'm going to lower it

372
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
so i'm going i'm going to lower it
 

373
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,670
so i'm going i'm going to lower it
to get his head low

374
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
to get his head low
 

375
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,910
to get his head low
lower it to get his head up

okay this is where you'll return to your

382
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
okay this is where you'll return to your
 

383
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,910
okay this is where you'll return to your
external stuff all right and again

384
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920

the guy's going to counter you or slow

386
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
the guy's going to counter you or slow

the guy's going to counter you or slow
you down enough to the second uk gets

388
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
you down enough to the second uk gets
 

389
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,630
you down enough to the second uk gets
you

390
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
you
 

391
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,630
you
right um or you just won't have the

392
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
right um or you just won't have the
 

393
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,750
right um or you just won't have the
mechanics for for doing the technique so

394
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
mechanics for for doing the technique so
 

395
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,070
mechanics for for doing the technique so
when you're you're over here and you're

396
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
when you're you're over here and you're
 

397
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,350
when you're you're over here and you're
going like this

398
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
going like this
 

399
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,949
going like this
this is all just leverage

400
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
this is all just leverage
 

401
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,590
this is all just leverage
right and so you you could you could

402
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
right and so you you could you could
 

403
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,470
right and so you you could you could
change

404
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
change
 

405
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,829
change
let's say i'm in the position right if i

406
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
let's say i'm in the position right if i
 

407
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,350
let's say i'm in the position right if i
go over here like this there's no

408
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
go over here like this there's no
 

409
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,949
go over here like this there's no
controlling him so this is where the

410
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
controlling him so this is where the
 

411
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,949
controlling him so this is where the
counter you can get does something else

412
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
counter you can get does something else
 

413
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:57,910
counter you can get does something else
to you okay

414
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
to you okay
 

415
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,310
to you okay
so here i already have control so we're

416
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
so here i already have control so we're
 

417
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,829
so here i already have control so we're
going to show that i have control

418
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
going to show that i have control
 

419
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,630
going to show that i have control
that he will give him different angles

420
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
that he will give him different angles
 

421
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,269
that he will give him different angles
so

422
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
so
 

423
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,430
so
uh let's say he wants to come forward

424
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
uh let's say he wants to come forward
 

425
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,430
uh let's say he wants to come forward
before i want him to he can't

426
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
before i want him to he can't
 

427
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,949
before i want him to he can't
uh and what you're going to see when i

428
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
uh and what you're going to see when i
 

429
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,710
uh and what you're going to see when i
say he can't is it

430
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
say he can't is it
 

431
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,790
say he can't is it
shifts his line of gravity and he has to

432
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
shifts his line of gravity and he has to
 

433
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,870
shifts his line of gravity and he has to
move his base of support okay

434
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
move his base of support okay
 

435
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,870
move his base of support okay
so uh in other words if he um

436
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
so uh in other words if he um
 

437
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,030
so uh in other words if he um
tries to pull back it's not that i'm

438
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
tries to pull back it's not that i'm
 

439
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,069
tries to pull back it's not that i'm
over here

440
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
over here
 

441
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,910
over here
it's that when i have the adhesion he

442
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
it's that when i have the adhesion he
 

443
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,190
it's that when i have the adhesion he
tries to pull back it

444
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
tries to pull back it
 

445
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,389
tries to pull back it
affects his line of gravity okay so as

446
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
affects his line of gravity okay so as
 

447
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,470
affects his line of gravity okay so as
i'm going you're gonna see that i don't

448
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
i'm going you're gonna see that i don't
 

449
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,269
i'm going you're gonna see that i don't
ever

450
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
ever
 

451
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,470
ever
get on to the other side and now make

452
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
get on to the other side and now make
 

453
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,829
get on to the other side and now make
this a push move

454
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
this a push move
 

455
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,269
this a push move
it's it's all an adhesion okay

456
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:41,279
it's it's all an adhesion okay
 

457
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,389
it's it's all an adhesion okay
so let's let's have him uh

458
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
so let's let's have him uh
 

459
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,670
so let's let's have him uh
lift up against the the adhesion

460
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
lift up against the the adhesion
 

461
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,910
lift up against the the adhesion
you see uh and we're going

462
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
you see uh and we're going
 

463
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,630
you see uh and we're going
let's let's have him uh try to bring his

464
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
let's let's have him uh try to bring his
 

465
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,710
let's let's have him uh try to bring his
foot this foot forward

466
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
foot this foot forward
 

467
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,389
foot this foot forward
yeah to get your face back under you

468
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399

473
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,069

so you have to watch the difference that

474
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
so you have to watch the difference that
 

475
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,590
so you have to watch the difference that
you're not over here you're going like

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,230
that will just go and it looks like it
looks like it's going to work but it

482
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
looks like it's going to work but it
 

483
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,430
looks like it's going to work but it
doesn't

484
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
doesn't

as you as you've noticed okay so instead

486
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
as you as you've noticed okay so instead
 

487
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,030
as you as you've noticed okay so instead
it's here you have the adhesion

488
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
it's here you have the adhesion
 

489
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,949
it's here you have the adhesion
and you're just using that adhesion on

490
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
and you're just using that adhesion on
 

491
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,829

that hat wall

492

495
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,430

okay as i do this

496
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
okay as i do this
 

497
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,829
okay as i do this
technique i i don't want to get on this

498
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
technique i i don't want to get on this
 

499
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:42,710

side and then

500
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
side and then
 

501
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,750
side and then
push this down it's going to be

502
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
push this down it's going to be
 

503
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,750
push this down it's going to be
a leverage move so

504
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
a leverage move so
 

505
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,150
a leverage move so
this this hand's got the connection

506
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
