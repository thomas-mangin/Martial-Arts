1
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,390

okay so these are some

2
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400
okay so these are some
 

3
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,670
okay so these are some
um imaginations or

4
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
um imaginations or
 

5
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,789
um imaginations or
imaginings or mindset to help you get

6
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
imaginings or mindset to help you get
 

7
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,190
imaginings or mindset to help you get
the

8
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
the
 

9
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,389
the
cadence for show

10
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399

 

11
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,510

and to have it have

12
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
and to have it have
 

13
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,870
and to have it have
some sense of danger and

14
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
some sense of danger and
 

15
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,030
some sense of danger and
also some sense of austerity

16
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
also some sense of austerity
 

17
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,749
also some sense of austerity
for the taking of the life and for the

18
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
for the taking of the life and for the
 

19
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,109
for the taking of the life and for the
life you took

20
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
life you took
 

21
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,430
life you took
okay um so just things that will help

22
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
okay um so just things that will help
 

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,350
okay um so just things that will help
if you think about these things it'll

24
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
if you think about these things it'll
 

25
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,190
if you think about these things it'll
fix your body

26
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
fix your body
 

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,710
fix your body
okay um you don't want to be

28
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
okay um you don't want to be
 

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,990
okay um you don't want to be
a big target you're in a big knife fight

30
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
a big target you're in a big knife fight
 

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,110
a big target you're in a big knife fight
so you want to be small you want to be

32
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
so you want to be small you want to be
 

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,070
so you want to be small you want to be
big

34
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
big
 

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,309
big
because that is more vulnerable you a

36
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
because that is more vulnerable you a
 

37
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,350
because that is more vulnerable you a
bigger target

38
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
bigger target
 

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,830
bigger target
in a knife fight is not a good thing

40
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
in a knife fight is not a good thing
 

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,030
in a knife fight is not a good thing
okay

42
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
okay
 

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,550
okay
so uh have a sense of

44
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
so uh have a sense of
 

45
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,670
so uh have a sense of
be a small target as possible my hands

46
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
be a small target as possible my hands
 

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,790
be a small target as possible my hands
are here

48
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
are here
 

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,350
are here
not here like this okay when i grab the

50
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
not here like this okay when i grab the
 

51
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,150
not here like this okay when i grab the
sword i don't grab the sword all big

52
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
sword i don't grab the sword all big
 

53
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,470
sword i don't grab the sword all big
i grab it from the sense of smallness

54
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
i grab it from the sense of smallness
 

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,670
i grab it from the sense of smallness
you see

56
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
you see
 

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,949
you see
i don't want limbs sticking out

58
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959

 

59
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,070

the success of the nuke scan of the

60
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
the success of the nuke scan of the
 

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,309
the success of the nuke scan of the
drawing cut

62
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
drawing cut
 

63
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,509
drawing cut
is not derived from the speed of my cut

64
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
is not derived from the speed of my cut
 

65
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,030
is not derived from the speed of my cut
but how long it takes

66
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
but how long it takes
 

67
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,149
but how long it takes
the opponent to recognize

68
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
the opponent to recognize
 

69
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,270
the opponent to recognize
that an attack has started so what i'm

70
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
that an attack has started so what i'm
 

71
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,710
that an attack has started so what i'm
doing is i'm not trying to make

72
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
doing is i'm not trying to make
 

73
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,750
doing is i'm not trying to make
me go faster i'm trying to

74
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
me go faster i'm trying to
 

75
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,509
me go faster i'm trying to
push back their response

76
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
push back their response
 

77
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,229
push back their response
so in a sense they're starting later

78
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239

 

79
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,949

so it's more about disguising it so if

80
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
so it's more about disguising it so if
 

81
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:31,750
so it's more about disguising it so if
you look

82
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
you look
 

83
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,110
you look
at how would i stand up it would be

84
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
at how would i stand up it would be
 

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,149
at how would i stand up it would be
like this

86
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159

 

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,670

i'm going to stand down and do nothing

88
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
i'm going to stand down and do nothing
 

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,789
i'm going to stand down and do nothing
so i want to try to

90
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
so i want to try to
 

91
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,470
so i want to try to
mimic as much of that

92
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
mimic as much of that
 

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,990
mimic as much of that
in the cut so

94
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
in the cut so
 

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,190
in the cut so
i have to decorum requires i hold the

96
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
i have to decorum requires i hold the
 

97
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,910
i have to decorum requires i hold the
sword

98
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
sword
 

99
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,589
sword
right so this hand is the first

100
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
right so this hand is the first
 

101
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,070
right so this hand is the first
thing that is giving a cue that

102
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
thing that is giving a cue that
 

103
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,070
thing that is giving a cue that
something different is happening

104
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
something different is happening
 

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,509
something different is happening
so that's going to be obvious

106
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
so that's going to be obvious
 

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,110
so that's going to be obvious
uh so this hand goes this way

108
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
uh so this hand goes this way
 

109
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,149
uh so this hand goes this way
you see and this

110
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
you see and this
 

111
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,670
you see and this
is more obvious than this so the more

112
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
is more obvious than this so the more
 

113
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,789
is more obvious than this so the more
movement i add

114
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
movement i add
 

115
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,390
movement i add
the more telegraphing i'm doing the more

116
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
the more telegraphing i'm doing the more
 

117
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,670
the more telegraphing i'm doing the more
i'm moving their response sooner

118
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
i'm moving their response sooner
 

119
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,430
i'm moving their response sooner
okay also if i do things independently

120
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
okay also if i do things independently
 

121
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,110
okay also if i do things independently
that's easy for us to recognize but if i

122
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
that's easy for us to recognize but if i
 

123
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,710
that's easy for us to recognize but if i
uh move all these things together so

124
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
uh move all these things together so
 

125
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,670
uh move all these things together so
they move together they move together

126
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
they move together they move together
 

127
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,070
they move together they move together
not

128
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
not
 

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,430
not
one two right and they move together

130
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
one two right and they move together
 

131
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,830
one two right and they move together
with

132
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
with
 

133
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,550
with
with my body so my body is moving you

134
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
with my body so my body is moving you
 

135
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,670
with my body so my body is moving you
see

136
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
see
 

137
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,350
see
and i try to hide it as long as possible

138
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
and i try to hide it as long as possible
 

139
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,550
and i try to hide it as long as possible
hide it as long as possible same thing

140
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
hide it as long as possible same thing
 

141
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,710
hide it as long as possible same thing
goes with my tension

142
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
goes with my tension
 

143
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,270
goes with my tension
that's all telegraphing you're gonna see

144
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
that's all telegraphing you're gonna see
 

145
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,070
that's all telegraphing you're gonna see
it okay

146
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
it okay
 

147
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,110
it okay
so your mind is actually like chill

148
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
so your mind is actually like chill
 

149
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,749
so your mind is actually like chill
chill chill relax because you're trying

00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
chill chill relax because you're trying
 

151
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,110
chill chill relax because you're trying
to hide the movement

152
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
to hide the movement
 

153
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,629
to hide the movement
okay so i'm actually physically skinny

154
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
okay so i'm actually physically skinny
 

155
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,710
okay so i'm actually physically skinny
but my mind is i'll hide the movement

156
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
but my mind is i'll hide the movement
 

157
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,070
but my mind is i'll hide the movement
hide the movement

158
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
hide the movement
 

159
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,270
hide the movement
don't freak out and so when i do knit

160
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
don't freak out and so when i do knit
 

161
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,830
don't freak out and so when i do knit
scare

162
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
scare
 

163
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,590
scare
it's just very

164
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600

 

165
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,350

okay by the time they figure out what's

166
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
okay by the time they figure out what's
 

167
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,110
okay by the time they figure out what's
happening the sword should probably be

168
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
happening the sword should probably be
 

169
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,510
happening the sword should probably be
somewhere around here

170
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
somewhere around here
 

171
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:37,350
somewhere around here
and the cut comes out

172
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360

 

173
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,270

that's my goal number one

174
