okay the second thing you might think it
is is I have magic powers I stick this

44
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
is is I have magic powers I stick this
 

45
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,840

out here I extend my gene and then a lot

46
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:01,850
out here I extend my gene and then a lot
 

47
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,399

of magic it might push it down any kid
 

49
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:05,289
of magic it might push it down any kid
I've done he's really pushing as hard as

50
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:05,299
I've done he's really pushing as hard as
 

51
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,760
I've done he's really pushing as hard as
you can but I can't seem to bring it

52
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:06,770
you can but I can't seem to bring it
 

53
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,770
you can but I can't seem to bring it
down okay that's not what's happening

54
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:08,780
down okay that's not what's happening
 

55
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,600
down okay that's not what's happening
what's happening is simply mental

56
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:10,610
what's happening is simply mental
 

57
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,020
what's happening is simply mental
suggestion I gave Mike a parameter are a

58
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,030
suggestion I gave Mike a parameter are a
 

59
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,399
suggestion I gave Mike a parameter are a
number of parameters in which he can

60
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:15,409
number of parameters in which he can
 

61
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,889
number of parameters in which he can
operate and then I simply change the

62
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:17,899
operate and then I simply change the
 

63
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:20,200
operate and then I simply change the
factors so when we're doing this it

64
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,210
factors so when we're doing this it
 

65
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,270
factors so when we're doing this it
seems like he can't push it down to him

66
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:22,280
seems like he can't push it down to him
 

67
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,679
seems like he can't push it down to him
but he's actually doing it all to

68
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:23,689
but he's actually doing it all to
 

69
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:24,160
but he's actually doing it all to
himself

70
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,170
himself
 

71
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,350
himself
so when I stick the Jo out first things

72
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:26,360
so when I stick the Jo out first things
 

73
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,060
so when I stick the Jo out first things
I don't like to stick both hands on top

74
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,070
I don't like to stick both hands on top
 

75
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,520
I don't like to stick both hands on top
okay this aligns him properly so I

76
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:30,530
okay this aligns him properly so I
 

77
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,230
okay this aligns him properly so I
already conditioned by I've already told

78
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
already conditioned by I've already told
 

79
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,029
already conditioned by I've already told
him you need to listen to what I say in

80
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:34,039
him you need to listen to what I say in
 

81
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,800
him you need to listen to what I say in
order for this to work the next thing I

82
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:35,810
order for this to work the next thing I
 

83
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,450
order for this to work the next thing I
tell Mike is he has to push this black

84
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:37,460
tell Mike is he has to push this black
 

85
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,429
tell Mike is he has to push this black
down to the ground so I make sure to

86
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
down to the ground so I make sure to
 

87
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,020
down to the ground so I make sure to
push it flat down to the ground yeah if

88
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,030
push it flat down to the ground yeah if
 

89
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,670
push it flat down to the ground yeah if
you saw how easy that was so he knows

90
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:42,680
you saw how easy that was so he knows
 

91
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,209
you saw how easy that was so he knows
that's easy

92
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:43,219
that's easy
 

93
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:45,099
that's easy
and I'm also conditioned to know he must

94
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:45,109
and I'm also conditioned to know he must
 

95
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,870
and I'm also conditioned to know he must
push the dough flat that means he has to

96
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
push the dough flat that means he has to
 

97
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,179
push the dough flat that means he has to
keep the joke level to the ground so

98
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:49,189
keep the joke level to the ground so
 

99
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,010
keep the joke level to the ground so
what I tell Mike to really begin pushing

100
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,020
what I tell Mike to really begin pushing
 

101
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,289
what I tell Mike to really begin pushing
all I do is simply tilt the Jo back and

102
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:53,299
all I do is simply tilt the Jo back and
 

103
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,849
all I do is simply tilt the Jo back and
forth let it open once again all I'm

104
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:54,859
forth let it open once again all I'm
 

105
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,800
forth let it open once again all I'm
doing it bringing is up all I'm doing is

106
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:56,810
doing it bringing is up all I'm doing is
 

107
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,319
doing it bringing is up all I'm doing is
this very small very small I'm doing

108
00:01:59,319 --> 00:01:59,329
this very small very small I'm doing
 

109
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,450
this very small very small I'm doing
this now one has to compensate for this

110
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:01,460
this now one has to compensate for this
 

111
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,340
this now one has to compensate for this
because Mike knows that she has to push

112
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,350
because Mike knows that she has to push
 

113
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,380
because Mike knows that she has to push
it flat so when it begins to push

114
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,390
it flat so when it begins to push
 

115
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,230
it flat so when it begins to push
I simply move the Joe's slightly right

116
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:08,240
I simply move the Joe's slightly right
 

117
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,350
I simply move the Joe's slightly right
because Mike's strong and he's shaking

118
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
because Mike's strong and he's shaking
 

119
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,510
because Mike's strong and he's shaking
it you can't even tell what I'm doing so

120
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
it you can't even tell what I'm doing so
 

121
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,400
it you can't even tell what I'm doing so
I've given Mike some parameters he's got

122
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:15,410
I've given Mike some parameters he's got
 

123
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,870
I've given Mike some parameters he's got
to push it flattens gotta have his hands

124
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:16,880
to push it flattens gotta have his hands
 

125
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,330
to push it flattens gotta have his hands
on top so when Mike begins working it

126
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:19,340
on top so when Mike begins working it
 

127
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,220
on top so when Mike begins working it
gets working against himself I can hold

128
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,230
gets working against himself I can hold
 

129
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,720
gets working against himself I can hold
it here all day I'm not doing any work

130
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:22,730
it here all day I'm not doing any work
 

131
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,920
it here all day I'm not doing any work
Mike's holding it up for me and he's

132
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:23,930
Mike's holding it up for me and he's
 

133
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,300
Mike's holding it up for me and he's
working his hands against each other

134
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:25,310
working his hands against each other
 

135
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,910
working his hands against each other
this is a very easy thing to do so if my

136
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
this is a very easy thing to do so if my
 

137
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,320
this is a very easy thing to do so if my
didn't have to operate within the

138
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,330
didn't have to operate within the
 

139
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,210
didn't have to operate within the
parameters if I didn't begin to push it

140
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,220
parameters if I didn't begin to push it
 

141
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,010
parameters if I didn't begin to push it
flat to the ground but instead I could

142
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,020
flat to the ground but instead I could
 

143
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,449
flat to the ground but instead I could
push it down any way possible when I

144
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:34,459
push it down any way possible when I
 

145
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:36,580
push it down any way possible when I
begin to tilt the joke Michael just push

146
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:36,590
begin to tilt the joke Michael just push
 

147
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,470
begin to tilt the joke Michael just push
however he can push right there Mike

148
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
however he can push right there Mike
 

149
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,940
however he can push right there Mike
push the dirt on the ground he might

150
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:39,950
push the dirt on the ground he might
 

151
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,800
push the dirt on the ground he might
even push against me and down right so

152
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:41,810
even push against me and down right so
 

153
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,690
even push against me and down right so
they're like push the Joe down but

154
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:43,700
they're like push the Joe down but
 

155
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,060
they're like push the Joe down but
because Mike believes he has to push it

156
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,070
because Mike believes he has to push it
 

157
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,610
because Mike believes he has to push it
black to the ground he will work in a

158
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:48,620
black to the ground he will work in a
 

159
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,380
black to the ground he will work in a
