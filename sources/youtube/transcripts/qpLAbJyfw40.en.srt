dead feeling of all the years of reps
 

225
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,950
dead feeling of all the years of reps
and training and practice has developed

226
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
and training and practice has developed

a particular feeling that's telling me

228
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:29,720
a particular feeling that's telling me

a particular feeling that's telling me
this is the proper organization timing

230
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:32,390
this is the proper organization timing
 

231
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,740
this is the proper organization timing
right and so where do I look to see that

232
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:37,750
right and so where do I look to see that
 

233
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,840
right and so where do I look to see that
do you do you understand I can't it's

234
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:40,850
do you do you understand I can't it's
 

235
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,570
do you do you understand I can't it's
not a database so it doesn't it make

236
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:43,580
not a database so it doesn't it make
 

237
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,340
not a database so it doesn't it make
sense that I'm looking everywhere

238
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,350
sense that I'm looking everywhere
 

239
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,210
sense that I'm looking everywhere
simultaneously yeah

240
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:47,220
simultaneously yeah
 

241
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,070
simultaneously yeah
make sense it's not all that different

242
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,080
make sense it's not all that different
 

243
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,010
make sense it's not all that different

your gaze is not important your case is

260
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:15,690
your gaze is not important your case is
 

261
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,980

in a beginner and at that point then

266
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
in a beginner and at that point then
 

267
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,280
in a beginner and at that point then
that feeling is probably the most

268
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,290
that feeling is probably the most
 

269
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,090
that feeling is probably the most
important so I the reason I mentioned

270
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:35,100

how I understand them what are they
 

767
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,560
how I understand them what are they
really trying to do

768
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:50,570

 

769
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:58,840

well you have had several answers to

that but I think they in in the Taoist
 

773
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,660
that but I think they in in the Taoist
tradition they really come down to two

774
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:04,670
tradition they really come down to two
 

775
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,470
tradition they really come down to two
and one is and it's mentioned in the

780
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:19,019
and then the other one is this kind of
 

781
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:24,080

that's the riddle you have to figure out

1258
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:46,660
that's the riddle you have to figure out
 

1259
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,510
that's the riddle you have to figure out
and I think we would do ourselves a

1260
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:48,520
and I think we would do ourselves a
 

1261
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,180
and I think we would do ourselves a
disservice when we don't start with I

1262
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,190
disservice when we don't start with I
 

1263
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,980
disservice when we don't start with I
should just do these patterns the way

1264
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:52,990
should just do these patterns the way
 

1265
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,839
should just do these patterns the way
that they're taught to me maybe that's

1266
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:54,849
that they're taught to me maybe that's
 

1267
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:58,440
that they're taught to me maybe that's
it you know what I mean maybe that could

1268
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:58,450
