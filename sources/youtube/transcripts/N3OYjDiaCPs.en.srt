us look at the strategic
 

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,669
us look at the strategic
problem of the fact that

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:11,679
problem of the fact that
 

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,910
problem of the fact that

say about it
okay one

18
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
okay one
 

19
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,069
okay one
is that it's going to move

a tactical problem
 

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,630
a tactical problem
as it is a mind problem

30
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
as it is a mind problem
 

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,630
as it is a mind problem
in the buddhist sense of the word

32
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640

 

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,710

anything is a lot to deal with

anything is a lot to deal with
 

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,149
anything is a lot to deal with
okay what modern systems do

36
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
okay what modern systems do
 

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,590
okay what modern systems do
is they try to artificially get rid of

38
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
is they try to artificially get rid of
 

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,830
is they try to artificially get rid of
this fact

40
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:23,840
this fact
 

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,390
this fact
so you do boxing no kicks

00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560

 

59
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,950

as a spiritual tradition this is why

you are coming face to face with the

64
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
you are coming face to face with the
 

65
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,389
you are coming face to face with the
infinite

66
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
infinite
 

67
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,510
infinite
how do you deal with it

68
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520

 

69
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,190

you have three ways

70
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
you have three ways
 

71
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,390
you have three ways
one is

72
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
one is
 

73
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,869
one is
a cultivated body mind

74
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879

 

75
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,309

so this this will go to our um other

76
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
so this this will go to our um other
 

77
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,589
so this this will go to our um other
lecture

this is the unfettered mind the mind

86
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
this is the unfettered mind the mind
 

87
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,790
this is the unfettered mind the mind
that is not overwhelmed by anything

88
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
that is not overwhelmed by anything
 

89
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,910
that is not overwhelmed by anything
because it does not

90
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
because it does not
 

91
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,030
because it does not
see an infinite amount of things it sees

92
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
see an infinite amount of things it sees
 

93
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,869
see an infinite amount of things it sees
one thing

94
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879

 

95
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,589

the second thing is

96
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
the second thing is
 

97
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,630
the second thing is
in aikido is this ikea adhesion

98
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640

 

99
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,270

this allows me to have in here

100
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
this allows me to have in here
 

101
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,390
this allows me to have in here
i can deal with the infinite

102
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
i can deal with the infinite
 

103
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,589
i can deal with the infinite
and here i become connected

104
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
and here i become connected
 

105
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,110
and here i become connected
inseparable from the infinite

106
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
inseparable from the infinite
 

107
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,430
inseparable from the infinite
so i don't face the infinite in an

108
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
so i don't face the infinite in an
 

109
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,030
so i don't face the infinite in an
adversarial way

110
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
adversarial way
 

111
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,550
adversarial way
or tactically as a game of catch-up

112
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
or tactically as a game of catch-up
 

113
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,630
or tactically as a game of catch-up
or a game of prevention

114
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640

 

115
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,949

the second you do something i'm already

116
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
the second you do something i'm already
 

117
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,750
the second you do something i'm already
touching you

118
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
touching you
 

119
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,710
touching you
whatever you're doing i not only know

120
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
whatever you're doing i not only know
 

121
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,710
whatever you're doing i not only know
what you're doing i am what you're doing

122
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720

 

123
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,149

and then the third way is

124
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
and then the third way is
 

125
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,149
and then the third way is
that you're setting up dilemmas

126
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
that you're setting up dilemmas
 

127
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,750
that you're setting up dilemmas
meaning i am systematically

128
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
meaning i am systematically
 

129
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,750
meaning i am systematically
taking away your possibilities

130
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
taking away your possibilities
 

131
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,710
taking away your possibilities
and setting you up with probabilities

132
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
and setting you up with probabilities
 

133
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,509
and setting you up with probabilities
okay

134
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
okay
 

135
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,630
okay
so i take the infinite nature of this

136
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
so i take the infinite nature of this
 

137
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,670
so i take the infinite nature of this
but i make more things probable as i

138
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
but i make more things probable as i
 

139
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,070
but i make more things probable as i
make

140
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
make
 

141
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,949
make
less things probable i'm no longer

142
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
less things probable i'm no longer
 

143
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:07,670
less things probable i'm no longer
dealing with

144
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
dealing with
 

145
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,309
dealing with
possibility okay

146
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319

 

147
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:18,469

so when he has

148
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479

 

149
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,550

for example

150
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560

 

151
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,350

let's take the bottom one the dilemma

152
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
let's take the bottom one the dilemma
 

153
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,310
let's take the bottom one the dilemma
where i take the

154
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
where i take the
 

155
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,749
where i take the
anything and i reduce it to

156
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:28,759
anything and i reduce it to
 

157
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,469
anything and i reduce it to
probabilities

158
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
probabilities
 

159
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,070
probabilities
okay so he goes to do at this point

160
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
okay so he goes to do at this point
 

161
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,590
okay so he goes to do at this point
you would ask what could he do

162
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
you would ask what could he do
 

163
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,629
you would ask what could he do
when you you would just run out of time

164
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
when you you would just run out of time
 

165
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,070
when you you would just run out of time
listen him but now

166
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
listen him but now
 

167
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,110
listen him but now
what can he do

168
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
what can he do
 

169
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,230
what can he do
not as many things because his

170
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
not as many things because his
 

171
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,510
not as many things because his
balance is being affected because

172
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
balance is being affected because
 

173
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,830
balance is being affected because
most of that anything requires

174
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
most of that anything requires
 

175
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,350
most of that anything requires
his equilibrium and so in your

176
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
his equilibrium and so in your
 

177
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,629
his equilibrium and so in your
aikido this is why you attack his

178
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
aikido this is why you attack his
 

179
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,749
aikido this is why you attack his
equilibrium

180
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759

he goes i set up the dilemma by taking
 

215
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,110
he goes i set up the dilemma by taking
his balance
