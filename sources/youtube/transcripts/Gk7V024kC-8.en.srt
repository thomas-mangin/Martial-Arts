1
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:42,830

crazy

2
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840

 

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:53,029

uh

4
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039

 

5
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,189

all right you have to think outside your

6
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
all right you have to think outside your
 

7
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,510
all right you have to think outside your
box right it's not easy

8
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
box right it's not easy
 

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,630
box right it's not easy
so you don't come back and turn

10
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640

 

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,830

get the leverage point under your weight

12
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,840

 

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,910

then trade sides

14
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
then trade sides
 

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,149
then trade sides
so that the left side becomes the front

16
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
so that the left side becomes the front
 

17
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,230
so that the left side becomes the front
side

18
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
side
 

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,149
side
you drop that shoulder straight down to

20
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
you drop that shoulder straight down to
 

21
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,950
you drop that shoulder straight down to
the ground

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960

 

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:35,990

so this hand

24
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000

 

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,190

here then back

26
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
here then back
 

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,830
here then back
with the shoulder into the ground turn

28
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
with the shoulder into the ground turn
 

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,870
with the shoulder into the ground turn
the arm

30
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
the arm
 

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:02:06,830
the arm
drop your leg onto that upper arm

32
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840

 

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,670

so

34
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680

 

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,830

so don't use your knee

36
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840

 

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,750

to bring them down you want the

38
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
to bring them down you want the
 

39
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,270
to bring them down you want the
platform stabilized so boom

40
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
platform stabilized so boom
 

41
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,430
platform stabilized so boom
down she is she's down that's the idea

42
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
down she is she's down that's the idea
 

43
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,670
down she is she's down that's the idea
you guys understand that difference so i

44
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
you guys understand that difference so i
 

45
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,790
you guys understand that difference so i
have redundant

46
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
have redundant
 

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,670
have redundant
overlapping systems of control so the

48
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
overlapping systems of control so the
 

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,070
overlapping systems of control so the
first

50
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
first
 

51
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,990
first
one is here

52
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
one is here
 

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,910
one is here
okay she's down then i'm going to

54
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
okay she's down then i'm going to
 

55
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,030
okay she's down then i'm going to
replace the

56
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
replace the
 

57
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,630
replace the
hand on the elbow

58
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640

 

59
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,990

that's where i go to the other one don't

60
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
that's where i go to the other one don't
 

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,710
that's where i go to the other one don't
kneel them down okay try it again okay

62
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
kneel them down okay try it again okay
 

63
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,509
kneel them down okay try it again okay
so

64
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
so
 

65
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:08,550
so
first move

66
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560

 

67
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,589

just hit

68
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599

 

69
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,110

so energy's coming in boom moving out of

70
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
so energy's coming in boom moving out of
 

71
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,030
so energy's coming in boom moving out of
the way off to the side just like

72
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
the way off to the side just like
 

73
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,070
the way off to the side just like

79
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,309
thing
off to the side boom

80
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319

 

81
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:40,630

boom okay all right

82

00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
back leg you see that
 

87
00:03:44,959 --> 00:04:01,589
back leg you see that
oh not here

88
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
oh not here
 

89
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,509
oh not here
okay shifting onto the back leg

90
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
okay shifting onto the back leg
 

91
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,949
okay shifting onto the back leg
has the absorption you see that so if i

92
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
has the absorption you see that so if i
 

93
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:09,910
has the absorption you see that so if i
stay here

94
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
stay here
 

95
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,190
stay here
that's not absorbing okay so i time it

96
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200

 

97
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,229

and it has me clearing the line see i

98
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
and it has me clearing the line see i
 

99
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,349
and it has me clearing the line see i
was here

100
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
was here
 

101
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,349

understand okay
so boom

106
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320

 

107
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:49,510

see i'm beginning

108
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520

 

109
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,270

so when i step back i don't go step

110
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
so when i step back i don't go step
 

111
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:07,670
so when i step back i don't go step
here

112
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680

 

113
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:16,790

start to turn

114
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800

 

115
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,790

because if i step straight back i have a

116
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
because if i step straight back i have a
 

117
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,029
because if i step straight back i have a
retreating element

118
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039

 

119
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,629

you see the difference

120
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639

 

121
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:36,830

what i'm going to do is turn

122
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840

 

123
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:45,909

00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
shoulder
 

131
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,990
shoulder

down then when she's down
 

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,029
down then when she's down
i turn the arm

135
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:46,830
i turn the arm
okay it's going to hurt

136
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840

 

137
00:06:46,840 --> 00:07:39,990

oh

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000

 

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:56,390

you're below the elbow

140
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400

 

141
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,869

143
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,749

you see that you see it that movement

144
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759

 

145
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,710

oh okay affected by what i'm doing

146

right in his shoulder

150
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039

 

151
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,790

you have to take the slack out of the

152
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
you have to take the slack out of the
 

153
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,829
you have to take the slack out of the
arm here there's nothing

00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:35,839
arm here there's nothing
 

155
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,909
arm here there's nothing
you just give him his base with his hand

156
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
you just give him his base with his hand
 

157
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,670
you just give him his base with his hand
down

158
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
down
 

159
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,110
down
so you take the slack out

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
so you take the slack out
 

161
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,550
so you take the slack out
you see once the slack is out then you

162
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
you see once the slack is out then you
 

163
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,910
you see once the slack is out then you
start

164
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920

but it's very very small flat

168
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200

 

169
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:29,269

170
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279

 

171
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:39,990

when you arm hurt you turn

172
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000

 

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:59,910

slide out boom

174
