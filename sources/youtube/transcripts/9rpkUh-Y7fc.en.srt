00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:29,390
and being a parallel and I'm starting a
 

171
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:36,280
and being a parallel and I'm starting a
rotational geometry so again embryonic

172
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,290
rotational geometry so again embryonic
 

173
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:48,250
rotational geometry so again embryonic
Li we all wait both goes we saw

174
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:48,260

 

175

routed it's about a quarter turn tops
 

183
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:19,070
routed it's about a quarter turn tops
maybe less with that movement you're

184
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,080
maybe less with that movement you're
 

185
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,659
maybe less with that movement you're
going to see that my right hip is gonna

186

now he is a factor so I don't want to
move his weapon is it correct mechanics

380
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:18,700
move his weapon is it correct mechanics
 

381
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,320

on the show I'm going around it you see

382
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,330
on the show I'm going around it you see
 

383
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,310
on the show I'm going around it you see
it hasn't moved

384
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:23,320
it hasn't moved
 

385
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,440
it hasn't moved
do you see that it hasn't moved and I

386

do you see that it hasn't moved and I
 

387
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:31,740
do you see that it hasn't moved and I
want to straight down oh that

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:38,740
from me doing an angle of deflection
 

393
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,360
from me doing an angle of deflection
it is a displace the displacement to why

394
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,370
it is a displace the displacement to why
 

395
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,610
it is a displace the displacement to why

it there and I'm going around it I'm
 

409
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,710
it there and I'm going around it I'm
making contact with it you see there's

410
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
making contact with it you see there's
 

411
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,160
making contact with it you see there's
contact with it you see and I get on the

412
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,170
contact with it you see and I get on the
 

413
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:36,640
contact with it you see and I get on the
other side of it boom straight down yeah

00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:36,650

 

415
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:40,370

okay I'll slowly blow at this key and he

416
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:40,380
okay I'll slowly blow at this key and he
 

417
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,290
okay I'll slowly blow at this key and he
will practice and secondly Kimmy

418
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:42,300
will practice and secondly Kimmy
 

419
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,610
