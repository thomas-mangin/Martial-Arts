00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360

 

17
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,789

other side is

18
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:05,799
other side is
 

19
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,910
other side is
alive 10 she goes that way I step out

20
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
alive 10 she goes that way I step out
 

21
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,630
alive 10 she goes that way I step out
and enter as she comes

22
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640

 

23
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,830

around

24
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:16,840
around
 

25
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,670
around
enter 10 come she goes this way I step

26
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:21,680
enter 10 come she goes this way I step
 

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:56,750
enter 10 come she goes this way I step
out enter she comes around

28
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:56,760

 

29
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,110

okay try

30
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,120
okay try
 

31
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,790
okay try
all right you have to think about it a

32
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:01,800
all right you have to think about it a
 

33
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,550
all right you have to think about it a
little bit okay so if we're just

34
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:05,560
little bit okay so if we're just
 

35
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,509
little bit okay so if we're just
here I don't want my angle of

36
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
here I don't want my angle of
 

37
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,789
here I don't want my angle of
deflection to move with my angle of

38
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:13,799
deflection to move with my angle of
 

39
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:16,949
deflection to move with my angle of
deviation okay I'm trapping myself in

40
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
deviation okay I'm trapping myself in
 

41
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,470
deviation okay I'm trapping myself in
this thing

42
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
this thing
 

43
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,589
this thing
okay so my angle of if my angle of

44
00:03:22,589 --> 00:03:22,599
okay so my angle of if my angle of
 

45
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,750
okay so my angle of if my angle of
deviation is going to my

46
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:24,760
deviation is going to my
 

47
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,390
deviation is going to my
left then the angle of the flexion has

48
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:29,400
left then the angle of the flexion has
 

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,309
left then the angle of the flexion has
to go to my right you see

50
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:33,319
to go to my right you see
 

51
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,550
to go to my right you see
that so that's the rule we're working on

52
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
that so that's the rule we're working on
 

53
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,309
that so that's the rule we're working on
here so one two she's going to go this

54
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
here so one two she's going to go this
 

55
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,949
here so one two she's going to go this
way and I go this way that's the

56
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
way and I go this way that's the
 

57
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,429
way and I go this way that's the
move what you're confused

58
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:50,439
move what you're confused
 

59
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,670
move what you're confused
with is you want to be

60
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
with is you want to be
 

61
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,350
with is you want to be
homolateral so you go here and you go

62
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:56,360
homolateral so you go here and you go
 

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,949
homolateral so you go here and you go
step to the right move to the left you

64
00:03:59,949 --> 00:03:59,959
step to the right move to the left you
 

65
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,910
step to the right move to the left you
want your body in there it's not like

66
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
want your body in there it's not like
 

67
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:16,229
want your body in there it's not like
that one two turn she goes this

68
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239

 

69
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:40,710

way this way she goes

70
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720

 

71
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,830

okay just try that part is right before

72
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:42,840
okay just try that part is right before
 

73
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,510
okay just try that part is right before
we go under the so if we look and here

74
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
we go under the so if we look and here
 

75
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,430
we go under the so if we look and here
we have a grid pattern okay so right

76
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:48,440
we have a grid pattern okay so right
 

77
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,029
we have a grid pattern okay so right
when she grabs you can see that we're on

78
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:52,039
when she grabs you can see that we're on
 

79
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:57,189
when she grabs you can see that we're on
the same line okay uh she's pushing at

80
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
the same line okay uh she's pushing at
 

81
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,029
the same line okay uh she's pushing at
me okay and I am standing right right in

82
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:00,039
me okay and I am standing right right in
 

83
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,790
me okay and I am standing right right in
front of her what I'm going to do is

84
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
front of her what I'm going to do is
 

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,350
front of her what I'm going to do is
transform this relationship between in

86
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
transform this relationship between in
 

87
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,110
transform this relationship between in
these spirals okay if you pay attention

88
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,120
these spirals okay if you pay attention
 

89
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,270
these spirals okay if you pay attention
in normal iido someone's going to go

90
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
in normal iido someone's going to go
 

91
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,189
in normal iido someone's going to go
over

92
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:12,199
over
 

93
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,189
over
here and then go like this okay but

94
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:16,199
here and then go like this okay but
 

95
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,870
here and then go like this okay but
we're still on a 126 line okay do you

96
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:19,880
we're still on a 126 line okay do you
 

97
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,270
we're still on a 126 line okay do you
see that right and then they bring them

98
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:22,280
see that right and then they bring them
 

99
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,550
see that right and then they bring them
around and on on the 126 line again and

100
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
around and on on the 126 line again and
 

101
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,189
around and on on the 126 line again and
then they go out and then they come

102
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
then they go out and then they come
 

103
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,990
then they go out and then they come
around

104
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,000
around
 

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,029
around
okay so again

106
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:34,039
okay so again
 

107
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,029
okay so again
look 126

108
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
look 126
 

109
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,430
look 126
line 126 lines you see and it come

110
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
line 126 lines you see and it come
 

111
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,430
line 126 lines you see and it come
around I didn't do anything

112
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:44,440
around I didn't do anything
 

113
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,950
around I didn't do anything
okay so what we're going to do is change

114
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
okay so what we're going to do is change
 

115
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,029
okay so what we're going to do is change
the we're going to get rid of the

116
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
the we're going to get rid of the
 

117
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,629
the we're going to get rid of the
126 okay and I do that by start

118
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
126 okay and I do that by start
 

119
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,309
126 okay and I do that by start
rotating this thing

120
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:57,319
rotating this thing
 

121
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,950
rotating this thing
okay and as we start to go

122
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
okay and as we start to go
 

123
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,909
okay and as we start to go
I don't want to go on

124
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:02,919
I don't want to go on
 

125
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,270
I don't want to go on
126 I'm going to keep her moving you see

126
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
126 I'm going to keep her moving you see
 

127
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,029
126 I'm going to keep her moving you see
and we are now on the 39 line but I'm

128
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
and we are now on the 39 line but I'm
 

129
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,469
and we are now on the 39 line but I'm
not really on the 39 line you see cuz I

130
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
not really on the 39 line you see cuz I
 

131
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,110
not really on the 39 line you see cuz I
didn't go to here so I kept turning her

132
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
didn't go to here so I kept turning her
 

133
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,390
didn't go to here so I kept turning her
and now I do my ten con you see and I'm

134
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:25,400
and now I do my ten con you see and I'm
 

135
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,270
and now I do my ten con you see and I'm
on that 39 line again on the other side

136
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,280
on that 39 line again on the other side
 

137
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,790
on that 39 line again on the other side
now okay

138
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
now okay
 

139
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,670
now okay
she's going to come

140
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:32,680
she's going to come
 

141
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,070
she's going to come
around and I'm over

142
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,080
around and I'm over
 

143
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:41,110
around and I'm over
here okay like this so if we look at her

144
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
here okay like this so if we look at her
 

145
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,390
here okay like this so if we look at her
and me I'm going to start

146
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
and me I'm going to start
 

147
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,790
and me I'm going to start
using the 48 line when I

148
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:47,800
using the 48 line when I
 

149
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,629
using the 48 line when I
enter she's now on the 28 line you see

150
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:53,639
enter she's now on the 28 line you see
 

151
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,390
enter she's now on the 28 line you see
so if you look here this has already

152
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,400
so if you look here this has already
 

153
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,150
so if you look here this has already
changed got it

154
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
changed got it
 

155
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,350
changed got it
so when she passes me now she comes

156
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:04,360
so when she passes me now she comes
 

157
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,830
so when she passes me now she comes
around what I'm going to do is I have

158
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
around what I'm going to do is I have
 

159
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,990
around what I'm going to do is I have
built a

160
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,000
built a
 

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,390
built a
relationship on the

162
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:11,400
relationship on the
 

163
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,710
relationship on the
hand i'm centered on the hand I'm not on

164
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:15,720
hand i'm centered on the hand I'm not on
 

165
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,990
hand i'm centered on the hand I'm not on
her line stay there

166
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,000
her line stay there
