00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,710
okay I had to externally yield and and
get a y on the projection point

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
get a y on the projection point
 

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,549
get a y on the projection point
but I want to at

12
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
but I want to at

the compression is right there okay and
then I keep increasing it as she's

then I keep increasing it as she's
 

19
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,150
then I keep increasing it as she's
driving I keep increasing it you see

that and then very small movements press

22
00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:51,079
that and then very small movements press
 

23
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,470
that and then very small movements press
so you can feel it okay so very small

24
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:53,480
so you can feel it okay so very small
 

25
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,029

see my hands moveed there you see that
 

35
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,630
see my hands moveed there you see that
so if she's driving driving I'll release

36
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:13,640

arm don't need to move my eyes Okay so

58
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
arm don't need to move my eyes Okay so
 

59
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,910

that's

00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
that's
 

61
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,709
that's
why in order to get the absorption I

62
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
why in order to get the absorption I
 

63
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,270
why in order to get the absorption I
have to release the tension and then

64
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
have to release the tension and then
 

65
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,190
have to release the tension and then
if I move my arms I'm probably not doing

if I move my arms I'm probably not doing
the absorption so you keep tasking

the absorption so you keep tasking
 

69
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,990
the absorption so you keep tasking
yourself with less tension and less

don't go against the thumb so I grip
 

103
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,710
don't go against the thumb so I grip
then I'm inside the grip see that so you

00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:43,720
then I'm inside the grip see that so you

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,710
your pull don't open or close just stay
right where you're in and seek the Tom

170
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:29,720
right where you're in and seek the Tom
 

171
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,909
right where you're in and seek the Tom
in the middle which is neither pinky nor

172
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
in the middle which is neither pinky nor
 

173
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,510
in the middle which is neither pinky nor
thumb okay and so I don't I don't fight

174
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:36,520
thumb okay and so I don't I don't fight
 

175
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,189
thumb okay and so I don't I don't fight
you to get that kind of stuff I use the

176
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:40,199
you to get that kind of stuff I use the
 

177
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,909
you to get that kind of stuff I use the
motion there's the elbow right

178
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:42,919
motion there's the elbow right
 

179
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,390
motion there's the elbow right
here okay so try it some

180
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
here okay so try it some
 

181
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,830
here okay so try it some
more inward outward

182
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:52,840

 

183
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:59,990

spiral is in

184
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000

 

185
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,710

it could be

186
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720

 

187
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,909

small but it's the

188
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
small but it's the
 

189
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,469
small but it's the
shape it's the

190
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479

 

191
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,189

shape

192
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:12,199
shape
 

193
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,749
shape
small see can be small or it didn't look

194
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
small see can be small or it didn't look
 

195
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,670
small see can be small or it didn't look
like it but inside it's coiling do you

196
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:20,680
like it but inside it's coiling do you
 

197
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,270
like it but inside it's coiling do you
understand the two are coiling so I

198
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
understand the two are coiling so I
 

199
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,230
understand the two are coiling so I
don't have to go

200
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
don't have to go
 

201
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,510
don't have to go
outward inward but I have to coil

202
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:30,520
outward inward but I have to coil
 

203
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,589
outward inward but I have to coil
TR half the

204
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:34,599

 

205
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:38,790

coil okay right try

206
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
coil okay right try
 

207
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,270
coil okay right try
it keep l

208
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
it keep l
 

209
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,710
it keep l
g and and let the

210
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:43,720
g and and let the
 

211
00:06:43,720 --> 00:07:01,020
g and and let the
mudra do the work TR the

212
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,030

 

213
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:09,830

215
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,909

okay careful of these like if you're

216
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:12,919
okay careful of these like if you're
 

217
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:14,990
okay careful of these like if you're
fighting freaking do it but here we're

218
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,000
fighting freaking do it but here we're
 

219
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,670
fighting freaking do it but here we're
training okay all right

220
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
training okay all right
 

221
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,510
training okay all right
okay watch those straight lines all

222
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:20,520
okay watch those straight lines all
 

223
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,830
okay watch those straight lines all
right

224
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
right
 

225
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,230
right
yes make

226
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
yes make
 

227
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:33,909
yes make
spirals Act linearly

228
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919

 

229
00:07:33,919 --> 00:08:00,830

now gone

230
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:00,840

 

231
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:16,950

little more curve on the Y

232
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960

 

233
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,749

hand okay so watch the

234
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
hand okay so watch the
 

235
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,149
hand okay so watch the
uh the Y hand here see that okay so we

236
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:28,159
uh the Y hand here see that okay so we
 

237
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,950
uh the Y hand here see that okay so we
want to go

238
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
want to go
 

239
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,149
want to go
linear there all right you see that and

240
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
linear there all right you see that and
 

241
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,509
linear there all right you see that and
sometimes sometimes we turn him but then

242
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:36,519
sometimes sometimes we turn him but then
 

243
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,550
sometimes sometimes we turn him but then
it's linear there you see that yes okay

244
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
it's linear there you see that yes okay
 

245
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,630
it's linear there you see that yes okay
in or if I go spiral now I'm in the

246
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:43,640
in or if I go spiral now I'm in the
 

247
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,750
in or if I go spiral now I'm in the
shoulder that's part of the

248
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760

 

249
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,949

problem again I'm turning him I go

250
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
problem again I'm turning him I go
 

251
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,230
problem again I'm turning him I go
spiral I got in the shoulder I missed

252
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:53,240
spiral I got in the shoulder I missed
 

253
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,790
spiral I got in the shoulder I missed
the center

254
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
the center
 

255
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,670
the center
okay that's why this is where the

256
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
okay that's why this is where the
 

257
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,310
okay that's why this is where the
internals come in I don't to touch I

258
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
internals come in I don't to touch I
 

259
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,870
internals come in I don't to touch I
don't have to push the shoulder to make

260
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
don't have to push the shoulder to make
 

261
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,829
don't have to push the shoulder to make
the center go back okay so as you're

262
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839
the center go back okay so as you're
 

263
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,949
the center go back okay so as you're
doing your spiral

264
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
doing your spiral
 

265
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,630
doing your spiral
here pay pay attention to that I feel

266
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
here pay pay attention to that I feel
 

267
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,590
here pay pay attention to that I feel
that okay so as I do the spiral I'm not

268
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
that okay so as I do the spiral I'm not
 

269
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,350
that okay so as I do the spiral I'm not
going to pass you here and go into that

270
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,360
going to pass you here and go into that
 

271
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,150
going to pass you here and go into that
shoulder I keep this connection you see

272
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
shoulder I keep this connection you see
 

273
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,470
shoulder I keep this connection you see
this that connection that connection

274
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
this that connection that connection
 

275
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,550
this that connection that connection
that pushed you there I keep that

276
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
that pushed you there I keep that
 

277
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,350
that pushed you there I keep that
connection on the

278
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,360
connection on the
 

279
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,750
connection on the
spiral see that it doesn't go in the

280
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
spiral see that it doesn't go in the
 

281
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,630
spiral see that it doesn't go in the
shoulder so I'm not going like that in

282
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
shoulder so I'm not going like that in
 

283
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,150
shoulder so I'm not going like that in
the

284
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
the
 

285
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,550
the
shoulder but I'm not going like this

286
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:39,560
shoulder but I'm not going like this
 

287
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,190
shoulder but I'm not going like this
either I spiral

288
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
either I spiral
 

289
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,150
either I spiral
boom that that that part of the curve

290
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
boom that that that part of the curve
 

291
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,910
boom that that that part of the curve
from the vector that I'm staying

292
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:50,920
from the vector that I'm staying
 

293
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,670
from the vector that I'm staying
connected on is

294
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
connected on is
 

295
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,430
connected on is
linear do you see so

296
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440

 

297
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,630

you you can spin the triangle it's now a

298
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:01,640
you you can spin the triangle it's now a
 

299
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,630
you you can spin the triangle it's now a
circle right you can you can hit with

300
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
circle right you can you can hit with
 

301
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,870
circle right you can you can hit with
the round object that that's kind of

302
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
the round object that that's kind of
 

303
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,470
the round object that that's kind of
what we're doing here so careful that

304
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
what we're doing here so careful that
 

305
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,710
what we're doing here so careful that
you like I feel I got him do you see

306
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:13,720
you like I feel I got him do you see
 

307
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,509
you like I feel I got him do you see
that and then you start pushing

308
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
that and then you start pushing
 

309
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,030
that and then you start pushing
instead come around the tanden all right

310
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,040
instead come around the tanden all right
 

311
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,389
instead come around the tanden all right
all

312
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:23,399
all
 

313
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,240
all
right got that okay
