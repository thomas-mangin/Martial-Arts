00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
i made sure
 

25
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,830
i made sure
that the tension was there while we were

26
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
that the tension was there while we were
 

27
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,110
that the tension was there while we were
talking

28
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
talking
 

29
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,150

because my awareness has to be there all

30
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
because my awareness has to be there all
 

31
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,590
because my awareness has to be there all
the time

32
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
the time
 

33
00:00:47,600 --> 00:01:25,030
the time
the same as our breathing reservoirs

34
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040

 

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,030

and that's what i want you to do i want

36
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
and that's what i want you to do i want
 

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,190
and that's what i want you to do i want
you to realize that your sensitivity

38
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
you to realize that your sensitivity
 

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,710

00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360

 

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,310

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,709
this is what we need to try and take out
this is when we go inside ourself rather

48
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
this is when we go inside ourself rather
 

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,630
this is when we go inside ourself rather
than go inside ourselves

50
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
than go inside ourselves
 

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,510
