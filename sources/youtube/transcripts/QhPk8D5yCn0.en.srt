waist your foot is caving and it's not
at a 45° angle

252
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:55,879

 

253
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,029

forward let me try it again stay CL I

254
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
forward let me try it again stay CL I
 

255
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,070
forward let me try it again stay CL I
know I

256
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
know I
 

257
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,230
know I
here and I'm I'm using some sort of

258
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,240
here and I'm I'm using some sort of
 

259
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,510
here and I'm I'm using some sort of
engine to to show that for line you got

260
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:06,520
engine to to show that for line you got
 

261
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,990
engine to to show that for line you got
it okay uh one

262
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,000

 

263
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,469

is one is my arm goes up and

264
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479

 

265
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,070

down another one is my torso goes up and

266
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,080
down another one is my torso goes up and
 

267
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,309
down another one is my torso goes up and
you see that those all require you to

268
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
you see that those all require you to
 

269
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,469
you see that those all require you to
move something that requires your levers

270
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
move something that requires your levers
 

271
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,790
move something that requires your levers
to be capable of moving the resistance

272
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:31,800
to be capable of moving the resistance
 

273
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,350
to be capable of moving the resistance
that means you need to be strong enough

274
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
that means you need to be strong enough
 

275
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,070
that means you need to be strong enough
to do it okay we're going to do a third

276
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,080
to do it okay we're going to do a third
 

277
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,750
to do it okay we're going to do a third
one I don't lift anything because I

278
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:40,760
one I don't lift anything because I
 

279
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,910
one I don't lift anything because I
don't lower anything I'm just here and I

289
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,870
have to be strong have to do that I
don't want to go like this yeah we some

290
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:03,880
don't want to go like this yeah we some
 

291
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,550
don't want to go like this yeah we some
of us can get very strong like that

292
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
of us can get very strong like that
 

293
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,670
of us can get very strong like that
but it's still

294
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:08,680
but it's still
 

295
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,069
but it's still
strength okay I'm just

296
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:11,079
strength okay I'm just
 

297
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:14,630
strength okay I'm just
here and I use my

298
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
here and I use my
 

299
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,829
here and I use my
body you see that okay let's

300
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839

 

301
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,509

go so this foot is too far back in order

302
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:26,519
go so this foot is too far back in order
 

303
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,389
go so this foot is too far back in order
to push her forward because in terms of

304
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:29,399
to push her forward because in terms of
 

305
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,790
to push her forward because in terms of
moving forward you're near the end of

306
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:31,800
moving forward you're near the end of
 

307
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,670
moving forward you're near the end of
your capacity so this foot's not going

308
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:34,680
your capacity so this foot's not going
 

309
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,389
your capacity so this foot's not going
to push you and what you're going to do

310
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
to push you and what you're going to do
 

311
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,870
to push you and what you're going to do
instead is fall into the stance you

312
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:39,880
instead is fall into the stance you
 

313
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,829
instead is fall into the stance you
understand okay secondly this foot is

314
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:43,839
understand okay secondly this foot is
 

315
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,630
understand okay secondly this foot is
too far south for the t con so the hips

316
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
too far south for the t con so the hips
 

317
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,829
too far south for the t con so the hips
are square so when you do that step like

318
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:50,839
are square so when you do that step like
 

319
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,350
are square so when you do that step like
that you're probably going to keep

320
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:52,360
that you're probably going to keep
 

321
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,389
that you're probably going to keep
Square hips so now you're going to have

322
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
Square hips so now you're going to have
 

323
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,350
Square hips so now you're going to have
to use strength one of

324
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
to use strength one of
 

325
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,150
to use strength one of
them okay this foot goes behind the

326
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,160
them okay this foot goes behind the
 

327
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,910
them okay this foot goes behind the
other foot at the 45°

328
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
other foot at the 45°
 

329
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,190
other foot at the 45°
angle got it and you're at the 45° angle

330
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:08,200
angle got it and you're at the 45° angle
 

331
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,550
angle got it and you're at the 45° angle
so this hip has to follow this foot

332
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
so this hip has to follow this foot
 

333
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,269

attention my line of gravity identified

360
00:10:59,870 --> 00:10:59,880
attention my line of gravity identified
 

361
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,550
attention my line of gravity identified
okay now I can start

362
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
okay now I can start
 

363
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,870
okay now I can start
to go

I do
that I am kind of leaving the line of

370
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:17,079
that I am kind of leaving the line of
 

371
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:19,750
that I am kind of leaving the line of
gravity in this kind of lifted

372
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
gravity in this kind of lifted
 

373
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,030
gravity in this kind of lifted
suspension when I

374
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,040
suspension when I
 

375
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,590
suspension when I
step that's not it okay what I'm doing

376
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
step that's not it okay what I'm doing
 

377

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:29,880
is immed
 

379
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,509
is immed
pushing the line of gravity so option A

380
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:34,519
pushing the line of gravity so option A
 

381
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:41,509
pushing the line of gravity so option A
I step and I drop option b pushing

382
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
I step and I drop option b pushing
 

383
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,829
I step and I drop option b pushing
forward

384
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:44,839

 

385
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,629

okay so I'm here and I'm going to step

386
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:48,639
okay so I'm here and I'm going to step
 

387
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,670
okay so I'm here and I'm going to step
and

388
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
and
 

389
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,550
and
drop now I want this

390

drop now I want this
 

391
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,670
drop now I want this
glute to push me

392
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:56,680

 

393
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,269

forward it's like this stay still

394
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:00,279
forward it's like this stay still
 

395
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,389
forward it's like this stay still
I'm going

396
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:01,399
I'm going
 

397
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,470
I'm going
to step and

398

to step and
 

399
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,870
to step and
drop I'm going to push me

400
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:07,880
drop I'm going to push me
 

401

drop I'm going to push me
forward see that difference okay so you

402
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,200
forward see that difference okay so you
 

403
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,949
forward see that difference okay so you
know you want to get down but you're

404
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
know you want to get down but you're
 

405
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,910
know you want to get down but you're
here and that's

406
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
here and that's
 

407
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:37,670
here and that's
weak drive yourself forward okay try

408
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680

 

409
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,880

okay let's go
