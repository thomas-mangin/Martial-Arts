it for example let's say I make contact

96
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:24,680
it for example let's say I make contact
 

97
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,790
it for example let's say I make contact
and he goes around I'm following the

98
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
and he goes around I'm following the
 

99
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,190
and he goes around I'm following the
weapon do you see that would be one

100
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
weapon do you see that would be one
 

101
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,150

strategy

102
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160

 

103
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,790

um if he in this case I don't have

104
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
um if he in this case I don't have
 

105
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,830
um if he in this case I don't have
contact with the weapon so I have to now

106
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:40,840
contact with the weapon so I have to now
 

107
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,470
contact with the weapon so I have to now
use the other strategy and that is that

108
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
use the other strategy and that is that
 

109
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,550
use the other strategy and that is that
I remained or I I fuse my defense and my

I remained or I I fuse my defense and my
offense so as I'm working for that

112
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
offense so as I'm working for that
 

113
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,790

starting to follow the weapon so I don't

116
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
starting to follow the weapon so I don't
 

117
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,070
starting to follow the weapon so I don't
have contact but you can see see I'm

118
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
have contact but you can see see I'm
 

119
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,990

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:10,440
down on the leg you won't know that
 

125
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,470
down on the leg you won't know that
because you don't have contact with it

that's when I would hit it so if we look

134
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159

and you now look what my Joe is doing

140
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
and you now look what my Joe is doing
 

141
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,910

you'll notice that it's covering my body

142
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:36,920
you'll notice that it's covering my body
 

143
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,149
you'll notice that it's covering my body
as it's trying to figure out what his

144
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:39,159
as it's trying to figure out what his
 

145
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,509
as it's trying to figure out what his
weapon is doing so my defense is

146
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
weapon is doing so my defense is
 

147
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,350
weapon is doing so my defense is
canceling out angles until I know

148

exactly what his weapon is doing boom
this way boom so I could cover the low I

152
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:50,920
this way boom so I could cover the low I
 

153
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,869
this way boom so I could cover the low I
can cover the medium and I can cover the

154
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:53,879
can cover the medium and I can cover the
 

155
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,270

163
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,390
coming High
okay so I need to know how to cover my

164
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
okay so I need to know how to cover my
 

165
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,069
okay so I need to know how to cover my
body but it doesn't mean I'm blocking my

166
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:09,079
body but it doesn't mean I'm blocking my
 

167
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,750
body but it doesn't mean I'm blocking my
body okay so we work like this you could

168
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:12,760
body okay so we work like this you could
 

169
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,030
body okay so we work like this you could
set it up from here there's no reason

170
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
set it up from here there's no reason
 

171
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,830
set it up from here there's no reason
why you

172
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:16,840
why you
 

173
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,909
why you
can't and now this stops in training

174
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
can't and now this stops in training
 

175
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,749
can't and now this stops in training
this stops being an natural sword cut

176
00:04:22,749 --> 00:04:22,759
this stops being an natural sword cut
 

177
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,510
this stops being an natural sword cut
and it becomes the angle that I use to

178
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
and it becomes the angle that I use to
 

179
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,590
and it becomes the angle that I use to
teach me that Fusion of offense and

180
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600
teach me that Fusion of offense and
 

181
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,909
teach me that Fusion of offense and
defense so I move to the right my my

182
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:32,919
defense so I move to the right my my
 

183
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,390
defense so I move to the right my my
weapon comes up my weapon comes up in

184
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400

201
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,629

okay let's try progression one okay so

202
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
okay let's try progression one okay so
 

203
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,350
okay let's try progression one okay so
as I come around you have your outer rim

204
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
as I come around you have your outer rim
 

205
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,310
as I come around you have your outer rim
concept right so you don't want to

206

concept right so you don't want to
 

207
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,070
concept right so you don't want to
defend things outside your outer rim so

208
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
defend things outside your outer rim so
 

209
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,870
defend things outside your outer rim so
my right elbow in particular but you

anything out here with that okay so pay
 

217
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,670
anything out here with that okay so pay
attention my elbow comes up my shoulders

218
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
attention my elbow comes up my shoulders
 

219
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,390
attention my elbow comes up my shoulders
line when I when I do the

220
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
line when I when I do the
 

221
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,870
line when I when I do the
movement likewise if I bring my elbow in

222
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
movement likewise if I bring my elbow in
 

223
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,350
movement likewise if I bring my elbow in
then I didn't Shield that shoulder okay

224
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
then I didn't Shield that shoulder okay
 

225
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,790
then I didn't Shield that shoulder okay
so a lot of people game this part and

226
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
so a lot of people game this part and
 

227
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,430
so a lot of people game this part and
they kind of just go like here like that

228
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
they kind of just go like here like that
 

229
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,110
they kind of just go like here like that
no I don't know what he's going to do so

230
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,120
no I don't know what he's going to do so
 

231
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,029

I gain I I keep my elbow in on that Yang

232
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:52,039
I gain I I keep my elbow in on that Yang
 

233
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,189
I gain I I keep my elbow in on that Yang
line and do the

00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:54,199
line and do the
 

235
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,350
line and do the
movement make yourself smaller so my my

236
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:58,360
movement make yourself smaller so my my
 

237
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,870

00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
tension with that closed grip is to
 

327
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,589
tension with that closed grip is to
bring tension throughout the rest of the

328
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:24,599
bring tension throughout the rest of the
 

329
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,790
bring tension throughout the rest of the
body and that would slow me down at

330
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
body and that would slow me down at
 

331
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,749
body and that would slow me down at
application timing Okay so that fix your

332
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:30,759
application timing Okay so that fix your
 

333
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,469
application timing Okay so that fix your
hands progression two so we come

334
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:35,479
hands progression two so we come
 

335
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,990
hands progression two so we come
around again this is not a cut but right

336
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,000
around again this is not a cut but right
 

337
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,190
around again this is not a cut but right
now it's teaching me the Mind where I

338
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
now it's teaching me the Mind where I
 

339
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,670
now it's teaching me the Mind where I
need to be how far out

340
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
need to be how far out
 

341
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,710
need to be how far out
okay and that means that when we make

342
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:47,720
okay and that means that when we make
 

343
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,190
okay and that means that when we make

application phase this incorrect okay
 

353
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,350
application phase this incorrect okay
this is embryonic training phase so he's

354
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
this is embryonic training phase so he's
 

355
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,509

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:53,880
picture that point in
 

457
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,190
picture that point in
space I'm not going to go forward with

458
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,200
space I'm not going to go forward with
 

459
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,750
space I'm not going to go forward with
it because I'm trying to defend myself

460
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:58,760
it because I'm trying to defend myself
 

461
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,069
it because I'm trying to defend myself
as as long as possible watch what

462

as as long as possible watch what
 

463
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,069
as as long as possible watch what
happens to my angles of defense and went

464
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
happens to my angles of defense and went
 

465
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,110
happens to my angles of defense and went
forward okay as I go forward my head

466
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
forward okay as I go forward my head
 

467
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,990
forward okay as I go forward my head
starts to be

468
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,000
starts to be
 

469
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,829
starts to be
uncovered if I take that point in space

470
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
uncovered if I take that point in space
 

471
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,509
uncovered if I take that point in space
and I move it this

472
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
and I move it this
 

473
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,110
and I move it this
way I start to uncover the left side of

474
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,120
way I start to uncover the left side of
 

475
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,069
way I start to uncover the left side of
my body

476
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:18,079
my body
 

477
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,509
my body
okay so in application Phase there's no

478
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:22,519
okay so in application Phase there's no
 

479
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,870
okay so in application Phase there's no
cross that ever makes contact but

480
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
cross that ever makes contact but
 

481
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,990
cross that ever makes contact but
energetically in terms of attacking

482
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,000
energetically in terms of attacking
 

483
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,310
energetically in terms of attacking
angles and defending angles I keep that

484
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,320
angles and defending angles I keep that
 

485
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,829
angles and defending angles I keep that
cross in place so I keep that point in

486
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:34,839
cross in place so I keep that point in
 

487
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,470
cross in place so I keep that point in
place and you can see the third joob by

488
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:39,480
place and you can see the third joob by
 

489

you hit here how far do you go down is
 

531
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,430
you hit here how far do you go down is
dependent upon when you've captured his

Center you you'll feel his Center you'll

534
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
Center you you'll feel his Center you'll
 

535
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,269
Center you you'll feel his Center you'll
feel the check of the feet and you'll

536
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:48,279
feel the check of the feet and you'll
 

537
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,350
feel the check of the feet and you'll
feel the the projection the faster

538
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
feel the the projection the faster
 

539
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,350
feel the the projection the faster
everything's going the less movement you

540
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
everything's going the less movement you
 

541
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,189
everything's going the less movement you
have to do but this is training this

542
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199
have to do but this is training this
 

543
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,670
have to do but this is training this
embryonic training so I like people to

544
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
embryonic training so I like people to
 

545
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,470
embryonic training so I like people to
train for all the way way down to the

546
00:13:59,470 --> 00:13:59,480
train for all the way way down to the
 

547
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,949
train for all the way way down to the
bottom okay uh and how soon do you

548
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:02,959
bottom okay uh and how soon do you
 

549
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,110
bottom okay uh and how soon do you
capture someone's feet is not only a

550
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
capture someone's feet is not only a
 

551
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,150
capture someone's feet is not only a
matter of how fast you're going but what

552
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
matter of how fast you're going but what
 

553
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,189
matter of how fast you're going but what
is their internalization skill so if he

554
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
is their internalization skill so if he
 

555
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,870
is their internalization skill so if he
can reconcile a lot of energy I probably

556
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:13,880
can reconcile a lot of energy I probably
 

557
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,389
can reconcile a lot of energy I probably
have to go deeper into my action cycle

558
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
have to go deeper into my action cycle
 

559
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,910
have to go deeper into my action cycle
okay so I need to have the skill of

560
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:18,920
okay so I need to have the skill of
 

561
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,269
okay so I need to have the skill of
being able to go all the way to the

562
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:20,279
being able to go all the way to the
 

563
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,870
being able to go all the way to the
ground if I needed to okay so that's

564
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
ground if I needed to okay so that's
 

565
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,870
ground if I needed to okay so that's
what we're doing here one two I'm going

566
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
what we're doing here one two I'm going
 

567
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,230
what we're doing here one two I'm going
to come all the way down all the way

um it's a yinong art and the way that it

640
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
um it's a yinong art and the way that it
 

641
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,710
um it's a yinong art and the way that it
is designed is that you have to have

642
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
is designed is that you have to have
 

643
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,110
is designed is that you have to have
both elements you don't ever go left arm

644
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
both elements you don't ever go left arm
 

645
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,350
both elements you don't ever go left arm
is Yin always right arm is Young always

646
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:26,360
is Yin always right arm is Young always
 

647
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,309
is Yin always right arm is Young always
and nor would you ever have too Yin or

648
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:30,319
and nor would you ever have too Yin or
 

649
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:32,309
and nor would you ever have too Yin or
Too Young you you wouldn't have that

650
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:32,319
