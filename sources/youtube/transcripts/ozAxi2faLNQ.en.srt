00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,189
it again
come on control no I got to here and we

162
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:02,199
come on control no I got to here and we
 

163
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,040
come on control no I got to here and we
we already know right so if I go for

164
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,050
we already know right so if I go for
 

165
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,830
we already know right so if I go for
figure four I come around he extends his

166
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
figure four I come around he extends his
 

167
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,520
figure four I come around he extends his
arm right you'll just take the armbar

168
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:13,530

 

169
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,130

sometimes when I let go of the neck

170
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:16,140
sometimes when I let go of the neck
 

171
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,680
sometimes when I let go of the neck
right now when he decides to pull his

172
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:18,690
right now when he decides to pull his
 

173
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,550
right now when he decides to pull his
arm in she's gonna pull his army so you

174
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
arm in she's gonna pull his army so you
 

175
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,140
arm in she's gonna pull his army so you
should be doing this when you do the

176
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:24,150
should be doing this when you do the
 

177
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,130
should be doing this when you do the
figure four and that is you're trying to

178
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:28,140
figure four and that is you're trying to
 

179
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,910
figure four and that is you're trying to
affect the scapula mechanism you're not

180
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:31,920
affect the scapula mechanism you're not
 

181
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,190
affect the scapula mechanism you're not
trying to tweak this or this so when he

182
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,200
trying to tweak this or this so when he
 

183
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,060
trying to tweak this or this so when he
does that

184
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,070
does that
 

185
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,480
does that
if you lift you're taking everything off

186
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:40,490
if you lift you're taking everything off
 

187
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,390
if you lift you're taking everything off
so consciously aim for the scapula

188
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
so consciously aim for the scapula
 

189
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,310
so consciously aim for the scapula
mechanism okay you have to do it slow

190
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:49,320
mechanism okay you have to do it slow
 

191
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,420
mechanism okay you have to do it slow
because he likely won't feel it so I'll

192
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,430
because he likely won't feel it so I'll
 

193
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,670
because he likely won't feel it so I'll
open it up so you can see and I'm just

194
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
open it up so you can see and I'm just
 

195
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,720
open it up so you can see and I'm just
aiming for the scapula mechanism it's no

196
00:05:59,720 --> 00:05:59,730
aiming for the scapula mechanism it's no
 

197
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,250
aiming for the scapula mechanism it's no
different if wrote me here and I go to

198
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:04,260
different if wrote me here and I go to
 

199
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,730
different if wrote me here and I go to
here right that's the same thing watch

200
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:09,740
here right that's the same thing watch
 

201
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,410
here right that's the same thing watch
you have the same technique you just aim

202
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:12,420
you have the same technique you just aim
 

203
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,080
you have the same technique you just aim
at the scapula mechanism you're gonna

204
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,090
at the scapula mechanism you're gonna
 

205
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,140
at the scapula mechanism you're gonna
get it so let's do this let's start the

206
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,150
get it so let's do this let's start the
 

207
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,610
get it so let's do this let's start the
drill one right to here right everything

208
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:22,620
drill one right to here right everything
 

209
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,700
drill one right to here right everything
is tight I'll open it up for you but I'm

210
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:25,710
is tight I'll open it up for you but I'm
 

211
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,270
is tight I'll open it up for you but I'm
aiming on that scapula mechanism barely

212
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
aiming on that scapula mechanism barely
 

213
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,890
aiming on that scapula mechanism barely
takes anything if you're doing that if

214
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:30,900
takes anything if you're doing that if
 

215
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,350
takes anything if you're doing that if
you're just moving his arm you're not

216
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
you're just moving his arm you're not
 

217
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,190
you're just moving his arm you're not
gonna do it so take me here very slow

218
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,200
gonna do it so take me here very slow
 

219
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,440
gonna do it so take me here very slow
we'll have them then we'll do the other

220
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:39,450
we'll have them then we'll do the other
 

221
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,200
we'll have them then we'll do the other
drill all the way on and then you have

222
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,210
drill all the way on and then you have
 

223
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,180
drill all the way on and then you have
the additional counter they come around

224
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,190
the additional counter they come around
 

225
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,890
the additional counter they come around
and then they bring their arm in you

226
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:45,900
and then they bring their arm in you
 

227
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,110
and then they bring their arm in you
freed the neck hook then you'll attack

228
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,120
freed the neck hook then you'll attack
 

229
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,540
freed the neck hook then you'll attack
the scapula directly okay nice and slow

230
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:50,550
the scapula directly okay nice and slow
 

231
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,800
the scapula directly okay nice and slow
and tap early go
