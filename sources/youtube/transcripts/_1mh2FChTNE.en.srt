gonna rotate around the cross

82
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,220
gonna rotate around the cross
 

83
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,309
gonna rotate around the cross
and it's coming down and I'm gonna

84
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:13,319
and it's coming down and I'm gonna
 

85
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,470
and it's coming down and I'm gonna
rotate around the cross again and

86
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:15,480
rotate around the cross again and
 

87
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,930
rotate around the cross again and
connect

88
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:17,940

 

89
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,710

so you again

90
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:21,720
so you again
 

91
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,610
so you again
this rotating cross pattern is Central

92
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:25,620
this rotating cross pattern is Central
 

93

um
all the

100
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:37,400
all the
 

101
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,630
all the
vectoral manifestations of infinite

102
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:41,640
vectoral manifestations of infinite

potentiality okay

104
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:44,340
potentiality okay
 

105
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,050
potentiality okay
um so you always are have a yin and yang

106
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,060
um so you always are have a yin and yang
 

107
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,850
um so you always are have a yin and yang
line and you're going to rotate them

108
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:49,860
line and you're going to rotate them
 

109
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,369
line and you're going to rotate them
around and in the rotation of them

110
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:52,379
around and in the rotation of them
 

111
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,150
around and in the rotation of them
you're manifesting the uh

112
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
you're manifesting the uh
 

113
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,850
you're manifesting the uh
the reconciliation of them so you have

114
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:58,860
the reconciliation of them so you have
 

115
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,110
the reconciliation of them so you have
it here externally in the form so I have

116
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
it here externally in the form so I have
 

117
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,729
it here externally in the form so I have
a uh one of the yin or young aspects he

118
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:07,739
a uh one of the yin or young aspects he
 

119
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,309
a uh one of the yin or young aspects he
has one of the yin or young aspects so

120
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
has one of the yin or young aspects so
 

121
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,610
has one of the yin or young aspects so
right now I'm currently young he's going

122
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:13,620
right now I'm currently young he's going
 

123
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,649
right now I'm currently young he's going
to go around it

124
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:15,659
to go around it
 

125
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,170
to go around it
and this is going to change the value

126
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,180
and this is going to change the value
 

127
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,589
and this is going to change the value
okay now he's going to be young and I

128
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
okay now he's going to be young and I
 

129
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,930
okay now he's going to be young and I
have subsequently become Yin go ahead

130
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:23,940

boom and there's the attack on the hand

132
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:26,700

version we can see my stock would come

142
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:44,580
version we can see my stock would come
 

143
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,910
version we can see my stock would come
around that would be young

144
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:46,920

he's going to rotate the cross he is now

146
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:49,560
he's going to rotate the cross he is now
 

147
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,610

young and I subsequently became Yin and

148
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:52,620
young and I subsequently became Yin and
 

149
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,430
young and I subsequently became Yin and
there would be the attack

150
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:55,440

 

151
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,250

and I'm going to do it back to him so he

152
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:58,260
and I'm going to do it back to him so he
 

153
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,930
and I'm going to do it back to him so he
rotates around

154
00:03:59,930 --> 00:03:59,940
rotates around
 

155
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,449
rotates around
and I'm going to rotate around here and

156
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:02,459
and I'm going to rotate around here and
 

157
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:17,600
and I'm going to rotate around here and
then stick with him
