struggling with the lower body
 

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,630
struggling with the lower body
especially the glute and the C and and I

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:57,640
especially the glute and the C and and I
 

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,270
especially the glute and the C and and I
do think that comes afterwards

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,280
do think that comes afterwards
 

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,310

things yeah feel the um this tension
coming in then trying to release out of

30
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,320
coming in then trying to release out of
 

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,310
coming in then trying to release out of
it and feeling kind of goes and then

32
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
it and feeling kind of goes and then
 

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,590
it and feeling kind of goes and then
coming back fluu okay and so it's in

34
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
coming back fluu okay and so it's in
 

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,469
coming back fluu okay and so it's in
that upper arm shoulder area bicep area

36
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
that upper arm shoulder area bicep area
 

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,990
that upper arm shoulder area bicep area
okay Maya are you feeling that too yeah

38
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,000
okay Maya are you feeling that too yeah
 

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,469
okay Maya are you feeling that too yeah
my Delta okay yeah in the deltoid so

40
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
my Delta okay yeah in the deltoid so
 

41
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,230
my Delta okay yeah in the deltoid so
you're at a later phase where you can

42
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,240
you're at a later phase where you can
 

43
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,149
you're at a later phase where you can
relax and release the shoulders but the

44
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
relax and release the shoulders but the
 

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,469
relax and release the shoulders but the
lower legs is there so the first thing

46
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:37,479
lower legs is there so the first thing
 

47
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,990
lower legs is there so the first thing
and I agree the very first place is you

48
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
and I agree the very first place is you
 

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,950
and I agree the very first place is you
have to learn how to release the the the

50
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:41,960
have to learn how to release the the the
 

51
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,310
have to learn how to release the the the
arms the upper torso um so let's address

52
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
arms the upper torso um so let's address
 

53
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,190
arms the upper torso um so let's address
that okay so

54
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,200
that okay so
 

55
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,270
that okay so
um and again this is a progression drill

56
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
um and again this is a progression drill
 

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,230
um and again this is a progression drill
to cultiv skill in beginners it's not

58
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
to cultiv skill in beginners it's not
 

59
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,029
to cultiv skill in beginners it's not
necessarily how you do it uh and and

60
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:00,039
necessarily how you do it uh and and
 

61
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,950
necessarily how you do it uh and and
it's definitely not how you would apply

62
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:01,960
it's definitely not how you would apply
 

63
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,830
it's definitely not how you would apply
it in an application field okay so what

64
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:04,840
it in an application field okay so what
 

65
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,910
it in an application field okay so what
I want you to do um is I want you to

66
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:08,920
I want you to do um is I want you to
 

67
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,430
I want you to do um is I want you to
turn your elbow underneath elbow

68
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
turn your elbow underneath elbow
 

69
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,430
turn your elbow underneath elbow
underneath don't have the elbow on the

70
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
underneath don't have the elbow on the
 

71
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,309
underneath don't have the elbow on the
side if you pay attention when your

72
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
side if you pay attention when your
 

73
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,390
side if you pay attention when your
elbow is on the side you actually

74
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:19,400
elbow is on the side you actually
 

75
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,990
elbow is on the side you actually
violated the Y Line it's outside your

76
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
violated the Y Line it's outside your
 

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,550
violated the Y Line it's outside your
outer rim it's a very common mistake

78
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:25,560
outer rim it's a very common mistake
 

79
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,150
outer rim it's a very common mistake
this is very comfortable to us and so

80
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
this is very comfortable to us and so
 

81
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,350
this is very comfortable to us and so
we're used to doing that but you already

82
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:30,360
we're used to doing that but you already
 

83
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,589
we're used to doing that but you already
wrong okay you turn that elbow

84
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
wrong okay you turn that elbow
 

85
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,869
wrong okay you turn that elbow
underneath I'm not asking you to drop

86
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:35,879
underneath I'm not asking you to drop
 

87
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,790
underneath I'm not asking you to drop
his hand there I just make sure the

88
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
his hand there I just make sure the
 

89
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,190
his hand there I just make sure the
elbow's underneath you see that

90
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,200
elbow's underneath you see that
 

91
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,190
elbow's underneath you see that
okay and now make sure that you keep it

92
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,200
okay and now make sure that you keep it
 

93
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,790
okay and now make sure that you keep it
in katatori

94
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:49,800
in katatori
 

95
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,750
in katatori
articulation don't come back so two

96
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:52,760
articulation don't come back so two
 

97
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,630
articulation don't come back so two
mistakes is your elbows on the side

98
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:55,640
mistakes is your elbows on the side
 

99
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,710
mistakes is your elbows on the side
you're going to activate that just just

100
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:57,720
you're going to activate that just just
 

101
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,229
you're going to activate that just just
automatically it's going to happen okay

102
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
automatically it's going to happen okay
 

103
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,869
automatically it's going to happen okay
and then you come back and your bicep is

104
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
and then you come back and your bicep is
 

105
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,509
and then you come back and your bicep is
going to do it you combine the two and

106
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:04,519
going to do it you combine the two and
 

107
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,149
going to do it you combine the two and
you get two okay so we are going to

108
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:07,159
you get two okay so we are going to
 

109
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,229
you get two okay so we are going to
start at the physical level for the

110
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:09,239
start at the physical level for the
 

111
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,390
start at the physical level for the
person getting going okay and your

112
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
person getting going okay and your
 

113
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,869
person getting going okay and your
elbow's going to be

114
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:13,879
elbow's going to be
 

115
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,550
elbow's going to be
underneath and you're going to keep the

116
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
underneath and you're going to keep the
 

117
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,910
underneath and you're going to keep the
katatori

118

angle so he's going to go and this is a

120
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:20,840
angle so he's going to go and this is a
 

121
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,949
angle so he's going to go and this is a
lot of skeletal alignment it's fine as

122
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:23,959
lot of skeletal alignment it's fine as
 

123
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,750
lot of skeletal alignment it's fine as
you start to feel it's going out I don't

124
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:26,760
you start to feel it's going out I don't
 

125
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,910
you start to feel it's going out I don't
know if you can tell you just pull it

126
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:28,920
know if you can tell you just pull it
 

127
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,390
know if you can tell you just pull it
back under pull it back under pull it

back under pull it back under pull it
 

129
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,869
back under pull it back under pull it
back under and your goal is going to be

130
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:35,879
back under and your goal is going to be
 

131
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,869
back under and your goal is going to be
hey just keep this shape keep that shape

135
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,229

shape that's that's going to be your

136
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:47,239
shape that's that's going to be your
 

137
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,190
shape that's that's going to be your
thing I don't want you to entertain

138
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,200
thing I don't want you to entertain
 

139
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,589

anything about releasing or anything

140
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:52,599
anything about releasing or anything
 

141
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,630
anything about releasing or anything
you're going to just get skeletal

142
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
you're going to just get skeletal
 

143
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,630
you're going to just get skeletal
alignment first elbow underneath

144
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640

 

145
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,830

angle so how much do I bend my elbow

146
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:02,840
angle so how much do I bend my elbow
 

147
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,069
angle so how much do I bend my elbow
that's that's what you're doing there

148

okay we're here hit that shape the next
 

151
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,390
okay we're here hit that shape the next
thing you can work on is with the

152
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
thing you can work on is with the
 

153
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,470
thing you can work on is with the
skeletal alignment is the ground

154
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
skeletal alignment is the ground
 

155
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,030
skeletal alignment is the ground
vectoring so you should feel it

156
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
vectoring so you should feel it
 

157
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,909
vectoring so you should feel it
here going to feel it on that ground

158
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
here going to feel it on that ground
 

159
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,629
here going to feel it on that ground
midfoot on the back foot so as he's

cultivating tool in the ballp part and I

342
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
cultivating tool in the ballp part and I
 

343
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,670
cultivating tool in the ballp part and I
do learn one skill that I will use

344
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
do learn one skill that I will use
 

345
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,949
do learn one skill that I will use
continuously and that is how to take

346
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:33,959
continuously and that is how to take

00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,430
continuously and that is how to take
this energy that's going straight over

348
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:36,440
this energy that's going straight over
 

349
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,509
this energy that's going straight over
there and revor it so that it's going

350
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
there and revor it so that it's going
 

351
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,949
there and revor it so that it's going
down

down
 

353
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,470
down
okay and now from

okay and now from
there you start to release the muscle

356
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
there you start to release the muscle
 

357
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,470

I'm doing that then the next progression

558
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,480
I'm doing that then the next progression
 

559
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,189
I'm doing that then the next progression
was hey take take out tension out of out

560
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:00,199
was hey take take out tension out of out

um the next one is because the hand was
 

565
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,350
um the next one is because the hand was
not relevant to the form to the

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,189
not relevant to the form to the
structure I've been tasked with then I

568
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:14,199
structure I've been tasked with then I
 

569
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,110

can keep any shape with it and the shape

570

my hand was not relevant so I keep L
 

619
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,230
my hand was not relevant so I keep L
long so the feeling in this hand he's

620
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:33,240
long so the feeling in this hand he's
 

621
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,550
long so the feeling in this hand he's
pushing this whole time I'm talking and

pushing this whole time I'm talking and
 

623
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,790
pushing this whole time I'm talking and
the feeling in this hand is exactly the

624
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:37,800
the feeling in this hand is exactly the

calves I don't know that I have the
 

669
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,190
calves I don't know that I have the
awareness in my body to feel it in the

670
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
awareness in my body to feel it in the
 

671
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,270
awareness in my body to feel it in the
calves yet but I definitely feel it in

00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:13,679
the swimmer muscle right in the front of
 

675
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,470
the swimmer muscle right in the front of
the shin at Min one when I start asking

676
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
the shin at Min one when I start asking
 

677
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,149
the shin at Min one when I start asking
for a lot more and get pressed and then

678
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:23,159
for a lot more and get pressed and then
 

679
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:25,149
for a lot more and get pressed and then
have to try to that's where I feel it

have to try to that's where I feel it
 

681
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,870
have to try to that's where I feel it
and then have to yeah try to release

682
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:27,880
and then have to yeah try to release
 

683
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,470
and then have to yeah try to release
yeah I if you pay

684
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
yeah I if you pay
 

685
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,950
yeah I if you pay
attention uh I would say it's like from

686
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:33,960
attention uh I would say it's like from
 

687
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,909
attention uh I would say it's like from
the lower

688
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
the lower
 

689
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,390
the lower
back uh the lumbar region down so it

690
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:39,400
back uh the lumbar region down so it
 

691
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,590
back uh the lumbar region down so it
goes through the glutes through the

692
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:41,600
goes through the glutes through the
 

693
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,029
goes through the glutes through the
groins uh through the upper legs through

694
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
groins uh through the upper legs through
 

695
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,549
groins uh through the upper legs through
your knee joints all your lower leg all

696
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
your knee joints all your lower leg all
 

697
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,590
your knee joints all your lower leg all
the way down to your feet is where the

698
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:50,600
the way down to your feet is where the
 

699
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,909
the way down to your feet is where the
tension is so we've been you you right

700
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:53,919
tension is so we've been you you right
 

701
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,270
tension is so we've been you you right
you've been working lately on keeping

702
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:56,280
you've been working lately on keeping
 

703
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,110
you've been working lately on keeping
your

704
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
your
 

705
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,190
your
metatarsals on flat fed you see so your

706
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
metatarsals on flat fed you see so your
 

707
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,390
metatarsals on flat fed you see so your
metatarsals are flexing then the tendons

708
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,400
metatarsals are flexing then the tendons
 

709
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,029
metatarsals are flexing then the tendons
running through the lower leg are tense

710
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:08,039
running through the lower leg are tense
 

711
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:14,590
running through the lower leg are tense
okay um so yeah where where you feel the

712
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:14,600
okay um so yeah where where you feel the
 

713
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,310
okay um so yeah where where you feel the
tension is very much related to your

714
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
tension is very much related to your
 

715
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,190
tension is very much related to your
awareness of the tension so the tension

716
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,200
awareness of the tension so the tension
 

717
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,909
awareness of the tension so the tension
is happening so for example when your

718
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:23,919
is happening so for example when your
 

719
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,070
is happening so for example when your
feet were flexing and going all over the

720
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
feet were flexing and going all over the
 

721
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,789
feet were flexing and going all over the
place you really weren't aware of it

722
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:27,799
place you really weren't aware of it
 

723
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,310
place you really weren't aware of it
until relatively recently do you see it

724
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
until relatively recently do you see it
 

725
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,390
until relatively recently do you see it
was doing it all these years but you

726
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
was doing it all these years but you
 

727
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,430
was doing it all these years but you
weren't aware of it so you have an

728
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
weren't aware of it so you have an
 

729
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,430
weren't aware of it so you have an
awareness level that's feeling it there

730
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:38,440
awareness level that's feeling it there
 

731
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,029
awareness level that's feeling it there
but you should know it's from the lumbar

732
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
but you should know it's from the lumbar
 

733
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,710
but you should know it's from the lumbar
region down okay and someone might feel

734
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
region down okay and someone might feel
 

735
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,390
region down okay and someone might feel
it more in the lower legs as opposed to

736
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
it more in the lower legs as opposed to
 

737
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,990
it more in the lower legs as opposed to
from the lumbar region down does that

738
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,000
from the lumbar region down does that
 

739
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,950
from the lumbar region down does that
make sense okay so it's all there now

740
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:53,960
make sense okay so it's all there now
 

741
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,070
make sense okay so it's all there now
you just have to work with where's your

742
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
you just have to work with where's your
 

743
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,310
you just have to work with where's your
awareness so start there it's in the

744
00:19:59,310 --> 00:19:59,320
awareness so start there it's in the
 

745
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,830
awareness so start there it's in the
lower half of the body we know that so

746
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:01,840
lower half of the body we know that so
 

747
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,029
lower half of the body we know that so
you you're aware of the one on the front

748
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:04,039
you you're aware of the one on the front
 

749
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,669
you you're aware of the one on the front
of the lower leg okay start there you're

750
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:06,679
of the lower leg okay start there you're
 

751
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:08,270
of the lower leg okay start there you're
also aware of the one running through

752
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:08,280
also aware of the one running through
 

753
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,029
also aware of the one running through
the foot so start there and as you get

754
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:11,039
the foot so start there and as you get
 

755
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,029
the foot so start there and as you get
more awareness and you start

756
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:14,039
more awareness and you start
 

757
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,029
more awareness and you start
problematizing that flexion you're going

758
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:16,039
problematizing that flexion you're going
 

759
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:19,830
problematizing that flexion you're going
to see ah it's from the lumbar down

760
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:19,840
to see ah it's from the lumbar down
 

761
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,070
to see ah it's from the lumbar down
because you're going to go from region

762
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,080
because you're going to go from region
 

763
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,669
because you're going to go from region
to region as you get get there okay so

764
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679
to region as you get get there okay so
 

765
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,230
to region as you get get there okay so
just work from there okay where where

766
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,240
just work from there okay where where
 

767
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,070
just work from there okay where where
did you

768
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,080
did you
 

769
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,430
did you
have noticing the the sort of down

770
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:30,440
have noticing the the sort of down
 

771
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,750
have noticing the the sort of down
spiraling capacity in any one rep if the

772
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
spiraling capacity in any one rep if the
 

773
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,510
spiraling capacity in any one rep if the
thought came in oh I'm not getting it it

774
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:36,520
thought came in oh I'm not getting it it
 

775
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,549
thought came in oh I'm not getting it it
became very hard to pull out of that

776
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
became very hard to pull out of that
 

777
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,350
became very hard to pull out of that
thought and try to back into the Rel yes

778
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,360
thought and try to back into the Rel yes
 

779
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,390
thought and try to back into the Rel yes
it is so if you look back at what the

780
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
it is so if you look back at what the
 

781
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,510
it is so if you look back at what the
teacher

does everyone understand that and so

1042
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,240
does everyone understand that and so
 

1043
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,830
does everyone understand that and so
we're

1044

we're
 

1045
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,789
we're
progressing as soon or later you're not

1046
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,799
progressing as soon or later you're not
 

1047

progressing as soon or later you're not
going to be able to progress okay so but

1048
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:31,520
going to be able to progress okay so but
 

1049
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,950
going to be able to progress okay so but
you have to get the first skill okay so

1050
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:33,960
you have to get the first skill okay so
 

1051
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,789
you have to get the first skill okay so
if I remember uh as we were going back

1052
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:37,799
if I remember uh as we were going back
 

1053
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,110
if I remember uh as we were going back
through these progressions I'm

1054
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,120
through these progressions I'm
 

1055
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,230
through these progressions I'm
reflecting back you still couldn't keep

1056
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,240
reflecting back you still couldn't keep
 

1057
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,430
reflecting back you still couldn't keep
your elbow in katatori

1058
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,440
your elbow in katatori
 

1059
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,630
your elbow in katatori
okay and that's very important because

1060
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
okay and that's very important because
 

1061
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,750
okay and that's very important because
your elbow in

1062
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
your elbow in
 

1063
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,149
your elbow in
katad in in the beginning progressions

1064
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:53,159
katad in in the beginning progressions
 

1065
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:56,070
katad in in the beginning progressions
it was looked at a degree of

1066
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
it was looked at a degree of
 

1067
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,070
it was looked at a degree of
rotation but in this progression since

1068
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,080
rotation but in this progression since
 

1069
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,070
rotation but in this progression since
you don't have a forearm it's looked at

1070
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
you don't have a forearm it's looked at
 

1071
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,630
you don't have a forearm it's looked at
as how far away is your elbow from your

1072
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:04,640
as how far away is your elbow from your
 

1073
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,389
as how far away is your elbow from your
torso do you see that so as you increase

1074
00:28:07,389 --> 00:28:07,399
torso do you see that so as you increase
 

1075
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:10,470
torso do you see that so as you increase
the degrees of rotation in your elbow in

1076
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:10,480
the degrees of rotation in your elbow in
 

1077
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,470
the degrees of rotation in your elbow in
the earlier progressions your elbow is

1078
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:13,480
the earlier progressions your elbow is
 

1079
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,110
the earlier progressions your elbow is
now closer to your

1080
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,120
now closer to your
 

1081
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,590
now closer to your
body and because your upper arm is a

1082
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:18,600
body and because your upper arm is a
 

1083
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,269
body and because your upper arm is a
lever around an axis the shoulder it's

1084
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:23,279
lever around an axis the shoulder it's
 

1085
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,549
lever around an axis the shoulder it's
getting lower which we corrected on you

1086
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:27,559
getting lower which we corrected on you
 

1087
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,269
getting lower which we corrected on you
on the last little coaching right I came

1088
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:31,279
on the last little coaching right I came

1092
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:36,919
it's going down okay so we don't you
 

1093
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:39,750
it's going down okay so we don't you
could look at it either way don't bring

1094
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:39,760
could look at it either way don't bring
 

1095
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,830
could look at it either way don't bring
your elbow down don't bring your elbow

1096
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:42,840
your elbow down don't bring your elbow
 

1097
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,389
your elbow down don't bring your elbow
close to your body don't increase the

1098
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:45,399
close to your body don't increase the
 

1099
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:48,389
close to your body don't increase the
degrees of articulation in your elbow

1100
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
degrees of articulation in your elbow
 

1101
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,110
degrees of articulation in your elbow
that it's all the same problem okay so

1102
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,120
that it's all the same problem okay so
 

1103
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,029
that it's all the same problem okay so
you need to figure out uh where is that

1104
00:28:56,029 --> 00:28:56,039
you need to figure out uh where is that
 

1105
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,310
you need to figure out uh where is that
Groove so to speak where is that

1106
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:58,320
Groove so to speak where is that
 

1107
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,350
Groove so to speak where is that
organization that your teacher wants you

1108
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:00,360
organization that your teacher wants you
 

1109
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,789
organization that your teacher wants you
to be in well the best progression for

1110
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:02,799
to be in well the best progression for
 

1111
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,389
to be in well the best progression for
that is the earlier the earlier ones

1112
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:05,399
that is the earlier the earlier ones
 

1113
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:08,549
that is the earlier the earlier ones
okay we are now at a point where you

1114
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:08,559
okay we are now at a point where you
 

1115
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,590
okay we are now at a point where you
didn't have your elbow where it needs to

1116
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:10,600
didn't have your elbow where it needs to
 

1117
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,269
didn't have your elbow where it needs to
be meaning you did not have the

1118
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:12,279
be meaning you did not have the
 

1119
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:15,950
be meaning you did not have the
prescribed or organization and so now

1120
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:15,960
prescribed or organization and so now
 

1121
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,590
prescribed or organization and so now
this drill is not doable so you got to

1122
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:18,600
this drill is not doable so you got to
 

1123
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,630
this drill is not doable so you got to

1132
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:30,640
you got to get the skill but we have
 

1133
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,430
you got to get the skill but we have
other levels here so we're moving on

1134
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:36,440

 

1135
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,909

1140
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:47,320
come up to the uh come up to the elbow
 

1141
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,269
come up to the uh come up to the elbow
and we come up to the elbow and my arm

1142
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:49,279
and we come up to the elbow and my arm
 

1143
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,269
and we come up to the elbow and my arm
is not holding me in

1144
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:51,279
is not holding me in
 

1145
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,350
is not holding me in
space then clearly muscle tension was

1146
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:54,360
space then clearly muscle tension was
 

1147
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,830
space then clearly muscle tension was
not important in my in my forearm do you

1148
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,840
not important in my in my forearm do you
 

1149
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,830
not important in my in my forearm do you
understand was it it's not important you

1150
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
understand was it it's not important you
 

1151
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,630
understand was it it's not important you
can just keep the elbow in space I just

1152
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:01,640
can just keep the elbow in space I just
 

1153
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,950
can just keep the elbow in space I just
keep the elbow in space that's what I

1154
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:02,960
keep the elbow in space that's what I
 

1155
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,430
keep the elbow in space that's what I
just proed okay but the same thing as

1156
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:06,440
just proed okay but the same thing as
 

1157
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,710
just proed okay but the same thing as
the elbow is related to the uh to the

1158
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:10,720
the elbow is related to the uh to the
 

1159
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,990
the elbow is related to the uh to the
wrist if I if my elbow collaps in space

1160
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,000
wrist if I if my elbow collaps in space
 

1161
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,710
wrist if I if my elbow collaps in space
then it's not going to matter how much

1162
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:15,720
then it's not going to matter how much
 

1163
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,990
then it's not going to matter how much
tension I put in the forearm the

1164
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,000
tension I put in the forearm the
 

1165
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,350
tension I put in the forearm the
shoulder works the same way so if the

1166
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:20,360
shoulder works the same way so if the
 

1167
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,789
shoulder works the same way so if the
shoulder can't be strong then the

1168
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:22,799
shoulder can't be strong then the
 

1169
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,350
shoulder can't be strong then the
elbow's not strong you see that so we'll

1170
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:25,360
elbow's not strong you see that so we'll
 

1171
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,549
elbow's not strong you see that so we'll
climb up okay and if you need to I don't

1172
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:28,559
climb up okay and if you need to I don't
 

1173
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,350
climb up okay and if you need to I don't
care how relaxed you are but if you can

1174
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,360
care how relaxed you are but if you can
 

1175
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,389
care how relaxed you are but if you can
L gone you keep loud gone cuz loud going

1176
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:32,399
L gone you keep loud gone cuz loud going
 

1177
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,470
L gone you keep loud gone cuz loud going
is relaxed do we climb up I'm going to

1178
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,480
is relaxed do we climb up I'm going to
 

1179
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,149
is relaxed do we climb up I'm going to
do a little quickly so the video is not

1180
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:36,159
do a little quickly so the video is not
 

1181
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,110
do a little quickly so the video is not
too long and he'll climb up to the

1182
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,120
too long and he'll climb up to the
 

1183
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,070
too long and he'll climb up to the
shoulder and I keep the same feeling and

1184
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,080
shoulder and I keep the same feeling and
 

1185
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,710
shoulder and I keep the same feeling and
I you can be

1186
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:42,720
I you can be
 

1187
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,870
I you can be
here right you kind of just relax if you

1188
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:45,880
here right you kind of just relax if you
 

1189
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,350
here right you kind of just relax if you
need to relax because the arms are not

1190
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:48,360
need to relax because the arms are not
 

1191
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,470
need to relax because the arms are not
relevant to what I'm doing and then we

1192
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,480
relevant to what I'm doing and then we
 

1193
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,710
relevant to what I'm doing and then we
go out which means I got to

1194
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:52,720
go out which means I got to
 

1195
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,389
go out which means I got to
refine where it

1196
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:55,399
refine where it
 

1197
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:59,029
refine where it
is and we climb back out push push push

1198
00:30:59,029 --> 00:30:59,039
is and we climb back out push push push
 

1199
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,909
is and we climb back out push push push
we climb back out okay I'll do it again

1200
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:01,919
we climb back out okay I'll do it again
 

1201
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,990
we climb back out okay I'll do it again
as if I started the drill he's driving I

1202
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,000
as if I started the drill he's driving I
 

1203
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,830
as if I started the drill he's driving I
start to give him the elbow I give him

1204
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:06,840
start to give him the elbow I give him
 

1205
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,909
start to give him the elbow I give him
the elbow he's driving I start to give

1206
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:09,919
the elbow he's driving I start to give
 

1207
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,750
the elbow he's driving I start to give
him the

1208
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:11,760
him the
 

1209
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,269
him the
shoulder nothing changes he's pushing

1210
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:14,279
shoulder nothing changes he's pushing
 

1211
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,070
shoulder nothing changes he's pushing
push push push push push push push push

push push push everything is just going
 

1215
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,310
push push push everything is just going
down there's no leaning or anything I'm

1216
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,320
down there's no leaning or anything I'm
 

1217
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,789
down there's no leaning or anything I'm
just here and then I want you to come up

1218
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
just here and then I want you to come up
 

1219
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,789
just here and then I want you to come up
give him the elbow keep everything the

1220
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:24,799
give him the elbow keep everything the
 

1221
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,669
give him the elbow keep everything the
same and you come out I'm doing it

1222
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:26,679
same and you come out I'm doing it
 

1223
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:28,230
same and you come out I'm doing it
faster than I want you to do it and

1224
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,240
faster than I want you to do it and
 

1225
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,629
faster than I want you to do it and
you're back out okay so there's no

1226
00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:31,639
you're back out okay so there's no
 

1227
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,830
you're back out okay so there's no
tension involved if there was tension I

1228
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:33,840
tension involved if there was tension I
 

1229
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,430
tension involved if there was tension I
wouldn't be able to take the arms away

1230
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,440
wouldn't be able to take the arms away
 

1231
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,110
wouldn't be able to take the arms away
we just don't fig we haven't figured

1232
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,120
we just don't fig we haven't figured
 

1233
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,830
we just don't fig we haven't figured
that out yet okay but it's the clear

1234
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:40,840
that out yet okay but it's the clear
 

1235
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,149
that out yet okay but it's the clear
scientific experiment that muscle

1236
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:43,159
scientific experiment that muscle
 

1237
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:45,590
scientific experiment that muscle
tension had nothing to do with it in the

1238
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:45,600
tension had nothing to do with it in the
 

1239
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,389
tension had nothing to do with it in the
arm had nothing to do with it there's a

1240
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:48,399
arm had nothing to do with it there's a
 

1241
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,870
arm had nothing to do with it there's a
structural Integrity in the shoulder

1242
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:52,880
structural Integrity in the shoulder
 

1243
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,990
structural Integrity in the shoulder
obviously but it's not in the arm you

1244
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,000
obviously but it's not in the arm you
 

1245
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,430
obviously but it's not in the arm you
got that so just kind of be a

1246
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:58,440
got that so just kind of be a
 

1247
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,830
got that so just kind of be a
kinesiologist or physiologist right now

1248
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:01,840
kinesiologist or physiologist right now
 

1249
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,509
kinesiologist or physiologist right now
where is the tension that's keeping the

1250
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:04,519
where is the tension that's keeping the
 

1251
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,629
where is the tension that's keeping the
shoulder in

1252
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:06,639
shoulder in
 

1253
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:10,430
shoulder in
space it's not in the upper arm it's not

1254
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:10,440
space it's not in the upper arm it's not
 

1255
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,629
space it's not in the upper arm it's not
in the shoulder muscle it's not in the

1256
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:12,639
in the shoulder muscle it's not in the
 

1257
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,710
in the shoulder muscle it's not in the
forearm it's not in the half what's

1258
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:14,720
forearm it's not in the half what's
 

1259
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,070
forearm it's not in the half what's
keeping the shoulder in

1260
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,080
keeping the shoulder in
 

1261
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,190
keeping the shoulder in
space yep Bouch you got it the whole

1262
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,200
space yep Bouch you got it the whole
 

1263
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,669
space yep Bouch you got it the whole
freaking structure here got it to just

1264
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:22,679
freaking structure here got it to just
 

1265
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,470
freaking structure here got it to just
hold the structure which is what you

1266
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,480
hold the structure which is what you
 

1267
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,750
hold the structure which is what you
were supposed to do here in the

1268
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:25,760
were supposed to do here in the
 

1269
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,350
were supposed to do here in the
beginning but we were like nope it's got

1270
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:28,360
beginning but we were like nope it's got
 

1271
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,710
beginning but we were like nope it's got
to be my hand it's got to be my forearm

1272
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:30,720
to be my hand it's got to be my forearm
 

1273
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,350
to be my hand it's got to be my forearm
it's got to be my upper arm it's got to

1274
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:32,360
it's got to be my upper arm it's got to
 

1275
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,870
it's got to be my upper arm it's got to
be my OU outer delto it's not just my

1276
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:35,880
be my OU outer delto it's not just my
 

1277
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,909
be my OU outer delto it's not just my
whole body here okay so let's focus on

1278
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:38,919
whole body here okay so let's focus on
 

1279
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:41,029
whole body here okay so let's focus on
that I don't want you to give that up

Andrew keep mushing me all over the

1348
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:17,320
Andrew keep mushing me all over the
 

1349
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,190
Andrew keep mushing me all over the
place mushing me all over the place

1350
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:20,200
place mushing me all over the place
 

1351
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,550
place mushing me all over the place
mushing on me all over the

1352
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:22,560
mushing on me all over the
 

1353
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,389
mushing on me all over the
place wishing

1354
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:25,399
place wishing
 

1355
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:30,190
place wishing
all okay

1356
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:30,200

 

1357
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:38,389

um the drill isn't going to work if

1358
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:38,399

 

1359
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,310

I'm that's not the drill okay the drill

1360
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,320
I'm that's not the drill okay the drill
 

1361
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,230
I'm that's not the drill okay the drill
is to get my body mind to realize it's

1362
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,240
is to get my body mind to realize it's
 

1363
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,710
is to get my body mind to realize it's
not what I think it is okay and so the

1364
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:50,720
not what I think it is okay and so the
 

1365
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,790
not what I think it is okay and so the
logic here again is if your if your hand

1366
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:54,800
logic here again is if your if your hand
 

1367
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,910
logic here again is if your if your hand
was able to hold out there it had

1368
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:57,920
was able to hold out there it had
 

1369
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,470
was able to hold out there it had
nothing to do with

1370
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,480
nothing to do with
 

1371
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,150
nothing to do with
tension and if your wrist is able to

1372
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:03,160
tension and if your wrist is able to
 

1373
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,230
tension and if your wrist is able to
have hold out there it had nothing to do

1374
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,240
have hold out there it had nothing to do
 

1375
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,030
have hold out there it had nothing to do
with forearm tension it had to do with

1376
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,040
with forearm tension it had to do with
 

1377
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,990
with forearm tension it had to do with
structural integrity and space of the

1378
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,000
structural integrity and space of the
 

1379
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,910
structural integrity and space of the
elbow so you could take that away if I

1380
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:12,920
elbow so you could take that away if I
 

1381
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,670
elbow so you could take that away if I
could take it away then that me it could

1382
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:14,680
could take it away then that me it could
 

1383
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,150
could take it away then that me it could
have stayed just relaxed the whole

1384
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:17,160
have stayed just relaxed the whole
 

1385
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,550
have stayed just relaxed the whole
forearm to make it old lady mushing okay

1386
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:21,560
forearm to make it old lady mushing okay
 

1387
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,069
forearm to make it old lady mushing okay
and then the same

1388
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:23,079
and then the same
 

1389
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,069
and then the same
thing the only reason this is in space

1390
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:26,079
thing the only reason this is in space
 

1391
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,230
thing the only reason this is in space
is because the shoulders in space got it

1392
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,240
is because the shoulders in space got it
 

1393
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,069
is because the shoulders in space got it
okay and so then I don't can I can take

1394
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:34,079
okay and so then I don't can I can take
 

1395
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,150
okay and so then I don't can I can take
that away we're not going anywhere and

1396
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:37,160
that away we're not going anywhere and
 

1397
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,150
that away we're not going anywhere and
then that would have meant that I don't

1398
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,160
then that would have meant that I don't
 

1399
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,670
then that would have meant that I don't
need upper arm tension I don't

1400
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:42,680
need upper arm tension I don't
 

1401
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,870
need upper arm tension I don't
need lower arm lower arm tension I don't

1402
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:45,880
need lower arm lower arm tension I don't
 

1403
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,470
need lower arm lower arm tension I don't
need hand tension don't think of it

1404
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:48,480
need hand tension don't think of it
 

1405
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,710
need hand tension don't think of it
faster cuz your your ego trip part mind

1406
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:51,720
faster cuz your your ego trip part mind
 

1407
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,069
faster cuz your your ego trip part mind
is going to go right back and you

1408
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:54,079
is going to go right back and you
 

1409
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,870
is going to go right back and you
all up okay um some other things things

1410
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:58,880
all up okay um some other things things
 

1411
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,109
all up okay um some other things things
for example if my shoulder is in space

1412
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:02,119
for example if my shoulder is in space
 

1413
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,470
for example if my shoulder is in space
we'll go a little

1414
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:03,480
we'll go a little
 

1415
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,950
we'll go a little
quicker on my shoulder okay he's driving

1416
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:06,960
quicker on my shoulder okay he's driving
 

1417
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,750
quicker on my shoulder okay he's driving
you got it he's driving I know and we're

1418
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:09,760
you got it he's driving I know and we're
 

1419
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,190
you got it he's driving I know and we're
not going to do it tonight but just want

1420
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,200
not going to do it tonight but just want
 

1421
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,829
not going to do it tonight but just want
to show you you're thinking that there's

1422
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
to show you you're thinking that there's
 

1423
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,470
to show you you're thinking that there's
a skeletal

1424
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:15,480
a skeletal
 

1425
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,589
a skeletal
alignment do do you understand like

1426
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:17,599
alignment do do you understand like
 

1427
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,630
alignment do do you understand like
you're thinking I'm sideways to

1428
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:20,640
you're thinking I'm sideways to
 

1429
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,390
you're thinking I'm sideways to
him but his line is over

1430
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:25,400
him but his line is over
 

1431
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,790
him but his line is over
my that shoulders that should line so it

1432
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:28,800
my that shoulders that should line so it
 

1433
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,790
my that shoulders that should line so it
doesn't it again doesn't matter if he's

1434
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:30,800
doesn't it again doesn't matter if he's
 

1435
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,710
doesn't it again doesn't matter if he's
somewhere else pushing at an angle you

1436
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:34,720
somewhere else pushing at an angle you
 

1437
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,990
somewhere else pushing at an angle you
see that he's I've not we're not on the

1438
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,000
see that he's I've not we're not on the
 

1439
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,390
see that he's I've not we're not on the
skeletal not on the skeletal alignment

1440
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:40,400
skeletal not on the skeletal alignment
 

1441
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,510
skeletal not on the skeletal alignment
and so if I if I wasn't on the skeletal

1442
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:42,520
and so if I if I wasn't on the skeletal
 

1443
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,470
and so if I if I wasn't on the skeletal
alignment he's driving drive drive drive

1444
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:44,480
alignment he's driving drive drive drive
 

1445
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,349
alignment he's driving drive drive drive
drive drive drive drive and it does I

1446
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:46,359
drive drive drive drive and it does I
 

1447
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:49,230
drive drive drive drive and it does I
don't even need the on you can do

1448
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:49,240
don't even need the on you can do
 

1449
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,790
don't even need the on you can do
whatever you

1450
