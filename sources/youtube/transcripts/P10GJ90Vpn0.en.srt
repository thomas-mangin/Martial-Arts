00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:02,000
hi everyone alex gent here so in the
 

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,669
hi everyone alex gent here so in the
last three videos we've been looking at

4
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:03,679
last three videos we've been looking at
 

5
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:04,630
last three videos we've been looking at
staff spinning

6
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:04,640
staff spinning
 

7
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,230
staff spinning
and today i'm going to be talking about

8
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,240
and today i'm going to be talking about
 

9
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,749
and today i'm going to be talking about
spinning and whether it's got any place

10
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:07,759
spinning and whether it's got any place
 

11
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,910
spinning and whether it's got any place
when it comes to martial application

12
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:09,920
when it comes to martial application
 

13
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,920
when it comes to martial application
the short answer is both yes and no

14
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:16,930
the short answer is both yes and no
 

15
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,790
the short answer is both yes and no

so firstly it's not always clear to know

18
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
so firstly it's not always clear to know
 

19
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,990
so firstly it's not always clear to know
what's applicable and what's not

20
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
what's applicable and what's not
 

21
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,910
what's applicable and what's not
a better question to ask is what's the

22
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:23,920
a better question to ask is what's the
 

23
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,109
a better question to ask is what's the
context and

24
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
context and
 

25
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,750
context and
why do you do certain movements now when

26
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
why do you do certain movements now when
 

27
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,269
why do you do certain movements now when
we're talking about staff spinning

28
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
we're talking about staff spinning
 

29
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,269
we're talking about staff spinning
we're generally talking about these type

30
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
we're generally talking about these type
 

31
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,389
we're generally talking about these type
of figure eight spins

32
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
of figure eight spins
 

33
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,709
of figure eight spins
side to side and rotating from the

34
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
side to side and rotating from the
 

35
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,470
side to side and rotating from the
middle now this in itself

36
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
middle now this in itself
 

37
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,270
middle now this in itself
isn't very martial for several reasons

38
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
isn't very martial for several reasons
 

39
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,630
isn't very martial for several reasons
holding the staff in one hand isn't

40
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
holding the staff in one hand isn't
 

41
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,750
holding the staff in one hand isn't
necessarily an issue

42
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
necessarily an issue
 

43
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,270
necessarily an issue
but the hand placement does make a

44
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
but the hand placement does make a
 

45
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,029
but the hand placement does make a
difference as to whether it's marshall

46
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
difference as to whether it's marshall
 

47
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,630
difference as to whether it's marshall
or not

48
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
or not
 

49
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,510
or not
if for example i'm in this position and

50
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
if for example i'm in this position and
 

51
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,790
if for example i'm in this position and
i'm spinning from the center of the

52
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
i'm spinning from the center of the
 

53
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,510
i'm spinning from the center of the

oh let's ignore footwork for the time

56
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
oh let's ignore footwork for the time
 

57
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,270
oh let's ignore footwork for the time
being and i was doing this type of

58
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
being and i was doing this type of
 

59
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,990
being and i was doing this type of
movement

60
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
movement
 

61
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,990
movement
doesn't matter how much i try and spin

62
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
doesn't matter how much i try and spin
 

63
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,470
doesn't matter how much i try and spin
it and generate power

64
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
it and generate power
 

65
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,709
it and generate power
it's not really that powerful because

66
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
it's not really that powerful because
 

67
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,469
it's not really that powerful because
it's actually dividing

68
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
it's actually dividing
 

69
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,710
it's actually dividing
the two ends and the powers the power

70
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
the two ends and the powers the power
 

71
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,550
the two ends and the powers the power
that i can potentially generate

72
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560
that i can potentially generate
 

73
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,990
that i can potentially generate
is split in two whereas

74
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
is split in two whereas
 

75
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,630
is split in two whereas
if i actually offset the grip i'm

76
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
if i actually offset the grip i'm
 

77
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,310
if i actually offset the grip i'm
creating more of a leverage

78
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
creating more of a leverage
 

79
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,149
creating more of a leverage
to the other end which creates more

80
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
to the other end which creates more
 

81
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,749
to the other end which creates more
force and more power

82
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
force and more power
 

83
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,310
force and more power
which from a marshall aspect is more

84
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
which from a marshall aspect is more
 

85
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,350
which from a marshall aspect is more
applicable

86
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
applicable
 

87
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,910
applicable
so if i was in the same position again

88
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
so if i was in the same position again
 

89
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,270
so if i was in the same position again
not using footwork

90
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
not using footwork
 

91
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,870
not using footwork
and i was doing the same type of figure

92
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
and i was doing the same type of figure
 

93
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,789
and i was doing the same type of figure
eight movement as this

94
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
eight movement as this
 

95
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,749
eight movement as this
but actually offset towards the top of

96
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
but actually offset towards the top of
 

97
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,149
but actually offset towards the top of
the staff

98
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
the staff
 

99
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,749
the staff
i can generate much more power

100
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759

 

101
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,469

even if i'm not using the other hand

102
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
even if i'm not using the other hand
 

103
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,990
even if i'm not using the other hand
just that sweep down

104
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,000
just that sweep down
 

105
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,749
just that sweep down
you can generate a lot of power into

106
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
you can generate a lot of power into
 

107
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,069
you can generate a lot of power into
that if we then start introducing

108
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
that if we then start introducing
 

109
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,590
that if we then start introducing
footwork into it

110
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600

 

111
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,350

it then starts to take more of a martial

112
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
it then starts to take more of a martial
 

113
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,830
it then starts to take more of a martial
form the other factor to consider is the

114
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
form the other factor to consider is the
 

115
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,030
form the other factor to consider is the
angles on the plane of

116
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
angles on the plane of
 

117
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,149
angles on the plane of
the strike so this same movement shown

118
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
the strike so this same movement shown
 

119
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,030
the strike so this same movement shown
from this side

120
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,040
from this side
 

121
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,670
from this side
side profile if i was just doing it like

122
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
side profile if i was just doing it like
 

123
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,950
side profile if i was just doing it like
this

124
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
this
 

125
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,990
this
it kind of looks the same but i'm not

126
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
it kind of looks the same but i'm not
 

127
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,510
it kind of looks the same but i'm not
really getting that much power out of it

128
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
really getting that much power out of it
 

129
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,070
really getting that much power out of it
and i'm going down in a in this type of

130
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
and i'm going down in a in this type of
 

131
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,229
and i'm going down in a in this type of
angle so i'm showing you front

132
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
angle so i'm showing you front
 

133
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,949
angle so i'm showing you front
i'm sweeping down like this which that

134
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
i'm sweeping down like this which that
 

135
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:21,990
i'm sweeping down like this which that
isn't very martial

136
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
isn't very martial
 

137
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,390
isn't very martial
i'm just twirling the sticker out

138
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
i'm just twirling the sticker out
 

139
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,869
i'm just twirling the sticker out
even if i try and put a bit more effort

140
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
even if i try and put a bit more effort
 

141
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,990
even if i try and put a bit more effort
into it

142
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
into it
 

143
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,589
into it
it's not actually becoming a strike i'm

144
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
it's not actually becoming a strike i'm
 

145
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,229
it's not actually becoming a strike i'm
just moving it from side to side

146
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
just moving it from side to side
 

147
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,350
just moving it from side to side
and it's not really doing that much i

148
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
and it's not really doing that much i
 

149
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,509
and it's not really doing that much i
was thinking about where i was striking

150
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
was thinking about where i was striking
 

151
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,670
was thinking about where i was striking
what i want to be doing is going more at

152
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
what i want to be doing is going more at
 

153
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,830
what i want to be doing is going more at
an angle like this rather than a shallow

154
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
an angle like this rather than a shallow
 

155
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,030
an angle like this rather than a shallow
angle

156
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
angle
 

157
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,070
angle
so as i step forward i want that

158
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
so as i step forward i want that
 

159
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,910
so as i step forward i want that
to be coming round and going more

160
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
to be coming round and going more
 

161
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,030
to be coming round and going more
across rather than raising it up and

162
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
across rather than raising it up and
 

163
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,390
across rather than raising it up and
coming down like this

164
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
coming down like this
 

165
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,670
coming down like this
i need it to be more striking across

166
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
i need it to be more striking across
 

167
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,110
i need it to be more striking across
like this going back and striking across

168
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
like this going back and striking across
 

169
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,550
like this going back and striking across
the other way as well now this kind of

170
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
the other way as well now this kind of
 

171
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,350
the other way as well now this kind of
contradicts

172
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
contradicts
 

173
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,270
contradicts
with some of the previous videos where

174
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
with some of the previous videos where
 

175
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,710
with some of the previous videos where
i've talked about trying to keep

176
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
i've talked about trying to keep
 

177
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,750
i've talked about trying to keep
the planes nice and tight which is more

178
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
the planes nice and tight which is more
 

179
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,949
the planes nice and tight which is more
like this but again it's the context

180
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
like this but again it's the context
 

181
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,670
like this but again it's the context
are we stop spinning or are we actually

182
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
are we stop spinning or are we actually
 

183
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,670
are we stop spinning or are we actually
looking at it as being a strike

184
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
looking at it as being a strike
 

185
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,589
looking at it as being a strike
so how does spinning actually help us

186
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
so how does spinning actually help us
 

187
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,190
so how does spinning actually help us
well when it comes to plane control

188
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
well when it comes to plane control
 

189
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,110
well when it comes to plane control
i think it plays an important part if

190
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
i think it plays an important part if
 

191
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,869
i think it plays an important part if
for example we use this strike as an

192
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
for example we use this strike as an
 

193
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,830
for example we use this strike as an
example

194
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
example
 

195
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,789
example
if i'm striking across the face there if

196
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
if i'm striking across the face there if
 

197
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,509
if i'm striking across the face there if
it was

198
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
it was
 

199
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,589
it was
missing for example i might take it wide

200
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
missing for example i might take it wide
 

201
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,270
missing for example i might take it wide
and control it here and the same when

202
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
and control it here and the same when
 

203
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,229
and control it here and the same when
i'm going back

204
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
i'm going back
 

205
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,470
i'm going back
and it takes this quite wide angle

206
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
and it takes this quite wide angle
 

207
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,789
and it takes this quite wide angle
if i was for example to strike them and

208
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
if i was for example to strike them and
 

209
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,309
if i was for example to strike them and
if you if you actually hit things this

210
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
if you if you actually hit things this
 

211
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,430
if you if you actually hit things this
is why i think it's important to

212
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
is why i think it's important to
 

213
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,710
is why i think it's important to
actually get things so you actually get

214
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
actually get things so you actually get
 

215
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,110
actually get things so you actually get
that

216
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
that
 

217
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,309
that
feeling of actually hitting and then

218
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
feeling of actually hitting and then
 

219
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,070
feeling of actually hitting and then
recovering afterwards if you're able to

220
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
recovering afterwards if you're able to
 

221
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,830
recovering afterwards if you're able to
follow through it's okay if it kind of

222
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
follow through it's okay if it kind of
 

223
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,949
follow through it's okay if it kind of
ricochets

224
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
ricochets
 

225
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,229
ricochets
and then comes down that's where it

226
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
and then comes down that's where it
 

227
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,670
and then comes down that's where it
would take that shallow angle

228
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
would take that shallow angle
 

229
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,910
would take that shallow angle
again going back if i'm striking here

230
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
again going back if i'm striking here
 

231
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,670
again going back if i'm striking here
and then it drops down

232
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
and then it drops down
 

233
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,710
and then it drops down
you'd have that angle but it's all about

234
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
you'd have that angle but it's all about
 

235
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,990
you'd have that angle but it's all about
the intention

236
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
the intention
 

237
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,589
the intention
you need to have that feeling of wanting

238
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
you need to have that feeling of wanting
 

239
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,310
you need to have that feeling of wanting
to go across

240
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320

 

241
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,509

and that's the angle that you need to be

242
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
and that's the angle that you need to be
 

243
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,189
and that's the angle that you need to be
taking if for example you're hitting

244
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
taking if for example you're hitting
 

245
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,390
taking if for example you're hitting
something and it actually

246
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
something and it actually
 

247
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,550
something and it actually
hits and then drops you still need to be

248
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
hits and then drops you still need to be
 

249
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,150
hits and then drops you still need to be
able to recover at that point

250
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
able to recover at that point
 

251
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,909
able to recover at that point
so i demonstrated that with the 13th joe

252
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
so i demonstrated that with the 13th joe
 

253
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,390
so i demonstrated that with the 13th joe
sabori however we can also

254
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
sabori however we can also
 

255
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,909
sabori however we can also
apply various spinning movements

256
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
apply various spinning movements
 

257
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,350
apply various spinning movements
in martial application when holding the

258
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
in martial application when holding the
 

259
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,830
in martial application when holding the
center of the job providing we're also

260
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
center of the job providing we're also
 

261
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,990
center of the job providing we're also
in contact with the back end of the jaw

262
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
in contact with the back end of the jaw
 

263
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,590
in contact with the back end of the jaw
as well and this can be seen

264
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
as well and this can be seen
 

265
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,230
as well and this can be seen
with the hasso movements

266
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240

 

267
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,950

so if we were to look at hasso front on

268
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
so if we were to look at hasso front on
 

269
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,390
so if we were to look at hasso front on
the same thing applies

270
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
the same thing applies
 

271
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,350
the same thing applies
if this is a deflection as i make

272
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
if this is a deflection as i make
 

273
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,270
if this is a deflection as i make
contact here i want to make sure that

274
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
contact here i want to make sure that
 

275
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,990
contact here i want to make sure that
there is

276
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
there is
 

277
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,749
there is
this pressure there and i'm not just

278
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
this pressure there and i'm not just
 

279
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,550
this pressure there and i'm not just
laying it drop down like this

280
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
laying it drop down like this
 

281
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,150
laying it drop down like this
as i said before if i'm just doing this

282
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
as i said before if i'm just doing this
 

283
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,350
as i said before if i'm just doing this
it's just a twirling movement and it's

284
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
it's just a twirling movement and it's
 

285
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,629
it's just a twirling movement and it's
got no intention

286
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
got no intention
 

287
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,070
got no intention
what i want to be doing is actually

288
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
what i want to be doing is actually
 

289
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,469
what i want to be doing is actually
visualizing that i'm making contact here

290
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
visualizing that i'm making contact here
 

291
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,150
visualizing that i'm making contact here
and as this contact

292
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
and as this contact
 

293
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,070
and as this contact
goes across that's where i'm deflecting

294
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
goes across that's where i'm deflecting
 

295
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,350
goes across that's where i'm deflecting
whether it's a thrust whatever it might

296
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
whether it's a thrust whatever it might
 

297
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,029
whether it's a thrust whatever it might

it's actually going there and it's going

300
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
it's actually going there and it's going
 

301
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,550
it's actually going there and it's going
to cross

302
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
to cross
 

303
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,830
to cross
the line what i don't want to do is just

304
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
the line what i don't want to do is just
 

305
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,629
the line what i don't want to do is just
let it

306
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
let it
 

307
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,150
let it
drop down like this

308
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160

 

309
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,390

however again same thing if there's

310
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
however again same thing if there's
 

311
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,430
however again same thing if there's
actually contact

312
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
actually contact
 

313
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,950
actually contact
at this point here and there's a

314
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
at this point here and there's a
 

315
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,110
at this point here and there's a
deflection it might be the case that if

316
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
deflection it might be the case that if
 

317
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,469
deflection it might be the case that if
you're actually making contact and

318
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
you're actually making contact and
 

319
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,270
you're actually making contact and
hitting something

320
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
hitting something
 

321
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,670
hitting something
you might drop down into that position

322
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
you might drop down into that position
 

323
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,270
you might drop down into that position
and then it's taking more of a shallow

324
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
and then it's taking more of a shallow
 

325
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,550
and then it's taking more of a shallow
angle and changing

326
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
angle and changing
 

327
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,390
angle and changing
trajectory so that's where the spinning

328
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
trajectory so that's where the spinning
 

329
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,950
trajectory so that's where the spinning
i suppose um becomes useful because

330
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
i suppose um becomes useful because

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,230
i suppose um becomes useful because
you're understanding the different

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,550
and you have control in different angle
from different angles

338
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
from different angles
 

339
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,830
from different angles
now although rotating from the center

340
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
now although rotating from the center
 

341
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,909
now although rotating from the center
isn't very good for striking it is much

342
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
isn't very good for striking it is much
 

343
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,150
isn't very good for striking it is much
quicker which is good for positioning

344
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
quicker which is good for positioning
 

345
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,749
quicker which is good for positioning
so using this hasso movement

346
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
so using this hasso movement
 

347
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,070
so using this hasso movement
i could do the same movement but instead

348
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
i could do the same movement but instead
 

349
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,189
i could do the same movement but instead
of taking it up

350
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
of taking it up
 

351
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,270
of taking it up
i could actually just change my position

352
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
i could actually just change my position
 

353
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,870
i could actually just change my position
so i'm in a thrusting position from the

354
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
so i'm in a thrusting position from the
 

355
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,629
so i'm in a thrusting position from the
other side

356
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
other side
 

357
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,950
other side
and that can be done quite quickly you

358
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
and that can be done quite quickly you
 

359
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,629
and that can be done quite quickly you
can use the spinning movement to change

360
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
can use the spinning movement to change
 

361
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,909
can use the spinning movement to change
between low to high

362
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
between low to high
 

363
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,350
between low to high
thrusting positions or change directions

364
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
thrusting positions or change directions
 

365
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,510
thrusting positions or change directions
so to sum up context is key even if

366
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
so to sum up context is key even if
 

367
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,350
so to sum up context is key even if
there isn't a martial application

368
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
there isn't a martial application
 

369
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,110
there isn't a martial application
movement might offer flexibility a

370
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
movement might offer flexibility a
 

371
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,950
movement might offer flexibility a
better understanding of plane control

372
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
better understanding of plane control
 

373
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,189
better understanding of plane control
or maybe you just enjoy doing it either
