1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,950

um for me there's only three angles for

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:06,960

 

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,589

Shon

4
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599
Shon
 

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,349
Shon
um the one we did on the Shon prep is a

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:15,359
um the one we did on the Shon prep is a
 

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,990
um the one we did on the Shon prep is a
m and uh then there's a UR one which is

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,000
m and uh then there's a UR one which is
 

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,589
m and uh then there's a UR one which is
extremely hard it's extremely hard to

10
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:23,599
extremely hard it's extremely hard to
 

11
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,750
extremely hard it's extremely hard to
uh to learn because our ego tritip mind

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:28,760
uh to learn because our ego tritip mind
 

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,630
uh to learn because our ego tritip mind
wants to think two-dimensionally and

14
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:31,640
wants to think two-dimensionally and
 

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,229
wants to think two-dimensionally and
that technique is not two-dimensionally

16
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
that technique is not two-dimensionally
 

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,350
that technique is not two-dimensionally
and then another one is

18
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:36,360
and then another one is
 

19
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,869
and then another one is
direct um and I don't think it's that

20
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:39,879
direct um and I don't think it's that
 

21
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,350
direct um and I don't think it's that
hard but somebody who's a

22
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:42,360
hard but somebody who's a
 

23
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,350
hard but somebody who's a
ferite they they can't find it but um

24
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
ferite they they can't find it but um
 

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,189
ferite they they can't find it but um
once my people learn the direct they

26
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:50,199
once my people learn the direct they
 

27
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:52,470
once my people learn the direct they
almost can't do the other two it's so

28
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,480
almost can't do the other two it's so
 

29
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,670
almost can't do the other two it's so
much better

30
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:54,680
much better
 

31
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:03,029
much better
okay uh so the the the OT one

32
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039

 

33
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,710

let's just let's just do the

34
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:05,720
let's just let's just do the
 

35
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:14,990
let's just let's just do the
in

36
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,000

 

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,310

so okay so we're going to look at the

38
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
so okay so we're going to look at the
 

39
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,230
so okay so we're going to look at the
the entry then the pattern overall

40
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:21,240
the entry then the pattern overall
 

41
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,069
the entry then the pattern overall
pattern of each

42
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:27,079

 

43
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:31,069

one this is choku and

44
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:31,079
one this is choku and
 

45
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,109
one this is choku and
jaes

46
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
jaes
 

47
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,389
jaes
okay all right so theot the UK will be

48
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:37,399
okay all right so theot the UK will be
 

49
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,030
okay all right so theot the UK will be
at the North Side okay and uh they're

50
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
at the North Side okay and uh they're
 

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,030
at the North Side okay and uh they're
going this

52
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
going this
 

53
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,990
going this
way okay and what you're going to do

54
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,000
way okay and what you're going to do
 

55
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,270
way okay and what you're going to do
as Naga is take a 90° angle so you were

56
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:52,280
as Naga is take a 90° angle so you were
 

57
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,109
as Naga is take a 90° angle so you were
on the X and you're going to move 90° to

58
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
on the X and you're going to move 90° to
 

59
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,630
on the X and you're going to move 90° to
the line and angle of attack

60
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
the line and angle of attack
 

61
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,709
the line and angle of attack
okay that's what you're going to do so

62
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
okay that's what you're going to do so
 

63
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,229
okay that's what you're going to do so
you'd be at the flank of UK

64
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
you'd be at the flank of UK
 

65
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,750
you'd be at the flank of UK
okay on the UDA version it starts

66
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
okay on the UDA version it starts
 

67
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,910
okay on the UDA version it starts
exactly the same you're going to do the

68
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
exactly the same you're going to do the
 

69
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,589
exactly the same you're going to do the
same thing you were here you're going to

70
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
same thing you were here you're going to
 

71
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,710
same thing you were here you're going to
move to the

72
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720

 

73
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,030

flank and you'd be over

74
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,040
flank and you'd be over
 

75
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,350
flank and you'd be over
here

76
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:28,360
here
 

77
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,390
here
okay and on the direct version you're

78
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:31,400
okay and on the direct version you're
 

79
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,190
okay and on the direct version you're
going to do the same thing

80
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
going to do the same thing
 

81
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,990
going to do the same thing
okay it always starts from the

82
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
okay it always starts from the
 

83
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,550
okay it always starts from the
flank okay no

84
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:41,560
flank okay no
 

85
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,390
flank okay no
difference um let me show you the two

86
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
difference um let me show you the two
 

87
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,309
difference um let me show you the two
ferite

88
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:49,319
ferite
 

89
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,790
ferite
uh we'll do the

90
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:51,800
uh we'll do the
 

91
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,710
uh we'll do the
ferite OT

92
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
ferite OT
 

93
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,190
ferite OT
and so on the ferite of m

94
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,200

 

95
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,149

it's really never coming in let's be

96
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
it's really never coming in let's be
 

97
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,949
it's really never coming in let's be
honest okay and then

98
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:07,959
honest okay and then
 

99
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,949
honest okay and then
uh you go this

100
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:11,959
uh you go this
 

101
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,149
uh you go this
way and you are facing that

102
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:15,159
way and you are facing that
 

103
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,190
way and you are facing that
way okay on these you're facing this way

104
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:20,200
way okay on these you're facing this way
 

105
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,910
way okay on these you're facing this way
you face the

106
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920

 

107
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,030

UK

108
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,040
UK
 

109
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,509
UK
okay and then on the Ura

110
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:30,519
okay and then on the Ura
 

111
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,550
okay and then on the Ura
the UK is coming in

112
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
the UK is coming in
 

113
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,350
the UK is coming in
again

114
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:34,360
again
 

115
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,910
again
okay and you do the same

116
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
okay and you do the same
 

117
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,390
okay and you do the same
thing only you're facing the

thing only you're facing the
 

119
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,869
thing only you're facing the
way UK is

120
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
way UK is
 

121

okay that's what you're
doing okay now the overall

124
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:50,599
doing okay now the overall
 

125
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:56,110
doing okay now the overall
pattern of the mayamot version this

126
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,120
pattern of the mayamot version this
 

127
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,309
pattern of the mayamot version this
one is going to

128
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
one is going to
 

129
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,990
one is going to
be the one Run for the

130
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
be the one Run for the
 

131
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,990
be the one Run for the
back uh outwards uh kazushi pattern okay

132
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
back uh outwards uh kazushi pattern okay
 

133
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,670
back uh outwards uh kazushi pattern okay
so UK is going to be

134
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:12,680

 

135
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,670

brought

136
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:14,680
brought
 

137
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,390
brought
into the spiral so let me see if if UK

138
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:19,400
into the spiral so let me see if if UK
 

139
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,310
into the spiral so let me see if if UK
is holding my right

140
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:21,320
is holding my right
 

141
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,870
is holding my right
arm

142
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
arm
 

143
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,990
arm
uh they're going to

144
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
uh they're going to
 

145
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,150
uh they're going to
do a shape like this

146
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160

 

147
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,029

they're going around this

148
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:36,039

 

149
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,350

way and then we switch

150
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
way and then we switch
 

151
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,430
way and then we switch
sides and then they get thrown this

152
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:42,440
sides and then they get thrown this
 

153
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,550
sides and then they get thrown this
way okay on the Ura

154
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:47,560

 

155
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,430

pattern they're going to do

156
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440

 

157
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,510

this the whole time

158
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:00,520

 

159
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,070

and on the choku pattern the choku

160
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
and on the choku pattern the choku
 

161
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,950
and on the choku pattern the choku
pattern they're going to do that pattern

162
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:05,960
pattern they're going to do that pattern
 

163
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,870
pattern they're going to do that pattern
again but

164
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
again but
 

165
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,749
again but
I do not switch

166
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:12,759
I do not switch
 

167
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,070
I do not switch
sides or I should

168
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
sides or I should
 

169
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,070
sides or I should
say

170
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,080
say
 

171
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,350
say
um how do I want to say

172
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,360
um how do I want to say
 

173
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,749
um how do I want to say
this there there's no there's not going

174
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:24,759
this there there's no there's not going
 

175
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,029
this there there's no there's not going
to be a point where I face the UK okay

176
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
to be a point where I face the UK okay
 

177
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,189
to be a point where I face the UK okay
but the p pattern is going to be the

178
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
but the p pattern is going to be the
 

179
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,110
but the p pattern is going to be the
same pattern is going to do this

180
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
same pattern is going to do this
 

181
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,510
same pattern is going to do this
okay and if we take these patterns again

182
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:38,520
okay and if we take these patterns again
 

183
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,469
okay and if we take these patterns again
the ferite

184
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
the ferite
 

185
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,870
the ferite
patterns

186
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:43,880

 

187
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,390

um they're kind of like this you go you

188
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:47,400
um they're kind of like this you go you
 

189
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,029
um they're kind of like this you go you
go so mot goes this way then a Mot goes

190
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:50,039
go so mot goes this way then a Mot goes
 

191
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:50,990
go so mot goes this way then a Mot goes
that

192
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,000
that
 

193
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,990
that
way and then you take the Ura

194
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
way and then you take the Ura
 

195
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,070
way and then you take the Ura
pattern and it goes this way and then

196
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,080
pattern and it goes this way and then
 

197
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,270
pattern and it goes this way and then
back that way way so you're kind of on

198
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:02,280
back that way way so you're kind of on
 

199
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,950
back that way way so you're kind of on
this line here you're on the line only

200
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
this line here you're on the line only
 

201
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,189
this line here you're on the line only
twice here you're on the line three

202
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
twice here you're on the line three
 

203
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,790
twice here you're on the line three
times

204
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800

205
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,309

okay couple things uh in terms of

206
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:13,319
okay couple things uh in terms of
 

207
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,950
okay couple things uh in terms of
cosmological patterns obviously you see

208
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:15,960
cosmological patterns obviously you see
 

209
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,189
cosmological patterns obviously you see
the figure a and you see the golden

210
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
the figure a and you see the golden
 

211
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,670

mean um if you study Silk Road you you

212
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
mean um if you study Silk Road you you
 

213
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,670
mean um if you study Silk Road you you
know this is it you know that's not it

214
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
know this is it you know that's not it

it just can't be it
 

217
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,670
it just can't be it
um but the reason why we end up on these

218
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:34,680
um but the reason why we end up on these
 

219
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,430
um but the reason why we end up on these
patterns is

220
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:36,440

second but which variation you
 

281
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,350

choose is dependent upon How

deep the UK or the attacker is in that
 

285
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,430
deep the UK or the attacker is in that
opening um that's the variation you're

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
opening um that's the variation you're
 

287
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,909
opening um that's the variation you're
going to choose okay so um if they're

288
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:22,919
going to choose okay so um if they're
 

289
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,869
going to choose okay so um if they're
not very deep into that opening uh choku

00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
not very deep into that opening uh choku
 

291
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,790
not very deep into that opening uh choku
is where it goes which is why you would

is where it goes which is why you would
 

293
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,469
is where it goes which is why you would
like choco choku because you don't want

right when the opening appears Boom the

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,269
right when the opening appears Boom the
choku entry is is right there and you

choku entry is is right there and you
 

305
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,990
choku entry is is right there and you
should have taken that one if they get a

should have taken that one if they get a
 

307
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,190
should have taken that one if they get a

little deeper into the opening that I'll
 

309
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,790
little deeper into the opening that I'll
show you the Ura is the way to go and if

310
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
show you the Ura is the way to go and if

know where
 

327
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,550
know where
shoag would fall into play okay so I'll

328
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:23,560
shoag would fall into play okay so I'll
 

329
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,310
shoag would fall into play okay so I'll
show you first the opening and then

330
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
show you first the opening and then
 

331
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,590
show you first the opening and then
we'll go over as best we can the entry

332
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:30,600
we'll go over as best we can the entry
 

333
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,910
we'll go over as best we can the entry
angles and uh these different patterns

334
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:34,920
angles and uh these different patterns
 

335
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,190
angles and uh these different patterns
particularly this one U because this was

336
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,200
particularly this one U because this was
 

337
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,389
particularly this one U because this was
the pattern in the shho Nugget prep

338
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399

position the counter to this is that I
 

403
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,550
position the counter to this is that I
turn around this projection Point

404
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
turn around this projection Point
 

405
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,190
turn around this projection Point
here that's what opens up

406
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200

someone can explain to you uh the myth
 

459
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,189
someone can explain to you uh the myth
the reason they're theat thematic is

460
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:28,199
the reason they're theat thematic is
 

461
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,670
the reason they're theat thematic is
that one piece of information is being

462

that one piece of information is being
 

463
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,990
that one piece of information is being
used to hold a bunch of information

464

used to hold a bunch of information
 

465
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,310
used to hold a bunch of information
which the elder or the Storyteller or

the shaman knows the bunch of
 

469
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,670
the shaman knows the bunch of
information it's very similar in

470
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:42,680
information it's very similar in

need the cuden the oral tradition
 

475
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,670
need the cuden the oral tradition
because the forms are Mythic or thematic

because the forms are Mythic or thematic
 

477
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,590
because the forms are Mythic or thematic
in their holding of information and then

478
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:56,600
in their holding of information and then
 

479
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,790
in their holding of information and then
the teacher the Sensei knows the then

and knows
where what one piece of information is

484

00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
here you see but as you start from here
 

503
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,710
here you see but as you start from here
you have to continue to get into that

504
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:38,720
you have to continue to get into that
 

505
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,030
you have to continue to get into that
energy and there is the

506
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,040
energy and there is the
 

507
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,269
energy and there is the
same place that we wore for the sh nag

508
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
same place that we wore for the sh nag
 

509
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,150
same place that we wore for the sh nag
opening okay does that make sense okay

510
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,160
opening okay does that make sense okay
 

511
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:55,150
opening okay does that make sense okay
so he's here and I am going to start to

512
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,160
so he's here and I am going to start to
 

513
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,189
so he's here and I am going to start to
move in a way that I get the the

514
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
move in a way that I get the the
 

515
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,749
move in a way that I get the the
Thematic opening of the Shon okay the

516
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:02,759
Thematic opening of the Shon okay the
 

517
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,990
Thematic opening of the Shon okay the
only difference is in

518
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,000
only difference is in
 

519
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,189
only difference is in

520
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:08,199
fighting his technique his energy would
 

521
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,590

be coming

522
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
be coming
 

523
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,550
be coming
around to this do you get

524
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
around to this do you get
 

525
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,310
around to this do you get
that okay so you kind of just like go

526
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
that okay so you kind of just like go
 

527
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,230
that okay so you kind of just like go
okay cool but I don't

528
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:21,240
okay cool but I don't
 

529
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,110
okay cool but I don't
have I'm going to maneuver

530
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,120
have I'm going to maneuver
 

531
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,150
have I'm going to maneuver
you I don't have this energy which is in

532
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,160
you I don't have this energy which is in
 

533
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,230
you I don't have this energy which is in
the technique okay

534
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
the technique okay
 

535
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,949
the technique okay
right but I do have the opportunity to

536
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:35,959
right but I do have the opportunity to
 

537
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:39,350
right but I do have the opportunity to
generate that energy now which I want to

538
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
generate that energy now which I want to
 

539
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,590
generate that energy now which I want to
do so if you give me that opening as you

540
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:42,600
do so if you give me that opening as you
 

541
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,389
do so if you give me that opening as you
counter the front inward kazushi I have

542
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:45,399
counter the front inward kazushi I have
 

543
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,470
counter the front inward kazushi I have
to know how to keep that energy going

544
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:47,480
to know how to keep that energy going
 

545
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,790
to know how to keep that energy going
into the technique so mythically

546
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:51,800
into the technique so mythically
 

547
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,389
into the technique so mythically
thematically that's why this thing keeps

548
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
thematically that's why this thing keeps
 

549
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:03,150
thematically that's why this thing keeps
going by this way

550
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,160

 

551
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,350

so I come out of the

552
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:05,360
so I come out of the
 

553
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,509
so I come out of the
way and then I have to have him not go

554
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:08,519
way and then I have to have him not go
 

555
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,629
way and then I have to have him not go
forward like Chris wants to go which is

556
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:10,639
forward like Chris wants to go which is
 

557
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,350
forward like Chris wants to go which is
why he loses his grip

558
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360

 

559
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,189

there if you keep your grip and don't do

560
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:18,199
there if you keep your grip and don't do
 

561
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:21,110
there if you keep your grip and don't do
anything you'll feel

562
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
anything you'll feel
 

563
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,790
anything you'll feel
it it's going on this

564
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800

okay so one way that cha used to teach

586
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
okay so one way that cha used to teach
 

587
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,990
okay so one way that cha used to teach
the way to follow the energy is he would

588
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,000
the way to follow the energy is he would

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,630
the way to follow the energy is he would
do it you see and go

do it you see and go
 

591
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,470
do it you see and go
forward it hurts

592
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:23,480
forward it hurts
 

593
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,829
forward it hurts
okay but the way I do it is keep your

594
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:26,839
okay but the way I do it is keep your
 

595
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,350
okay but the way I do it is keep your
palm on there don't guess

596
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
palm on there don't guess
 

597
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,549

make him fight you and then I'm staying
 

717
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:22,430
make him fight you and then I'm staying
with him as much as he's staying with

718
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:22,440

 

719
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,269

me as opposed to doing the movement you

727
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,430
moving it okay all right so we're going
to work at that level but you can still

728
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
to work at that level but you can still
 

729
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,590
to work at that level but you can still
see the entry okay and that's what we're

730
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:40,600
see the entry okay and that's what we're
 

731
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,149
see the entry okay and that's what we're
going to look

732
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
going to look
 

733
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,510
going to look
at so you have to move where someone can

734
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
at so you have to move where someone can
 

735
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,070
at so you have to move where someone can
tell okay so

736
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,080
tell okay so
 

737
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,710
tell okay so
west east north south you're going

738
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
west east north south you're going
 

739
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,990
west east north south you're going
to you're going to move off

740
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,000
to you're going to move off
 

741

743
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,070

entry so I end up because he's finally

744
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,080
entry so I end up because he's finally
 

745
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,750
entry so I end up because he's finally
displacing I end up

746
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:20,760
displacing I end up
 

747
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,830
displacing I end up
somewhere uh around um

748
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:26,840

 

749
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,830

8:00 12:00 in front and I move off and I

750
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:32,840
8:00 12:00 in front and I move off and I
 

751
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,990
8:00 12:00 in front and I move off and I
am at

752
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,000

 

753
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,990

8:00 if he's not spinally displacing at

754
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,000
8:00 if he's not spinally displacing at
 

755
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,310
8:00 if he's not spinally displacing at
all don't don't move don't grip okay and

756
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,320
all don't don't move don't grip okay and
 

757
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,710
all don't don't move don't grip okay and
you do this don't spinally displace stay

758
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:47,720
you do this don't spinally displace stay
 

759
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,510
you do this don't spinally displace stay
where you are you're going to lose

760
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:51,520
where you are you're going to lose
 

761
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,710
where you are you're going to lose
connection so if you were to grab me all

762
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
connection so if you were to grab me all
 

763
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,070
connection so if you were to grab me all
right and you're here like that and he's

764
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,080
right and you're here like that and he's
 

765
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,390
right and you're here like that and he's
not spinally dising

766
00:22:59,390 --> 00:22:59,400
not spinally dising
 

767
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,870
not spinally dising
you're going to come out of the

768
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:01,880
you're going to come out of the
 

769
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,710
you're going to come out of the
grip that's why this other stuff makes

770
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:05,720
grip that's why this other stuff makes
 

771
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,870
grip that's why this other stuff makes
sense to come in this way you see and do

772
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,880
sense to come in this way you see and do
 

773
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,909
sense to come in this way you see and do
the technique like

774
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:10,919
the technique like
 

775
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:14,950
the technique like
that he's not finally

776
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:14,960

 

777
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,149

displacing okay if he is finally

778
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
displacing okay if he is finally
 

779
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,950
displacing okay if he is finally
displacing and you want to step that

780
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:20,960
displacing and you want to step that
 

781
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,669
displacing and you want to step that
front foot over there let me just see do

782
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
front foot over there let me just see do
 

783
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,149
front foot over there let me just see do
it yes there you

784
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:25,159
it yes there you
 

785
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:28,590
it yes there you
go okay and

786
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:28,600
go okay and
 

787
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,990
go okay and
you're not going to get there okay so we

788
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,000
you're not going to get there okay so we
 

789
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,110
you're not going to get there okay so we
always require them to spinal displac

790
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,120
always require them to spinal displac
 

791
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,149
always require them to spinal displac
because that's where Naga is viable

792
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:37,159
because that's where Naga is viable
 

793
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:40,070
because that's where Naga is viable
against final displacement and you can't

794
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
against final displacement and you can't
 

795
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,470
against final displacement and you can't
do those other

796
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:41,480
do those other
 

797
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,470
do those other
things um an interesting thing is there

798
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
things um an interesting thing is there
 

799
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,350

counter that I just demonstrated
 

811
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,990
counter that I just demonstrated
okay and what it was was move to here so

812
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
okay and what it was was move to here so
 

813
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,269
okay and what it was was move to here so
I'll link that video in this pose okay

I'll link that video in this pose okay
 

815
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,549
I'll link that video in this pose okay
so I'm moving off the line and I'm now

816
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:15,559
so I'm moving off the line and I'm now
 

817
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:23,029
so I'm moving off the line and I'm now
flanked to him

818
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,039

 

819
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,029

I'm working with Chris we're just

822
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:27,880
I'm working with Chris we're just
 

823
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:37,269
I'm working with Chris we're just
looking at the footwork and the body

824
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:37,279

 

825
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,590

work okay now from here is where you

826
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:42,600
work okay now from here is where you
 

827
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,190
work okay now from here is where you
work that opening so that technique now

828
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:46,200
work that opening so that technique now
 

829
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,590
work that opening so that technique now
you can stay where you are Chris is

830
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:49,600
you can stay where you are Chris is
 

831
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,830
you can stay where you are Chris is
remember in the opening his energy is

832
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:52,840
remember in the opening his energy is
 

833
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,310
remember in the opening his energy is
going this way so his body is

834
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
going this way so his body is
 

835
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,669
going this way so his body is
technically coming back at me

836
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:00,679

 

837
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,990

so that's your new angle of attack so as

838
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,000
so that's your new angle of attack so as
 

839
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,830
so that's your new angle of attack so as
his body's coming to me I move to the

840
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:06,840
his body's coming to me I move to the
 

841
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,149
his body's coming to me I move to the
other side and that is

842
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:09,159
other side and that is
 

843
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,630
other side and that is
sh and then really what it is

844
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:13,640
sh and then really what it is
 

845
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,669
sh and then really what it is
isida but I'm in his back okay

846
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:18,679
isida but I'm in his back okay
 

847
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,950
isida but I'm in his back okay
so right here boom in real life his

848
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:23,960
so right here boom in real life his
 

849
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,190
so right here boom in real life his
energy would be coming back this way

850
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,200
energy would be coming back this way
 

851
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,669
energy would be coming back this way
towards me and that's when I move out of

852
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:28,679
towards me and that's when I move out of
 

853
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:39,269
towards me and that's when I move out of
the

854
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279

 

855
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,909

way those are the angles

856
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:42,919
way those are the angles
 

857
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:47,549
way those are the angles
okay

858
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:47,559

 

859
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:51,630

um do you think you got it okay thank

860
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:51,640
um do you think you got it okay thank
 

861
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,630
um do you think you got it okay thank
you all right and in case it wasn't

862
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:54,640
you all right and in case it wasn't
 

863
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,470
you all right and in case it wasn't
clear what I'm showing right now is just

864
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:57,480
clear what I'm showing right now is just
 

865
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,190
clear what I'm showing right now is just
the a

866
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,200
the a
 

867
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,430
the a
OT entry and then the OT pattern is what

868
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:03,440
OT entry and then the OT pattern is what
 

869
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,190
OT entry and then the OT pattern is what
we're doing but

870
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:08,200

 

871
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,549

um so if you look at it he comes in

872
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:13,559
um so if you look at it he comes in
 

873
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:18,110
um so if you look at it he comes in
going into the pattern now okay uh he

874
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,120
going into the pattern now okay uh he
 

875
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,830
going into the pattern now okay uh he
gets into this

876
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:19,840
gets into this
 

877
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,630
gets into this
position he's brought around stay there

878
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:23,640
position he's brought around stay there
 

879
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,870
position he's brought around stay there
please you come to this

880
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:25,880
please you come to this
 

881
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:36,789
please you come to this
side and this is where you have

882
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:36,799

 

883
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,990

hole it's the same po okay that's why

884
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,000
hole it's the same po okay that's why
 

885
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,350
hole it's the same po okay that's why
it's that figure a so for

886
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,360
it's that figure a so for
 

887
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,710
it's that figure a so for
example five was here come around his

888
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
example five was here come around his
 

889
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,389

890
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:50,399
leg comes
 

891
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:58,470
leg comes
back there's his C

in the
 

895
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:03,590
in the
sh his legs coming back has the energy

896
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:03,600
sh his legs coming back has the energy
 

897
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,029
sh his legs coming back has the energy
back back this way as in the real

898
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:07,039
back back this way as in the real
 

899
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,549
back back this way as in the real
counter en comes back and I came over

900
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:09,559
counter en comes back and I came over
 

901
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:17,310
counter en comes back and I came over
here and there's the same angle for

902
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:17,320

 

903
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,630

the don't use

904
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:19,640
the don't use
 

905
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:26,590
the don't use
your keep

906
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:26,600

 

907
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,230

it okay

908
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240

 

909
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,190

uh the version that you're doing in your

910
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:34,200
uh the version that you're doing in your
 

911
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,350
uh the version that you're doing in your
video is not that entry nor that pattern

912
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:38,360
video is not that entry nor that pattern
 

913
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,230
video is not that entry nor that pattern
it is the fedorite Ura

914
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,240
it is the fedorite Ura
 

915
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,909
it is the fedorite Ura
pattern so we'll go into that now okay

916
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:45,919
pattern so we'll go into that now okay
 

917
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,509
pattern so we'll go into that now okay
and that's the one where you come

918
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:48,519
and that's the one where you come
 

919
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:52,870
and that's the one where you come
around you come

920
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:52,880

 

921
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,509

up you turn around and then now you do

922
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:56,519
up you turn around and then now you do
 

923
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,990
up you turn around and then now you do
that

924
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,000
that
 

925
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,710
that
get Chris on that same

926
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:01,720
get Chris on that same
 

927
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,549
get Chris on that same
page okay so ten

928
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:05,559
page okay so ten
 

929
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:13,830
page okay so ten
con turn and

930
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:13,840

 

931
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,750

then

932
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760
then
 

933
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:22,269
then
hand Boom

934
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:22,279

 

935
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:26,190

turn okay can you do that I'll talk you

936
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,200
turn okay can you do that I'll talk you
 

937
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,470
turn okay can you do that I'll talk you
through it you're going to KN me to the

938
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:29,480
through it you're going to KN me to the
 

939
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,710
through it you're going to KN me to the
outside 10

940
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:31,720
outside 10
 

941
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:41,830
outside 10
con double pivot around and there's the

942
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:41,840

 

943
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,909

throw yes and there's the okay one more

944
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919
throw yes and there's the okay one more
 

945
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,430
throw yes and there's the okay one more
time for

946
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,440

 

947
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,990

Chris

948
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:53,000
Chris
 

949
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,590
Chris
good okay now we'll add this final

950
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:55,600
good okay now we'll add this final
 

951
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:04,029
good okay now we'll add this final
displacement

952
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:04,039

 

953
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,350

so the abrupt change in Direction

954
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:06,360
so the abrupt change in Direction
 

955
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,870
so the abrupt change in Direction
because of that zigzag is not conducive

956
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:08,880
because of that zigzag is not conducive
 

957
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,149
because of that zigzag is not conducive
to the spinal displacement so he

958
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:13,159
to the spinal displacement so he
 

959
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:18,350
to the spinal displacement so he
needs he needs an equal y value in order

960
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:18,360
needs he needs an equal y value in order
 

961
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,750
needs he needs an equal y value in order
to adhere but when he goes the other way

962
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:22,760
to adhere but when he goes the other way
 

963
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,149
to adhere but when he goes the other way
at too sharp an angle which he

964
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:26,159
at too sharp an angle which he
 

965
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,870
at too sharp an angle which he
will um to the SP displacement his y

966
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:29,880
will um to the SP displacement his y
 

967
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,710
will um to the SP displacement his y
value will increase and he will lose the

968
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:32,720
value will increase and he will lose the
 

969
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,909
value will increase and he will lose the
adhesion so that's what's

970
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:35,919
adhesion so that's what's
 

971
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,190
adhesion so that's what's
happening right there okay what they'll

972
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:40,200
happening right there okay what they'll
 

973
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,470
happening right there okay what they'll
tend to do is they'll hold on to it in

974
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:43,480
tend to do is they'll hold on to it in
 

975
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,350
tend to do is they'll hold on to it in
shag so he's going to hold on to me you

976
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:46,360
shag so he's going to hold on to me you
 

977
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,950
shag so he's going to hold on to me you
see go ahead get start there so I push

978
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:49,960
see go ahead get start there so I push
 

979
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,950
see go ahead get start there so I push
and now the other hand is keeping me on

980
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:52,960
and now the other hand is keeping me on
 

981
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,389
and now the other hand is keeping me on
there

982
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:54,399
there
 

983
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:00,870
there
okay but it's still a young young cloud

984
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:00,880

 

985
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,389

because he has to be able to overpower

986
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:04,399
because he has to be able to overpower
 

987
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,630
because he has to be able to overpower
my Force output to get that to go around

988
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:08,640
my Force output to get that to go around
 

989
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,870
my Force output to get that to go around
okay then on top of it there's no

990
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:11,880
okay then on top of it there's no
 

991
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,990
okay then on top of it there's no
overall spiral of the

992
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,000
overall spiral of the
 

993
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,710
overall spiral of the
pairing and the opening never manifests

994
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:17,720
pairing and the opening never manifests
 

995
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,990
pairing and the opening never manifests
because the body never gets in this

996
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,000
because the body never gets in this
 

997
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,669
because the body never gets in this
position not even

998
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:23,679
position not even
 

999
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,509
position not even
mythologically okay the guys just kind

1000
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:26,519
mythologically okay the guys just kind
 

1001
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,630
mythologically okay the guys just kind
of stand in there

1002
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:28,640
of stand in there
 

1003
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,110
of stand in there
um so that's why we don't do it that way

1004
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,120
um so that's why we don't do it that way
 

1005
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,750
um so that's why we don't do it that way
I was trained that way originally but it

1006
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:34,760
I was trained that way originally but it
 

1007
