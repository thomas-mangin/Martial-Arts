1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,270

go

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:08,280

 

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,390

again uh do the same one

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400

 

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,470

again and again nope I do it

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:21,480

 

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,070

again

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:23,080
again
 

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,349
again
okay you're going to do it again and I

10
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:26,359
okay you're going to do it again and I
 

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,870
okay you're going to do it again and I
don't you don't need to change anything

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:27,880
don't you don't need to change anything
 

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,109
don't you don't need to change anything
B you just do you I want you to pay

14
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
B you just do you I want you to pay
 

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,910
B you just do you I want you to pay
attention to her left elbow plot it in

16
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:34,920
attention to her left elbow plot it in
 

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,110
attention to her left elbow plot it in
space and you

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
space and you
 

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,430
space and you
go okay did you do you see how it's

20
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
go okay did you do you see how it's
 

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,270
go okay did you do you see how it's
you're going to keep doing that when you

22
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
you're going to keep doing that when you
 

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,869
you're going to keep doing that when you
tell me what's happening to that left

24
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
tell me what's happening to that left
 

25
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,470
tell me what's happening to that left
elbow as you ploted in

26
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:47,480
elbow as you ploted in
 

27
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,830
elbow as you ploted in
space describe what's happening moves

28
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:50,840
space describe what's happening moves
 

29
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,349
space describe what's happening moves
slightly there then stay still here

30
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:53,359
slightly there then stay still here
 

31
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,069
slightly there then stay still here
until say speak up it moves slightly at

32
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
until say speak up it moves slightly at
 

33
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,790
until say speak up it moves slightly at
the beginning and then stays still

34
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:57,800
the beginning and then stays still
 

35
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,069
the beginning and then stays still
through the rest of the technique all

36
00:00:59,069 --> 00:00:59,079
through the rest of the technique all
 

37
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,509
through the rest of the technique all
right let's find out

38
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:00,519
right let's find out
 

39
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,069
right let's find out
stop I'm going to plot it in space right

40
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:03,079
stop I'm going to plot it in space right
 

41
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,870
stop I'm going to plot it in space right
there you do the throw looks like it

42
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:05,880
there you do the throw looks like it
 

43
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,990
there you do the throw looks like it
went towards the east yes okay so you

44
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,000
went towards the east yes okay so you
 

45
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,429
went towards the east yes okay so you
weren't accurate so you're going to do

46
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:10,439
weren't accurate so you're going to do
 

47
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,190
weren't accurate so you're going to do
it

48
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
it
 

49
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,670
it
again watch the elbow do you see yes

50
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
again watch the elbow do you see yes
 

51
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,510
again watch the elbow do you see yes
okay we'll have you you guys go that n

52
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
okay we'll have you you guys go that n
 

53
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,630
okay we'll have you you guys go that n
get

54
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:23,640

 

55
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,510

Taylor let's again moving away from me

56
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:26,520
Taylor let's again moving away from me
 

57
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,830
Taylor let's again moving away from me
and you're going to plot his elbow in

58
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:28,840
and you're going to plot his elbow in
 

59
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,670
and you're going to plot his elbow in
space

60
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:30,680
space
 

61
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,230
space
nope you're always going to go north

62
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
nope you're always going to go north
 

63
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,789
nope you're always going to go north
you're always going to throw North

64
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:33,799
you're always going to throw North
 

65
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,080
you're always going to throw North
you're you're plotting his

66
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,090

elbow what what do you what do you
 

71
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,429
elbow what what do you what do you
notice as you plotted in

72
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:48,439

 

73
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,469

space anything what do you

space anything what do you
 

75
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,670
space anything what do you
notice

76
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
notice
 

77
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,510
notice
what is it staying still or is it moving

78
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:56,520
what is it staying still or is it moving
 

79
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,389
what is it staying still or is it moving
in space it's moving it's moving pay

80
00:01:59,389 --> 00:01:59,399
in space it's moving it's moving pay
 

81
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,709
in space it's moving it's moving pay
attention it's it's moving Eastward

82
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
attention it's it's moving Eastward
 

83
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,990
attention it's it's moving Eastward
again watch watch prior to the throat

84
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
again watch watch prior to the throat
 

85
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,429
again watch watch prior to the throat
you see it's going Eastward again okay

86
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
you see it's going Eastward again okay
 

87
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,630
you see it's going Eastward again okay
uh we'll come back we'll do the other p

88
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:09,640
uh we'll come back we'll do the other p
 

89
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,350
uh we'll come back we'll do the other p
and you're going to do the same thing

90
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
and you're going to do the same thing
 

91
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,030
and you're going to do the same thing
you don't have to change

92
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
you don't have to change
 

93
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,309
you don't have to change
anything and uh we're going to now plot

94
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
anything and uh we're going to now plot
 

95
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,589
anything and uh we're going to now plot
for the hand in Space the wrist

96
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:22,599

 

97
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,470

scrab what do you

98
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480

 

99
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,750

notice up

100
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:28,760
notice up
 

101
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,550
notice up
down

102
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
down
 

103
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,430
down
R pay attention what the same direction

104
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,440
R pay attention what the same direction
 

105
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,270
R pay attention what the same direction
as the it's going in the same direction

106
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:36,280
as the it's going in the same direction
 

107
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,990
as the it's going in the same direction
so if we plot look at the distance the

108
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,000
so if we plot look at the distance the
 

109
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,869
so if we plot look at the distance the
wrist is currently from her torso do you

110
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
wrist is currently from her torso do you
 

111
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,589
wrist is currently from her torso do you
understand now watch as he

112
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:44,599
understand now watch as he
 

113
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,990
understand now watch as he
throws it got closer to our torso do you

114
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
throws it got closer to our torso do you
 

115
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,070
throws it got closer to our torso do you
see that and that's a product of that

116
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,080
see that and that's a product of that
 

117
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,670
see that and that's a product of that
elbow hinging that's why the wrist gets

118
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:54,680
elbow hinging that's why the wrist gets
 

119
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,030
elbow hinging that's why the wrist gets
closer do you understand okay so we're

120
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,040
closer do you understand okay so we're
 

121
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,830
closer do you understand okay so we're
going to come and we'll switch the the

122
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:00,840
going to come and we'll switch the the
 

123
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,070
going to come and we'll switch the the
other team watch that and again you see

124
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
other team watch that and again you see
 

125
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,190
other team watch that and again you see
how the Hat the wrist gets closer you

126
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
how the Hat the wrist gets closer you
 

127
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,750
how the Hat the wrist gets closer you
see which is telling you the elbow is

128
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:10,760
see which is telling you the elbow is
 

129
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,110
see which is telling you the elbow is
hinging got

130
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
hinging got
 

131
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,070
hinging got
it

132

133
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,350

okay so and you don't have to worry push

134
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
okay so and you don't have to worry push
 

135
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,110
okay so and you don't have to worry push
push push okay I don't want to stay here

136
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
push push okay I don't want to stay here
 

137

see the
 

143
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,470
see the
segmentation right right at

144
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:41,480
segmentation right right at
 

145
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,630

00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
that uh so right at contact everything
 

157
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,990
that uh so right at contact everything
stays the same so even this little

158
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,000
stays the same so even this little
 

159
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,550
stays the same so even this little
shoulder you see don't no no shoulder

up she she's go she's trying to go in

170
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:24,759
up she she's go she's trying to go in
 

171
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,350
up she she's go she's trying to go in
but I'm not going to let

172
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:26,360
but I'm not going to let
 

173
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,590
but I'm not going to let
her do you see

174
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600
her do you see
 

175
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,270
her do you see
that

176
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,280
that
 

177
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,550
that
if we pay attention to the

178
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
if we pay attention to the
 

179
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,710
if we pay attention to the
ukes the ukes disconnect all the time

180
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:37,720
ukes the ukes disconnect all the time
 

181
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,870
ukes the ukes disconnect all the time
all the time okay um so if you pay

182
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
all the time okay um so if you pay
 

183
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,350
all the time okay um so if you pay
attention to when so she pushes she's

184
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:46,360
attention to when so she pushes she's
 

185
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,790
attention to when so she pushes she's
now not disconnected but when does she

186
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:49,800
now not disconnected but when does she
 

187
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,189
now not disconnected but when does she
when does she want that right there let

188
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
when does she want that right there let
 

189
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,550
when does she want that right there let
stay there right here is where she'll

190
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:57,560
stay there right here is where she'll
 

191
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,110
stay there right here is where she'll
take her Center out of the technique and

192
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,120
take her Center out of the technique and
 

193
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,110
take her Center out of the technique and
so the

194
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:02,120
so the
 

195
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,670
so the
internal uh energetic manipulation she's

196
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:06,680
internal uh energetic manipulation she's
 

197
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,990
internal uh energetic manipulation she's
trying to Des segmented she's trying to

198
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,000
trying to Des segmented she's trying to
 

199
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,469
trying to Des segmented she's trying to
disconnect it you see and then the

200
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:11,479
disconnect it you see and then the
 

201
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,270
disconnect it you see and then the
hinges will become viable again so this

202
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
hinges will become viable again so this
 

203
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,670
hinges will become viable again so this
kind of UK gives you a great

204
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:18,680
kind of UK gives you a great
 

205
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,870
kind of UK gives you a great
opportunity to do you see there it is

206
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
opportunity to do you see there it is
 

207
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,510
opportunity to do you see there it is
again

208
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:24,520
again
 

209
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,070
again
so once once I have her here I have her

210
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
so once once I have her here I have her
 

211
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,309
so once once I have her here I have her
Center so you can see you can move her

212
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:30,319
Center so you can see you can move her
 

213
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,070
Center so you can see you can move her
any any anywhere you want but once she

214
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,080
any any anywhere you want but once she
 

215
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,629
any any anywhere you want but once she
goes off balance she's now changing the

216
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
goes off balance she's now changing the
 

217
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,150
goes off balance she's now changing the
angle and disconnecting the center what

218
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
angle and disconnecting the center what
 

219
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,870
angle and disconnecting the center what
you have to do as you advance is not go

220
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:43,880
you have to do as you advance is not go
 

221
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,150
you have to do as you advance is not go
back to a hinge she change the vector so

222
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
back to a hinge she change the vector so
 

223
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,749
back to a hinge she change the vector so
you just keep the energy

224
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:50,759
you just keep the energy
 

225
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,110
you just keep the energy
instead got it so I don't want to do the

226
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,120
instead got it so I don't want to do the
 

227
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,029
instead got it so I don't want to do the
Keyon at the cost of bringing her joints

228
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:58,039
Keyon at the cost of bringing her joints
 

229
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,990
Keyon at the cost of bringing her joints
back in

230
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,000
back in
 

231
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,350
back in
I just I have the energy the energy is

232
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
I just I have the energy the energy is
 

233
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,990
I just I have the energy the energy is
what I

234
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,000

 

235
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,629

use every time she

236
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:09,639
use every time she
 

237
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,830
use every time she
disconnects I keep that lock on her

238
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:12,840
disconnects I keep that lock on her
 

239
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,270
disconnects I keep that lock on her
joints so here that see how she goes

240
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
joints so here that see how she goes
 

241
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,029
joints so here that see how she goes
back okay what what she supp us to do

242
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:18,039
back okay what what she supp us to do
 

243
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:20,990
back okay what what she supp us to do
push push okay but she goes back go back

244
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,000
push push okay but she goes back go back
 

245
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,510
push push okay but she goes back go back
and same thing I can't keep going where

246
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
and same thing I can't keep going where
 

247
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,350
and same thing I can't keep going where
she

248
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:24,360
she
 

249
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,150
she
disconnected she goes back and I keep

250
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
disconnected she goes back and I keep
 

251
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,589
disconnected she goes back and I keep
the same thing do you feel you see and

252
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:30,599
the same thing do you feel you see and
 

253
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,189
the same thing do you feel you see and
the joints don't

254
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:34,199

 

255
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:40,990

hinge got it okay

256
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,000

 

257
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,510

Chris so this I don't want

258
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:46,520

 

259
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,110

that

260
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,120
that
 

261
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:56,749
that
see it's just the feeling of

262
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:56,759

 

263
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,950

them when does it happen

264
00:06:59,950 --> 00:06:59,960
them when does it happen
 

265
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,189
them when does it happen
right when he's about to fall okay so

266
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:04,199
right when he's about to fall okay so
 

267
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,950
right when he's about to fall okay so
maybe I take the Keyon up to that part

268
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:07,960
maybe I take the Keyon up to that part
 

269
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,469
maybe I take the Keyon up to that part
he starts to pull out and hinge do you

270
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:11,479
he starts to pull out and hinge do you
 

271
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:14,790
he starts to pull out and hinge do you
see now to continue on this now here's

272
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
see now to continue on this now here's
 

273
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,950
see now to continue on this now here's
where you can push down on that hand you

274
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
where you can push down on that hand you
 

275
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,189
where you can push down on that hand you
see he'll he he's giv back leverage to

276
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:20,199
see he'll he he's giv back leverage to
 

277
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,589
see he'll he he's giv back leverage to
himself which is what a resisting person

278
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:22,599
himself which is what a resisting person
 

279
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:25,749
himself which is what a resisting person
will do they will do that and that's why

280
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
will do they will do that and that's why
 

281
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,430
will do they will do that and that's why
they this kind of UK it's not the best

282
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,440
they this kind of UK it's not the best
 

283
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,749
they this kind of UK it's not the best
for you n development but for my nogget

284
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
for you n development but for my nogget
 

285
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,469
for you n development but for my nogget
development it'll help me train so when

286
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
development it'll help me train so when
 

287
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,150
development it'll help me train so when
I feel that you see how I felt it goes y

288
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
I feel that you see how I felt it goes y
 

289
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,990
I feel that you see how I felt it goes y
you see how I put it back

290
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,000
you see how I put it back
 

291
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,629
you see how I put it back
on so we'll do that one again just so I

292
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:43,639
on so we'll do that one again just so I
 

293
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,629
on so we'll do that one again just so I
can talk it through as I feel him pull

294
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
can talk it through as I feel him pull
 

295
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,909
can talk it through as I feel him pull
that do you see rather than push here

296
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
that do you see rather than push here
 

297
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,029
that do you see rather than push here
and give him the mechanical advantage

298
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
and give him the mechanical advantage
 

299
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,270
and give him the mechanical advantage
there right I brought this this way this

300
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
there right I brought this this way this
 

301
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,830
there right I brought this this way this
is going this way see and what you

302
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:00,840
is going this way see and what you
 

303
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,830
is going this way see and what you
notice is that the hinge stops

304
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
notice is that the hinge stops
 

305
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,550
notice is that the hinge stops
working every

306
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
working every
 

307
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,189
working every
time there's that little

308
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:12,199
time there's that little
 

309
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:18,749
time there's that little
hinge there it is

310
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:18,759

 

311
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,430

again there's that hinge you see trying

312
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
again there's that hinge you see trying
 

313
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,110
again there's that hinge you see trying
to take energy off it kind of go

314
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
to take energy off it kind of go
 

315
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,869
to take energy off it kind of go
down do do you understand so pay

00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:29,879
down do do you understand so pay
 

317
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,670
down do do you understand so pay

I'll now I'll risk it okay and now be
 

505
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,230
I'll now I'll risk it okay and now be
segmented different body okay so what

506
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
segmented different body okay so what
 

507
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,749
segmented different body okay so what
you want to do is not be afraid because

508
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:20,759
you want to do is not be afraid because
 

509
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,710
you want to do is not be afraid because
fear segments the body you

510
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:25,720

00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,160
can't be pushing on this all the time
 

517
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,030
can't be pushing on this all the time
you use the

518
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
you use the
 

519
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,110
you use the

525
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,310

eyes no it happens right at the fear

526
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:55,320
eyes no it happens right at the fear
 

527
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,670
eyes no it happens right at the fear
response of falling

528
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680
response of falling
 

529
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,949
response of falling
okay

530
00:14:59,949 --> 00:14:59,959
okay
 

531
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,110
okay
so if you if that's the

532
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
so if you if that's the
 

533
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,749
so if you if that's the
case then doing the prescribed Uki which

534
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:07,759
case then doing the prescribed Uki which
 

535
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,790
case then doing the prescribed Uki which
is the role of buuk Not the Falling

536
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:11,800
is the role of buuk Not the Falling
 

537
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,670
is the role of buuk Not the Falling
okay I get to reconcile fear I'm brought

538
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
okay I get to reconcile fear I'm brought
 

539
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,110
okay I get to reconcile fear I'm brought
to the fear crisis the fork in the road

540
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
to the fear crisis the fork in the road
 

541
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,749
to the fear crisis the fork in the road
which will you do will you go

542
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:21,759
which will you do will you go
 

543
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,949
which will you do will you go
unconscious you see will you segment go

544
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:25,959
unconscious you see will you segment go
 

545
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,910
unconscious you see will you segment go
unconscious or will you maintain

546
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
unconscious or will you maintain
 

547
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,629
unconscious or will you maintain
awareness and in the face of that

548
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:30,639
awareness and in the face of that
 

549
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,910

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:34,920

 

551
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,430

egocentrism it's it's a choice okay and

552
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:38,440
egocentrism it's it's a choice okay and
 

553
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,189
egocentrism it's it's a choice okay and
as you as

554

okay pay attention to those joints both

562
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,040
okay pay attention to those joints both
 

563
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,629
okay pay attention to those joints both
from UK and if they do do it from net

564
00:15:59,629 --> 00:15:59,639
from UK and if they do do it from net
 

565
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:26,030
from UK and if they do do it from net
get them back out of play okay

566
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,040

 

567
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,749

good okay so now pay attention to the

568
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:28,759
good okay so now pay attention to the
 

569
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,150
good okay so now pay attention to the
functioning the

570
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
functioning the
 

571
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,430
functioning the
articulating the articulation in her

572
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:32,440
articulating the articulation in her
 

573
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:48,949
articulating the articulation in her
joints have the wrist elbow and the

574
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959

 

575
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,309

shoulder what do you

576
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:52,319
shoulder what do you
 

577
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:57,470
shoulder what do you
notice there seems to be a little

578
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:57,480

 

579
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,230

um we're going back

580
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
um we're going back
 

581
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,670
um we're going back
ands anyone else notice anything there's

582
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
ands anyone else notice anything there's
 

583
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,789
ands anyone else notice anything there's
energy leakage yes there's energy

584
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:05,799
energy leakage yes there's energy
 

585
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:09,829
energy leakage yes there's energy
leakage which which who could who could

586
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
leakage which which who could who could
 

587
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,029
leakage which which who could who could
Define what is not being impacted as a

588
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:13,039
Define what is not being impacted as a
 

589
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,870
Define what is not being impacted as a
result of that energy leakage CER the

590
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:15,880
result of that energy leakage CER the
 

591
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,350
result of that energy leakage CER the
center the center is not being affected

592
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:18,360
center the center is not being affected
 

593
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,990
center the center is not being affected
so the center is being sequentially

594
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,000
so the center is being sequentially
 

595
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,549
so the center is being sequentially
externally affected so as you work

596
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:23,559
externally affected so as you work
 

597
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,990
externally affected so as you work
through each

598
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,000
through each
 

599
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,510
through each
joint then eventually you're pulling on

600
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
joint then eventually you're pulling on
 

601
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,190
joint then eventually you're pulling on
the center do do you understand that

602
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:30,200
the center do do you understand that
 

603
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,909
the center do do you understand that
okay so the same thing is

604
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
okay so the same thing is
 

605
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,710
okay so the same thing is
here okay so uh when I'm here you see

606
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:37,720
here okay so uh when I'm here you see
 

607
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,590
here okay so uh when I'm here you see
I'm in the center it's it's in your

608
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
I'm in the center it's it's in your
 

609
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,549
I'm in the center it's it's in your
Center that's why when you try to

610
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:43,559
Center that's why when you try to
 

611
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,110
Center that's why when you try to
disconnect what do you feel this hand is

612
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,120
disconnect what do you feel this hand is
 

613
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,390
disconnect what do you feel this hand is
doing uh where is it it's in C yeah do

614
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:49,400
doing uh where is it it's in C yeah do
 

615
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,789
doing uh where is it it's in C yeah do
you see okay as opposed to you go ahead

616
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:52,799
you see okay as opposed to you go ahead
 

617
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,070
you see okay as opposed to you go ahead
disconnect and I disconnect too okay as

618
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,080
disconnect and I disconnect too okay as
 

619
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,149
disconnect and I disconnect too okay as
you get and then inversely it's the same

620
00:17:58,149 --> 00:17:58,159
you get and then inversely it's the same
 

621
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:01,630
you get and then inversely it's the same
thing here right so as you as I go into

622
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:01,640
thing here right so as you as I go into
 

623
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,990
thing here right so as you as I go into
your joints cuz you disconnected go

624
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,000
your joints cuz you disconnected go
 

625
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,909
your joints cuz you disconnected go
ahead and do your thing you see like

626
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:06,919
ahead and do your thing you see like
 

627
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,310
ahead and do your thing you see like
that now the joints become functional

628
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:09,320
that now the joints become functional
 

629
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,190
that now the joints become functional
again but if I if you get to that point

630
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:12,200
again but if I if you get to that point
 

631
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,510
again but if I if you get to that point
and you disconnect you see and I'm still

632
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:14,520
and you disconnect you see and I'm still
 

633
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,669
and you disconnect you see and I'm still
in the the center but from a different

634
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
in the the center but from a different
 

635
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,110
in the the center but from a different
vector and you have to be able to do it

636
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,120
vector and you have to be able to do it
 

637
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,630
vector and you have to be able to do it
on the Fly and the joints stop

638
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
on the Fly and the joints stop
 

639
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,510
on the Fly and the joints stop
functioning every time the joints

640
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
functioning every time the joints
 

641
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,909
functioning every time the joints
function you're going to lose connection

642
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
function you're going to lose connection
 

643
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,029
function you're going to lose connection
to the center okay

644
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039

 

645
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,430

so if you if you watch her Center and we

646
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:34,440
so if you if you watch her Center and we
 

647
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,149
so if you if you watch her Center and we
just plotted in space is it moving is it

648
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:38,159
just plotted in space is it moving is it
 

649
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,230
just plotted in space is it moving is it
is it is it moving through the sagittal

650
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240
is it is it moving through the sagittal
 

651
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,190
is it is it moving through the sagittal
plane that's on the map or is it

652
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,200
plane that's on the map or is it
 

653
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,029
plane that's on the map or is it
rotating are the distal ends of her body

654
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:48,039
rotating are the distal ends of her body
 

655
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,549
rotating are the distal ends of her body
rotating around her Center okay such

656
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:51,559
rotating around her Center okay such
 

657
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,750
rotating around her Center okay such
that it's because the center is

658
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:53,760
that it's because the center is
 

659
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,909
that it's because the center is
spinning okay like a imagine a a balar

660
00:18:58,909 --> 00:18:58,919
spinning okay like a imagine a a balar
 

661
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,630
spinning okay like a imagine a a balar
and I'm spinning it okay or I'm actually

662
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:01,640
and I'm spinning it okay or I'm actually
 

663
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,270
and I'm spinning it okay or I'm actually
doing some combination of both and

664
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280
doing some combination of both and
 

665
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,870
doing some combination of both and
they're spiraling through space like a

666
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:04,880
they're spiraling through space like a
 

667
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,549
they're spiraling through space like a
corpse through roller coaster so if we

668
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
corpse through roller coaster so if we
 

669
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,590
corpse through roller coaster so if we

joints do you see go back we're going to
 

841
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,630
joints do you see go back we're going to
go really slow as you take your kimy to

842
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:48,640
go really slow as you take your kimy to
 

843
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,310
go really slow as you take your kimy to
reconcile the

reconcile the
 

845
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,630
reconcile the
energy what am I doing keeping it on

846
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
energy what am I doing keeping it on
 

847
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,390
energy what am I doing keeping it on
keeping it on you see that's another

00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
keeping it on you see that's another
 

849
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,350
keeping it on you see that's another
attempt to take it off go around again

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
attempt to take it off go around again
 

851
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,669
attempt to take it off go around again
you'll see It'll be off you see it's off

852
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:03,679
you'll see It'll be off you see it's off
 

853

you'll see It'll be off you see it's off
again go

854
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:05,880
again go
 

855
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,950
again go
back so as each reconcile that she does

856
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:09,960
back so as each reconcile that she does
 

857

back so as each reconcile that she does
I keep the joint

858
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:11,880
I keep the joint
 

859

that
 

871
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,830
that
on okay now I don't want to see I don't

872
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:36,840
on okay now I don't want to see I don't
 

873
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,110
on okay now I don't want to see I don't
want to go here that's not where it's

874
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,120
want to go here that's not where it's
 

875
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,549
want to go here that's not where it's
on okay I have to go into your Center

876
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:43,559
on okay I have to go into your Center
 

877
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:44,789
on okay I have to go into your Center
into your Center you feel that

878
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
into your Center you feel that
 

879
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,269
into your Center you feel that
difference and that's where my

projection
 

883
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,149
projection
is okay try it

884
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:51,159
is okay try it
 

885
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:55,029
is okay try it
again all so now you're not in K DOA

886
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,039
again all so now you're not in K DOA
 

887

same okay
so as I go into his Center just like

896
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:08,760
so as I go into his Center just like
 

897
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,990
so as I go into his Center just like
kosa you feel it there it is he's going

898
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,000
kosa you feel it there it is he's going
 

899
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,630
kosa you feel it there it is he's going
to reconcile that energy and get back

900
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
to reconcile that energy and get back
 

901
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,230
to reconcile that energy and get back
into my Center okay and I'll show you he

902
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
into my Center okay and I'll show you he
 

903
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,990
into my Center okay and I'll show you he
because he can do a projection through

so I receive his projection again he's

948
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:43,760
so I receive his projection again he's
 

949
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,590
so I receive his projection again he's
not trying to just deal with my joints

950

faster do you get it that's what you
 

973
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,909
faster do you get it that's what you
were doing so you you over countered too

974

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,590
center
and at this point as I start to fall I'm

998
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:02,600
and at this point as I start to fall I'm
 

999
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,909
and at this point as I start to fall I'm
now going against the lock as I put him

1000
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:07,919
now going against the lock as I put him
 

1001
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,950
now going against the lock as I put him
back into there you see that so I go and

1002
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:11,960
back into there you see that so I go and
 

1003
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,029
back into there you see that so I go and
now your net has a choice don't break

1004
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:14,039
now your net has a choice don't break
 

1005
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,509
now your net has a choice don't break
our

1006
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:15,519
our
 

1007
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,549
our
wrist you get it or break our wrist

1008
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:20,559
wrist you get it or break our wrist
 

1009
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,470
wrist you get it or break our wrist
okay so don't

1010
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:23,480
okay so don't
 

1011
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,830
okay so don't
fall instead just reconcile again you

1012
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:27,840
fall instead just reconcile again you
 

1013
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,029
fall instead just reconcile again you
see just

1014
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:30,039
see just
 

1015
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:35,789
see just
reconcile and he'll

1016
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:35,799

 

1017
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,389

continue

1018
00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:37,399
continue
 

1019
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:48,389
continue
okay try it

1020
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399

 

1021
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:56,389

again I don't why are you not

1022
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:56,399

 

1023
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:08,990

switching

1024
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,000

 

1025
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,070

okay so again you're in his joint if we

1026
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,080
okay so again you're in his joint if we
 

1027
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,710
okay so again you're in his joint if we
if we you're in her joint too so if we

1028
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:15,720
if we you're in her joint too so if we
 

1029
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,269
if we you're in her joint too so if we
watch how much of the move has started

1030
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:18,279
watch how much of the move has started
 

1031
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:20,029
watch how much of the move has started
there's no he's just standing there do

1032
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:20,039
there's no he's just standing there do
 

1033
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,230
there's no he's just standing there do
you see this is where the resistant

1034
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,240
you see this is where the resistant
 

1035
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,470
you see this is where the resistant
opponent punches you in the face okay so

1036
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:25,480
opponent punches you in the face okay so
 

1037
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,269
opponent punches you in the face okay so
you would go no no nothing in the

1038
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:29,279
you would go no no nothing in the
 

1039
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,350
you would go no no nothing in the
center nothing now here so the joints

1040
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:32,360
center nothing now here so the joints
 

1041
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,269
center nothing now here so the joints
work their way up till they affected his

1042
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:35,279
work their way up till they affected his
 

1043
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,230
work their way up till they affected his
posture as as a sense of something

1044
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:38,240
posture as as a sense of something
 

1045
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,190
posture as as a sense of something
different he'll he's going to grab right

1046
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,200
different he'll he's going to grab right
 

1047
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,230
different he'll he's going to grab right
and because you can project it any point

1048
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,240
and because you can project it any point
 

1049
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,509
and because you can project it any point
this means I'm in his center right I'm

1050
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:46,519
this means I'm in his center right I'm
 

1051
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,549
this means I'm in his center right I'm
not going to be in his arm not in his

1052
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:48,559
not going to be in his arm not in his
 

1053
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,509
not going to be in his arm not in his
arm the second of contact you come that

1054
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:51,519
arm the second of contact you come that
 

1055
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:53,110
arm the second of contact you come that
so I'm going to I'm going to move

1056
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,120
so I'm going to I'm going to move
 

1057
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,909
so I'm going to I'm going to move
through the architectural pattern of n

1058
00:29:56,909 --> 00:29:56,919
through the architectural pattern of n
 

1059
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,269
through the architectural pattern of n
okay and I'll stop at various increments

1060
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:00,279
okay and I'll stop at various increments
 

1061
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:03,789
okay and I'll stop at various increments
in its spiral geometry and you'll see

1062
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:03,799
in its spiral geometry and you'll see
 

1063
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:07,269
in its spiral geometry and you'll see
that I can always project okay so I'm

1064
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:07,279
that I can always project okay so I'm
 

1065
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,190
that I can always project okay so I'm
going to start to

1066
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,200
going to start to
 

1067
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,430
going to start to
move there's that first part and again

1068
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:12,440
move there's that first part and again
 

1069
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,990
move there's that first part and again
in the center keep moving keep moving

1070
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,000
in the center keep moving keep moving
 

1071
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,230
in the center keep moving keep moving
and again there there it is right there

1072
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:21,240
and again there there it is right there
 

1073
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,230
and again there there it is right there
okay uh I'm going to go into the

1074
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,240
okay uh I'm going to go into the
 

1075
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,230
okay uh I'm going to go into the
technique here we are same thing

1076
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,240
technique here we are same thing
 

1077
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,669
technique here we are same thing
boom in the center I'm cutting through

1078
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:30,679
boom in the center I'm cutting through
 

1079
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,430
boom in the center I'm cutting through
the technique same thing in the center

1080
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:34,440
the technique same thing in the center
 

1081
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,710
the technique same thing in the center
same thing in the center and you have to

1082
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:37,720
same thing in the center and you have to
 

1083
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,630
same thing in the center and you have to
move so you can do it okay we're getting

1084
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:40,640
move so you can do it okay we're getting
 

1085
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,870
move so you can do it okay we're getting
into the technique same thing project in

1086
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:42,880
into the technique same thing project in
 

1087
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,950
into the technique same thing project in
the center
