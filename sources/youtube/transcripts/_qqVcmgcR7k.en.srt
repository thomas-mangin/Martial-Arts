1118
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:56,570
and problem very probably or in all
 

1119
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,750
and problem very probably or in all
probability a meal that we had in the

1120
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:58,760

00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,090
us becoming sick I ate the least because
 

1125
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,060
us becoming sick I ate the least because
I was already sick and as I said I was

1126
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,070

1131
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:23,520

so yeah with the supposition is we were

1132
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:23,530
so yeah with the supposition is we were
 

1133
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,210
so yeah with the supposition is we were
poisoned

1134
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:24,220
poisoned
 

1135
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,779

this area was famous for having a

this area was famous for having a
 

1137
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:31,680
this area was famous for having a
special recipe as it were for dealing

1138
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:31,690
special recipe as it were for dealing
 

1139
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:35,430
special recipe as it were for dealing
with outsiders yeah and I guess the

1140
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:35,440
with outsiders yeah and I guess the
 

1141
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,640
with outsiders yeah and I guess the
other factor chip remembers stuff better

1142
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:38,650
other factor chip remembers stuff better
 

1143
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,670
other factor chip remembers stuff better
than me so maybe I should ask you some

1144
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:41,680
than me so maybe I should ask you some
 

1145
