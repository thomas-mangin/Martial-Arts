1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,950

he did not use geometry okay

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:08,960

 

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,360

so we're working on cool on the scheme

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,370
so we're working on cool on the scheme
 

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:19,250
so we're working on cool on the scheme
okay it can't be like this no power in

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:19,260
okay it can't be like this no power in
 

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,160
okay it can't be like this no power in
it so the drill he's gonna offer

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,170
it so the drill he's gonna offer
 

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,200
it so the drill he's gonna offer
resistance you can go ahead okay and I

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,210
resistance you can go ahead okay and I
 

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,170
resistance you can go ahead okay and I
don't want to go up with my foot and

12
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:32,180
don't want to go up with my foot and
 

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,389
don't want to go up with my foot and
then down you'll you'll feel some

14
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:35,399
then down you'll you'll feel some
 

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,869
then down you'll you'll feel some
gravitational energy when you come down

16
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
gravitational energy when you come down
 

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,200
gravitational energy when you come down
but you won't ever get down in when

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,210
but you won't ever get down in when
 

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,209
but you won't ever get down in when
you're actually trying to apply force so

20
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:47,219
you're actually trying to apply force so
 

21
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,000
you're actually trying to apply force so
as I go up and he pushes on my sword

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,010
as I go up and he pushes on my sword
 

23
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,180
as I go up and he pushes on my sword
you see I won't reach that top okay so

24
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:55,190
you see I won't reach that top okay so
 

25
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:01,610
you see I won't reach that top okay so
that's not what we're doing so and it's

26
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:01,620
that's not what we're doing so and it's
 

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,329
that's not what we're doing so and it's
not in my arm that's not right my grip

28
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:05,339
not in my arm that's not right my grip
 

29
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,810
not in my arm that's not right my grip
is barely it is barely in I'm gonna drop

30
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:08,820
is barely it is barely in I'm gonna drop
 

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,060
is barely it is barely in I'm gonna drop
my weight so I can engage just like in

32
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,070
my weight so I can engage just like in
 

33
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,370
my weight so I can engage just like in
the you Miyaichi video and going to

34
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:16,380
the you Miyaichi video and going to
 

35
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,359
the you Miyaichi video and going to
engage the front follow my foot and the

36
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:20,369
engage the front follow my foot and the
 

37
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,789
engage the front follow my foot and the
front ball my split the mid foot of both

38
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
front ball my split the mid foot of both
 

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,749
front ball my split the mid foot of both
feet okay so that I can have that kind

40
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:26,759
feet okay so that I can have that kind
 

41
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,600
feet okay so that I can have that kind
of ledge that I'm gonna push on and then

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:29,610
of ledge that I'm gonna push on and then
 

43
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,870
of ledge that I'm gonna push on and then
I keep that level I just move my face

44
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
I keep that level I just move my face
 

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,730
I keep that level I just move my face
forward so I don't want to drop and then

46
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:37,740
forward so I don't want to drop and then
 

47
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:45,970
forward so I don't want to drop and then
try to do that drop

48
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:45,980

 

49
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:54,690

drop there's really nothing in that has

50
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:54,700

 

51
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,460

the flexion of the midsection is the

52
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:57,470
the flexion of the midsection is the
 

53
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,990
the flexion of the midsection is the
same as always

54
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,000

 

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:12,730

so it's percussive it's projecting okay

56
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:12,740
so it's percussive it's projecting okay
 

57
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:21,220
so it's percussive it's projecting okay
let's try that two things as you lower

58
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,230
let's try that two things as you lower
 

59
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,740
let's try that two things as you lower
your weight don't pull your center of

60
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:26,750
your weight don't pull your center of
 

61
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,880
your weight don't pull your center of
gravity forward

62
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:27,890
gravity forward
 

63
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:34,980
gravity forward
don't step push push it in the back

64
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:34,990
don't step push push it in the back
 

65
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,990
don't step push push it in the back
because when you have the when you step

66
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
because when you have the when you step
 

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,130
because when you have the when you step
like this right step your center of

68
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:42,140
like this right step your center of
 

69
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,340
like this right step your center of
gravity right it's getting in between

70
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,350
gravity right it's getting in between
 

71
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,870
gravity right it's getting in between
your feet and you want to push it push

72
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:49,880
your feet and you want to push it push
 

73
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,210
your feet and you want to push it push
it forward do you see that there's a

74
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:52,220
it forward do you see that there's a
 

75
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,220
it forward do you see that there's a
moment where nothing's happening

76
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,230
moment where nothing's happening
 

77
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,100
moment where nothing's happening
nothing's moving your foot moves now

78
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,110
nothing's moving your foot moves now
 

79
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,720
nothing's moving your foot moves now
they're centered right in between and

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:58,730
they're centered right in between and
 

81
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,640
they're centered right in between and
instead it just goes forward you guys

82
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:03,650
instead it just goes forward you guys
 

83
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,030
instead it just goes forward you guys
see that

84
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,040
see that
 

85
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,570
see that
alright secondly you you have the same

86
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:09,580
alright secondly you you have the same
 

87
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,550
alright secondly you you have the same
concept that always a psyche is here in

88
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
concept that always a psyche is here in
 

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,620
concept that always a psyche is here in
the grip so no I am generating that same

90
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:17,630
the grip so no I am generating that same
 

91
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,680
the grip so no I am generating that same
friction by matching the young energy of

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:23,690
friction by matching the young energy of
 

93
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,520
friction by matching the young energy of
the wood and the floor so I just loosely

94
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:27,530
the wood and the floor so I just loosely
 

95
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,740
the wood and the floor so I just loosely
here pushing my center forward loose

96
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:32,750
here pushing my center forward loose
 

97
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:40,430
here pushing my center forward loose
scrips

98
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:40,440

 

99
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:59,700

you see see how loose loose loose so

100
00:03:59,700 --> 00:03:59,710
you see see how loose loose loose so
 

101
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:13,860
you see see how loose loose loose so
this is to help he's gonna hold on hold

102
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:13,870
this is to help he's gonna hold on hold
 

103
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:31,200
this is to help he's gonna hold on hold
on to my dad you just watch your face

104
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,210
on to my dad you just watch your face
 

105
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,030
on to my dad you just watch your face
that you don't get stabbed when you come

106
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
that you don't get stabbed when you come
 

107
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:40,189
that you don't get stabbed when you come
back in okay let's try that

108
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:40,199

 

109
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,450

so it's gonna be right when we touch ooh

110
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:44,460
so it's gonna be right when we touch ooh
 

111
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:59,179
so it's gonna be right when we touch ooh
I'm gonna do this and now I'm adding the

112
00:04:59,179 --> 00:04:59,189
I'm gonna do this and now I'm adding the
 

113
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:03,860
I'm gonna do this and now I'm adding the
continuous violence of action they

114
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:03,870
continuous violence of action they
 

115
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,409
continuous violence of action they
really were doing this by initial

116
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:06,419
really were doing this by initial
 

117
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:10,010
really were doing this by initial
acceleration and I'm going to keep going

118
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,020
acceleration and I'm going to keep going
 

119
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,850
acceleration and I'm going to keep going
forward so right when we touch this is

120
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:13,860
forward so right when we touch this is
 

121
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:31,990
forward so right when we touch this is
it

122
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000

 

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,490

all right let's try

124
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:38,500

 

125
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,570

so I am NOT going to be committed to say

126
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:43,580
so I am NOT going to be committed to say
 

127
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,510
so I am NOT going to be committed to say
God and my kid I'm not gonna half-ass

128
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:46,520
God and my kid I'm not gonna half-ass
 

129
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,580
God and my kid I'm not gonna half-ass
this we want that violence of action

130
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:51,590
this we want that violence of action
 

131
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:57,180
this we want that violence of action
okay I don't want him grabbing my sword

132
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,190
okay I don't want him grabbing my sword
 

133
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,590
okay I don't want him grabbing my sword
I want him to deal with the onslaught of

134
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:02,600
I want him to deal with the onslaught of
 

135
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:12,370
I want him to deal with the onslaught of
my aggressiveness it's kind of like if I

136
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:12,380
my aggressiveness it's kind of like if I
 

137
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,880
my aggressiveness it's kind of like if I
throw if I throw my punch

138
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:14,890
throw if I throw my punch
 

139
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:20,560
throw if I throw my punch
he might block it but he's got all that

140
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:20,570
he might block it but he's got all that
 

141
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:26,400
he might block it but he's got all that
aggressiveness okay

142
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,410

 

143
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,760

trying to occupy his mind by occupying

144
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:30,770
trying to occupy his mind by occupying
 

145
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:40,500
trying to occupy his mind by occupying
his space so this isn't it he'll grab

146
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:40,510
his space so this isn't it he'll grab
 

147
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,840
his space so this isn't it he'll grab
your sword and beat you with it okay

148
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:43,850
your sword and beat you with it okay
 

149
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:54,280
your sword and beat you with it okay
your your mind is your in and so he's

150
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,290
your your mind is your in and so he's
 

151
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,820
your your mind is your in and so he's
gonna do it now don't make me just grab

152
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:57,830
gonna do it now don't make me just grab
 

153
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:04,840
gonna do it now don't make me just grab
your sword there's little hesitation and

154
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:04,850
your sword there's little hesitation and
 

155
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,960
your sword there's little hesitation and
if I do grab it you're just gonna keep

156
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:07,970
if I do grab it you're just gonna keep
 

157
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:13,590
if I do grab it you're just gonna keep
it going
