hey guys it's a uh cold rainy day here

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:07,240
hey guys it's a uh cold rainy day here

00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,470
hey guys it's a uh cold rainy day here
in Fresno and I just came back from

6
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:09,480
in Fresno and I just came back from
 

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,190
in Fresno and I just came back from
driving around and I took a corner

8
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:12,200
driving around and I took a corner
 

9
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,789
driving around and I took a corner
really fast and everything's really wet

10
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:13,799
really fast and everything's really wet
 

11
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,870
really fast and everything's really wet
right now and uh my tires had just

12
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
right now and uh my tires had just
 

13
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,150
right now and uh my tires had just
enough grip to allow me to make a pretty

14
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:19,160
enough grip to allow me to make a pretty
 

15
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,710
enough grip to allow me to make a pretty
quick turn and and when after I made the

16
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:21,720
quick turn and and when after I made the
 

17
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,630
quick turn and and when after I made the
turn I thought about how happy I was

18
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:23,640
turn I thought about how happy I was
 

19
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,910
turn I thought about how happy I was
that there was plenty of tread on my

20
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:24,920
that there was plenty of tread on my
 

21
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,269
that there was plenty of tread on my
tires so it enabled me to kind of to get

22
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:27,279
tires so it enabled me to kind of to get
 

23
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,790
tires so it enabled me to kind of to get
the grip I needed to make that turn and

24
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:29,800
the grip I needed to make that turn and
 

25
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,870
the grip I needed to make that turn and
that started to make me think about uh

26
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:31,880
that started to make me think about uh
 

27
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,229
that started to make me think about uh
race car tires and regular daily driver

28
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:35,239
race car tires and regular daily driver
 

29
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,630
race car tires and regular daily driver
tires and how they differ and and they

30
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:37,640
tires and how they differ and and they
 

31
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,310
tires and how they differ and and they
differ for very important reasons and

32
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:39,320
differ for very important reasons and
 

33
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,990
differ for very important reasons and
that led me to think about martial arts

34
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,000
that led me to think about martial arts
 

35
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,590
that led me to think about martial arts
and self-defense and Sport martial arts

36
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:42,600
and self-defense and Sport martial arts
 

37
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,630
and self-defense and Sport martial arts
and how that works um and I know that

38
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
and how that works um and I know that
 

39
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,270
and how that works um and I know that
seems strange probably to think about

40
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:46,280
seems strange probably to think about
 

41
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,830
seems strange probably to think about
all those things in a row but I think

42
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
all those things in a row but I think
 

43
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,150
all those things in a row but I think
about martial arts most of the time so

44
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
about martial arts most of the time so
 

45
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,670
about martial arts most of the time so
usually any anything I I kind of start

46
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:52,680
usually any anything I I kind of start
 

47
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,310
usually any anything I I kind of start
to understand I I start to equate to

48
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
to understand I I start to equate to
 

49
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,950
to understand I I start to equate to
martial arts really quickly so real

50
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:55,960
martial arts really quickly so real
 

51
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,990
martial arts really quickly so real
briefly and it it tires really don't

52
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
briefly and it it tires really don't
 

53
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,470
briefly and it it tires really don't
matter to most the people watching this

54
00:00:59,470 --> 00:00:59,480
matter to most the people watching this
 

55
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,029
matter to most the people watching this
video I'm sure but basically uh your

56
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:02,039
video I'm sure but basically uh your
 

57
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,590
video I'm sure but basically uh your
Tire's job is to make a lot of

58
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:04,600
Tire's job is to make a lot of
 

59
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,429
Tire's job is to make a lot of
connection to the ground right so you

60
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:06,439
connection to the ground right so you
 

61
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,390
connection to the ground right so you
want a lot of surface area to make

62
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
want a lot of surface area to make
 

63
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,630
want a lot of surface area to make
connection to the ground now in a race

64
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
connection to the ground now in a race
 

65
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,109
connection to the ground now in a race
car tire they use a really slick tread

66
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:14,119
car tire they use a really slick tread
 

67
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:16,030
car tire they use a really slick tread
and the reason they do this is because

68
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,040
and the reason they do this is because
 

69
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,109
and the reason they do this is because
the Slick tread allows you to make

70
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:18,119
the Slick tread allows you to make
 

71
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,190
the Slick tread allows you to make
maximum uh contact surface area with the

72
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
maximum uh contact surface area with the
 

73
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,429
maximum uh contact surface area with the
track and the track's a consistent

74
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
track and the track's a consistent
 

75
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,749
track and the track's a consistent
surface that we always know about so

76
00:01:24,749 --> 00:01:24,759
surface that we always know about so
 

77
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:29,109
surface that we always know about so
it's always hard and smooth and grippy

78
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
it's always hard and smooth and grippy
 

79
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,069
it's always hard and smooth and grippy
and and we we can always make sure we

80
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:31,079
and and we we can always make sure we
 

81
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,910
and and we we can always make sure we
have our races when the tire or when the

82
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
have our races when the tire or when the
 

83
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,310
have our races when the tire or when the
conditions are optimal for the tire to

84
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,320
conditions are optimal for the tire to
 

85
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,789
conditions are optimal for the tire to
grip right so for example if it's rainy

86
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:37,799
grip right so for example if it's rainy
 

87
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,429
grip right so for example if it's rainy
uh or it's too cold and the track's kind

88
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:40,439
uh or it's too cold and the track's kind
 

89
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,670
uh or it's too cold and the track's kind
of hard and frosty or it's too hot and

90
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:42,680
of hard and frosty or it's too hot and
 

91
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,510
of hard and frosty or it's too hot and
the track's kind of gummy we can say oh

92
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:44,520
the track's kind of gummy we can say oh
 

93
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,109
the track's kind of gummy we can say oh
we're not going to have a race today

94
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:46,119
we're not going to have a race today
 

95
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:47,950
we're not going to have a race today
because the conditions aren't right and

96
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:47,960
because the conditions aren't right and
 

97
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,870
because the conditions aren't right and
so it's not safe or not ideal for for

98
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
so it's not safe or not ideal for for
 

99
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,030
so it's not safe or not ideal for for
racing in a normal cars Tire we have

100
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
racing in a normal cars Tire we have
 

101
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,550
racing in a normal cars Tire we have
tread on our tires and the reason we

102
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
tread on our tires and the reason we
 

103
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,230
tread on our tires and the reason we
have that tread is because when the the

104
00:01:59,230 --> 00:01:59,240
have that tread is because when the the
 

105
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,469
have that tread is because when the the
surface that we're driving on is soft or

106
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:03,479
surface that we're driving on is soft or
 

107
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,029
surface that we're driving on is soft or
loose or by loose I mean like there's a

108
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:06,039
loose or by loose I mean like there's a
 

109
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:08,510
loose or by loose I mean like there's a
lot of grit that can slide around or

110
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:08,520
lot of grit that can slide around or
 

111
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,430
lot of grit that can slide around or
something like that uh so like dust or

112
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
something like that uh so like dust or
 

113
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,550
something like that uh so like dust or
rain uh or if it's really slick we need

114
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
rain uh or if it's really slick we need
 

115
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,990
rain uh or if it's really slick we need
surface area we need more surface area

116
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,000
surface area we need more surface area
 

117
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,710
surface area we need more surface area
to catch as the tire slides along right

118
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:19,720
to catch as the tire slides along right
 

119
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,990
to catch as the tire slides along right
so if you can picture it you know the

120
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
so if you can picture it you know the
 

121
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,750
so if you can picture it you know the
Bottom's of course always connecting but

122
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
Bottom's of course always connecting but
 

123
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,150
Bottom's of course always connecting but
if the bottom gives way we want to have

124
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
if the bottom gives way we want to have
 

125
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,229
if the bottom gives way we want to have
little ridges that can kind of catch any

126
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
little ridges that can kind of catch any
 

127
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,390
little ridges that can kind of catch any
bumps along the way that get us to have

128
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
bumps along the way that get us to have
 

129
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,990
bumps along the way that get us to have
more traction so the the everyday driver

130
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,000
more traction so the the everyday driver
 

131
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,710
more traction so the the everyday driver
tire kind of makes a sacrifice of not

132
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
tire kind of makes a sacrifice of not
 

133
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,270
tire kind of makes a sacrifice of not
having optimal traction on on a perfect

134
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:38,280
having optimal traction on on a perfect
 

135
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,830
having optimal traction on on a perfect
roadway but when the roadway is not

136
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:40,840
roadway but when the roadway is not
 

137
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,470
roadway but when the roadway is not
perfect it gives us a lot of traction

138
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
perfect it gives us a lot of traction
 

139
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,550
perfect it gives us a lot of traction
that we wouldn't have in a slick tire

140
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
that we wouldn't have in a slick tire
 

141
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,030
that we wouldn't have in a slick tire
and that's of course probably not

142
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,040
and that's of course probably not
 

143
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,949
and that's of course probably not
important to most of you but it makes a

144
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:47,959
important to most of you but it makes a
 

145
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,350
important to most of you but it makes a
nice analogy for me with the martial

146
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:50,360
nice analogy for me with the martial
 

147
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,550
nice analogy for me with the martial
arts in the martial arts if you're

148
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
arts in the martial arts if you're
 

149
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,830
arts in the martial arts if you're
studying martial arts for self-defense

150
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:54,840
studying martial arts for self-defense
 

151
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,830
studying martial arts for self-defense
and that is that you want to have a

152
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:56,840
and that is that you want to have a
 

153
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,390
and that is that you want to have a
pragmatic ability to take care of

154
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
pragmatic ability to take care of
 

155
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,149
pragmatic ability to take care of
yourself when you're out in the world

156
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
yourself when you're out in the world
 

157
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,789
yourself when you're out in the world
you need to have the equivalent of a

158
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:03,799
you need to have the equivalent of a
 

159
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,309
you need to have the equivalent of a
general purpose allterrain tire so you

160
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
general purpose allterrain tire so you
 

161
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,550
general purpose allterrain tire so you
want a tire with a lot of ridges so when

162

of people who study self-defense will
say well I don't want to stay Brazilian

340
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:16,280
say well I don't want to stay Brazilian
 

341
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,469
say well I don't want to stay Brazilian
Jitsu because I don't want to fight on

342
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479

ground but you might find yourself on
the ground so if we go back to our

350
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:26,039
the ground so if we go back to our
 

351
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,270
the ground so if we go back to our
analogy of the tire you know as as a guy

ideally always want to drive on a

356
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
ideally always want to drive on a
 

357
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,270
ideally always want to drive on a
perfect track and you do but sometimes

358
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:34,280
perfect track and you do but sometimes
 

359
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,390
perfect track and you do but sometimes
you have to go off terrain because

360
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
you have to go off terrain because
 

361
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,670
you have to go off terrain because
that's what happens right when we're

362
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
that's what happens right when we're
 

363
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,430
that's what happens right when we're
driving every day we don't always get to

364
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
driving every day we don't always get to

of environmental changes it doesn't take
 

455
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,029
of environmental changes it doesn't take

attacker situations so that's that's an
 

461
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,309
attacker situations so that's that's an
awful lot of area that it's just

462
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
awful lot of area that it's just
 

463
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,110
awful lot of area that it's just
completely

464
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,120

they do they're better at what they do
 

471
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,550
they do they're better at what they do
um in that specific situation than any

472
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
um in that specific situation than any
 

473
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,189
um in that specific situation than any
generalist could even be generally

474
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
generalist could even be generally
 

475
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,790
generalist could even be generally
because the when when you're looking at

476
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:27,800
because the when when you're looking at
 

477
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,909
because the when when you're looking at
a lot of different environments it's

478
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
a lot of different environments it's
 

479
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,589
a lot of different environments it's
hard to master any one of those

480
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
hard to master any one of those
 

481
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,509
hard to master any one of those
