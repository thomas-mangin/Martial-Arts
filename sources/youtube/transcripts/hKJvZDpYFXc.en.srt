some way so sometimes you have some ukas
 

33
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:27,070
some way so sometimes you have some ukas
that will slide

that will slide
 

35
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,229
that will slide
under okay and then sometimes you have

back breakfall but either way uh if we
 

47
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,830
back breakfall but either way uh if we
just look at the head

48

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,390
stuff is what we want to do because
they're coming from west to east and we

70
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:23,400
they're coming from west to east and we

so that's a y y Clash okay we don't want

74
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:29,959
so that's a y y Clash okay we don't want
 

75
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,030
so that's a y y Clash okay we don't want
to do that so if uh this is where the

76
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,040
to do that so if uh this is where the
 

77
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,309
to do that so if uh this is where the
heaven arm would be what we want to do

78
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
heaven arm would be what we want to do
 

79
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,589
heaven arm would be what we want to do
instead is we know for the head to

help make the feet light okay and the

138
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:11,720
help make the feet light okay and the
 

139
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,430
help make the feet light okay and the
way you do that is you now bring the

140
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:14,440
way you do that is you now bring the
 

141
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,629
way you do that is you now bring the
head this

142
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:15,639
head this
 

143
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:21,629
head this
way okay your hip's going to go in

144
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:21,639

 

145
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,909

here crap all right you're going to go

146
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:24,919
here crap all right you're going to go
 

147
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,510
here crap all right you're going to go
this way you make that little Loop and

148
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
this way you make that little Loop and
 

149
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,710
this way you make that little Loop and
now you come this way

150
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
now you come this way
 

151
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,270
now you come this way
then your hip goes in here and this part

152
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,280
then your hip goes in here and this part
 

153
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,029
then your hip goes in here and this part
starts to now folk them around this way

154
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:38,039
starts to now folk them around this way
 

155
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,790
starts to now folk them around this way

pick the feet up and I help pick the
 

165
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,749
pick the feet up and I help pick the
feet up by moving the head this way and

166
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:54,759
feet up by moving the head this way and
 

167
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,070
feet up by moving the head this way and
then eventually that head Falls over on

168
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,080
then eventually that head Falls over on
 

169
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,150
then eventually that head Falls over on
this side okay so let's fil it from over

170
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,160
this side okay so let's fil it from over
 

171
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,029
this side okay so let's fil it from over
here so you can see more of the angles

172
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
here so you can see more of the angles
 

173
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,870
here so you can see more of the angles
the head is going forward it's going to

174
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:07,880
the head is going forward it's going to
 

175
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,070
the head is going forward it's going to
do that

176
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,080
do that
 

177
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,830
do that
kotes on the head now the forward

178
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
kotes on the head now the forward
 

179
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,469
kotes on the head now the forward
inertia is going rearward okay then I

180
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:15,479
inertia is going rearward okay then I
 

181
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,670
inertia is going rearward okay then I
got to get weight off the feet and so I

182
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:18,680
got to get weight off the feet and so I
 

183
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,110
got to get weight off the feet and so I
bring the head this way with my hip over

184
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
bring the head this way with my hip over
 

185
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,909
bring the head this way with my hip over
here the head goes this way the feet go

186
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:24,919
here the head goes this way the feet go
 

187
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,070
here the head goes this way the feet go
that way and the feet start to lower the

188
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,080
that way and the feet start to lower the
 

189
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,070
that way and the feet start to lower the
head and the guy falls down okay

190
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
head and the guy falls down okay
 

191
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,469
head and the guy falls down okay
okay one more time this way on the head

192
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:35,479
okay one more time this way on the head
 

193
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,749
okay one more time this way on the head
then back this way Hip is over here

194
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:38,759
then back this way Hip is over here
 

195
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,710
then back this way Hip is over here
it'll lighten the feet the feet will

196
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
it'll lighten the feet the feet will
 

197
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,469
it'll lighten the feet the feet will
come around as I keep guiding the head

198
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
come around as I keep guiding the head
 

199
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,990
come around as I keep guiding the head
around my body and the guy falls down

200
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
around my body and the guy falls down
 

201
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,629
around my body and the guy falls down
okay not doing

202
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
okay not doing
 

203
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,390
okay not doing
this like that

204
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:51,400
this like that
 

205
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,189
this like that
okay so let's look at some of the more

206
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
okay so let's look at some of the more
 

207
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,350
okay so let's look at some of the more
common ways that

208
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,360
common ways that
 

209
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,510
common ways that
people um um mistakenly end up Yong Yong

210
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
people um um mistakenly end up Yong Yong
 

211
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,869
people um um mistakenly end up Yong Yong
clashing that means that they're coming

212
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:05,879
clashing that means that they're coming
 

213
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,230
clashing that means that they're coming
this way and you just took energy uh in

214
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
this way and you just took energy uh in
 

215
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,189
this way and you just took energy uh in
100 uh 180° opposition to them okay so

216
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
100 uh 180° opposition to them okay so
 

217
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,189
100 uh 180° opposition to them okay so
we'll do that

218
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
we'll do that
 

219
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,350
we'll do that
now okay uh let's go over

220
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:20,360
now okay uh let's go over
 

221
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,029
now okay uh let's go over
here so probably the most common way is

222
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:24,039
here so probably the most common way is
 

223
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,950
here so probably the most common way is
we'll just look at the Earth hand is the

224
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
we'll just look at the Earth hand is the
 

225
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,990
we'll just look at the Earth hand is the
earth hand the person's coming in and

226
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
earth hand the person's coming in and
 

227
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,189
earth hand the person's coming in and
then we pull it this way

228
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:34,199
then we pull it this way
 

229
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,550
then we pull it this way
okay so this hand looks like

230
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:37,560
okay so this hand looks like
 

231
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,749
okay so this hand looks like
this

232
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
this
 

233
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,710
this
okay uh a lot of people are thinking

234
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:43,720
okay uh a lot of people are thinking
 

235
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,909
okay uh a lot of people are thinking
that you're going to shove that down

236
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
that you're going to shove that down
 

237
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,909
that you're going to shove that down
like that and then you have now shikaku

238
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:48,919
like that and then you have now shikaku
 

239
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:53,950
like that and then you have now shikaku
and then you enter into

240
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:53,960

 

241
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,070

it but what happens is is when you when

242
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,080
it but what happens is is when you when
 

243
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,990
it but what happens is is when you when
you pull this thing around like that

244
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
you pull this thing around like that
 

245
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,629
you pull this thing around like that
you can see the pull I'm doing on his

246
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
you can see the pull I'm doing on his
 

247
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,149
you can see the pull I'm doing on his
shoulder so I'm just demonstrating it

248
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:05,159
shoulder so I'm just demonstrating it
 

249
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,909
shoulder so I'm just demonstrating it
from this angle

250
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
from this angle
 

251
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,670
from this angle
okay

252
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
okay
 

253
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,309
okay
okay and so now that

254
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
okay and so now that
 

255
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,189
okay and so now that
shoulder is coming back which means that

256
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
shoulder is coming back which means that
 

257
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,589
shoulder is coming back which means that
other shoulders coming forward and you

258
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
other shoulders coming forward and you
 

259
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,149
other shoulders coming forward and you
can see how it sets them up for that

260
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:20,159
can see how it sets them up for that
 

261
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:26,830
can see how it sets them up for that
turn that you have uh that problem with

262
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:26,840

 

263
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,629

okay which means if he wants to he could

264
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
okay which means if he wants to he could
 

265
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,709
okay which means if he wants to he could
take that

266
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:31,719
take that
 

267
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,430
take that
turn you

268
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:34,440
turn you
 

269
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,110
turn you
see and that's that's the problem so I'm

270
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
see and that's that's the problem so I'm
 

271
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,550
see and that's that's the problem so I'm
contesting on the grip and now I made it

272
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
contesting on the grip and now I made it
 

273
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,230
contesting on the grip and now I made it
possible for the UK who wants to turn to

274
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,240
possible for the UK who wants to turn to
 

275
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,269
possible for the UK who wants to turn to
turn

276
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
turn
 

277
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,990
turn
okay it goes this

278
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,000
okay it goes this
 

279
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,430
okay it goes this
way and it doesn't matter if I

280
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440

 

281
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,430

enter and to do it every time okay so

282
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:00,440
enter and to do it every time okay so
 

283
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,829
enter and to do it every time okay so
what we want to do on this hand is not

284
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:04,839
what we want to do on this hand is not
 

285
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,110
what we want to do on this hand is not
go this

286
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:06,120
go this
 

287
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,190
go this
way it's going to help with that pattern

288
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
way it's going to help with that pattern
 

289
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,949
way it's going to help with that pattern
so I showed the pattern on this side so

290
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
so I showed the pattern on this side so
 

291
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,630
so I showed the pattern on this side so
we'll do it on this side okay he's going

292
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:13,640
we'll do it on this side okay he's going
 

293
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,350
we'll do it on this side okay he's going
to go

294
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:16,360
to go
 

295
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,550
to go
in and then around me this way

296
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:21,560
in and then around me this way
 

297
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,389
in and then around me this way
okay so if we look at certain things

298
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:25,399
okay so if we look at certain things
 

299
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,590
okay so if we look at certain things
one when I do this hand

300
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
one when I do this hand
 

301
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,550
one when I do this hand
and I go here like that we want to look

302
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
and I go here like that we want to look
 

303
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,389
and I go here like that we want to look
at where his foot is to my hip it's way

304
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
at where his foot is to my hip it's way
 

305

there and we want to bring him more in
past my hip and that's where that hand

310
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440

 

311
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:01,230

drops I want him past my head

way this way not this

318
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:17,560

 

319
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:33,030

way let him pass you and then you enter

320
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040

 

321
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,509

324
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:40,639
you just guiding it is very light here
 

325
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,750
you just guiding it is very light here
that's how you know when to drop it when

326
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
that's how you know when to drop it when
 

327
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,910
that's how you know when to drop it when
you don't feel his energy on it anymore

328
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:46,920
you don't feel his energy on it anymore
 

329

hand is going this way this hand is
going this way too it's coming back

500
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
going this way too it's coming back
 

501
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,230
going this way too it's coming back
towards me back towards me

502
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
towards me back towards me
 

503
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,189
towards me back towards me
okay so a lot of times just like on the

504
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
okay so a lot of times just like on the
 

505
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,550
okay so a lot of times just like on the
earth hand uh people bring it only a

506
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
earth hand uh people bring it only a
 

507
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,389
earth hand uh people bring it only a
little bit where his foot SN over here

508
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:31,399
little bit where his foot SN over here
 

509
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,949
little bit where his foot SN over here
and then they start bringing it back

510
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
and then they start bringing it back
 

511
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,590
and then they start bringing it back
here the same thing you get sub opening

512
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:36,600
here the same thing you get sub opening
 

513
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,749
here the same thing you get sub opening
but now it's going it's going that way

514
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:38,759
but now it's going it's going that way
 

515
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,629
but now it's going it's going that way
and it stops a person stops a person and

516
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:43,639
and it stops a person stops a person and
 

517
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,350
and it stops a person stops a person and
when it stops a person it gives him a

518
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:46,360
when it stops a person it gives him a
 

519
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,269
when it stops a person it gives him a
choice to turn on it and you can do the

520
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
choice to turn on it and you can do the
 

521
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,389
choice to turn on it and you can do the
forward

522
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:51,399
forward
 

523
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,350
forward
R what we're trying to do is stop him

524
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:54,360
R what we're trying to do is stop him
 

525
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,269
R what we're trying to do is stop him
from being able to turn by preoccupying

526
00:16:58,269 --> 00:16:58,279
from being able to turn by preoccupying
 

527
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,509
from being able to turn by preoccupying
his Center with the forward

528
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:00,519
his Center with the forward
 

529
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,870
his Center with the forward
inertia it's hard to turn when your

530
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:02,880
inertia it's hard to turn when your
 

531
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,189
inertia it's hard to turn when your
Center is being pulled that way okay

532
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:06,199
Center is being pulled that way okay
 

533
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,429
Center is being pulled that way okay
that's that's our our counter to the

534
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:08,439
that's that's our our counter to the
 

535
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,630
that's that's our our counter to the
turn all right so we work on this

536
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
turn all right so we work on this
 

537
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,110
turn all right so we work on this
hand and it's the IM spiral yes but it

538
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,120
hand and it's the IM spiral yes but it
 

539
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,429
hand and it's the IM spiral yes but it
wants to control the

540
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:20,439
wants to control the
 

541
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,789
wants to control the
elbow and this becomes as if I'm holding

542
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799
elbow and this becomes as if I'm holding
 

543
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:32,669
elbow and this becomes as if I'm holding
here and I pull this forward

544
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:32,679

 

545
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:35,630

here and I'm pulling it forward so he

546
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:35,640
here and I'm pulling it forward so he
 

547
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,990
here and I'm pulling it forward so he
keeps going

548
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,000
keeps going
 

549
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,150
keeps going
forward when you combine this elbow like

550
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,160
forward when you combine this elbow like
 

551
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,590
forward when you combine this elbow like
that and they're both pulling it's not

552
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
that and they're both pulling it's not
 

553
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,029
that and they're both pulling it's not
possible to turn cuz there's pulling

554
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:46,039
possible to turn cuz there's pulling
 

555
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:50,190
possible to turn cuz there's pulling
here try to turn it's pulling him that

556
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:50,200
here try to turn it's pulling him that
 

557
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,590
here try to turn it's pulling him that
way so we're going to just look at this

558
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:52,600
way so we're going to just look at this
 

559
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,549
way so we're going to just look at this
hand and this hand goes here and it

560
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
hand and this hand goes here and it
 

561
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,789
hand and this hand goes here and it
moves him back for

562
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:00,799
moves him back for
 

563
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,630
moves him back for
forward and back this way that's what I

564
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
forward and back this way that's what I
 

565
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,950
forward and back this way that's what I
mean it's making him go

566
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:07,960
mean it's making him go
 

567
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,669
mean it's making him go
forward and it brings him to here I

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,110

from okay try that for okayy a second

662
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
from okay try that for okayy a second
 

663
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,870
from okay try that for okayy a second
detail on this on the heaven hand okay

664
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
detail on this on the heaven hand okay
 

665
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,630
detail on this on the heaven hand okay
for him to

666
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
for him to
 

667
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,470
for him to
turn he can't have his head going the

668
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:57,480
turn he can't have his head going the
 

669
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,029
turn he can't have his head going the
other way so

670
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
other way so
 

671
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,830
other way so
here would be a a a linear energy

672
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:02,840
here would be a a a linear energy
 

673
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,789
here would be a a a linear energy
against his chin and he's going to turn

674
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:05,799
against his chin and he's going to turn
 

675
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,870
against his chin and he's going to turn
this way the head the head is now acting

676
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:07,880
this way the head the head is now acting
 

677
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,310
this way the head the head is now acting
against that okay so when he's in the

678
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:11,320
against that okay so when he's in the
 

679
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,750
against that okay so when he's in the
heaven hand and he she like that and you

680
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:14,760
heaven hand and he she like that and you
 

681
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,269
heaven hand and he she like that and you
C you're throwing him basically into the

682
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:17,279
C you're throwing him basically into the
 

683
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,789
C you're throwing him basically into the
hand so he's pressing into the hand okay

684
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
hand so he's pressing into the hand okay
 

685
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,029
hand so he's pressing into the hand okay
it's not it's not easy to turn your head

686
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:24,039
it's not it's not easy to turn your head
 

687
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,029
it's not it's not easy to turn your head
that way because even though I'm

688
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:26,039
that way because even though I'm
 

689
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,710
that way because even though I'm
bringing his head this way if if you

690
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:28,720
bringing his head this way if if you
 

691
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,870
bringing his head this way if if you
don't

692
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:30,880
don't
 

693
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,110
don't
mind his linear inertia is pushing him

694
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,120
mind his linear inertia is pushing him
 

695
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,230
mind his linear inertia is pushing him
into my hand you see and as I move this

696
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,240
into my hand you see and as I move this
 

697
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,669
into my hand you see and as I move this
way it's difficult for him to turn his

698
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
way it's difficult for him to turn his
 

699
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,549
way it's difficult for him to turn his
chin in the direction do do you

700
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
chin in the direction do do you
 

701
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,470
chin in the direction do do you
understand that

702
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480

 

703
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,190

whereas if I don't have him cuz I'm

704
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,200
whereas if I don't have him cuz I'm
 

705
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,830
whereas if I don't have him cuz I'm
pushing my hand this way his forward

706
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
pushing my hand this way his forward
 

707
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,990
pushing my hand this way his forward
inertia he's going to yield to it by

708
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
inertia he's going to yield to it by
 

709
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,830
inertia he's going to yield to it by
turning and he's in the pivot okay so

710
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:57,840
turning and he's in the pivot okay so
 

711
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,669
turning and he's in the pivot okay so
I'm going to smash him into my arm boom

712
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:02,679
I'm going to smash him into my arm boom
 

713
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:05,070
I'm going to smash him into my arm boom
and it makes it hard for him to turn the

714
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,080
and it makes it hard for him to turn the
 

715
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,029
and it makes it hard for him to turn the
chin and I don't need him to not turn

716
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:08,039
chin and I don't need him to not turn
 

717
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,750
chin and I don't need him to not turn
the chin ever I just need him not to

718
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:10,760
the chin ever I just need him not to
 

719
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,830
the chin ever I just need him not to
turn the chin long enough for me to

720
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:13,840
turn the chin long enough for me to
 

721
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,909
turn the chin long enough for me to
enter

722
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:15,919
enter
 

723
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,510
enter
okay when I

724
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520

 

725
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,230

enter and I have him

726
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,240
enter and I have him
 

727
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,830
enter and I have him
here I don't now try to throw his

728
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:25,840
here I don't now try to throw his
 

729
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,110
here I don't now try to throw his
head okay I have him like this so go

730
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,120
head okay I have him like this so go
 

731
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,149
head okay I have him like this so go
back where I show you where I'm at

to do
 

747
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:56,310
to do
instead is as the weight is not on his

748
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
instead is as the weight is not on his
 

749
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,269
instead is as the weight is not on his
legs now and the inertia was coming

750
00:23:59,269 --> 00:23:59,279
legs now and the inertia was coming
 

751
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,390
legs now and the inertia was coming
through on his

752
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400

 

753
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,950

754
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:05,960
Center imagine here's his head I hold
 

755
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,269
Center imagine here's his head I hold
his head

00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:09,279

 

757
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,470

still camera over here you're going to

758
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,480
still camera over here you're going to
 

759
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,310
still camera over here you're going to
grab his Center this camera over here

760
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:17,320
grab his Center this camera over here
 

761
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,149
grab his Center this camera over here
this is what I'm working with this makes

762
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
this is what I'm working with this makes
 

763
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,950
this is what I'm working with this makes
his feet light and I can now make his

764
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:23,960
his feet light and I can now make his
 

765
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,710
his feet light and I can now make his
head light okay so when he gets to where

766
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
head light okay so when he gets to where
 

767
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,149
head light okay so when he gets to where
I want here this is where I'm coming in

768
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:33,159
I want here this is where I'm coming in
 

769
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:36,990
I want here this is where I'm coming in
and hitting this

770
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,000

 

771
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,070

base as the base gets displaced his head

772
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,080
base as the base gets displaced his head
 

773
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,149
base as the base gets displaced his head
gets lighter and all I'm doing is

774
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,159
gets lighter and all I'm doing is
 

775
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,470
gets lighter and all I'm doing is
guiding it around me I'm not throwing

776
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
guiding it around me I'm not throwing
 

777
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,350
guiding it around me I'm not throwing
them down so I don't ever have to make

778
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
them down so I don't ever have to make
 

779
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,870
them down so I don't ever have to make
my arm go against that energy coming

780
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
my arm go against that energy coming
 

781
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:26,430
my arm go against that energy coming
west to east just around

782
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:26,440

 

783
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:53,750

785
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,310

okay so uh what I'm doing here is that

786
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:57,320
okay so uh what I'm doing here is that
 

787
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,990
okay so uh what I'm doing here is that
body lock concept we have a video on the

788
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,000
body lock concept we have a video on the
 

789
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,110
body lock concept we have a video on the
body lock maybe more than one but it's

790
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
body lock maybe more than one but it's
 

791
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,190
body lock maybe more than one but it's
the only way I throw I only throw with

792
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,200
the only way I throw I only throw with
 

793
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,310
the only way I throw I only throw with
the body lock especially on the back

794
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320
the body lock especially on the back
 

795
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,990
the body lock especially on the back
breakfall um as opposed to requiring a

796
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,000
breakfall um as opposed to requiring a
 

797
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,430
breakfall um as opposed to requiring a
hinge in the middle of his body like the

798
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:14,440
hinge in the middle of his body like the
 

799
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,070
hinge in the middle of his body like the
bonai does or uh the Federation at large

800
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,080
bonai does or uh the Federation at large
 

801
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,710
bonai does or uh the Federation at large
where they sit their butt down you see

802
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:23,720
where they sit their butt down you see
 

803
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,029
where they sit their butt down you see
that it has that hinge in the body still

804
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:26,039
that it has that hinge in the body still
 

805
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,669
that it has that hinge in the body still
is just going the other way than bonai

806
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:28,679
is just going the other way than bonai
 

807
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,510
is just going the other way than bonai
and uh none of that happens martially uh

808
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
and uh none of that happens martially uh
 

809
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,230
and uh none of that happens martially uh
people that are aggressing uh they will

810
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,240
people that are aggressing uh they will
 

811
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,510
people that are aggressing uh they will
lock their own body up uh and then with

812
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,520
lock their own body up uh and then with
 

813
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,789
lock their own body up uh and then with
inertia too the inertia acting on him

814
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:39,799
inertia too the inertia acting on him
 

815
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,870
inertia too the inertia acting on him
will lock the body up so all I have here

816
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:42,880
will lock the body up so all I have here
 

817
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,669
will lock the body up so all I have here
at this point with all that stuff I've

818
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:44,679
at this point with all that stuff I've
 

819
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:47,909
at this point with all that stuff I've
done with the tabaki the ashaki the yin

820
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,919
done with the tabaki the ashaki the yin
 

821
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,230
done with the tabaki the ashaki the yin
yield the I adhesion Etc is to create a

00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:51,240
yield the I adhesion Etc is to create a
 

823
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,110
yield the I adhesion Etc is to create a
kind of rigidity on his body that's what

824
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,120
kind of rigidity on his body that's what
 

825
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,389
kind of rigidity on his body that's what
you want okay um you don't want you

826
00:26:57,389 --> 00:26:57,399
you want okay um you don't want you
 

827
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,630
you want okay um you don't want you
don't want this

828
00:26:59,630 --> 00:26:59,640
don't want this
 

829
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,669
don't want this
okay and what I'm doing here is and I'll

830
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:03,679
okay and what I'm doing here is and I'll
 

831
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,110
okay and what I'm doing here is and I'll
just go see the video on the body lock

832
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,120
just go see the video on the body lock
 

833
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,510
just go see the video on the body lock
okay but there is the ademi angle where

834
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:09,520
okay but there is the ademi angle where
 

835
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,190
okay but there is the ademi angle where
I can be on the front top part of it

836
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,200
I can be on the front top part of it
 

837
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,789
I can be on the front top part of it
like the bul in and the bottom part back

838
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
like the bul in and the bottom part back
 

839
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,750
like the bul in and the bottom part back
of it and that's what you're throwing

840
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:21,760
of it and that's what you're throwing
 

841
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,590
of it and that's what you're throwing
when you do these techniques it's kind

842
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:23,600
when you do these techniques it's kind
 

843
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,430
when you do these techniques it's kind
of I'm gaming it here but instead of

844
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:26,440
of I'm gaming it here but instead of
 

845
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,470
of I'm gaming it here but instead of
bending them backwards and then he

846
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
bending them backwards and then he
 

847
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,510
bending them backwards and then he
go you're kind of just hitting

848
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:34,520
go you're kind of just hitting
 

849
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,510
go you're kind of just hitting
here you want it to lock but your body

850
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,520
here you want it to lock but your body
 

851
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,909
here you want it to lock but your body
has to be in a certain place for that

852
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
has to be in a certain place for that
 

853
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,590
has to be in a certain place for that
okay and that I found even my dish you

854
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:42,600
okay and that I found even my dish you
 

855
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,110
okay and that I found even my dish you
don't quite get it as you go down in the

856
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,120
don't quite get it as you go down in the
 

857
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,310
don't quite get it as you go down in the
rank there's a place what they usually

858
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320
rank there's a place what they usually
 

859
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,230
rank there's a place what they usually
Miss is the coordination between the

860
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,240
Miss is the coordination between the
 

861
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,509
Miss is the coordination between the
upper part and the bottom part uh and

862
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:54,519
upper part and the bottom part uh and
 

863
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:57,110
upper part and the bottom part uh and
then secondarily where where does this

864
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
then secondarily where where does this
 

865
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,549
then secondarily where where does this
EDI go they missed that part they're

866
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:00,559
EDI go they missed that part they're
 

867
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,830
EDI go they missed that part they're
doing some other stuff over here over

868
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:04,840
doing some other stuff over here over
 

869
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,990
doing some other stuff over here over
this way like a trip let me move your

870
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,000
this way like a trip let me move your
 

871
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,029
this way like a trip let me move your
leg P like this and that's not it you're

872
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:12,039
leg P like this and that's not it you're
 

873
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:14,750
leg P like this and that's not it you're
coming in one is here this is

874
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:14,760
coming in one is here this is
 

875
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,669
coming in one is here this is
exaggeration just so you can see the

876
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:16,679
exaggeration just so you can see the
 

877
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:19,070
exaggeration just so you can see the
physics involved okay cuz remember in

878
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,080
physics involved okay cuz remember in
 

879
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,269
physics involved okay cuz remember in
the technique we're going to figure a it

880
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:21,279
the technique we're going to figure a it
 

881
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,350
the technique we're going to figure a it
on the vertical plane here I'm not doing

882
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,360
on the vertical plane here I'm not doing
 

883
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,950
on the vertical plane here I'm not doing
that this has to coordinate with this Ed

884
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:26,960
that this has to coordinate with this Ed
 

885
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,389
that this has to coordinate with this Ed
displacement

886
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:29,399
displacement
 

887
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:32,630
displacement
so that his body can lock okay that's

888
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:32,640
so that his body can lock okay that's
 

889
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,269
so that his body can lock okay that's
the body lock and that's in the

890
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:34,279
the body lock and that's in the
 

891
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,230
the body lock and that's in the
technique that also makes it very very

892
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:37,240
technique that also makes it very very
 

893
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:43,039
technique that also makes it very very
difficult to turn okay try it
