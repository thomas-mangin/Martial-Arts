Untouchable if a teacher comes across
something in their work and they say I

46
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
something in their work and they say I
 

47
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,549
something in their work and they say I
don't think this is very good then they

48
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:55,559
don't think this is very good then they
 

49
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,549
don't think this is very good then they
change it and that might be a shock to

50
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:57,559
change it and that might be a shock to
 

51
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:58,869
change it and that might be a shock to
someone who studied with them 5 years

52
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
someone who studied with them 5 years
 

53
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,229
someone who studied with them 5 years
ago when they didn't teach it that way

54
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
ago when they didn't teach it that way
 

55
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,910
ago when they didn't teach it that way
and they go oh that's not the way but

56
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
and they go oh that's not the way but
 

57
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,110
and they go oh that's not the way but
it's like well that's how the teacher

58
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
it's like well that's how the teacher
 

59
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,109
it's like well that's how the teacher
evolved to do it this way right so as

60
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
evolved to do it this way right so as
 

61
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,630
evolved to do it this way right so as
long as teachers can explain why they're

62
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
long as teachers can explain why they're
 

63
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,789
long as teachers can explain why they're
doing stuff makes good sense so my seven

64
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:09,799
doing stuff makes good sense so my seven
 

65
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,190
doing stuff makes good sense so my seven
looks most similar to cyos senses from

66
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
looks most similar to cyos senses from
 

67
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,469
looks most similar to cyos senses from
the uh 1980s in there like probably mid

68
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
the uh 1980s in there like probably mid
 

69
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,710
the uh 1980s in there like probably mid
to late 80s and it um also has a

70
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
to late 80s and it um also has a
 

71
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,149
to late 80s and it um also has a
different beginning than cyto synthes

72
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
different beginning than cyto synthes
 

73
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,550
different beginning than cyto synthes
shows and I think it because I mean I

74
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
shows and I think it because I mean I
 

75
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,550
shows and I think it because I mean I
chose to do that because it makes it

76
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:27,560
chose to do that because it makes it
 

77
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,270
chose to do that because it makes it
more sensible with the form that ceeded

78
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:30,280
more sensible with the form that ceeded
 

79
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,270
more sensible with the form that ceeded
that so the fourth form makes more sense

80
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:32,280
that so the fourth form makes more sense
 

81
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,109
that so the fourth form makes more sense
in conjunction with it and it fits

82
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:34,119
in conjunction with it and it fits
 

83
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:35,910
in conjunction with it and it fits
really nice as to why that would happen

84
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
really nice as to why that would happen
 

85
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,550
really nice as to why that would happen
because the way scos since they did it

86
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:37,560
because the way scos since they did it
 

87
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,749
because the way scos since they did it
my opinion is kind of a flawed

88
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
my opinion is kind of a flawed
 

89
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,910
my opinion is kind of a flawed
strategical idea that's my opinion

90
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
strategical idea that's my opinion
 

91
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,149
strategical idea that's my opinion
without being able to talk to the man

92
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:43,159
without being able to talk to the man
 

93
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,590
without being able to talk to the man
about why he made that decision but as

94
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:44,600
about why he made that decision but as
 

95
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,230
about why he made that decision but as
far as I can tell there's a problem and

96
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
far as I can tell there's a problem and
 

97
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,709
far as I can tell there's a problem and
we'll talk about that when we get out

98
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:47,719
we'll talk about that when we get out
 

99
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,270
we'll talk about that when we get out
there um I'm gonna get Josh over here

100
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
there um I'm gonna get Josh over here
 

101
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,270
there um I'm gonna get Josh over here
we're going to go work

102
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,280

 

103
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,429

Josh all right so uh right now we're

104
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
Josh all right so uh right now we're
 

105
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,630
Josh all right so uh right now we're
going to talk about my fifth form which

106
00:01:59,630 --> 00:01:59,640
going to talk about my fifth form which
 

107
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,389
going to talk about my fifth form which
is is analogous to cyto sensei's seventh

108
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
is is analogous to cyto sensei's seventh
 

109
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,029
is is analogous to cyto sensei's seventh
form uh very very similar and it starts

110
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:05,039
form uh very very similar and it starts
 

111
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:07,749
form uh very very similar and it starts
in the joki position all right let's go

112
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
in the joki position all right let's go
 

113
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,949
in the joki position all right let's go
and

114
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
and
 

115
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,790
and
switch okay the beginning of this form

116
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:11,800
switch okay the beginning of this form
 

117
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,390
switch okay the beginning of this form
is exactly like for the previous form to

118
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
is exactly like for the previous form to
 

119
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,990
is exactly like for the previous form to
this so when Josh comes in I do this now

120
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,000
this so when Josh comes in I do this now
 

121
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,110
this so when Josh comes in I do this now
in the last one Josh was going to back

122
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
in the last one Josh was going to back
 

123
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,270
in the last one Josh was going to back
up and use joden guch to hit me in the

124
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
up and use joden guch to hit me in the
 

125
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,830
up and use joden guch to hit me in the
head okay now my solution what like what

126
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
head okay now my solution what like what
 

127
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,110
head okay now my solution what like what
for that was to be right on top of him

128
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
for that was to be right on top of him
 

129
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,430
for that was to be right on top of him
and to shove him in the elbows and push

130
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:26,440
and to shove him in the elbows and push
 

131
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,190
and to shove him in the elbows and push
him back um and also that is a way that

132
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
him back um and also that is a way that
 

133
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,550
him back um and also that is a way that
cyos say shows the his seventh form um

134
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:33,560
cyos say shows the his seventh form um
 

135
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,390
cyos say shows the his seventh form um
earlier and then again sometimes later

136
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
earlier and then again sometimes later
 

137
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,910
earlier and then again sometimes later
uh when he's teaching it so one

138
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
uh when he's teaching it so one
 

139
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,630
uh when he's teaching it so one
variation of his that that actually is

140
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:39,640
variation of his that that actually is
 

141
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,070
variation of his that that actually is
how the end is is to drive him away but

142
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
how the end is is to drive him away but
 

143
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,949
how the end is is to drive him away but
in this the idea is we're here and Josh

144
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:45,959
in this the idea is we're here and Josh
 

145
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,949
in this the idea is we're here and Josh
is going to stay in tight and he's going

146
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:47,959
is going to stay in tight and he's going
 

147
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,390
is going to stay in tight and he's going
to go to my leg so he joden GES and he

148
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
to go to my leg so he joden GES and he
 

149
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,030
to go to my leg so he joden GES and he
goes to my leg right so he realizes that

150
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
goes to my leg right so he realizes that
 

151
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,509
goes to my leg right so he realizes that
I'm going to try and charge him back so

152
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:54,519
I'm going to try and charge him back so
 

153
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:56,309
I'm going to try and charge him back so
he shortens it so I can't get to his

154
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
he shortens it so I can't get to his
 

155
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,589
he shortens it so I can't get to his
arms and he goes to hit my leg right now

156
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:58,599
arms and he goes to hit my leg right now
 

157
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,390
arms and he goes to hit my leg right now
the reason he chooses my leg is because

158
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
the reason he chooses my leg is because
 

159
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,110
the reason he chooses my leg is because
at this distance if he J on guch and

160
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,120
at this distance if he J on guch and
 

161
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,670
at this distance if he J on guch and
went to my head you can see he's in a

162
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
went to my head you can see he's in a
 

163
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,430
went to my head you can see he's in a
bad spot in his weapon he would ra

164
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
bad spot in his weapon he would ra
 

165
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,309
bad spot in his weapon he would ra
rather be way out here right so because

166
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:07,319
rather be way out here right so because
 

167
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,350
rather be way out here right so because
of that if he just goes down to my leg

168
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:10,360
of that if he just goes down to my leg
 

169
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,750
of that if he just goes down to my leg
it's okay goes down to my leg he's now

170
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
it's okay goes down to my leg he's now
 

171
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,830
it's okay goes down to my leg he's now
hitting in the ideal spot in his weapon

172
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
hitting in the ideal spot in his weapon
 

173
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,589
hitting in the ideal spot in his weapon
and it's a better shot right and if he

174
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
and it's a better shot right and if he
 

175
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,789
and it's a better shot right and if he
took my leg out and that'd be really

176
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:16,799
took my leg out and that'd be really
 

177
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,710
took my leg out and that'd be really
great for him so he transitions his arms

178
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:19,720
great for him so he transitions his arms
 

179
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,149
great for him so he transitions his arms
faster than I can get under them and he

180
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
faster than I can get under them and he
 

181
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,229
faster than I can get under them and he
goes for my leg because he's staying in

182
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
goes for my leg because he's staying in
 

183
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,710
goes for my leg because he's staying in
close to me right so we're here like

184
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
close to me right so we're here like
 

185
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,990
close to me right so we're here like
this and when he goes to do that I turn

186
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,000
this and when he goes to do that I turn
 

187
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,990
this and when he goes to do that I turn
and I defend like this okay now when I'm

188
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
and I defend like this okay now when I'm
 

189
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,750
and I defend like this okay now when I'm
doing this I'm stepping back so if I did

190
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:34,760
doing this I'm stepping back so if I did
 

191
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,630
doing this I'm stepping back so if I did
my job right I'm probably just getting

192
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
my job right I'm probably just getting
 

193
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,630
my job right I'm probably just getting
out of the way of it but I could not

194
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
out of the way of it but I could not
 

195
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,270
out of the way of it but I could not
step back far enough or this could

196
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,280
step back far enough or this could
 

197
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,030
step back far enough or this could
happen also boom he hits that front leg

198
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
happen also boom he hits that front leg
 

199
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,070
happen also boom he hits that front leg
so I want to have a defense in place so

200
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,080
so I want to have a defense in place so
 

201
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,710
so I want to have a defense in place so
you keep scooting away from me so so as

202
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:47,720
you keep scooting away from me so so as
 

203
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,270
you keep scooting away from me so so as
we're here and I see that I step back

204
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
we're here and I see that I step back
 

205
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,630
we're here and I see that I step back
and I defend just in case right so I'm

206
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:51,640
and I defend just in case right so I'm
 

207
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,470
and I defend just in case right so I'm
here and this is basically half a get on

208
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:53,480
here and this is basically half a get on
 

209
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,750
here and this is basically half a get on
Gish okay now from here what Josh is

210
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
Gish okay now from here what Josh is
 

211
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,390
Gish okay now from here what Josh is
going to do is use subet he's going to

212
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:57,400
going to do is use subet he's going to
 

213
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,550
going to do is use subet he's going to
draw his weapon back and he's going to

214
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
draw his weapon back and he's going to
 

215
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,910
draw his weapon back and he's going to
hit me in the side is his idea with that

216
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:00,920
hit me in the side is his idea with that
 

217
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,750
hit me in the side is his idea with that
as he does that I turn now this is

218
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:02,760
as he does that I turn now this is
 

219
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,110
as he does that I turn now this is
fairly different than scy the Sensei 7th

220
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
fairly different than scy the Sensei 7th
 

221
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,470
fairly different than scy the Sensei 7th
scy the Sensei does a different thing

222
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
scy the Sensei does a different thing
 

223
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,949
scy the Sensei does a different thing
but uh I think this is a really good

224
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:07,959
but uh I think this is a really good
 

225
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,789
but uh I think this is a really good
thing to show we won't see this specific

226
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:09,799
thing to show we won't see this specific
 

227
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,190
thing to show we won't see this specific
movement until the 31 Kum Joe but I

228
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,200
movement until the 31 Kum Joe but I
 

229
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,149
movement until the 31 Kum Joe but I
think it's good to initiate now it's a

230
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
think it's good to initiate now it's a
 

231
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,910
think it's good to initiate now it's a
good good movement to use right here

232
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
good good movement to use right here
 

233
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,629
good good movement to use right here
okay now from here what I'm going to do

234
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:17,639
okay now from here what I'm going to do
 

235
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,509
okay now from here what I'm going to do
is I'm going to whip his weapon away so

236
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
is I'm going to whip his weapon away so
 

237
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,830
is I'm going to whip his weapon away so
I'm going to go like this and the idea

238
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:20,840
I'm going to go like this and the idea
 

239
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,870
I'm going to go like this and the idea
is I want to clear my space so if I did

240
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
is I want to clear my space so if I did
 

241
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,030
is I want to clear my space so if I did
a really good job of clearing that I can

242
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
a really good job of clearing that I can
 

243
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,550
a really good job of clearing that I can
maybe pop them up here or do all kinds

244
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
maybe pop them up here or do all kinds
 

245
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,749
maybe pop them up here or do all kinds
of other stuff when I do that though I

246
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:28,759
of other stuff when I do that though I
 

247
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,510
of other stuff when I do that though I
just continue on so I go here and I come

248
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
just continue on so I go here and I come
 

249
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,469
just continue on so I go here and I come
back behind here and I get to his legs

250
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:33,479
back behind here and I get to his legs
 

251
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,710
back behind here and I get to his legs
and then I hook a leg and I pull it now

252
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:35,720
and then I hook a leg and I pull it now
 

253
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,029
and then I hook a leg and I pull it now
scite the Sensei I don't know uh why he

254
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:39,039
scite the Sensei I don't know uh why he
 

255
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,510
scite the Sensei I don't know uh why he
did what he did moving things around I

256
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
did what he did moving things around I
 

257
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,110
did what he did moving things around I
think however it's good to show the

258
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
think however it's good to show the
 

259
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,110
think however it's good to show the
students that you can entangle legs from

260
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,120
students that you can entangle legs from
 

261
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,909
students that you can entangle legs from
that position however just pulling

262
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:48,919
that position however just pulling
 

263
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,430
that position however just pulling
someone's leg out you got to be way

264
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:50,440
someone's leg out you got to be way
 

265
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,150
someone's leg out you got to be way
freaking stronger than they are to just

266
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
freaking stronger than they are to just
 

267
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,469
freaking stronger than they are to just
pull their leg out um but I'm going to

268
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
pull their leg out um but I'm going to
 

269
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,150
pull their leg out um but I'm going to
make a video for you guys later showing

270
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
make a video for you guys later showing
 

271
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,189
make a video for you guys later showing
all the ways that you can use those leg

272
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:58,199
all the ways that you can use those leg
 

273
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,870
all the ways that you can use those leg
entanglement methods um and it's just a

274
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
entanglement methods um and it's just a
 

275
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,950
entanglement methods um and it's just a
nice space saver to me for it to show we

276
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
nice space saver to me for it to show we
 

277
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,150
nice space saver to me for it to show we
could do any of those things here so

278
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,160
could do any of those things here so
 

279
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,310
could do any of those things here so
we're hooking the legs on that so again

280
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:07,320
we're hooking the legs on that so again
 

281
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,909
we're hooking the legs on that so again

285
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,790
come in here then as he comes to go
there I step back and defend my leg he

286
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:13,800
there I step back and defend my leg he
 

287
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,510
there I step back and defend my leg he
comes in for me I turn my hips and catch

288
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
comes in for me I turn my hips and catch
 

289
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,670
comes in for me I turn my hips and catch
the weapon I'm trying to clear my space

the weapon I'm trying to clear my space
 

291
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,110
the weapon I'm trying to clear my space
and when I do that I come all the way

292
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
and when I do that I come all the way
 

293
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,469
and when I do that I come all the way
back here hook that leg and I pull it up

294
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:21,479
back here hook that leg and I pull it up
 

295
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,070
back here hook that leg and I pull it up
and that is my fifth form an alus cyto

296
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
and that is my fifth form an alus cyto
 

297
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,390
and that is my fifth form an alus cyto
since a seventh form teaches us a lot of

298
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
since a seventh form teaches us a lot of
 

299
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,469
since a seventh form teaches us a lot of
great stuff what if we miss the elbows

300
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
great stuff what if we miss the elbows
 

301
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,909
great stuff what if we miss the elbows
when we're trying to catch the bows on

302
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
when we're trying to catch the bows on
 

303
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,590
when we're trying to catch the bows on
the previous form well this tells us

304
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
the previous form well this tells us
 

305
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,629
the previous form well this tells us
about it also tells us about making low

306
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:33,639
about it also tells us about making low
 

307
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,469
about it also tells us about making low
leg shots when you're in a crushed in

308
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:35,479
leg shots when you're in a crushed in
 

309
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:36,550
leg shots when you're in a crushed in
position right and we're going to see

310
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
position right and we're going to see
 

311
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,230
position right and we're going to see
that again in the next form so if I'm in

312
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
