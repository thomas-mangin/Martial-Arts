inside of aikido already

90
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400

91
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,429

93
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,190
you probably just don't know that
they're in there now your personal

94
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
they're in there now your personal
 

95
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,990
they're in there now your personal
ability to

96
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000

right so
and even if you train them a whole bunch

110
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
and even if you train them a whole bunch
 

111
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,350
and even if you train them a whole bunch
you can't just instantly do them when

112
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,360
you can't just instantly do them when

so look aikido has

176
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
so look aikido has

the basic set of fundamental techniques

178
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
the basic set of fundamental techniques
 

179
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,150
the basic set of fundamental techniques
that you will need for knife disarming

180
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
that you will need for knife disarming
 

181
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,470
that you will need for knife disarming
okay the way you disarm someone with a

182
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
okay the way you disarm someone with a
 

183
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,509
okay the way you disarm someone with a
knife is you first

184
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
knife is you first
 

185
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,670
knife is you first
weaken their grip and then you take the

186
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
weaken their grip and then you take the
 

187
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,430
weaken their grip and then you take the
knife out of their hand so that's the

188
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
knife out of their hand so that's the
 

189
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,790
knife out of their hand so that's the
most direct way right and of course

190
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,800
most direct way right and of course
 

191
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,070
most direct way right and of course
there's other ways punch them in the

192
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
there's other ways punch them in the
 

193
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,270
there's other ways punch them in the
face and maybe they'll let go of it all

194
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
face and maybe they'll let go of it all
 

195
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,470
face and maybe they'll let go of it all
kinds of other stuff could happen

196
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
kinds of other stuff could happen
 

197
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,550
kinds of other stuff could happen
but as far as directly taking something

198
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
but as far as directly taking something
 

199
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,750
but as far as directly taking something
out of someone's hand

200
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
out of someone's hand
 

201
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,270
out of someone's hand
you're going to weaken the grip and take

202
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
you're going to weaken the grip and take
 

203
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,390
you're going to weaken the grip and take
it out so let me show you what i mean

204
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
it out so let me show you what i mean
 

205
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,150
it out so let me show you what i mean
with that so if josh has this knife here

206
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
with that so if josh has this knife here
 

207
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,390
with that so if josh has this knife here
okay if i were able to pull on the knife

208
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
okay if i were able to pull on the knife
 

209
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,869
okay if i were able to pull on the knife
this way it wouldn't be a very

210
00:02:59,869 --> 00:02:59,879
this way it wouldn't be a very
 

211
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,990
this way it wouldn't be a very
successful way to pull on the knife

212
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
successful way to pull on the knife
 

213
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,830
successful way to pull on the knife
right so because he's strong right i

214
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
right so because he's strong right i
 

215
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,270
right so because he's strong right i
won't be able to pull it so it's it's

216
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
won't be able to pull it so it's it's
 

217
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,710
won't be able to pull it so it's it's
hard for me to get that out of his hand

218
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
hard for me to get that out of his hand
 

219
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,149
hard for me to get that out of his hand
unless of course he opens his hand like

220
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
unless of course he opens his hand like
 

221
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,790
unless of course he opens his hand like
he just did

222
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
he just did
 

223
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,229
he just did
right then he can get it out of there

224
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
right then he can get it out of there
 

225
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,670
right then he can get it out of there
right and that's what happens a lot of

226
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
right and that's what happens a lot of
 

227
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,589
right and that's what happens a lot of
times the demonstrations is the uk knows

228
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
times the demonstrations is the uk knows
 

229
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,710
times the demonstrations is the uk knows
they're supposed to let go so they just

230
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
they're supposed to let go so they just
 

231
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,309
they're supposed to let go so they just
open their hand the guy was oh look

232
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
open their hand the guy was oh look
 

233
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,830
open their hand the guy was oh look
and you could disarm any way right and

234
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
and you could disarm any way right and
 

235
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,910
and you could disarm any way right and
that would have worked but

236
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
that would have worked but
 

237
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,990
that would have worked but
in order to get this out of his hand i

238
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
in order to get this out of his hand i
 

239
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,830
in order to get this out of his hand i
need to first weaken his grip so what

240
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
need to first weaken his grip so what
 

241
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,350
need to first weaken his grip so what
are the ways i could weaken his grip

242
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
are the ways i could weaken his grip
 

243
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,589
are the ways i could weaken his grip
well i want to lengthen the ligaments in

244
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
well i want to lengthen the ligaments in
 

245
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,589
well i want to lengthen the ligaments in
his arm as much as i possibly can

246
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
his arm as much as i possibly can
 

247
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,910
his arm as much as i possibly can
to make his grip weak right so the

248
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
to make his grip weak right so the
 

249
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,990
to make his grip weak right so the
ligaments in his arm only go so far

250
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
ligaments in his arm only go so far
 

251
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,509
ligaments in his arm only go so far
and then once those have been stretched

252
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
and then once those have been stretched
 

253
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,670
and then once those have been stretched
to their max he will have a hard time

254
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
to their max he will have a hard time
 

255
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,949
to their max he will have a hard time
gripping something right it'll be real

256
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
gripping something right it'll be real
 

257
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,630
gripping something right it'll be real
hard for him to grab something one of

258
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
hard for him to grab something one of
 

259
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,430
hard for him to grab something one of
the ways to link

260
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
the ways to link
 

261
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,190
the ways to link
those ligaments is to twist the wrist

262
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
those ligaments is to twist the wrist
 

263
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,949
those ligaments is to twist the wrist
this way right so by twisting it i'm

264
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
this way right so by twisting it i'm
 

265
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,550
this way right so by twisting it i'm
really stretching out everything is

266
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
really stretching out everything is
 

267
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,390
really stretching out everything is
in his arm here and that grip's getting

268
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
in his arm here and that grip's getting
 

269
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,670
in his arm here and that grip's getting
weaker and weaker and weaker until it

270
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
weaker and weaker and weaker until it
 

271
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,190
weaker and weaker and weaker until it
gets to a point where it's relatively

272
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
gets to a point where it's relatively
 

273
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,789
gets to a point where it's relatively
easy to take out of the hand right now

274
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
easy to take out of the hand right now
 

275
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,030
easy to take out of the hand right now
that's relative to how strong this guy

276
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
that's relative to how strong this guy
 

277
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,789
that's relative to how strong this guy
is how used to having his arm twisted

278
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
is how used to having his arm twisted
 

279
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,630
is how used to having his arm twisted
this way is but as far as

280
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
this way is but as far as
 

281
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,149
this way is but as far as
you know an average person that's going

282
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
you know an average person that's going
 

283
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,670
you know an average person that's going
to be the way to totally get it out of

284
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
to be the way to totally get it out of
 

285
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,149
to be the way to totally get it out of
their hand

286
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
their hand
 

287
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,149
their hand
okay now another way to get it out is to

288
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
okay now another way to get it out is to
 

289
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,270
okay now another way to get it out is to
turn it over this way

290
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
turn it over this way
 

291
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,190
turn it over this way
and i can turn it here and again i've

292
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
and i can turn it here and again i've
 

293
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,630
and i can turn it here and again i've
lengthened all those ligaments in this

294
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
lengthened all those ligaments in this
 

295
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,550
lengthened all those ligaments in this
form and it's easy to get that knife out

296
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
form and it's easy to get that knife out
 

297
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,589
form and it's easy to get that knife out
of his hand right

298
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
of his hand right
 

299
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,110
of his hand right
okay another way i could do it is i

300
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
okay another way i could do it is i
 

301
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,789
okay another way i could do it is i
could fold this wrist down

302
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
could fold this wrist down
 

303
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,789
could fold this wrist down
totally flat like this so those are the

304
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
totally flat like this so those are the
 

305
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,030
totally flat like this so those are the
basic core ways okay now

306
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
basic core ways okay now
 

307
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,909
basic core ways okay now
in aikido we call this way to lengthen

308
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
in aikido we call this way to lengthen
 

309
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,030
in aikido we call this way to lengthen
these ligaments in his

310
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
these ligaments in his
 

311
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,070
these ligaments in his
arm cottage right kotte is wrist geisha

312
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
arm cottage right kotte is wrist geisha
 

313
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,590
arm cottage right kotte is wrist geisha
means to turn over so i'm turning over

314
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
means to turn over so i'm turning over
 

315
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,950
means to turn over so i'm turning over
the wrist right here and that's how i'm

316
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
the wrist right here and that's how i'm
 

317
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,830
the wrist right here and that's how i'm
lengthening those

318
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
lengthening those
 

319
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,310
lengthening those
to get that out if we turn it this way

320
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
to get that out if we turn it this way
 

321
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,390
to get that out if we turn it this way
and add a little upward pressure we call

322
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
and add a little upward pressure we call
 

323
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,710
and add a little upward pressure we call
that

324
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
that
 

325
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,550
that
knee kyo right so that's second

326
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
knee kyo right so that's second
 

327
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,790
knee kyo right so that's second

at that
 

659
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,070
at that
well you need a set of drills to help

660
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
well you need a set of drills to help
 

661
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,670
well you need a set of drills to help
you get good at that let's call maya out

662
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
you get good at that let's call maya out
 

663
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,230
you get good at that let's call maya out
and see if she can help us

664
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240

 

665
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,389

all right so uh now we got our two

666
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
all right so uh now we got our two
 

667
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,670
all right so uh now we got our two
trainers out here

668
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
trainers out here
 

669
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,269
trainers out here
and i got a bum knee so i'm no good for

670
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
and i got a bum knee so i'm no good for
 

671
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,110
and i got a bum knee so i'm no good for
this all right so we're going to talk

672
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
this all right so we're going to talk
 

673
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,350
this all right so we're going to talk
about some methods to train you to be

674
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
about some methods to train you to be
 

675
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,230
about some methods to train you to be
better at

676
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
better at
 

677
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,310
better at
disarming now we've already shown some

678
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
disarming now we've already shown some
 

679
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,990
disarming now we've already shown some
of these these basic techniques

680
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
of these these basic techniques
 

681
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,350
of these these basic techniques
but we're going to kind of get into a

682
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
but we're going to kind of get into a
 

683
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,710
but we're going to kind of get into a
little bit more of a live practice with

684
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:32,720
little bit more of a live practice with
 

685
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,070
little bit more of a live practice with
it so you guys can see a little more

686
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
it so you guys can see a little more
 

687
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,870
it so you guys can see a little more
now right now we're using a dull still

688
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
now right now we're using a dull still
 

689
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,550
now right now we're using a dull still
steel trainer right so actually this is

690
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
steel trainer right so actually this is
 

691
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,509
steel trainer right so actually this is
aluminum trainer

692
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
aluminum trainer
 

693
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,910
aluminum trainer
um there is no edge on this at all right

694
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
um there is no edge on this at all right
 

695
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,350
um there is no edge on this at all right
it's flat flat flatter than

696
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
it's flat flat flatter than
 

697
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,350
it's flat flat flatter than
the back of a normal knife right so it's

698
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
the back of a normal knife right so it's
 

699
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,190
the back of a normal knife right so it's
super super flat all the edges have been

700
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
super super flat all the edges have been
 

701
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,670
super super flat all the edges have been
rounded

702
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
rounded
 

703
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,070
rounded
so it's purpose built for this training

704
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
so it's purpose built for this training
 

705
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,030
so it's purpose built for this training
i will still

706
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
i will still
 

707
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,550
i will still
say when you start training live with

708
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
say when you start training live with
 

709
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,550
say when you start training live with
this stuff that

710
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
this stuff that
 

711
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,550
this stuff that
steel is is really still hard on your

712
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
steel is is really still hard on your
 

713
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,990
steel is is really still hard on your
body if you get whacked real hard like

714
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
body if you get whacked real hard like
 

715
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,590
body if you get whacked real hard like
this it still is no fun

716
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
this it still is no fun
 

717
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,470
this it still is no fun
wood is a little better than that rubber

718
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
wood is a little better than that rubber
 

719
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,150
wood is a little better than that rubber
is way better than that the

720
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
is way better than that the
 

721
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,910
is way better than that the
and foam is even better yet than that

722
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
and foam is even better yet than that
 

723
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,350
and foam is even better yet than that
the problem with that is

724
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
the problem with that is
 

725
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,670
the problem with that is
as the knife becomes really flexible

726
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
as the knife becomes really flexible
 

727
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,110
as the knife becomes really flexible
then a lot of stuff where you're pushing

728
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
then a lot of stuff where you're pushing
 

729
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,990
then a lot of stuff where you're pushing
on the blade

730
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
on the blade
 

731
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,990
on the blade
um will not be available to you because

732
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
um will not be available to you because
 

733
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,350
um will not be available to you because
in foam your hand just goes through and

734
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
in foam your hand just goes through and
 

735
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,550
in foam your hand just goes through and
doesn't disarm anything

736
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
doesn't disarm anything
 

737
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,470
doesn't disarm anything
rubber not much better wood works pretty

738
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
rubber not much better wood works pretty
 

739
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,750
rubber not much better wood works pretty
good

740
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
good
 

741
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,430
good
so you choose the trainer that's

742
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440

through just some basic disarm
techniques with josh now we are using a

752
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
techniques with josh now we are using a
 

753
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,269
techniques with josh now we are using a
knife and this

754
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
knife and this
 

755
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,069
knife and this
video is specifically built towards um

756
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
video is specifically built towards um
 

757
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,590
video is specifically built towards um
uh

758
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
uh
 

759
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,949
uh
working with knife disarms although

760
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
working with knife disarms although
 

761
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,310
working with knife disarms although
these can be done for anything you're

762
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
these can be done for anything you're
 

763
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,750
these can be done for anything you're
gonna see these basic ways that we've

764
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
gonna see these basic ways that we've
 

765
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,550
gonna see these basic ways that we've
done before

766
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
done before
 

767
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,750
done before
in other videos right so so in this

768
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
in other videos right so so in this
 

769
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,269
in other videos right so so in this
so first thing we're gonna do is we're

770
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
so first thing we're gonna do is we're
 

771
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,750
so first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna have maya place her hands on josh

772
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
gonna have maya place her hands on josh
 

773
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,190
gonna have maya place her hands on josh
right so right on that knife there

774
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
right so right on that knife there
 

775
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,550
right so right on that knife there
somewhere all right so now she's got a

776
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
somewhere all right so now she's got a
 

777
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,350
somewhere all right so now she's got a
hole to the knife

778
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
hole to the knife
 

779
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,870
hole to the knife
now she always wants to grab with two

780
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
now she always wants to grab with two
 

781
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,910
now she always wants to grab with two
actually let me have you switch guys the

782
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
actually let me have you switch guys the
 

783
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,949
actually let me have you switch guys the
other hand real quick just so they can

784
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
other hand real quick just so they can
 

785
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,430
other hand real quick just so they can
see this

786
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
see this
 

787
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,190
see this
okay so she always wants to be working

788
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
okay so she always wants to be working
 

789
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,710
okay so she always wants to be working
two on the on the one now

790
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
two on the on the one now
 

791
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,870
two on the on the one now
here's why because now she's got a

792
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
here's why because now she's got a
 

793
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,470
here's why because now she's got a
slight strength advantage right so josh

794
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
slight strength advantage right so josh
 

795
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,910
slight strength advantage right so josh
would have to be twice as strong with

796
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:03,920
would have to be twice as strong with
 

797
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,910
would have to be twice as strong with
this one arm as maya is with her two

798
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:05,920
this one arm as maya is with her two
 

799
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,870
this one arm as maya is with her two
arms in order for

800
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
arms in order for
 

801
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,630
arms in order for
him to be stronger than her okay the

802
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
him to be stronger than her okay the
 

803
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,910
him to be stronger than her okay the
second reason for that is

804
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
second reason for that is
 

805
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,590
second reason for that is
there's always the potential for him to

806
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
there's always the potential for him to
 

807
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,910
there's always the potential for him to
switch that knife so if her hand wasn't

808
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
switch that knife so if her hand wasn't
 

809
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,430
switch that knife so if her hand wasn't
there he could easily switch that knife

810
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
there he could easily switch that knife
 

811
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,750
there he could easily switch that knife
over

812
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
over
 

813
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,590
over
that's no good so she always wants one

814
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
that's no good so she always wants one
 

815
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,829
that's no good so she always wants one
hand blocking the opening of his hands

816
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
hand blocking the opening of his hands
 

817
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,350
hand blocking the opening of his hands
whenever she's working a knife disarm

818
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360

00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:42,399

 

985
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,230

there we go we got that same technique

986
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
there we go we got that same technique
 

987
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,590
there we go we got that same technique
out okay now

988
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
out okay now
 

989
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,110
out okay now
from that we're going to go to a

990
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
from that we're going to go to a
 

991
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,870
from that we're going to go to a
practice where they don't have

992
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:48,880
practice where they don't have
 

993
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,470
practice where they don't have
connection and this should look really

994
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480
connection and this should look really
 

995
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,550
connection and this should look really
similar to aikido people this is often

similar to aikido people this is often
called

998

practice where josh is going to really
lightly

1004
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
lightly
 

1005
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,030
lightly
give some very simple strikes now look

1006
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
give some very simple strikes now look
 

1007
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,870
give some very simple strikes now look
these are the the strikes that no one

1008
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
these are the the strikes that no one
 

1009
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,150
these are the the strikes that no one
thinks are any good because

1010
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
thinks are any good because
 

1011
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,670
thinks are any good because
they're used to unarmed martial arts

1012
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
they're used to unarmed martial arts
 

1013
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,829
they're used to unarmed martial arts

be very normal strikes
josh is going to lightly move around

1024
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
josh is going to lightly move around
 

1025
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,910
josh is going to lightly move around
with maya maya's going to try to get

1026
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
with maya maya's going to try to get
 

1027
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,269
with maya maya's going to try to get
into defended position so as they're

1028
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
into defended position so as they're
 

1029
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,389
into defended position so as they're
moving around she's going to try to

1030
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
moving around she's going to try to
 

1031
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,990
moving around she's going to try to
defend and keep that knife from getting

1032
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
defend and keep that knife from getting
 

1033
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,269
defend and keep that knife from getting
to her and then she's going to try to

1034
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279
to her and then she's going to try to
 

1035
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,629
to her and then she's going to try to
get to the position that she knows she

1036
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
get to the position that she knows she
 

1037
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,590
get to the position that she knows she
can disarm from

1038
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
can disarm from
 

1039
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,629
can disarm from
all right so we see that practice next

1040
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639

 

1041
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,790

now notice now josh is not just waiting

1042
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
now notice now josh is not just waiting
 

1043
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,069
now notice now josh is not just waiting
for her to take it out of his hand

1044
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
for her to take it out of his hand
 

1045
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,910
for her to take it out of his hand
but he's also not really actively trying

1046
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
but he's also not really actively trying
 

1047
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,269
but he's also not really actively trying
to mess her up right he's not trying to

1048
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
to mess her up right he's not trying to
 

1049
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,230
to mess her up right he's not trying to
hurt her

1050
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
hurt her
 

1051
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,590
hurt her
to really get her or make her feel

1052
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
to really get her or make her feel
 

1053
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,189
to really get her or make her feel
stupid right and so maya's having to

1054
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
stupid right and so maya's having to
 

1055
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,710
stupid right and so maya's having to
work through these different scenarios

1056
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:38,720
work through these different scenarios
 

1057
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,430
work through these different scenarios
right

1058
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440
right
 

1059
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,189
right
every time she's looking for that same

1060
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
every time she's looking for that same
 

1061
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,030
every time she's looking for that same
position and then once she's comfortable

1062
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,040
position and then once she's comfortable
 

1063
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,629
position and then once she's comfortable
she's gonna work that disarm all right

1064
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:44,639
she's gonna work that disarm all right
 

1065
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,189
she's gonna work that disarm all right
so

1066
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:45,199
so
 

1067
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,069
so
this is no resistance from josh as far

1068
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
this is no resistance from josh as far
 

1069
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,350
this is no resistance from josh as far
as when maya's trying to apply the

1070
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
as when maya's trying to apply the
 

1071
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,350
as when maya's trying to apply the
technique no resistance from josh at all

1072
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
technique no resistance from josh at all
 

1073
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,030
technique no resistance from josh at all
um all he's doing now is add the

1074
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
um all he's doing now is add the
 

1075
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,870
um all he's doing now is add the
spontaneity of he's gonna do some

1076
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
spontaneity of he's gonna do some
 

1077
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,230
spontaneity of he's gonna do some
different kinds of cuts so he's trying

1078
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
different kinds of cuts so he's trying
 

1079
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,590
different kinds of cuts so he's trying
some different stabs in there

1080
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,600
some different stabs in there
 

1081
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,509
some different stabs in there
cutting in different directions but for

1082
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
cutting in different directions but for
 

1083
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,990
cutting in different directions but for
maya once we get to this basic kind of

1084
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
maya once we get to this basic kind of
 

1085
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,430
maya once we get to this basic kind of
position she should already have some

1086
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
position she should already have some
 

1087
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,870
position she should already have some
programming for that now of course she

1088
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
programming for that now of course she
 

1089
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,870
programming for that now of course she
should also have programming from here

1090
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
should also have programming from here
 

1091
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,550
should also have programming from here
and also programming from here and you

1092
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
and also programming from here and you
 

1093
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,470
and also programming from here and you
can work all those things in as you go

1094
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
can work all those things in as you go
 

1095
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,990
can work all those things in as you go
but now because josh is coming in in a

1096
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
but now because josh is coming in in a
 

1097
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,670
but now because josh is coming in in a
variety of different ways she can then

1098
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
variety of different ways she can then
 

1099
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,509
variety of different ways she can then
get to the position and learn to disarm

1100
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
get to the position and learn to disarm
 

1101
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,030
get to the position and learn to disarm
from there okay now what we're going to

1102
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
from there okay now what we're going to
 

1103
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,550
from there okay now what we're going to
do is we're going to do that same exact

1104
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
do is we're going to do that same exact
 

1105
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,110
do is we're going to do that same exact
practice

1106
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
practice
 

1107
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,990
practice
at the same speed i hope but now josh is

1108
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
at the same speed i hope but now josh is
 

1109
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,430
at the same speed i hope but now josh is
actually going to try to resist a little

1110
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,440
actually going to try to resist a little
 

1111
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,910
actually going to try to resist a little
bit so

1112
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
bit so
 

1113
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,430
bit so
when maya goes to take it out of his arm

1114
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
when maya goes to take it out of his arm
 

1115
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,189
when maya goes to take it out of his arm
he can recover his arm he can try and

1116
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
he can recover his arm he can try and
 

1117
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,790
he can recover his arm he can try and
push her off and mine's still going to

1118
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
push her off and mine's still going to
 

1119
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,790
push her off and mine's still going to
try to work those same disarms okay same

1120
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
try to work those same disarms okay same
 

1121
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:38,870
try to work those same disarms okay same
speed though so still pretty mellow

1122
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880

 

1123
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:46,470

she got a nico there

1124
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:46,480

 

1125
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:56,710

nico again

1126
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720

 

1127
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,590

uh he switched their honor good all

1128
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
uh he switched their honor good all
 

1129
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,550
uh he switched their honor good all
right very good all right

1130
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
right very good all right
 

1131
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,870
right very good all right
so you can see this is still super light

1132
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
so you can see this is still super light
 

1133
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,470
so you can see this is still super light
we're still being super cool no one's

1134
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
we're still being super cool no one's
 

1135
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,590
we're still being super cool no one's
really trying to get anyone

1136
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600
really trying to get anyone
 

1137
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,189
really trying to get anyone
but we're giving he's giving her more

1138
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
but we're giving he's giving her more
 

1139
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,870
but we're giving he's giving her more
and more difficulty as we progress right

1140
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
and more difficulty as we progress right
 

1141
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,870
and more difficulty as we progress right
so there he switched the knife or she

1142
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
so there he switched the knife or she
 

1143
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,069
so there he switched the knife or she
gets it he kind of tries to pull his

1144
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
gets it he kind of tries to pull his
 

1145
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,069
gets it he kind of tries to pull his

but you can see how that's going to amp
 

1265
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,789
but you can see how that's going to amp

so now we're a progression up okay now

1290
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
so now we're a progression up okay now
 

1291
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:40,789
so now we're a progression up okay now
from here

1292
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:40,799
from here

position
 

1305
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,990
position
right so like that he's in a defended

1306

right so like that he's in a defended
 

1307
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,350
right so like that he's in a defended
position and he should be trying to keep

1308
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,360
position and he should be trying to keep
 

1309
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,510

he should try and grab her and stab her

1314
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,240
he should try and grab her and stab her

and that's a valid thing all right now
 

1319
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,310
and that's a valid thing all right now
the problem for this is

1320
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,320
the problem for this is
 

1321
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,430
the problem for this is
in the system of aikido we don't run

1322

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,630
into someone with a knife so if josh
goes into a defended position switch so

1326
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
goes into a defended position switch so
 

1327
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,669
goes into a defended position switch so
they can see the knife

1328
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
they can see the knife
 

1329
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,190

run into this position
 

1337
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,950
run into this position
so in the system of aikido she should

1338
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
so in the system of aikido she should
 

1339
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,390
so in the system of aikido she should
just never practice this so

1340
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
just never practice this so
 

1341
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,870
just never practice this so
if josh gets dodgy and kg like this maya

1342

and and it will be a very boring minute
 

1347
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,909

or however long we run the scenario

1348
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:27,919
or however long we run the scenario
 

1349
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,070

and then from this he's gonna cut okay
 

1369
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,990
and then from this he's gonna cut okay
now we can run a full-on scenario and

spent most of her time
 

1421
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,830
spent most of her time
trying to stay at a distance and that's

1422
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:15,840
trying to stay at a distance and that's
 

1423
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,070
trying to stay at a distance and that's
because that's what she wants to do is

1424
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
because that's what she wants to do is

because that's what she wants to do is
stay at a distance

1426
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,200
stay at a distance
 

1427
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,789
stay at a distance
it's dangerous when you get in close

1428
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:20,799
it's dangerous when you get in close
 

1429
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,149
it's dangerous when you get in close
with that knife right a knife and a

small action can end your life
so she doesn't want to grapple with that

1434
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159
so she doesn't want to grapple with that
 

1435
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,669
so she doesn't want to grapple with that
guy if she can avoid it now only when

00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:29,679
the situation gets pressed in so much
 

1439
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,350
the situation gets pressed in so much
that getting out is not an option

1440
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
that getting out is not an option
 

1441
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,190
that getting out is not an option
anymore will maya try and transition to

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
anymore will maya try and transition to

anymore will maya try and transition to
a set of skills that allows her to take

1444
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
a set of skills that allows her to take
 

1445
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,669
a set of skills that allows her to take
the knife out

1446
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
the knife out
 

1447
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,190
the knife out
but again she's not trying to grapple

1448
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,200
but again she's not trying to grapple
 

1449
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,870
but again she's not trying to grapple
with this guy understand she's

1450
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
with this guy understand she's
 

1451
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,549
with this guy understand she's
envisioning a scenario where this guy is

1452
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
envisioning a scenario where this guy is
 

1453
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,990
envisioning a scenario where this guy is
bigger than her stronger than her better

1454
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
bigger than her stronger than her better
 

1455
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,190
bigger than her stronger than her better
train than her all that stuff

1456
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
train than her all that stuff
 

1457
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,390
train than her all that stuff
so she doesn't want to mess around with

1458
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
so she doesn't want to mess around with
 

1459
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,750
so she doesn't want to mess around with
it if she can get a quick disarm she

1460
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:45,760
it if she can get a quick disarm she
 

1461
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,190
it if she can get a quick disarm she
will and you saw a couple in there she

1462
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,200
will and you saw a couple in there she
 

1463
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,549
will and you saw a couple in there she
got a couple disarms right

1464
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
got a couple disarms right
 

1465
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,190
got a couple disarms right
so that's not getting disarms is not

1466
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,200
so that's not getting disarms is not
 

1467
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,470
so that's not getting disarms is not
like in the movies where every time

1468
