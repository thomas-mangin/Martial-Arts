00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,410
a problem
uh two things I do this one for the

90
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:21,420
uh two things I do this one for the
 

91
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,550
uh two things I do this one for the
camera

92
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
camera
 

93
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,430
camera
this hand coming up here

94
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
this hand coming up here
 

95
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,449
this hand coming up here
turning makes you try and take the top

96
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:29,459
turning makes you try and take the top
 

97
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,150
turning makes you try and take the top
one and then you find that you've you're

98
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
one and then you find that you've you're
 

99
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,610
one and then you find that you've you're
restricted you it's difficult to sort of

100
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:34,620
restricted you it's difficult to sort of
 

101
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,190
restricted you it's difficult to sort of
throw them and you sometimes feel like

102
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
throw them and you sometimes feel like
 

103
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,650
throw them and you sometimes feel like
you're going with them even when trying

104
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:42,660

 

105
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,790

it's in this hand

106
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:45,800
it's in this hand
 

107
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,750
it's in this hand
so

108
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
so
 

109
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,290
so
this one goes there but this one is lift

110
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:51,300
this one goes there but this one is lift
 

111
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,229
this one goes there but this one is lift
I I step back

112
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
I I step back
 

113
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,610
I I step back
okay that's what done the movement now

114
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:57,620
okay that's what done the movement now
 

115
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,770
okay that's what done the movement now
and then you just step forward

116
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:00,780
and then you just step forward
 

117
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,509
and then you just step forward
Okay so

118
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:02,519
Okay so
 

119
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,970
Okay so
it's not in the first one because he

120
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:04,980
it's not in the first one because he
 

121
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,770
it's not in the first one because he
might not push back I mean he's supposed

122
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:06,780
might not push back I mean he's supposed
 

123
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,509
might not push back I mean he's supposed
to push back but he might not push back

124
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:08,519
to push back but he might not push back
 

125
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,729
to push back but he might not push back
so if he doesn't push back if he's here

126
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:10,739
so if he doesn't push back if he's here
 

127
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,970
so if he doesn't push back if he's here
and you go like this

128
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:13,980
and you go like this
 

129
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,309
and you go like this
then there's a big gap here

130
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
then there's a big gap here
 

131
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,250
then there's a big gap here
you need to sort of like

132
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:19,260
you need to sort of like
 

133
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,250
you need to sort of like
take your body back in a in a powerful

137
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,309
way
so it's ah see so you can't actually see

138
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
so it's ah see so you can't actually see
 

139
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,790
so it's ah see so you can't actually see

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,710
like that and then
so

146
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
