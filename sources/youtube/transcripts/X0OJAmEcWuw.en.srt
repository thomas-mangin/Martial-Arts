1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:28,830

so

2
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840

 

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:38,790

so

4
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800

 

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,750

i'm going to aim this cookie projection

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
i'm going to aim this cookie projection
 

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,590
i'm going to aim this cookie projection
behind his

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
behind his
 

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,389
behind his
base of support so don't wait here and

10
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399
base of support so don't wait here and
 

11
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,350
base of support so don't wait here and
stop it

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
stop it
 

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:01:09,190
stop it
but aim it behind that

14
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200

 

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,149

okay all right so just like any cookie

16
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
okay all right so just like any cookie
 

17
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,190
okay all right so just like any cookie
projection

18
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
projection
 

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,469
projection
the you have to have the the ground path

20
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
the you have to have the the ground path
 

21
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,510
the you have to have the the ground path
so your technique must have an element

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
so your technique must have an element
 

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,950
so your technique must have an element
of stillness in it

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
of stillness in it
 

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,350
of stillness in it
you can it's not a matter like people

26
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
you can it's not a matter like people
 

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,630
you can it's not a matter like people
think or you're using your body momentum

28
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
think or you're using your body momentum
 

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,069
think or you're using your body momentum
that's not aikido's uh projecting

30
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
that's not aikido's uh projecting
 

31
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,030
that's not aikido's uh projecting
energy okay so i have to have a ground

32
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
energy okay so i have to have a ground
 

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,950
energy okay so i have to have a ground
pass his energy hits that

34
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
pass his energy hits that
 

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,270
pass his energy hits that
and that's what moves him so when i'm

36
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
and that's what moves him so when i'm
 

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,870
and that's what moves him so when i'm
coming in like this

38
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
coming in like this
 

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,270
coming in like this
i have to think about where that this

40
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
i have to think about where that this
 

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,190
i have to think about where that this
back foot needs to be

42
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
back foot needs to be
 

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,830
back foot needs to be
in order to do the projection

44
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840

 

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,350

so if the backwood is moving he's bigger

46
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
so if the backwood is moving he's bigger
 

47
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,990
so if the backwood is moving he's bigger
than me

48
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
than me
 

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,510
than me
i'll bounce off of him or will clash

50
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
i'll bounce off of him or will clash
 

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,149
i'll bounce off of him or will clash
because i'm not internalizing his energy

52
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
because i'm not internalizing his energy
 

53
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,550
because i'm not internalizing his energy
or

54
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
or
 

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,510
or
if i put it in a place where he can't do

56
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
if i put it in a place where he can't do
 

57
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,630
if i put it in a place where he can't do
it

58
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
it
 

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,550
it
this is all wrong so

60
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
this is all wrong so
 

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,869
this is all wrong so
if you look at the technique as as i've

62
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
if you look at the technique as as i've
 

63
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,670
if you look at the technique as as i've
closed in

64
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
closed in
 

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,990
closed in
it's always easier to go forward into

66
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
it's always easier to go forward into
 

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,270
it's always easier to go forward into
the eye of the storm once you've

68
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
the eye of the storm once you've
 

69
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,630
the eye of the storm once you've
committed the forward

70
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
committed the forward
 

71
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,430
committed the forward
than it is to go back okay so that's

72
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
than it is to go back okay so that's
 

73
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,110
than it is to go back okay so that's
what's happening here

74
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
what's happening here
 

75
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,470
what's happening here
so i came in and i'm gonna keep going in

76
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480

 

77
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,990

i'm gonna keep going and usually what

78
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
i'm gonna keep going and usually what
 

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,790
i'm gonna keep going and usually what
happens

80
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
happens
 

81
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,710
happens
is you're training you don't you don't

82
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
is you're training you don't you don't
 

83
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,390
is you're training you don't you don't
want to go in because that sword is

84
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
want to go in because that sword is
 

85
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,190
want to go in because that sword is
coming here

86
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
coming here
 

87
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,070
coming here
but you have to have a spirit that uh

88
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
but you have to have a spirit that uh
 

89
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,390
but you have to have a spirit that uh
you

90
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
you
 

91
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,750
you
are going in you're going in

92
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
are going in you're going in
 

93
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,509
are going in you're going in
and then that will stop your back foot

94
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
and then that will stop your back foot
 

95
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,869
and then that will stop your back foot
from being uh

96
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
from being uh
 

97
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,830
from being uh
placed in a in a zone where it doesn't

98
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
placed in a in a zone where it doesn't
 

99
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,550
placed in a in a zone where it doesn't
actually function as a projection okay

100
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
actually function as a projection okay
 

101
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,990
actually function as a projection okay
so you're going to move it

102
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000

 

103
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,990

then also don't look up at the store

104
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
then also don't look up at the store
 

105
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,390
then also don't look up at the store
because as you start out it's harder to

106
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
because as you start out it's harder to
 

107
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,229
because as you start out it's harder to
do projections when you don't have an

108
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
do projections when you don't have an
 

109
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,750
do projections when you don't have an
organized body

110
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
organized body
 

111
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,509
organized body
and the top of your spine should be the

112
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
and the top of your spine should be the
 

113
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,190
and the top of your spine should be the
top of your head

114
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
top of your head
 

115
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,670
top of your head
you look up like this you it's going to

116
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
you look up like this you it's going to
 

117
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,350
you look up like this you it's going to
be harder for a beginner to use a

118
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
be harder for a beginner to use a
 

119
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,630
be harder for a beginner to use a
projection

120
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
projection
 

121
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:38,630
projection
so don't look in move forward

122
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640

 

123
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,440

okay
