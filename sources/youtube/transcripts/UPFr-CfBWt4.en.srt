00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,950

let's let's go into the

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:04,960
let's let's go into the
 

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,150
let's let's go into the
um the

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,160
um the
 

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,549
um the
EO the EDI part okay the x pattern it's

6
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:11,559
EO the EDI part okay the x pattern it's
 

7
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:14,549
EO the EDI part okay the x pattern it's
it's different okay uh but all the all

8
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:14,559
it's different okay uh but all the all
 

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,230
it's different okay uh but all the all
my techniques are different they just

10
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:17,240
my techniques are different they just
 

11
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,590
my techniques are different they just
appear not to be because I

12
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:20,600
appear not to be because I
 

13
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,710
appear not to be because I
think uh you're not well to be honest

14
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:23,720
think uh you're not well to be honest
 

15
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,790
think uh you're not well to be honest
you're not looking closely enough you're

16
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:25,800
you're not looking closely enough you're
 

17
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,390
you're not looking closely enough you're
still using your Federation eyes to see

18
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:29,400
still using your Federation eyes to see
 

19
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,470
still using your Federation eyes to see
this

20
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
this
 

21
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,749
this
um but there's different things these

22
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:32,759
um but there's different things these
 

23
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,350
um but there's different things these
are different and this EO is very

24
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
are different and this EO is very
 

25
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,709
are different and this EO is very
different um because it's based on fight

26
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
different um because it's based on fight
 

27
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,150
different um because it's based on fight
experience so uh mid-range grappling is

28
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,160
experience so uh mid-range grappling is
 

29
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,510
experience so uh mid-range grappling is
a lot about controlling the extremities

30
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
a lot about controlling the extremities
 

31
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,670
a lot about controlling the extremities
of the body um which is important

32
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:48,680
of the body um which is important
 

33
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,590
of the body um which is important
because weapons are involved in real

34
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:50,600
because weapons are involved in real
 

35
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,470
because weapons are involved in real
fighting so um for me in law

36
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
fighting so um for me in law
 

37
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,990
fighting so um for me in law
enforcement uh it's always very hard as

38
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,000
enforcement uh it's always very hard as
 

39
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,549
enforcement uh it's always very hard as
I train people that do modern martial

40
00:00:59,549 --> 00:00:59,559
I train people that do modern martial
 

41
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,709
I train people that do modern martial
arts

42
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
arts
 

43
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,630
arts
uh because they want body control and

44
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
uh because they want body control and
 

45
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,149
uh because they want body control and
it's all like yeah but now he can draw a

46
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:05,159
it's all like yeah but now he can draw a
 

47
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,670
it's all like yeah but now he can draw a
weapon and so they learn really fast

48
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:08,680
weapon and so they learn really fast
 

49
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,789
weapon and so they learn really fast
when we allow the weapon in in play that

50
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:11,799
when we allow the weapon in in play that
 

51
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,190
when we allow the weapon in in play that
you need to control the limbs and

52
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
you need to control the limbs and
 

53
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,990
you need to control the limbs and
so mid-range grappling you are going to

54
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,000
so mid-range grappling you are going to
 

55
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,149
so mid-range grappling you are going to
play off in a dilemma uh between control

56
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
play off in a dilemma uh between control
 

57
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,030
play off in a dilemma uh between control
of the center and control of the limbs

58
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
of the center and control of the limbs
 

59
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,230
of the center and control of the limbs
and the way that this isn't oppositional

60
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
and the way that this isn't oppositional
 

61
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,149
and the way that this isn't oppositional
is through your internals so when I

62
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
is through your internals so when I
 

63
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,429
is through your internals so when I
touch a limb I am still touching the

64
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
touch a limb I am still touching the
 

65
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,230
touch a limb I am still touching the
center uh that's very very important but

66
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
center uh that's very very important but
 

67
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,030
center uh that's very very important but
you're still playing off how do I get

68
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
you're still playing off how do I get
 

69
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,670
you're still playing off how do I get
these arm isolations which is what we

70
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
these arm isolations which is what we
 

71
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,630
these arm isolations which is what we
call them today uh and the way you get

72
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
call them today uh and the way you get
 

73
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,830
call them today uh and the way you get
them is whenever you attack someone's uh

74
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
them is whenever you attack someone's uh
 

75
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,590
them is whenever you attack someone's uh
balance the arms will the arms will

76
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:54,600
balance the arms will the arms will
 

77
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,429
balance the arms will the arms will
always reach out from AC away from the

78
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
always reach out from AC away from the
 

79
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,389
always reach out from AC away from the
body exposing them to arm isolations

80
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
body exposing them to arm isolations
 

81
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,910
body exposing them to arm isolations
or whenever and so or larger whenever

82
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:02,920
or whenever and so or larger whenever
 

83
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,590
or whenever and so or larger whenever
you attack the core the spine line the

84
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:06,600
you attack the core the spine line the
 

85
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,710
you attack the core the spine line the
people always extend their arms out and

86
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:09,720
people always extend their arms out and
 

87
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,070
people always extend their arms out and
that's what generates the arm isolation

88
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
that's what generates the arm isolation
 

89
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,030
that's what generates the arm isolation
so a real simple one if he's down on the

90
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
so a real simple one if he's down on the
 

91
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,589
so a real simple one if he's down on the
ground and I have

92
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:18,599
ground and I have
 

93
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,270
ground and I have
Mount and um he could be all kind of

94
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:22,280
Mount and um he could be all kind of
 

95
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,630
Mount and um he could be all kind of
hidden here and not letting the these

96
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:25,640
hidden here and not letting the these
 

97
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,229
hidden here and not letting the these
this arm stuff but when you start

98
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
this arm stuff but when you start
 

99
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,309
this arm stuff but when you start
punching at his face then every time

100
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:31,319
punching at his face then every time
 

101
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,229
punching at his face then every time
you're getting there the arms get

102
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:33,239
you're getting there the arms get
 

103
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,830
you're getting there the arms get
further and further out as you're doing

104
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:36,840
further and further out as you're doing
 

105
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,710
further and further out as you're doing
this and now you have your arm

106
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
this and now you have your arm
 

107
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,670
this and now you have your arm
isolations that you can attack okay um

108
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:42,680
isolations that you can attack okay um
 

109
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,790
isolations that you can attack okay um
and that is what in

110
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,800
and that is what in
 

111
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,790
and that is what in
essence I the EO is doing so on the

112
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
essence I the EO is doing so on the
 

113
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,350
essence I the EO is doing so on the
first one you get his balance going you

114
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:52,360
first one you get his balance going you
 

115
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,830
first one you get his balance going you
see um he might he might have his arms

116
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
see um he might he might have his arms
 

117
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,790
see um he might he might have his arms
all all Clos you see and I can't get

118
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
all all Clos you see and I can't get
 

119
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,710
all all Clos you see and I can't get
those techniques I can't get that but I

120
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:01,720
those techniques I can't get that but I
 

121
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,670
those techniques I can't get that but I
moved his body and then the arm came the

122
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:04,680
moved his body and then the arm came the
 

123
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:53,429
moved his body and then the arm came the
elbow came away from his torso and

124
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439

 

125
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,910

came away from his torso and that's

126
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:56,920
came away from his torso and that's
 

127
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,429
came away from his torso and that's
always what makes the arm isolation

128
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:00,439
always what makes the arm isolation
 

129
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,789
always what makes the arm isolation
possible so if we look on the on the

130
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
possible so if we look on the on the
 

131
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,030
possible so if we look on the on the
mount

132
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,040
mount
 

133
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,309
mount
one when his elbows are tight to his

134
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:07,319
one when his elbows are tight to his
 

135
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,429
one when his elbows are tight to his
torso you just can't get leverage on

136
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:10,439
torso you just can't get leverage on
 

137
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,030
torso you just can't get leverage on
that but as it moves away then then it's

138
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,040
that but as it moves away then then it's
 

139
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,590
that but as it moves away then then it's
easy to do so that is what you're doing

140
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
easy to do so that is what you're doing
 

141
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,310
easy to do so that is what you're doing
in uh eel he has his tight elbows and

142
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
in uh eel he has his tight elbows and
 

143
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,189
in uh eel he has his tight elbows and
when you go that's when the elbow came

144
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
when you go that's when the elbow came
 

145
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:56,590
when you go that's when the elbow came
away

146
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:56,600

 

147
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,870

and now that arm is isolatable okay the

148
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
and now that arm is isolatable okay the
 

149
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,029
and now that arm is isolatable okay the
difference in II in II Jiu-Jitsu schools

150
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
difference in II in II Jiu-Jitsu schools
 

151
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,790
difference in II in II Jiu-Jitsu schools
is when you touch the arm you're not

152
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:07,800
is when you touch the arm you're not
 

153
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,029
is when you touch the arm you're not
just going to try to get the arm you

154
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:10,039
just going to try to get the arm you
 

155
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,469
just going to try to get the arm you
touch the arm to keep controlling the

156
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
touch the arm to keep controlling the
 

157
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:33,350
touch the arm to keep controlling the
the center of his body okay

158
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360

 

159
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,510

okay so that's what we're

160
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:36,520
okay so that's what we're
 

161
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,110
okay so that's what we're
doing um so let's get to here we don't I

162
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
doing um so let's get to here we don't I
 

163
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,830
doing um so let's get to here we don't I
don't care how you do this let's make it

164
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:42,840
don't care how you do this let's make it
 

165
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,550
don't care how you do this let's make it
a micro drill I'm only going to work on

166
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:45,560
a micro drill I'm only going to work on
 

167
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,670
a micro drill I'm only going to work on
part of the technique so we can even

168
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:48,680
part of the technique so we can even
 

169
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,550
part of the technique so we can even
start here okay and what we're going to

170
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:51,560
start here okay and what we're going to
 

171
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,350
start here okay and what we're going to
look at is

172
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360

 

173
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,790

thei so we know our starting

174
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
thei so we know our starting
 

175
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,830
thei so we know our starting
point

176
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:02,840
point
 

177
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,909
point
here start here and then I'm going to

178
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
here start here and then I'm going to
 

179
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,070
here start here and then I'm going to
give you the ending

180
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
give you the ending
 

181
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,230
give you the ending
point that elbow his elbow is under my

182
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:13,240
point that elbow his elbow is under my
 

183
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,629
point that elbow his elbow is under my
center line the wui line okay that's the

184
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
center line the wui line okay that's the
 

185
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:54,510
center line the wui line okay that's the
ending point

186
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:54,520

 

187
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,830

and then I'll give you some

188
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:56,840
and then I'll give you some
 

189
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,510
and then I'll give you some
parameters my elbow articulation angle

190
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
parameters my elbow articulation angle
 

191
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,350
parameters my elbow articulation angle
remains in katata DOI on both arms

192
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
remains in katata DOI on both arms
 

193
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,029
remains in katata DOI on both arms
so this angle which is

194
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
so this angle which is
 

195
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,350
so this angle which is
discoverable by the natural extension of

196
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:14,360
discoverable by the natural extension of
 

197
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,309
discoverable by the natural extension of
your arms here you don't hyperextend

198
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:17,319
your arms here you don't hyperextend
 

199
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,309
your arms here you don't hyperextend
them don't bend them where are they here

200
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:21,319
them don't bend them where are they here
 

201
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,869
them don't bend them where are they here
that's where katot

202
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:23,879
that's where katot
 

203
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,230
that's where katot
is that's where my arm so don't

204
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
is that's where my arm so don't
 

205
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,710
is that's where my arm so don't
hyperextend this one I'm in that

206
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:29,720
hyperextend this one I'm in that
 

207
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,230
hyperextend this one I'm in that
articulation and I keep it all the way

208
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,240
articulation and I keep it all the way
 

209
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:58,430
articulation and I keep it all the way
through the

210
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:58,440

 

211
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:31,189

technique for

212
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199

 

213
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,829

okay we're going to work on those things

214
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:32,839
okay we're going to work on those things
 

215
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,070
okay we're going to work on those things
we got our beginning we got our ending

216
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,080
we got our beginning we got our ending
 

217
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,709
we got our beginning we got our ending
and we have one parameter to work don't

218
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:37,719
and we have one parameter to work don't
 

219
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,750
and we have one parameter to work don't
have these arms go in and out what does

220
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
have these arms go in and out what does
 

221
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,070
have these arms go in and out what does
in and out look

222
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,080
in and out look
 

223
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,949
in and out look
like here

224
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
like here
 

225
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,150
like here
here this kind of stuff no that's not it

226
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,160
here this kind of stuff no that's not it
 

227
00:08:47,160 --> 00:09:03,910
here this kind of stuff no that's not it
okay all right here we go

228
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920

 

229
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,350

wait

230
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,360

 

231
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:25,710

okay this way

232
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:25,720

 

233
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:47,389

please and keep going

234
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:47,399

 

235
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,509

okay more

236
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
okay more
 

237
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,430
okay more
parameters um we'll review the one about

238
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:54,440
parameters um we'll review the one about
 

239
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,310
parameters um we'll review the one about
the yin Yong grid okay so the

240
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
the yin Yong grid okay so the
 

241
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,630
the yin Yong grid okay so the
let's say this is the elbow

242
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:03,640

 

243
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,230

hand

244
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:05,240
hand
 

245
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,310
hand
the grabbed hand brings it in the inward

246
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:11,320
the grabbed hand brings it in the inward
 

247
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,990
the grabbed hand brings it in the inward
spiral to the wui line and neither Yong

248
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,000
spiral to the wui line and neither Yong
 

249
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,150
spiral to the wui line and neither Yong
nor Yin line the midline that's where

250
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
nor Yin line the midline that's where
 

251
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,470
nor Yin line the midline that's where
the wrist hand is going to pick

252
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
the wrist hand is going to pick
 

253
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,190
the wrist hand is going to pick
up what the driving position who's the

254
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
up what the driving position who's the
 

255
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,590
up what the driving position who's the
team leader here that's the te so here

256
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:26,600
team leader here that's the te so here
 

257
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,829
team leader here that's the te so here
it

258
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
it
 

259
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,590
it
goes over

260
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:30,600
goes over
 

261
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,870
goes over
meets picks up

262
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:35,880

 

263
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,030

continues over to the left

264
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
continues over to the left
 

265
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,790
continues over to the left
Yar that will

266
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:41,800
Yar that will
 

267
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,829
Yar that will
bring the

268
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
bring the
 

269
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,590
bring the
elbow onto the wuji

270
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
elbow onto the wuji
 

271
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,550
elbow onto the wuji
line where it ends on that line at the

272
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:51,560
line where it ends on that line at the
 

273
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,110
line where it ends on that line at the
bottom we know that we also know that

274
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,120
bottom we know that we also know that
 

275
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,710
bottom we know that we also know that
the inward

276
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:57,720
the inward
 

277
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,069
the inward
spiral is a matter of how the wrist and

278
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
spiral is a matter of how the wrist and
 

279
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,710
spiral is a matter of how the wrist and
the elbow are related to each other so

280
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:05,720
the elbow are related to each other so
 

281
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,509
the elbow are related to each other so
they don't go like this there's there's

282
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
they don't go like this there's there's
 

283
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,910
they don't go like this there's there's
no spiraling around yes my arm moves

284
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:12,920
no spiraling around yes my arm moves
 

285
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,949
no spiraling around yes my arm moves
from right to left but the elbow

286
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:15,959
from right to left but the elbow
 

287
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,030
from right to left but the elbow
relation to the wrist didn't change the

288
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
relation to the wrist didn't change the
 

289
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,310
relation to the wrist didn't change the
wrist on the inward Spiral goes in and

290
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:23,320
wrist on the inward Spiral goes in and
 

291
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,310
wrist on the inward Spiral goes in and
the elbow goes

292
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
the elbow goes
 

293
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,710
the elbow goes
out on the other side you have the

294
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:29,720
out on the other side you have the
 

295
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,310
out on the other side you have the
outward spiral and I don't go like this

296
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
outward spiral and I don't go like this
 

297
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,629
outward spiral and I don't go like this
because again there's no arm movement

298
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:36,639
because again there's no arm movement
 

299
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,790
because again there's no arm movement
here the wrist goes out and the elbow

300
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:41,800
here the wrist goes out and the elbow
 

301
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,750
here the wrist goes out and the elbow
comes in that's what happens it's just

302
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:44,760
comes in that's what happens it's just
 

303
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,550
comes in that's what happens it's just
hard to see because inside of that

304
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:47,560
hard to see because inside of that
 

305
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,670
hard to see because inside of that
spiral I actually

306
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
spiral I actually
 

307
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,629
spiral I actually
moved

308
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:51,639
moved
 

309
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,069
moved
okay but I'm not just going like

310
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
okay but I'm not just going like
 

311
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,430
okay but I'm not just going like
this then we also know from previous

312
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
this then we also know from previous
 

313
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,870
this then we also know from previous
videos that my elbows never go outside

314
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
videos that my elbows never go outside
 

315
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,230
videos that my elbows never go outside
the Yang line so when you're doing this

316
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,240
the Yang line so when you're doing this
 

317
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,990
the Yang line so when you're doing this
your elbows can't go outside that

318
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:07,000
your elbows can't go outside that
 

319
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,829
your elbows can't go outside that
shoulder line never outside the outer we

320
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839
shoulder line never outside the outer we
 

321
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,670
shoulder line never outside the outer we
know all that

322
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
know all that
 

323
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,350
know all that
okay um some more parameters you have to

324
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
okay um some more parameters you have to
 

325
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,189
okay um some more parameters you have to
make sure your hands and your arms your

326
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:17,199
make sure your hands and your arms your
 

327
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:19,269
make sure your hands and your arms your
elbows are doing

328
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
elbows are doing
 

329
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,350
elbows are doing
this then we also

330
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:22,360
this then we also
 

331
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,949
this then we also
know that my spirals don't move from my

332
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959

these very small degrees so if my hand
 

339
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,750
these very small degrees so if my hand
was on the Y Line here this is the

340
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:40,760
was on the Y Line here this is the
 

341
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,949
was on the Y Line here this is the
amount of movement that that hand is

342
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
amount of movement that that hand is
 

343
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,230
amount of movement that that hand is
only allowed because it never crosses

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,069
other side
okay if I so so my movement is if the

350
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
okay if I so so my movement is if the
 

351
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,870
okay if I so so my movement is if the
arm movement maximum I can't go outside

352
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:57,880
arm movement maximum I can't go outside
 

353
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,470
arm movement maximum I can't go outside
the shoulder line and I can only go to

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
the shoulder line and I can only go to
 

355
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,389
the shoulder line and I can only go to
the wui line then that's all the

356
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
the wui line then that's all the
 

357
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,750
the wui line then that's all the
movement that I'm allowed on that if I

358
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:04,760
movement that I'm allowed on that if I
 

359
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,269
movement that I'm allowed on that if I
needed whatever I was holding on here to

360
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
needed whatever I was holding on here to

Traverse the mat more that's where you

362
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:09,399
Traverse the mat more that's where you
 

363
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,230
Traverse the mat more that's where you
have to move your body but my arm never

364

have to move your body but my arm never
 

365
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,750
have to move your body but my arm never
goes past that it's very small movements

366
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
goes past that it's very small movements
 

367
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,069
goes past that it's very small movements
very small movements

368
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
very small movements
 

369
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,150
very small movements
okay and then we also know that the arms

370
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,160
okay and then we also know that the arms
 

371
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,069
okay and then we also know that the arms
don't lead those

372
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:25,079
don't lead those
 

373
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,949
don't lead those
movements the qua leads that movement so

374
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
movements the qua leads that movement so
 

375
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,430
movements the qua leads that movement so
when when I want my hand to go from here

to that that small movement what do you
 

379
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,590
to that that small movement what do you
guys say that

380

guys say that
 

381
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,110
guys say that
is how many

quaw and that's what makes that four to
 

391
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,710
quaw and that's what makes that four to
six my hand doesn't do it the quaw

392
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
six my hand doesn't do it the quaw
 

393

joint here okay and then we also know

400
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
joint here okay and then we also know
 

401
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,269
joint here okay and then we also know
from previous videos that the

402
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:14,279
from previous videos that the
 

403
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,629
from previous videos that the
qua knee and foot have to uh stay in

404
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:19,639
qua knee and foot have to uh stay in
 

405
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:23,269
qua knee and foot have to uh stay in
alignment which is why you can't do

406
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
alignment which is why you can't do
 

407
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,230
alignment which is why you can't do
these stances in mod in Moder keto

408
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:27,240
these stances in mod in Moder keto
 

409
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,389
these stances in mod in Moder keto
they're not functioning correctly which

410
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:29,399
they're not functioning correctly which
 

411
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,189
they're not functioning correctly which
is why there's no qua in modern iino

412
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:32,199
is why there's no qua in modern iino
 

413
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:33,949
is why there's no qua in modern iino
okay because they're going to turn and

414
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:33,959
okay because they're going to turn and
 

415
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,110
okay because they're going to turn and
do these weird things it's like well I

416
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,120
do these weird things it's like well I
 

417
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,749

don't have knee and foot alignment with
 

419
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,069
don't have knee and foot alignment with
the qua okay so let's keep all that in

420
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
the qua okay so let's keep all that in
 

421
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:42,990
the qua okay so let's keep all that in
mind

422
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,000
mind
 

423
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,629
mind
now and we

424
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:45,639
now and we
 

425
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,670
now and we
start we still have my beginning and

426
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
start we still have my beginning and
 

427
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,790
start we still have my beginning and
ending and we still have the katata D

433
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,030
angle and I have to uh allow for the
wrist and elbow to move so don't go here

434
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
wrist and elbow to move so don't go here
 

435
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,310
wrist and elbow to move so don't go here
the wrist and elbow do not rotate around

00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:07,320
the wrist and elbow do not rotate around
 

437
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,629
the wrist and elbow do not rotate around
each other they do rotate around each

the wrist and elbow angle and I'm just

444
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
the wrist and elbow angle and I'm just
 

445
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,670
the wrist and elbow angle and I'm just
going to move it from my right the Y

446
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:18,680
going to move it from my right the Y
 

447
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,590
going to move it from my right the Y
line to

448
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:20,600
line to
 

449
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,990

one where the wrist and elbow rotate

460
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:45,079
one where the wrist and elbow rotate
 

461
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:50,389
one where the wrist and elbow rotate
around each

462
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399

 

463
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,309

other so we'll do it I'll do it faster

464
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:53,319
other so we'll do it I'll do it faster
 

465
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,870
other so we'll do it I'll do it faster
now so you can

466
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:55,880
now so you can
 

467
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,150
now so you can
see comes into me I'm on the other one

468
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
see comes into me I'm on the other one
 

469
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,069
see comes into me I'm on the other one
he's going to rotate around you as long

470
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:03,079
he's going to rotate around you as long
 

471
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:06,710
he's going to rotate around you as long
as these

472
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720

 

473
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,629

do so

474
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:09,639
do so
 

475
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,470
do so
you're some of the complication that you

476
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
you're some of the complication that you
 

477
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,189
you're some of the complication that you
might be having is you're violating what

478
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
might be having is you're violating what
 

479
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,629
might be having is you're violating what
is actually an inward spiral and outward

480
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
is actually an inward spiral and outward
 

481
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,030
is actually an inward spiral and outward
spiral so you can see

482
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,040

 

483
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,470

tayor we just going to go

484
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:27,480
tayor we just going to go
 

485
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,949
tayor we just going to go
here and he will come back into me give

486
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:31,959
here and he will come back into me give
 

487
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:35,829
here and he will come back into me give
him some balance so he doesn't fall okay

488
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
him some balance so he doesn't fall okay
 

489
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,749
him some balance so he doesn't fall okay
he comes towards me how you see because

490
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
he comes towards me how you see because
 

491
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,829
he comes towards me how you see because
the elbow comes towards

492
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:42,839
the elbow comes towards
 

493
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,870
the elbow comes towards
me you do watch the where the elbow goes

494
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:46,880
me you do watch the where the elbow goes
 

495
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,749
me you do watch the where the elbow goes
the elbow's going away from me so he

496
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
the elbow's going away from me so he
 

497
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,829
the elbow's going away from me so he
goes around me okay so if you're trying

498
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:53,839
goes around me okay so if you're trying
 

499
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,949
goes around me okay so if you're trying
to bring him towards

500
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:55,959
to bring him towards
 

501
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:59,629
to bring him towards
you you're going to close off

502
00:16:59,629 --> 00:16:59,639
you you're going to close off
 

503
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,590
you you're going to close off
the yin space that you need on the

504
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
the yin space that you need on the
 

505
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,350
the yin space that you need on the
entring he's coming at

506
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
entring he's coming at
 

507
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,470
entring he's coming at
you you're going to think that if you

508
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,480
you you're going to think that if you
 

509
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,390
you you're going to think that if you
bring it here you would get un over it

510
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
bring it here you would get un over it
 

511
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,549
bring it here you would get un over it
and you would feel your power but you

512
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
and you would feel your power but you
 

513
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,350
and you would feel your power but you
end up doing this

514
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,360
end up doing this
 

515
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,270
end up doing this
instead even if you go quicker he's very

516
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
instead even if you go quicker he's very
 

517
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,829
instead even if you go quicker he's very
heavy right there he's very heavy cuz

518
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:23,839
heavy right there he's very heavy cuz
 

519
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,870
heavy right there he's very heavy cuz
he's not already falling and I'm not

520
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
he's not already falling and I'm not
 

521
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,590
he's not already falling and I'm not
entering in true y space okay so you

522
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:30,600
entering in true y space okay so you
 

523
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,510
entering in true y space okay so you
have to

524
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:31,520
have to
 

525
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,270
have to
remember that they have to rotate around

526
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:34,280
remember that they have to rotate around
 

527
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,029
remember that they have to rotate around
each other not stay in the line in the

528
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:38,039
each other not stay in the line in the
 

529
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,270
each other not stay in the line in the
same spiraling relationship which is no

530
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,280
same spiraling relationship which is no
 

531
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,510
same spiraling relationship which is no
spiraling relationship okay then he will

532
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:44,520
spiraling relationship okay then he will
 

533
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,230
spiraling relationship okay then he will
go around me not into me if he doesn't

534
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
go around me not into me if he doesn't
 

535
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,909
go around me not into me if he doesn't
go into me I can enter into y space

536
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:50,919
go into me I can enter into y space
 

537
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,110
go into me I can enter into y space
because as he's going around me it's

538
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
because as he's going around me it's
 

539
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,270
because as he's going around me it's
opening not closing okay and this hand

540
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
opening not closing okay and this hand
 

541
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,310
opening not closing okay and this hand
this hand helps all that so again if you

542
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,320
this hand helps all that so again if you
 

543
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,549
this hand helps all that so again if you
just bring your arm and you watch my

544
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
just bring your arm and you watch my
 

545
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,630
just bring your arm and you watch my
elbow it's coming closer to me he comes

546
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
elbow it's coming closer to me he comes
 

547
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,630
elbow it's coming closer to me he comes
towards me but if I make my elbow go in

548
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
towards me but if I make my elbow go in
 

549
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,310
towards me but if I make my elbow go in
and my wrist goes out my elbow does not

550
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:17,320
and my wrist goes out my elbow does not
 

551
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,230
and my wrist goes out my elbow does not
come towards me he goes around me I'm

552
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,240
come towards me he goes around me I'm
 

553
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,789
come towards me he goes around me I'm
not closing off the yin space okay so

554
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:23,799
not closing off the yin space okay so
 

555
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,110
not closing off the yin space okay so
I'm not

556
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
I'm not
 

557
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,070
I'm not
going like this which is the fedorite

558
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
going like this which is the fedorite
 

559
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,350
going like this which is the fedorite
iido right right so they go like they're

560
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:30,360
iido right right so they go like they're
 

561
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,750
iido right right so they go like they're
swabbing the Pirates

562
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:32,760
swabbing the Pirates
 

563
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,990
swabbing the Pirates
at and then they bring them in we don't

564
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
at and then they bring them in we don't
 

565
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,710
at and then they bring them in we don't
have this Movement we don't have that

566
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:38,720
have this Movement we don't have that
 

567
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,710
have this Movement we don't have that
movement okay all right

568
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:41,720
movement okay all right
 

569
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,630
movement okay all right
so

570
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:43,640
so
 

571
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,669
so
then the other thing is when my elbow

572
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:48,679
then the other thing is when my elbow
 

573
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,270
then the other thing is when my elbow
does that when my elbow goes around the

574
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
does that when my elbow goes around the
 

575
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,230
does that when my elbow goes around the
wrist as the wrist of the elbow hand is

576
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:55,240
wrist as the wrist of the elbow hand is
 

577
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,870
wrist as the wrist of the elbow hand is
coming towards the wui line and this one

578
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
coming towards the wui line and this one
 

579
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,190
coming towards the wui line and this one
is coming to the Y

580
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
is coming to the Y
 

581
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,510
is coming to the Y
Line it is my qua that does that not not

582
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
Line it is my qua that does that not not
 

583
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,470
Line it is my qua that does that not not
my

584
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:06,480
my
 

585
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,190
my
arms so I don't want to

586
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
arms so I don't want to
 

587
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,870
arms so I don't want to
enter and then do

588
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
enter and then do
 

589
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,350
enter and then do
waste as you see here he's too far

590
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:18,360
waste as you see here he's too far
 

591
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,430
waste as you see here he's too far
around which is going to happen and it

592
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:22,440
around which is going to happen and it
 

593
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,430
around which is going to happen and it
doesn't actually show up in the

594
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:24,440
doesn't actually show up in the
 

595
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,990
doesn't actually show up in the
technique because that opening is going

596
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
technique because that opening is going
 

597
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,590
technique because that opening is going
to be gone by the time you do a two-step

598
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:30,600
to be gone by the time you do a two-step
 

599
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,750
to be gone by the time you do a two-step
Tak down okay it it's not un it's not

600
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:34,760
Tak down okay it it's not un it's not
 

601
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:41,110
Tak down okay it it's not un it's not
unlike we're here and I inter and then I

602
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
unlike we're here and I inter and then I
 

603
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,390
unlike we're here and I inter and then I
do my waist that's not what we do okay

604
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,400
do my waist that's not what we do okay
 

605
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,870
do my waist that's not what we do okay
the

606
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:45,880
the
 

607
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,430
the
qua the qua is going to enter into the

608
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
qua the qua is going to enter into the
 

609
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,950
qua the qua is going to enter into the
rotation and all I need is 4 in of

610
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
rotation and all I need is 4 in of
 

611
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,630
rotation and all I need is 4 in of
rotation

612
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
rotation
 

613
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,190
rotation
not that other thing okay because as you

614
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200
not that other thing okay because as you
 

615
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,990
not that other thing okay because as you
saw on that one my hand came past the

616
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,000
saw on that one my hand came past the
 

617
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,149
saw on that one my hand came past the
wuji line so I was over here and now how

618
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:09,159
wuji line so I was over here and now how
 

619
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:12,789
wuji line so I was over here and now how
much distance is that what do you say 2

620
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
much distance is that what do you say 2
 

621
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,789
much distance is that what do you say 2
feet you see that as opposed to my 4 in

622
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
feet you see that as opposed to my 4 in
 

623
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,470
feet you see that as opposed to my 4 in
okay

624
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
okay
 

625
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,190
okay
so as you're as you're entering you're

626
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:22,200
so as you're as you're entering you're
 

627
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,270
so as you're as you're entering you're
turning you're turning as you're

628
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
turning you're turning as you're
 

629
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,669
turning you're turning as you're
entering and as you're turning as you're

630
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:28,679
entering and as you're turning as you're
 

631
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,909
entering and as you're turning as you're
entering he's getting lighter not

632
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:30,919
entering he's getting lighter not
 

633
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:33,710
entering he's getting lighter not
heavier and the opening is remaining

634
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:33,720
heavier and the opening is remaining
 

635
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,310
heavier and the opening is remaining
open not closed okay so watch how you've

636
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
open not closed okay so watch how you've
 

637
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,149
open not closed okay so watch how you've
already entered and then you want to

638
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:41,159
already entered and then you want to
 

639
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:43,669
already entered and then you want to
turn that's not

640
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:43,679
turn that's not
 

641
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,789
turn that's not
it or of course worse you don't turn at

642
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:47,799
it or of course worse you don't turn at
 

643
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:50,549
it or of course worse you don't turn at
all you bring your arms in it's going to

644
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:50,559
all you bring your arms in it's going to
 

645
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,789
all you bring your arms in it's going to
close it like we said okay as as you're

646
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:54,799
close it like we said okay as as you're
 

647
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,350
close it like we said okay as as you're
entering you're turning turning

648
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
entering you're turning turning
 

649
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:18,190
entering you're turning turning
so if you

650
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,200

 

651
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,590

watch watch my

652
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:20,600
watch watch my
 

653
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,230
watch watch my
foot I think that's probably the biggest

654
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:23,240
foot I think that's probably the biggest
 

655
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,390
foot I think that's probably the biggest
indicator for someone to see cuz you

656
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:25,400
indicator for someone to see cuz you
 

657
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,630
indicator for someone to see cuz you
can't really see my clock

658
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
can't really see my clock
 

659
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,990
can't really see my clock
the foot

660
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
the foot
 

661
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,029
the foot
enters and it's

662
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:32,039
enters and it's
 

663
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:36,750
enters and it's
turning so when it when it hits it's

664
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:36,760
turning so when it when it hits it's
 

665
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,950
turning so when it when it hits it's
going to stop the qua

666
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960
going to stop the qua
 

667
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,149
going to stop the qua
stops okay so I'm here and it's

668
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:46,159
stops okay so I'm here and it's
 

669
00:21:46,159 --> 00:22:09,669
stops okay so I'm here and it's
turning boom

670
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:09,679

 

671
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,430

my foot doesn't end in this angle nor in

672
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
my foot doesn't end in this angle nor in
 

673
00:22:13,440 --> 00:23:07,669
my foot doesn't end in this angle nor in
this angle

674
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679

 

675
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:48,549

different move as a un

676
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:48,559

 

677
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,710

what this

678
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:49,720
what this
 

679
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,149
what this
does on the back side is my

680
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:55,159
does on the back side is my
 

681
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,750
does on the back side is my
Koshi goes back and attacks the center

682
00:23:59,750 --> 00:23:59,760
Koshi goes back and attacks the center
 

683
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,590
Koshi goes back and attacks the center
okay so if I don't turn you'll push him

684
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:04,600
okay so if I don't turn you'll push him
 

685
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,950
okay so if I don't turn you'll push him
away you don't load the

686
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:06,960
away you don't load the
 

687
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,990
away you don't load the
kushion if you've

688
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,000
kushion if you've
 

689
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,269
kushion if you've
entered then

690
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:11,279
entered then
 

691
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,029
entered then
turn it's like barely loaded and you

692
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
turn it's like barely loaded and you
 

693
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,789
turn it's like barely loaded and you
over

694
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
over
 

695
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:28,750
over
rotate but if you do this boom

696
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:28,760

 

697
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,590

he's up here up here I don't know get

698
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:32,600
he's up here up here I don't know get
 

699
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:54,310
he's up here up here I don't know get
different

700
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,320

 

701
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:28,950

angles here

702
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:28,960

 

703
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:47,630

[Music]

704
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:47,640

 

705
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,830

okay let's try so by re uh reminding you

706
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
okay let's try so by re uh reminding you
 

707
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,789
okay let's try so by re uh reminding you
of all these um biomechanical

708
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:55,799
of all these um biomechanical
 

709
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,510
of all these um biomechanical
alignments what we're trying to get away

710
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:58,520
alignments what we're trying to get away
 

711
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,389
alignments what we're trying to get away
from is twisting you don't want to twist

712
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:01,399
from is twisting you don't want to twist
 

713
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:05,630
from is twisting you don't want to twist
there's no we don't twist okay um we

714
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:05,640
there's no we don't twist okay um we
 

715
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,630
there's no we don't twist okay um we
don't use the waist we don't

716
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:07,640
don't use the waist we don't
 

717
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,190
don't use the waist we don't
twist uh you don't use the waist because

718
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,200
twist uh you don't use the waist because
 

719
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,470
twist uh you don't use the waist because
when you twist the waist uh you're going

720
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
when you twist the waist uh you're going
 

721
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,430
when you twist the waist uh you're going
to um choke or compress like a balloon

722
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
to um choke or compress like a balloon
 

723
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,870
to um choke or compress like a balloon
animal maker would so you want to you

724
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:21,880
animal maker would so you want to you
 

725
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,470
animal maker would so you want to you
turn the middle of the balloon you you

726
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
turn the middle of the balloon you you
 

727
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,870
turn the middle of the balloon you you
you're doing that to your tonden and the

728
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
you're doing that to your tonden and the
 

729
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,590
you're doing that to your tonden and the
tonden goes goes out you just kill it

730
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:29,600
tonden goes goes out you just kill it
 

731
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,110
tonden goes goes out you just kill it
okay uh so we don't want to twist um for

732
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,120
okay uh so we don't want to twist um for
 

733
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,470
okay uh so we don't want to twist um for
energetic alchemical reasons obviously

734
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,480
energetic alchemical reasons obviously
 

735
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,909
energetic alchemical reasons obviously
than spiritual reasons but mechanically

736
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:38,919
than spiritual reasons but mechanically
 

737
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:41,470
than spiritual reasons but mechanically
it's just not powerful okay physically

738
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:41,480
it's just not powerful okay physically
 

739
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,549
it's just not powerful okay physically
it's not powerful so we don't want to

740
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:43,559
it's not powerful so we don't want to
 

741
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:46,190
it's not powerful so we don't want to
twist okay and if you align all these

742
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:46,200
twist okay and if you align all these
 

743
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,669
twist okay and if you align all these
things like I said you won't twist and

744
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:48,679
things like I said you won't twist and
 

745
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,029
things like I said you won't twist and
if you don't twist he moves all at

746
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:52,039
if you don't twist he moves all at
 

747
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,870
if you don't twist he moves all at
once he moves as I move as opposed to he

748
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:55,880
once he moves as I move as opposed to he
 

749
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,269
once he moves as I move as opposed to he
staying there or I moved or whatever so

750
00:26:58,269 --> 00:26:58,279
staying there or I moved or whatever so
 

751
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:01,630
staying there or I moved or whatever so
so sometimes you can twist by having

752
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:01,640
so sometimes you can twist by having
 

753
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:07,549
so sometimes you can twist by having
your bottom half move first and then the

754
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:07,559

 

755
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,310

arms and you can do obviously the

756
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,320
arms and you can do obviously the
 

757
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,830
arms and you can do obviously the
reverse okay so the arms moved and then

758
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:14,840
reverse okay so the arms moved and then
 

759
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,630
reverse okay so the arms moved and then
the body moves last all right we don't

760
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:18,640
the body moves last all right we don't
 

761
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,269
the body moves last all right we don't
want either of those things okay so

762
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:21,279
want either of those things okay so
 

763
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,470
want either of those things okay so
we're going to put some on film that's

764
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:23,480
we're going to put some on film that's
 

765
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,149
we're going to put some on film that's
it's not easy and I think the reason

766
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
it's not easy and I think the reason
 

767
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,590
it's not easy and I think the reason
with my my take you guys bring some

768
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:28,600
with my my take you guys bring some
 

769
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,269
with my my take you guys bring some
awareness to this the reason it's not

770
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:32,279
awareness to this the reason it's not
 

771
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,430
awareness to this the reason it's not
easy is because you have to be able to

772
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:35,440
easy is because you have to be able to
 

773
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,430
easy is because you have to be able to
ground on one

774
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:38,440
ground on one
 

775
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,110
ground on one
foot because you have to be moving okay

776
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,120
foot because you have to be moving okay
 

777
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,029
foot because you have to be moving okay
and usually you're twisting because you

778
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039
and usually you're twisting because you
 

779
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,310
and usually you're twisting because you
want to wait for the weight to get off

780
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320
want to wait for the weight to get off
 

781
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,470
want to wait for the weight to get off
of you because we're

782
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:51,480
of you because we're
 

783
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,870
of you because we're
bracing and um you don't want to wait

784
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:55,880
bracing and um you don't want to wait
 

785
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,470
bracing and um you don't want to wait
entirely so you wait like half way

786
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:58,480
entirely so you wait like half way
 

787
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,630
entirely so you wait like half way
either top or bottom but now the

788
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
either top or bottom but now the
 

789
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,710
either top or bottom but now the
technique is gone okay so um when when

790
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:04,720
technique is gone okay so um when when
 

791
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,350
technique is gone okay so um when when
you're here like this you you're going

792
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,360
you're here like this you you're going
 

793
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,509
you're here like this you you're going
to you have to be on one foot okay and

794
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:11,519
to you have to be on one foot okay and
 

795
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,230
to you have to be on one foot okay and
uh you you can't be like

796
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:14,240
uh you you can't be like
 

797
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,430
uh you you can't be like
whoa and so and you also have to make

798
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,440
whoa and so and you also have to make
 

799
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,950
whoa and so and you also have to make
sure that he can go around you so that

800
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:19,960
sure that he can go around you so that
 

801
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,430
sure that he can go around you so that
you can turn the

802
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,440
you can turn the
 

803
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,269
you can turn the
quaw and all that is difficult it's not

804
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:24,279
quaw and all that is difficult it's not
 

805
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:26,830
quaw and all that is difficult it's not
so easy to do your grounding has to be

806
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:26,840
so easy to do your grounding has to be
 

807
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,789
so easy to do your grounding has to be
higher to be able to to do that okay cuz

808
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:29,799
higher to be able to to do that okay cuz
 

809
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:34,430
higher to be able to to do that okay cuz
there's a lot of weight all right try

810
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:34,440
there's a lot of weight all right try
 

811
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,110
there's a lot of weight all right try
it

812
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,120
it
 

813
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,110
it
some some things to

814
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,120
some some things to
 

815
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,950
