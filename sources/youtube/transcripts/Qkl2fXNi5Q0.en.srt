13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,910

so

14
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
so
 

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,950
so

16
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
perhaps it's better if you listen to his
 

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,189
perhaps it's better if you listen to his
words and than mine

18
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
words and than mine
 

19
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,470
words and than mine
but

20
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
but
 

21
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,069
but
you know we

22
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
you know we
 

23
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,470
you know we
we start aikido

24
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
we start aikido
 

25
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,030
we start aikido
and most when we're beginners we panic

26
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
and most when we're beginners we panic
 

27
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,430
and most when we're beginners we panic
at most things

28
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
at most things
 

29
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,430
at most things
and it takes years

30
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
and it takes years
 

31
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,790
and it takes years
in my opinion

32
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
in my opinion
 

33
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,229
