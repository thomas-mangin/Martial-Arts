overwhelming with Superior Firepower do
you see that it's always better to have

80
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:18,599
you see that it's always better to have
 

81
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,110
you see that it's always better to have
Superior Firepower but to use it in a

82
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
Superior Firepower but to use it in a
 

83
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,430
Superior Firepower but to use it in a
way that you mitigate risk that is much

84
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
way that you mitigate risk that is much
 

85
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,910
way that you mitigate risk that is much
better use of superior Firepower do you

86
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:26,920
better use of superior Firepower do you
 

87
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,150
better use of superior Firepower do you
get it so for example uh

88
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,160
get it so for example uh
 

89
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,229
get it so for example uh
I have I have tanks uh and I can charge

90
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
I have I have tanks uh and I can charge
 

91
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,790
I have I have tanks uh and I can charge
up this beach against all of your uh

92
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:37,800
up this beach against all of your uh
 

93
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,910
up this beach against all of your uh
forces and stuff but it would be much

94
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
forces and stuff but it would be much
 

95
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,030
forces and stuff but it would be much
better if I flank you with these tanks

96

do you see that and
 

99
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,270
do you see that and
so even in that context you mitigate for

100
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,280
so even in that context you mitigate for
 

101
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,869
so even in that context you mitigate for
the reduction of risk okay so that's

102
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
the reduction of risk okay so that's
 

103
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,990
the reduction of risk okay so that's
non-c contestation is how you mitigate

00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,000
non-c contestation is how you mitigate
 

105
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,509

form it is in a way a kind of
 

443
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,069
form it is in a way a kind of
competition but you can only compete

with the two sides of the form do you

446
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:07,880
with the two sides of the form do you
 

447
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,269
with the two sides of the form do you
understand okay

understand okay
so some of the ways it comes up at first

450
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
so some of the ways it comes up at first
 

451
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,550
so some of the ways it comes up at first
is you're going to increase the speed

452
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
is you're going to increase the speed
 

453
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,230
is you're going to increase the speed
and the strength of the moves okay but

454
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
and the strength of the moves okay but
 

455
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,910
and the strength of the moves okay but
you're going to find that when you get

456
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
you're going to find that when you get
 

457
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,629
you're going to find that when you get
with someone skilled that can actually

458
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:23,639
with someone skilled that can actually
 

459
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,150
with someone skilled that can actually
do the farm um you're going to need

460
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,160
do the farm um you're going to need
 

461
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,670
do the farm um you're going to need
these other aspects you're going to need

462
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
these other aspects you're going to need
 

463
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,590
these other aspects you're going to need
that mystical State you're going to need

464
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
that mystical State you're going to need
 

465
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,269
that mystical State you're going to need
the II and CQ do you get it because

466
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:34,279
the II and CQ do you get it because
 

467
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:40,110
the II and CQ do you get it because
you'll just lose over and over and over

468
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:40,120

 

469
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,790

again so again to summarize you're both

470
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
again so again to summarize you're both
 

471
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,790
again so again to summarize you're both
competing against each other but with

472
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:47,800
competing against each other but with
 

473
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,629
competing against each other but with
the form with the goal of knocking the

474
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
the form with the goal of knocking the
 

475
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,430
the form with the goal of knocking the
other one out of the form okay and this

476
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:54,440
other one out of the form okay and this
 

477
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,389
other one out of the form okay and this
this requires that you start freeing

478
00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:57,399
this requires that you start freeing
 

479
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,430
this requires that you start freeing
yourself from the form

480
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
yourself from the form
 

481
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,910
yourself from the form
and that is going to

482
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:00,920
and that is going to
 

483
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,269
and that is going to
require that your first mind aspect is

484
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
require that your first mind aspect is
 

485
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,150
require that your first mind aspect is
deconstructed okay some other things

486
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
deconstructed okay some other things
 

487
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,030
deconstructed okay some other things
come

488
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
come
 

489
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,949
come
up that don't come up in kihon waza if

490
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
up that don't come up in kihon waza if
 

491
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,150
up that don't come up in kihon waza if
you're doing kihon waza

492
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,160
you're doing kihon waza
 

493
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,990
you're doing kihon waza
incorrectly

incorrectly
 

495
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,829
incorrectly
so when you're in the second mind

496
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:20,839
so when you're in the second mind
 

497
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,870
so when you're in the second mind
aspect there cannot be fearing

00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,000
deflections uh
 

671
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,789
deflections uh
always appear to

672
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:00,799
always appear to
 

673
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,110
always appear to
work you see because we always imagine

674
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,120
work you see because we always imagine
 

675
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,029
work you see because we always imagine
that we're strong enough to do it but in

676
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
that we're strong enough to do it but in
 

677
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,710
that we're strong enough to do it but in
in weapons work angle of deflections are

678
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:09,720
in weapons work angle of deflections are
 

679
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,990
in weapons work angle of deflections are
too slow they're way too slow it's not

680
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
too slow they're way too slow it's not
 

681
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,950
too slow they're way too slow it's not
just that you if as I always say if

682
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
just that you if as I always say if
 

683
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,070
just that you if as I always say if
you're strong enough it'll work it but

684
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,080
you're strong enough it'll work it but
 

685
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,190
you're strong enough it'll work it but
there's always like as Weapons aren't

686
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
there's always like as Weapons aren't
 

687
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,190
there's always like as Weapons aren't
involved

688
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
involved
 

689
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,590
involved
okay so you're going to find out that

690
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,600
okay so you're going to find out that
 

691
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,710
okay so you're going to find out that
your your angle deflections just they

692
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:27,720
your your angle deflections just they
 

693
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,029
your your angle deflections just they
don't work not only because they might

694
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:30,039
don't work not only because they might
 

695
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,830
don't work not only because they might
not be strong enough once someone is

696
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
not be strong enough once someone is
 

697
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,710
not be strong enough once someone is
trying to knock you out of the

698
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:33,720
trying to knock you out of the
 

699
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,190
trying to knock you out of the
form but they will always be too slow

700
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,200
form but they will always be too slow
 

701
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,029
form but they will always be too slow
they're always too slow okay you're also

702
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
they're always too slow okay you're also
 

703
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:41,990
they're always too slow okay you're also
going to

704
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
going to
 

705
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,630
going to
see um that the positioning and weight

706
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
see um that the positioning and weight
 

707
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,669
see um that the positioning and weight
distribution of your body is not as

708
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:50,679
distribution of your body is not as
 

709
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,990
distribution of your body is not as
arbitrary as you once thought it was

710
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
arbitrary as you once thought it was
 

711
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,149
arbitrary as you once thought it was
because it will

712
00:18:56,149 --> 00:18:56,159
because it will
 

713
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:59,350
because it will
delay between the moves

714
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
delay between the moves
 

715
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,390
delay between the moves
okay and if you can't do your attack in

716
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:03,400
okay and if you can't do your attack in
 

717
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,630
okay and if you can't do your attack in
the middle of my attack you're not doing

718
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
the middle of my attack you're not doing
 

719
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,909
the middle of my attack you're not doing
your attack the other guy is going to

720
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:08,919
your attack the other guy is going to
 

721
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:13,230
your attack the other guy is going to
knock you out of the form okay now you

722
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:13,240
knock you out of the form okay now you
 

723
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,270
knock you out of the form okay now you
shouldn't let the word

724
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
shouldn't let the word
 

725
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,630
shouldn't let the word
intensified only mean power and speed it

726
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
intensified only mean power and speed it
 

727
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,669
intensified only mean power and speed it
doesn't mean that so as for example if I

728
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:21,679
doesn't mean that so as for example if I
 

729
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,590
doesn't mean that so as for example if I
slow your move down enough I don't have

730
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:24,600
slow your move down enough I don't have
 

731
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,549
slow your move down enough I don't have
to move that fast do you get it and if I

732
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
to move that fast do you get it and if I
 

733
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,909
to move that fast do you get it and if I
am trying to move faster than you I

734
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
am trying to move faster than you I
 

735
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,909
am trying to move faster than you I
might not slow your move down at all and

736
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
might not slow your move down at all and
 

737
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,390
might not slow your move down at all and
then in terms of relative speed I'm

738
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
then in terms of relative speed I'm
 

739
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,990
then in terms of relative speed I'm
faster than you you see so I wouldn't go

740
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,000
faster than you you see so I wouldn't go
 

741
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,510
faster than you you see so I wouldn't go
with uh just trying to speed up on power

742
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:42,520
with uh just trying to speed up on power
 

743
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,669
with uh just trying to speed up on power
uh it's all about good technique

744
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
uh it's all about good technique
 

745
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,950
uh it's all about good technique
okay so let's uh let me just demonstrate

746
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:48,960
okay so let's uh let me just demonstrate
 

747
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,110
okay so let's uh let me just demonstrate
and you'll see I'm not going my athletic

748
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120
and you'll see I'm not going my athletic
 

749
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,830
and you'll see I'm not going my athletic
fastest because it's still a training

750
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:54,840
fastest because it's still a training
 

751
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,430
fastest because it's still a training
environment after intensified Kona we

752
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:58,440
environment after intensified Kona we
 

753
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,510

technique you do you I do me got it so
 

777
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,029
technique you do you I do me got it so
after intensifying kihan we still have

778
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,039
after intensifying kihan we still have
 

779
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,029
after intensifying kihan we still have
play and we still have Gaza moving us

into uh
 

783
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,590
into uh
Takami okay so intensified Kon is still

00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:48,600
Takami okay so intensified Kon is still
 

785
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,390

a ritualized so to speak training
 

787
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,029
a ritualized so to speak training
environment got it um so that's why you

788
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:57,039
environment got it um so that's why you
 

789
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,830
environment got it um so that's why you
are restricted to defeat with the form

790
00:20:59,830 --> 00:20:59,840
are restricted to defeat with the form
 

791
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,789
are restricted to defeat with the form
and not be defeated with the form so if

792
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:02,799
and not be defeated with the form so if
 

793
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,990
and not be defeated with the form so if
you start going off the rails that is

794
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,000
you start going off the rails that is
 

795
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,750
you start going off the rails that is
we're going to you're not you can't do

we're going to you're not you can't do
 

797
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,190
we're going to you're not you can't do
it it won't do what it needs to do okay

798
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,200
it it won't do what it needs to do okay
 

799
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,669
it it won't do what it needs to do okay
all right so I'll demonstrate

800
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:14,679
all right so I'll demonstrate
 

801
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:17,830
all right so I'll demonstrate
some okay so we're we're again we're

802
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
some okay so we're we're again we're
 

803
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,750
some okay so we're we're again we're
going to now take we did the AI ritual

804
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:20,760
going to now take we did the AI ritual
 

805
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,549
going to now take we did the AI ritual
of Kor and we did an embryonic so I came

806
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:24,559
of Kor and we did an embryonic so I came
 

807
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:32,510
of Kor and we did an embryonic so I came
here he came there and then I came here

808
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:32,520

 

809
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,510

and some of the things you're going to

810
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:34,520
and some of the things you're going to
 

811
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,390
and some of the things you're going to
notice is you see there's an angle of

812
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,400
notice is you see there's an angle of
 

813
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,070
notice is you see there's an angle of
deflection in there did you see it so I

814
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,080
deflection in there did you see it so I
 

815
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,149
deflection in there did you see it so I
came here boom and again that's not

816
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:43,159
came here boom and again that's not
 

817
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:44,590
came here boom and again that's not
going to

818
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:44,600
going to
 

819
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,029
going to
work so I had to get rid of the angle

820
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
work so I had to get rid of the angle
 

821
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,470
work so I had to get rid of the angle
deflection that's why I called that

822
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,480
deflection that's why I called that
 

823
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,029
deflection that's why I called that
embryonic because that's not Maia tush

824
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:52,039
embryonic because that's not Maia tush
 

825
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:57,029
embryonic because that's not Maia tush
okay so I do the

826
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039

 

827
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,830

move

828
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:58,840
move
 

829
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,909
move
