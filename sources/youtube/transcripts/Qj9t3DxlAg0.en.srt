1259
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:52,550

move so we can do the first

1260
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:52,560

 

1261
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:57,269

01:09:22,669 --> 01:09:22,679

 

1275
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:26,990

okay so we're here pressure off on the

1276
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:27,000
okay so we're here pressure off on the
 

1277
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,910
okay so we're here pressure off on the

1281
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:46,470

you pressure off move

1282
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:46,480

 

1283
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,070

around

1284
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:48,080
around
 

1285
01:09:48,080 --> 01:10:07,830
around
okay try

1286
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:07,840

 

1287
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,750

you're still going to do the first that

1288
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:09,760
you're still going to do the first that
 

1289
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,709
you're still going to do the first that
the the tightening on the

1290
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:11,719
the the tightening on the
 

1291
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:17,350
the the tightening on the
circle then you let it

1292
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:17,360

 

1293

1299
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:31,030
shoulder they'll Circle CC around with
you why it's a simple answer why will

1300
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:31,040
you why it's a simple answer why will
 

1301
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:39,149
you why it's a simple answer why will
they circle around with

1302
01:10:39,149 --> 01:10:39,159

 

1303
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:43,590
