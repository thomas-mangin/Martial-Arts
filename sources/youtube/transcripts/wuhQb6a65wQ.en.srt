00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,830

here another stuff so it's my front foot

152
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
here another stuff so it's my front foot
 

153
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,029
here another stuff so it's my front foot
is open

154
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039

159
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,870

so

160
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
so
 

161
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,189

speed comes through everything being

162
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,909
speed comes through everything being
correct and

164
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
correct and
 

165
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,070
correct and
you're having body timing don't

166
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
