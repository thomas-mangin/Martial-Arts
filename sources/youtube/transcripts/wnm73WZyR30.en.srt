00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:22,070

[Applause]

2
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080

 

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,189

so when I move

4
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
so when I move
 

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,310
so when I move
back he comes in I bring my face with me

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
back he comes in I bring my face with me
 

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,510
back he comes in I bring my face with me
so I can move back

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520

 

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,069

in don't move back foot only is now you

10
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
in don't move back foot only is now you
 

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,389
in don't move back foot only is now you
can't get back

12
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:41,399
can't get back
 

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,709
can't get back
in and you didn't really

14
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719

 

15
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:55,029

leave so as he

16
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039

 

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,270

goes and this strategy is something that

18
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
goes and this strategy is something that
 

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,750
goes and this strategy is something that
you you using your uh pugilistic so for

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
you you using your uh pugilistic so for
 

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,390
you you using your uh pugilistic so for
example um I'll have he's measuring me

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
example um I'll have he's measuring me
 

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,670
example um I'll have he's measuring me
and he'll measure off where my chest is

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:10,680
and he'll measure off where my chest is
 

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,550
and he'll measure off where my chest is
and my front foot and people get in the

26
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:13,560
and my front foot and people get in the
 

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,950
and my front foot and people get in the
assumption that my back foot is where it

28
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:16,960
assumption that my back foot is where it
 

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,550
assumption that my back foot is where it
is okay but you can start faking this by

30
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
is okay but you can start faking this by
 

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,310
is okay but you can start faking this by
bringing that back foot up so you do

32
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:23,320
bringing that back foot up so you do
 

33
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,749
bringing that back foot up so you do
different things like for example let's

34
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
different things like for example let's
 

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,310
different things like for example let's
say he throws some combination and I'm

36
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
say he throws some combination and I'm
 

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,630
say he throws some combination and I'm
kind of here right and instead of

38
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
kind of here right and instead of
 

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,389
kind of here right and instead of
putting that foot back there me do it

40
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:34,399
putting that foot back there me do it
 

41
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,109
putting that foot back there me do it
again right I moved it here and so now

42
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:38,119
again right I moved it here and so now
 

43
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,990
again right I moved it here and so now
when he goes back to his base I really

44
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,000
when he goes back to his base I really
 

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,069
when he goes back to his base I really
have a lot of range that I can come in

46
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
have a lot of range that I can come in
 

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,149
have a lot of range that I can come in
okay

48
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
okay
 

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,749
okay
so this is very much like a a fake I'm

50
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:50,759
so this is very much like a a fake I'm
 

51
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,149
so this is very much like a a fake I'm
not trying to go and get out of the way

52
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:53,159
not trying to go and get out of the way
 

53
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,350
not trying to go and get out of the way
like that I'm faking how much more I can

54
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:56,360
like that I'm faking how much more I can
 

55
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,830
like that I'm faking how much more I can
come back in

56
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840
come back in
 

57
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,109
come back in
okay

58
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
okay
 

59
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,709
okay
home fake here and now now you can go

60
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
home fake here and now now you can go
 

61
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,870
home fake here and now now you can go
all that way stay there you can go all

62
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:07,880
all that way stay there you can go all
 

63
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,790
all that way stay there you can go all
that way

64
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800

 

65
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,150

back face

66
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,160
back face
 

67
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,470
back face
out all the way back

68
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
out all the way back
 

69
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,550
out all the way back
in face

70
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
in face
 

71
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,430
in face
out all the way

72
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:26,440

 

73
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:53,070

back all the way back okay try that

74
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,080

 

75
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,190

nothing's as easy as it looks okay um so

76
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,200
nothing's as easy as it looks okay um so
 

77
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,110
nothing's as easy as it looks okay um so
when we're here he goes in and I goes

78
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,120
when we're here he goes in and I goes
 

79
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,830
when we're here he goes in and I goes
back I don't want my line of

80
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
back I don't want my line of
 

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,990
back I don't want my line of
gravity to move in the middle of my body

82
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,000
gravity to move in the middle of my body
 

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,589
gravity to move in the middle of my body
I don't want it to go like

84
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
I don't want it to go like
 

85
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,190
I don't want it to go like
that going boom

86
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,200
that going boom
 

87
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,670
that going boom
boom in okay CU we know if he gives me

88
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:20,680
boom in okay CU we know if he gives me
 

89
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,750
boom in okay CU we know if he gives me
pressure you see and I try to I can't

90
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
pressure you see and I try to I can't
 

91
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,509
pressure you see and I try to I can't
push that CU I'm not ground vect I'm

92
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:28,519
push that CU I'm not ground vect I'm
 

93
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,550
push that CU I'm not ground vect I'm
sort of falling into

94
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:31,560
sort of falling into
 

95
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,589
sort of falling into
okay

96
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
okay
 

97
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,149
okay
instead I have to ground the back foot

98
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:37,159
instead I have to ground the back foot
 

99
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,270
instead I have to ground the back foot
the foot will go out you see I

100
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
the foot will go out you see I
 

101
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,030
the foot will go out you see I
shift and then the foot comes

102
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,040
shift and then the foot comes
 

103
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,949
shift and then the foot comes
in so in this work nice and slow

104
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
in so in this work nice and slow
 

105
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,750
in so in this work nice and slow
one no you're not his he can keep

106
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:54,760
one no you're not his he can keep
 

107
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,030
one no you're not his he can keep
pressure on my weapon and actually keep

108
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
pressure on my weapon and actually keep
 

109
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,710
pressure on my weapon and actually keep
me out

110
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
me out
 

111
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,030
me out
okay I'll do the mistake again

112
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
okay I'll do the mistake again
 

113
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,030
okay I'll do the mistake again
one

114
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
one
 

115
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,110
one
two okay instead

116
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,120
two okay instead
 

117
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:17,150
two okay instead
slow one ground ground foot out boom

118
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:17,160

 

119
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,950

in

120
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960

 

121
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,990

mistake correct boom ground foot slide

122
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
mistake correct boom ground foot slide
 

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,670
mistake correct boom ground foot slide
body comes in

124
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:34,680

 

125
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,189

mistake it's not it's yeah you probably

126
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:38,199
mistake it's not it's yeah you probably
 

127
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,469
mistake it's not it's yeah you probably
will focus on the Lurch step but the

128
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:41,479
will focus on the Lurch step but the
 

129
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:44,469
will focus on the Lurch step but the
problem is that my Center gravity goes

130
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
problem is that my Center gravity goes
 

131
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,350
problem is that my Center gravity goes
up under pressure right here is where it

132
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
up under pressure right here is where it
 

133
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,590
up under pressure right here is where it
gets caught I'll never get back down

134
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:52,600

 

135
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,150

okay the correct way ground

136
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:57,160
okay the correct way ground
 

137
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:04,270
okay the correct way ground
slide comes the back foot okay

138
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,280

 

139
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,749

boom okay try it

140
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
boom okay try it
 

141
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,550
boom okay try it
again okay

142
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:09,560
again okay
 

143
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,430
again okay
so I know I'm going to go

144
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
so I know I'm going to go
 

145
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,550
so I know I'm going to go
back right I know I'm going to go back

146
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
back right I know I'm going to go back
 

147
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,590
back right I know I'm going to go back
and then I know I'm going to go forward

148
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:18,600
and then I know I'm going to go forward
 

149
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,670
and then I know I'm going to go forward
and I know when I go forward I can't go

150
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:20,680
and I know when I go forward I can't go
 

151
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,350
and I know when I go forward I can't go
like that so I know I have to ground the

152
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
like that so I know I have to ground the
 

153
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,430
like that so I know I have to ground the
back foot so as I go back I ground and I

154
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
back foot so as I go back I ground and I
 

155
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,990
back foot so as I go back I ground and I
come in it's one one move

156
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,000

 

157
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,749

down so you can see it's

158
00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:36,759
down so you can see it's
 

159
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,469
down so you can see it's
reversing this foot is going to ground

160
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:39,479
reversing this foot is going to ground
 

161
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:45,070
reversing this foot is going to ground
as I go back you see I drop I push back

162
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,080
as I go back you see I drop I push back
 

163
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,909
as I go back you see I drop I push back
I drop I push forward so there's a

164
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
I drop I push forward so there's a
 

165
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,870
I drop I push forward so there's a
circle here

166
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880

 

167
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,710

Bo so instead of this straight back

168
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:57,720
Bo so instead of this straight back
 

169
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,870
Bo so instead of this straight back
straight P you see that

170
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
straight P you see that

okay I don't I don't have to go in and

342
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
okay I don't I don't have to go in and
 

343
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,389
okay I don't I don't have to go in and

UK the desire to not be overpowered get
 

359
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,590
UK the desire to not be overpowered get
rid of it all okay stick to the

360
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:50,600
rid of it all okay stick to the
 

361
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,269
rid of it all okay stick to the
energetics all right let's go into the

362
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
energetics all right let's go into the
 

363
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,710
energetics all right let's go into the
yin and yangong aspects of this maneuver

364
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:55,720
yin and yangong aspects of this maneuver
 

365
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,629
yin and yangong aspects of this maneuver
okay so on the embryonic all embryonic

366
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:58,639
okay so on the embryonic all embryonic
 

367
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,629
okay so on the embryonic all embryonic
timing

368
00:13:59,629 --> 00:13:59,639
timing
 

369
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,590
timing
are going to be exaggerations okay um so

370
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
are going to be exaggerations okay um so
 

371
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,189
are going to be exaggerations okay um so
for example he's going to get to F you

372
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:07,199
for example he's going to get to F you
 

373
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,870
for example he's going to get to F you
see he got to

374
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:09,880
see he got to
 

375
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,269
see he got to
Fong and I have to go to F Yen so I'm on

376
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
Fong and I have to go to F Yen so I'm on
 

377
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,030
Fong and I have to go to F Yen so I'm on
this side so if he pushes down it slides

378
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,040
this side so if he pushes down it slides
 

379
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,310
this side so if he pushes down it slides
up I'm not lifting up on his weapon

380
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:23,320
up I'm not lifting up on his weapon
 

381
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,110
up I'm not lifting up on his weapon
because he'd be pushing down on my

382
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
because he'd be pushing down on my
 

383
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,990
because he'd be pushing down on my
weapon you see and I'm not in that cross

384
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
weapon you see and I'm not in that cross
 

385
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,230
weapon you see and I'm not in that cross
there camera so you can see it where I'm

386
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:31,240
there camera so you can see it where I'm
 

387
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,670
there camera so you can see it where I'm
underneath 90 at the 90 underneath

388
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:34,680
underneath 90 at the 90 underneath
 

389
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,470
underneath 90 at the 90 underneath
because that's where his weight is I had

390
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:37,480
because that's where his weight is I had
 

391
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,670
because that's where his weight is I had
to rotate to the other side of it at a

392
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
to rotate to the other side of it at a
 

393
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,990
to rotate to the other side of it at a
minimum that 45 so that he finds that

394
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,000
minimum that 45 so that he finds that
 

395
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,030
minimum that 45 so that he finds that
angle okay do you understand okay but if

396
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
angle okay do you understand okay but if
 

397
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,670
angle okay do you understand okay but if
you pay

398
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:48,680
you pay
 

399
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,069
you pay
attention when you get to the

400
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:51,079
attention when you get to the
 

401
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:54,389
attention when you get to the
application if you do that he comes in

402
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:54,399
application if you do that he comes in
 

403
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,030
application if you do that he comes in
and you do that you now aren't doing

404
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
and you do that you now aren't doing
 

405
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,310
and you do that you now aren't doing
your attack in the midst of his attack

406
00:14:59,310 --> 00:14:59,320
your attack in the midst of his attack
 

407
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,269
your attack in the midst of his attack
you have to wait so that's that doesn't

408
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
you have to wait so that's that doesn't
 

409
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,550
you have to wait so that's that doesn't
make sense that never works martially

410
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:03,560
make sense that never works martially
 

411
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,389
make sense that never works martially
your attack is in the midst of his

412
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:05,399
your attack is in the midst of his
 

413
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,670
your attack is in the midst of his
attack so as as he goes over it's

414
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:10,680
attack so as as he goes over it's
 

415
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,550
attack so as as he goes over it's
already been

416
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
already been
 

417
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,870
already been
Yin okay and so now what I do is this

418
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:17,880
Yin okay and so now what I do is this
 

419
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,829
Yin okay and so now what I do is this
angle is different than he had before

420
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:20,839
angle is different than he had before
 

421
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:24,550
angle is different than he had before
and so now I can come straight in and

422
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
and so now I can come straight in and
 

423
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,710
and so now I can come straight in and
hit it so

424
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:27,720
hit it so
 

425
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,749
hit it so
embryonically yes yes architecturally it

426
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:30,759
embryonically yes yes architecturally it
 

427
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,710
embryonically yes yes architecturally it
looks like

428
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
looks like
 

429
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,749
looks like
this but

430
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:34,759
this but
 

431
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,829
this but
energetically y to

432
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
energetically y to
 

433
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,749
energetically y to
Yin okay is the opening so here you go y

434
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:42,759
Yin okay is the opening so here you go y
 

435
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,509
Yin okay is the opening so here you go y
to Yin and it's there and so the

436
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:46,519
to Yin and it's there and so the
 

437
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,069
to Yin and it's there and so the
difference is you stop functioning as a

438
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
difference is you stop functioning as a
 

439
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,629
difference is you stop functioning as a
practitioner architecturally and you

440
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
practitioner architecturally and you
 

441
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,949
practitioner architecturally and you
start functionally energetically as soon

442
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:55,959
start functionally energetically as soon
 

443
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:59,670
start functionally energetically as soon
as you feel his Yin you're going to come

444
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
as you feel his Yin you're going to come
 

445
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,790
as you feel his Yin you're going to come
down it you have your Yin opening for Ed

446
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,800
down it you have your Yin opening for Ed
 

447
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,069
down it you have your Yin opening for Ed
okay so uh I don't want you to start

448
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
okay so uh I don't want you to start
 

449
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,910
okay so uh I don't want you to start
doing a different technique you see I

450
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
doing a different technique you see I
 

451
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,629
doing a different technique you see I
pushed against you okay there is a

452
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:10,639
pushed against you okay there is a
 

453
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,269
pushed against you okay there is a
slight yield boom and then in it's just

454
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:14,279
slight yield boom and then in it's just
 

455
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,670
slight yield boom and then in it's just
smaller and the same way don't go here

456
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:18,680
smaller and the same way don't go here
 

457
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,189
smaller and the same way don't go here
that's now you have the unmarshal timing

458
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:22,199
that's now you have the unmarshal timing
 

459
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:27,230
that's now you have the unmarshal timing
okay there is a slide W yield an in and

460
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:27,240
okay there is a slide W yield an in and
 

461
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,990
okay there is a slide W yield an in and
it's it is energ ically the same opening

462
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,000
it's it is energ ically the same opening
 

463
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,110
it's it is energ ically the same opening
just not exaggerated

464
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,120

 

465
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,949

walk you can see how I'm not really

466
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
walk you can see how I'm not really
 

467
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,550
walk you can see how I'm not really
pushing on his sword it's just there the

468
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
pushing on his sword it's just there the
 

469
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,629
pushing on his sword it's just there the
the opening is

470
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
the opening is
 

471
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,389
the opening is
there so move and just falls into that

472
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
there so move and just falls into that
 

473
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,629
there so move and just falls into that
place I just follow it okay so uh let's

474
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:51,639
place I just follow it okay so uh let's
 

475
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:54,230
place I just follow it okay so uh let's
do that let's let's understand at the

476
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,240
do that let's let's understand at the
 

477
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,189
do that let's let's understand at the
application Level I'm more obeying the

478
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
application Level I'm more obeying the
 

479
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,870
application Level I'm more obeying the
energetics and not the architectural

480
00:16:59,870 --> 00:16:59,880
energetics and not the architectural
 

481
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,430
energetics and not the architectural
design of the embryonic form okay all

482
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:02,440
design of the embryonic form okay all
 

483
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,870
design of the embryonic form okay all
right try it

484
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:03,880
right try it
 

485
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,870
right try it
again in the move there's an touching

486
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:07,880
again in the move there's an touching
 

487
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,510
again in the move there's an touching
okay so we go and we come back boom it's

488
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,520
okay so we go and we come back boom it's
 

489
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,630
okay so we go and we come back boom it's
right there okay uh you always have if

490
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
right there okay uh you always have if
 

491
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,189
right there okay uh you always have if
you're going to thrust someone you have

492
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:16,199
you're going to thrust someone you have
 

493
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,829
you're going to thrust someone you have
to stabilize the target so that it adds

494
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:18,839
to stabilize the target so that it adds
 

495
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,470
to stabilize the target so that it adds
resistance to the piercing as opposed to

496
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:21,480
resistance to the piercing as opposed to
 

497
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,750
resistance to the piercing as opposed to
he's up and let's say he's stumbling

498
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
he's up and let's say he's stumbling
 

499
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,870
he's up and let's say he's stumbling
backwards then there's not going to be

500
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:25,880
backwards then there's not going to be

going to shift weight to a single Vector

604
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:25,880
going to shift weight to a single Vector
 

605
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,630
going to shift weight to a single Vector
on the back going make that heavy

606
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:29,640
on the back going make that heavy
 

607
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,230
on the back going make that heavy
it'll come back forward around and then

608

623
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,149
foot and he he can try to lift it and
you can feel my weight is on it do you

624
00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:57,159
you can feel my weight is on it do you
 

625
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:00,270
you can feel my weight is on it do you
see okay and then as I come forward

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:56,230
Vector okay and this is what I'm doing
so my my chi flow is in many ways like

662
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
so my my chi flow is in many ways like
 

663
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,070
so my my chi flow is in many ways like
gravitationally influenced by my center

664
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,080
gravitationally influenced by my center
 

665
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,549
gravitationally influenced by my center
of gravity okay and so as I'm moving my

666
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:02,559
of gravity okay and so as I'm moving my
 

667
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,710
of gravity okay and so as I'm moving my
body around my chi and my mind will

668
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:05,720
body around my chi and my mind will
 

669
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,909
body around my chi and my mind will
follow this pattern with my weight and

670
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:08,919
follow this pattern with my weight and
 

671
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:11,990
follow this pattern with my weight and
this is the concentric tie between the

672
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
this is the concentric tie between the
 

673
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,029
this is the concentric tie between the
physical and the energetic okay so as

674
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:15,039
physical and the energetic okay so as
 

675
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,830
physical and the energetic okay so as
we're going here we just now have more

676
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
we're going here we just now have more
 

677
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,029
we're going here we just now have more
gross movements but I have to feel the

678
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:22,039
gross movements but I have to feel the
 

679
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:26,549
gross movements but I have to feel the
same thing inside my toen so yes I have

680
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:26,559
same thing inside my toen so yes I have
 

681
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,510
same thing inside my toen so yes I have
to take a step but weight will shift

682
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:28,520
to take a step but weight will shift
 

683
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,830
to take a step but weight will shift
shift right and the chi will drop do you

684
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
shift right and the chi will drop do you
 

685
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,230
shift right and the chi will drop do you
understand the chi will drop who it'll

686
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,240
understand the chi will drop who it'll
 

687
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,149
understand the chi will drop who it'll
compress I'll come back forward boom and

688
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:37,159
compress I'll come back forward boom and
 

689
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:39,549
compress I'll come back forward boom and
the chi will drop again do you guys get

690
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:39,559
the chi will drop again do you guys get
 

691
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,070
the chi will drop again do you guys get
it and you're you're basically doing the

692
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,080
it and you're you're basically doing the
 

693
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,350
it and you're you're basically doing the
boat exercise which is the spiral

694
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
boat exercise which is the spiral
 

695
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,909
boat exercise which is the spiral
rotating of the lower tonden field on

696
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:47,919
rotating of the lower tonden field on
 

697
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,269
rotating of the lower tonden field on
one side of the body okay you're

698
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:50,279
one side of the body okay you're
 

699
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:52,350
one side of the body okay you're
basically doing that so that would make

700
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:52,360
basically doing that so that would make
 

701
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,909
basically doing that so that would make
this wrong do you guys see that I'm just

702
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
this wrong do you guys see that I'm just
 

703
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,310
this wrong do you guys see that I'm just
I'm just up here my

704
00:22:59,310 --> 00:22:59,320
I'm just up here my
 

705
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:11,510
I'm just up here my
energy and my mind must sink sink sink

706
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520

 

707
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:27,230

okay and I can make that smaller and

708
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:27,240

 

709
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,230

Tighter h

710
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240

 

711
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,149

okay let's try it so um if we look at

712
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
okay let's try it so um if we look at
 

713
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,710
okay let's try it so um if we look at
Keon was you kind of have an energy CU

714
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:39,720
Keon was you kind of have an energy CU
 

715
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,549
Keon was you kind of have an energy CU
which in this case would be the the

716
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:41,559
which in this case would be the the
 

717
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:44,510
which in this case would be the the
initial ski okay it would be that and

718
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:44,520
initial ski okay it would be that and
 

719
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,590
initial ski okay it would be that and
then you're going to have your Yin yield

720
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:46,600
then you're going to have your Yin yield
 

721
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,830
then you're going to have your Yin yield
catch right you're going to follow your

722
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
catch right you're going to follow your
 

723
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,230
catch right you're going to follow your
energetic rules and uh boom that

724
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240
energetic rules and uh boom that
 

725
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,750
energetic rules and uh boom that
technique is done that that's a killing

726
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:54,760
technique is done that that's a killing
 

727
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,029
technique is done that that's a killing
blow you see that so that that's the end

728
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
blow you see that so that that's the end
 

729
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,830
blow you see that so that that's the end
of the technique uh in Chima sets you

730
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
of the technique uh in Chima sets you
 

731
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,510
of the technique uh in Chima sets you
have these counters do you get it and so

732
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:02,520
have these counters do you get it and so
 

733
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,549
have these counters do you get it and so
it's a good thing I this is why we do it

734
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:05,559
it's a good thing I this is why we do it
 

735
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:09,350
it's a good thing I this is why we do it
and I want you to understand it um it

736
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
and I want you to understand it um it
 

737
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,669
and I want you to understand it um it
helps you understand uh how to find the

738
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
helps you understand uh how to find the
 

739
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,430
helps you understand uh how to find the
yin space the absorption and contact

740
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,440
yin space the absorption and contact
 

741
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,630
yin space the absorption and contact
from different starting angles than like

742
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:19,640
from different starting angles than like
 

743
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,590
from different starting angles than like
seon or something which is like a

744
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
seon or something which is like a
 

745
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,710
seon or something which is like a
classic starting angle just like

746
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:23,720
classic starting angle just like
 

747
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,470
classic starting angle just like
katatori is a classic starting angle

748
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:27,480
katatori is a classic starting angle
 

749
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,870
katatori is a classic starting angle
okay versus is like sometimes we do

750
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:29,880
okay versus is like sometimes we do
 

751
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,310
okay versus is like sometimes we do
techniques from the clinch right or

752
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
techniques from the clinch right or
 

753
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,110
techniques from the clinch right or
sometimes we do handcut wasall and he

754
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,120
sometimes we do handcut wasall and he
 

755
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,909
sometimes we do handcut wasall and he
can counter and do all all kinds of

756
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:35,919
can counter and do all all kinds of
 

757
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,230
can counter and do all all kinds of
things and then you have to find your uh

758
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:39,240
things and then you have to find your uh
 

759
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,029
things and then you have to find your uh
iido elements from that starting point

760
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:42,039
iido elements from that starting point
 

761
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:47,350
iido elements from that starting point
not the classic uh entry Cube okay uh so

762
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,360
not the classic uh entry Cube okay uh so
 

763
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,549
not the classic uh entry Cube okay uh so
this set continues and so for example uh

764
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:51,559
this set continues and so for example uh
 

765
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:54,389
this set continues and so for example uh
he goes I'm doing my thing he's going to

766
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:54,399
he goes I'm doing my thing he's going to
 

767
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:57,110
he goes I'm doing my thing he's going to
yield and come around and we'll keep

768
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
yield and come around and we'll keep
 

769
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,909
yield and come around and we'll keep
that other foot forward

770
00:24:59,909 --> 00:24:59,919
that other foot forward
 

771
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,549
that other foot forward
cuz it's going to be fast okay so he

772
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
cuz it's going to be fast okay so he
 

773
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,909
cuz it's going to be fast okay so he
goes W he's going to do it now to me and

774
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:06,919
goes W he's going to do it now to me and
 

775
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:08,669
goes W he's going to do it now to me and
you can feel that you lifted my sword

776
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:08,679
you can feel that you lifted my sword
 

777
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:11,950
you can feel that you lifted my sword
little okay he has the same Yin yield

778
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:11,960
little okay he has the same Yin yield
 

779
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,110
little okay he has the same Yin yield
energetics so boom boom better you want

780
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,120
energetics so boom boom better you want
 

781
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,630
energetics so boom boom better you want
my tip to fall into empty space boom no

782
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:21,640
my tip to fall into empty space boom no
 

783
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,950
my tip to fall into empty space boom no
switch rolls okay I'll show you the two

784
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
switch rolls okay I'll show you the two
 

785
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,110
switch rolls okay I'll show you the two
two uh errors okay so one

786
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,120
two uh errors okay so one
 

787
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,310
two uh errors okay so one
right we do

788
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,320

 

789
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,190

sorry one you feel it there's lifting

790
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,200
sorry one you feel it there's lifting
 

791
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,029
sorry one you feel it there's lifting
there okay you you'd actually overpower

792
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:39,039
there okay you you'd actually overpower
 

793
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,669
there okay you you'd actually overpower
that thing and then the other one is

794
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:42,679
that thing and then the other one is
 

795
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:47,669
that thing and then the other one is
that uh one and you come off okay again

796
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:47,679
that uh one and you come off okay again
 

797
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,990
that uh one and you come off okay again
I'm going to let you move so move he

798
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm going to let you move so move he
 

799
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,029
I'm going to let you move so move he
moves my

800
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:54,039

 

801
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:58,310

sword one he moves my sword very much

802
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
sword one he moves my sword very much
 

803
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,470
sword one he moves my sword very much
just like this one he moved my sword you

804
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:01,480
just like this one he moved my sword you
 

805
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,950
just like this one he moved my sword you
see you move my

806
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:02,960
see you move my
 

807
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:15,470
see you move my
sword I let your move my sword so

808
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:15,480

 

809
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,470

one again if I'm doing this right I

810
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:18,480
one again if I'm doing this right I
 

811
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,549
one again if I'm doing this right I
don't need any tension in my

812
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:24,559

 

813
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,750

body never

814
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:26,760
body never
 

815
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,230
body never
lifting nor shaping his sword so between

816
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,240
lifting nor shaping his sword so between
 

817
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,669
lifting nor shaping his sword so between
the three this is what why I can let go

818
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
the three this is what why I can let go
 

819
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,870
the three this is what why I can let go
there's three points of control if

820
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:35,880
there's three points of control if
 

821
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,510
there's three points of control if

and then let's look at the footwork
 

839
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,510
and then let's look at the footwork
again so one see he comes in I move and

840

at the end I'm cutting from the

864
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:04,360

 

865
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,269

angle so here were my

866
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:07,279
angle so here were my
 

867
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,669
angle so here were my
hips oh I'm going to use this bulk in to

868
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
hips oh I'm going to use this bulk in to
 

869
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,230
hips oh I'm going to use this bulk in to
show you the my hip angle okay this is

870
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,240
show you the my hip angle okay this is
 

871
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,669
show you the my hip angle okay this is
the hip angle of H

872
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:14,679
the hip angle of H
 

873
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,350
the hip angle of H
me if I just step over to the

874
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:19,360
me if I just step over to the
 

875
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,310
me if I just step over to the
side I don't I'm not oriented towards

876
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,320
side I don't I'm not oriented towards
 

877
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,070
side I don't I'm not oriented towards
him do you see that so at some

878
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,080
him do you see that so at some
 

879
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,630
him do you see that so at some
point these hips had to root

880
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
point these hips had to root
 

881
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,029
point these hips had to root
rotate and get that Hy angle to him

882
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:34,039
rotate and get that Hy angle to him
 

883
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:38,470
rotate and get that Hy angle to him
okay so not just stepping to the side

884
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:38,480
okay so not just stepping to the side
 

885
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,669
okay so not just stepping to the side
okay so I go I'm not going like this cuz

886
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:41,679
okay so I go I'm not going like this cuz
 

887
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,509
okay so I go I'm not going like this cuz
I would miss you see it's some point

888
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:44,519
I would miss you see it's some point
 

889
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:49,350
I would miss you see it's some point
there's some

890
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,360

 

891
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,950

rotation so we're going to go

892
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:51,960
rotation so we're going to go
 

893
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,070
rotation so we're going to go
slow that rotation should be

894
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,080
slow that rotation should be
 

895
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,110
slow that rotation should be
here you see because that's your yield

896
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,120
here you see because that's your yield
 

897
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,669
here you see because that's your yield
is there against his

898
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679

 

899
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,590

energy so one and you yield to his

900
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:05,600
energy so one and you yield to his
 

901
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,909
energy so one and you yield to his
energy you see how I'm turning and that

902
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:08,919
energy you see how I'm turning and that
 

903
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:13,630
energy you see how I'm turning and that
is you do that all the time in in your

904
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:13,640
is you do that all the time in in your
 

905
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,630
is you do that all the time in in your
art all the time

906
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:16,640
art all the time
 

907
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,870
art all the time
okay you're

908
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:19,880
okay you're
 

909
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,950
okay you're
even right here you see the qua the qua

910
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:24,960
even right here you see the qua the qua
 

911
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,269
even right here you see the qua the qua
yielding okay so the same thing here

912
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279

 

913
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,029

you're going to and and this is what

914
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:33,039
you're going to and and this is what
 

915
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,230
you're going to and and this is what
allows you to keep the spiral

916
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:35,240
allows you to keep the spiral
 

917
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:55,669
allows you to keep the spiral
rotation of the lower Tom Den so as I go

918
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:55,679

 

919
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,750

921
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,750

and as I'm rotating you're going to see

922
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:03,760
and as I'm rotating you're going to see
 

923
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,509
and as I'm rotating you're going to see
that you have to drop boom because my

924
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:06,519
that you have to drop boom because my
 

925
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,029
that you have to drop boom because my
feet separated you see so my

926
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:10,039
feet separated you see so my
 

927

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:57,029

it

994
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:57,039

 

995
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,389

okay so going back back again to the

996
00:32:59,389 --> 00:32:59,399
okay so going back back again to the
 

997
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:03,509
okay so going back back again to the
energetics uh when he push I yield and

998
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:03,519
energetics uh when he push I yield and
 

999
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,509
energetics uh when he push I yield and
when I push he

1000
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,519
when I push he
 

1001
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,909
when I push he
yields

1002
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:08,919

 

1003
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:17,549

okay you push I yield he P I push he

1004
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:17,559

 

1005
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:20,950

yields okay and so in essence we're

1006
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:20,960
yields okay and so in essence we're
 

1007
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,389
yields okay and so in essence we're
following the yin space so there's the

1008
00:33:23,389 --> 00:33:23,399
following the yin space so there's the
 

1009
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:26,950
following the yin space so there's the
yin space in there's the yin space out

1010
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:26,960
yin space in there's the yin space out
 

1011
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,990
yin space in there's the yin space out
okay so I'm going to follow that same

1012
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,000
okay so I'm going to follow that same
 

1013
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,310
okay so I'm going to follow that same
space pull right into

1014
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:35,320

 

1015
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,870

him in the same

1016
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:37,880
him in the same
 

1017
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,310
him in the same
way that I don't lose

1018
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,320
way that I don't lose
 

1019
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,470
way that I don't lose
connection and he doesn't lose

1020
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:44,480
connection and he doesn't lose
 

1021
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,310
connection and he doesn't lose
connection I don't want to lose

1022
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,320
connection I don't want to lose
 

1023
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,950
connection I don't want to lose
connection

1024

here Stu

1026
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:53,399
here Stu
 

1027
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,629
here Stu
Stu there's no

1028
00:33:55,629 --> 00:33:55,639
Stu there's no
 

1029
00:33:55,639 --> 00:34:03,789
Stu there's no
Gap the in space best I

1030
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:03,799

 

1031
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:07,990

felt so if you look at our timing I just

1032
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,000
felt so if you look at our timing I just
 

1033
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,629
felt so if you look at our timing I just
have one

1034
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:09,639
have one
 

1035
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:16,149
have one
Counterattack okay he

1036
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:16,159

 

1037
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,270

goes and that's what I'd like you to

1038
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,280
goes and that's what I'd like you to
 

1039
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,190
goes and that's what I'd like you to
do as opposed to your taking

1040
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,200
do as opposed to your taking
 

1041
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,990
do as opposed to your taking
turns I out of space I have one

1042
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:27,000
turns I out of space I have one
 

1043
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,750
turns I out of space I have one
aggressive

1044
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:28,760
aggressive
 

1045
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:35,030
aggressive
o one counter

1046
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,040

 

1047
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:50,550

squ

1048
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:50,560

 

1049
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,630

counter okay let's

1050
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:56,640

 

1051
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:26,630

try

1052
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:26,640

 

1053
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:46,790

e

1054
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:46,800

 

1055
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,510

you see how my V is not sliding

1056
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:51,520
you see how my V is not sliding
 

1057
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,190
you see how my V is not sliding
okay I'm going to generate an adhesion

1058
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:54,200
okay I'm going to generate an adhesion
 

1059
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,630
okay I'm going to generate an adhesion
there okay what what would what do it

1060
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:56,640
there okay what what would what do it
 

1061
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,990
there okay what what would what do it
look like if I don't

1062
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,000

 

1063
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,910

so we know for the adhesion I got to

1064
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:02,920
so we know for the adhesion I got to
 

1065
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,790
so we know for the adhesion I got to
match in my discourse I got to match the

1066
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:04,800
match in my discourse I got to match the
 

1067
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,670
match in my discourse I got to match the
Yang value okay it's the Yang value of

1068
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:07,680
Yang value okay it's the Yang value of
 

1069
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,430
Yang value okay it's the Yang value of
his his energy his inertial momentum

1070
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:10,440
his his energy his inertial momentum
 

1071
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,710
his his energy his inertial momentum
going forward on his cut and then the

1072
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:12,720
going forward on his cut and then the
 

1073
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,230
going forward on his cut and then the
gravitational uh energy of his Mass I

1074
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:15,240
gravitational uh energy of his Mass I
 

1075
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,990
gravitational uh energy of his Mass I
had to match that so my book and sticks

1076
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,000
had to match that so my book and sticks
 

1077
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,030
had to match that so my book and sticks
so that I can cook you

1078
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:22,040
so that I can cook you
 

1079
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,790
so that I can cook you
okay so it's not that I'm just there and

1080
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:25,800
okay so it's not that I'm just there and
 

1081
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,109
okay so it's not that I'm just there and
I'm I have my lightsaber

1082
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:28,119
I'm I have my lightsaber
 

1083
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,829
I'm I have my lightsaber
and I'm going to cut his arm okay you're

1084
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:31,839
and I'm going to cut his arm okay you're
 

1085
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,870
and I'm going to cut his arm okay you're
getting you're you're taking his balance

1086
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:34,880
getting you're you're taking his balance
 

1087
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,230
getting you're you're taking his balance
because you're in grappling range you

1088
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:37,240
because you're in grappling range you
 

1089
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,550
because you're in grappling range you
guys see that okay so you're going to

1090
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:39,560
guys see that okay so you're going to
 

1091
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,190
guys see that okay so you're going to
disturb his base B pop and so it has to

1092
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,200
disturb his base B pop and so it has to
 

1093
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,790
disturb his base B pop and so it has to
stick

1094
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:49,800

 

1095
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,510

1121
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,270

he so in some fencing schools uh

1122
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:28,280
he so in some fencing schools uh
 

1123
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,630
he so in some fencing schools uh
you'll have like a they'll call this

1124
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:30,640
you'll have like a they'll call this
 

1125

want him to cut my neck okay um these
 

1131
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:39,750
want him to cut my neck okay um these
are called binds in some

1132
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:39,760
are called binds in some
 

1133
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,470
are called binds in some
schools

1134
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:41,480
schools
 

1135
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,710
schools
um an empty

1136
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:43,720
um an empty
 

1137
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,309
um an empty
hand they're called

1138
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:46,319
hand they're called
 

1139
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:49,030
hand they're called
clenches do you understand so we're

1140
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,040
clenches do you understand so we're
 

1141
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,710
clenches do you understand so we're
we're here he's trying to push he

1142
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:50,720
we're here he's trying to push he
 

1143
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,109
we're here he's trying to push he
doesn't want me to punch him or need him

1144
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:53,119
doesn't want me to punch him or need him
 

1145
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,510
doesn't want me to punch him or need him
and so you're kind of checking all that

1146
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:55,520
and so you're kind of checking all that
 

1147
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,150
and so you're kind of checking all that
kind of stuff do do you understand

1148
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:57,160
kind of stuff do do you understand
 

1149
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,550
kind of stuff do do you understand
that's a bind

1150
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:00,560

 

1151
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,030

okay and when you get in binds as we

1152
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,040
okay and when you get in binds as we
 

1153
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,270
okay and when you get in binds as we
have many techniques you try to disturb

1154
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:09,280
have many techniques you try to disturb
 

1155
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,630
have many techniques you try to disturb
someone's base you have to otherwise

1156
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:11,640
someone's base you have to otherwise
 

1157
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,270
someone's base you have to otherwise
it's just a matter of time before they

1158
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:13,280
it's just a matter of time before they
 

1159
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,349
it's just a matter of time before they
do it to you okay so uh it's very

1160
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:18,359
do it to you okay so uh it's very
 

1161
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,550
do it to you okay so uh it's very
rare I would say there's no point in
