touch, I press into him, and then I
 

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,230
touch, I press into him, and then I
would move his center. Remember that or

38
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
would move his center. Remember that or
 

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,069

pull pull his center, too. Pull his
 

41
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,830
pull pull his center, too. Pull his
center. From there, we did it with open

42
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
center. From there, we did it with open
 

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,310
center. From there, we did it with open
hands and we did it with fingertips

140
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
So again, if we're doing keyhon
 

141
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,550
So again, if we're doing keyhon
we are we are more towards the

142
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
we are we are more towards the
 

143
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,710
we are we are more towards the
application phase which means we're not

144
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
application phase which means we're not
 

145
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,350
application phase which means we're not
purely energetic. We're not purely in

146
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
purely energetic. We're not purely in
 

147
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,430
purely energetic. We're not purely in
those energetic cultivation processes.

148
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440

would that be a harmony of yin and yang?

166
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
would that be a harmony of yin and yang?
 

167
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,830
would that be a harmony of yin and yang?
Okay. Well yes in some taichi circles

168
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
Okay. Well yes in some taichi circles
 

169
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,749
Okay. Well yes in some taichi circles
don't don't move your body. And then

170
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
don't don't move your body. And then
 

171
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,270
don't don't move your body. And then
what did they say? And then they don't

172
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
what did they say? And then they don't
 

173
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,990
what did they say? And then they don't
move their feet either. Okay, we're

174
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
move their feet either. Okay, we're
 

175
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,230
move their feet either. Okay, we're
going to move. We're going to combine

176
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
going to move. We're going to combine
 

177
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,870
going to move. We're going to combine
both external and internal. And it's a

178
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
both external and internal. And it's a
 

179
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,110
both external and internal. And it's a
fluctuation based on your skill set. So

180
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
fluctuation based on your skill set. So
 

181
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,189
fluctuation based on your skill set. So
um let's say she's she's very light.

182
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
um let's say she's she's very light.
 

183
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,990
um let's say she's she's very light.
I don't need to take any mechanical

184
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't need to take any mechanical
 

185
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,150
I don't need to take any mechanical
pressure off of her. You light. Okay.

186
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
pressure off of her. You light. Okay.
 

187
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,950
pressure off of her. You light. Okay.
But let's say, that keeps going

188
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
But let's say, that keeps going
 

189
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,350
But let's say, that keeps going
that way. You know what I mean? Because

190
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
that way. You know what I mean? Because
 

191
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,310
that way. You know what I mean? Because
you're so strong. You want to turn it.

192
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,320
you're so strong. You want to turn it.
 

193
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,469
you're so strong. You want to turn it.
And it takes off your mechanical

194
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
And it takes off your mechanical
 

195
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,270
And it takes off your mechanical
ability. Do you understand? But as I'm

196
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
ability. Do you understand? But as I'm
 

197
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,790
ability. Do you understand? But as I'm
turning it, I'll be whatever my Poke

198
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
turning it, I'll be whatever my Poke
 

199
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,590
turning it, I'll be whatever my Poke
ability is. Let's say it's 10, but

200
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
ability is. Let's say it's 10, but
 

201
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,990
ability is. Let's say it's 10, but
you're pushing at 12. Do you understand?

202
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
you're pushing at 12. Do you understand?
 

203
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,029
you're pushing at 12. Do you understand?
They're like, "Fuck it. I'm going to

204
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
They're like, "Fuck it. I'm going to
 

205
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,830
They're like, "Fuck it. I'm going to
lose it." Okay. I I go like this. Well,

206
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
lose it." Okay. I I go like this. Well,
 

207
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,909
lose it." Okay. I I go like this. Well,
now you're pushing at

208
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
now you're pushing at
 

209
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,909
now you're pushing at
10. You got it. And now and I I find it.

210
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
10. You got it. And now and I I find it.
 

211
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,230
10. You got it. And now and I I find it.
So I just do it seamlessly and no one

212
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
So I just do it seamlessly and no one
 

213
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,629
So I just do it seamlessly and no one
you you can't tell, but I'm fluctuating

214
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
you you can't tell, but I'm fluctuating
 

215
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,749
you you can't tell, but I'm fluctuating
between the two. Okay? And that is the

216
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
between the two. Okay? And that is the
 

217
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,830
between the two. Okay? And that is the
arc. That is the key. That that's

218
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
arc. That is the key. That that's
 

219
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,390
arc. That is the key. That that's
exactly what you do. You don't sit still

220
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
exactly what you do. You don't sit still
 

221
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,469
exactly what you do. You don't sit still
and and just try to coeue everyone all

222
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
and and just try to coeue everyone all
 

223
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,070
and and just try to coeue everyone all
over the place. Okay? So if you're

224
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
over the place. Okay? So if you're
 

225
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,029
over the place. Okay? So if you're
feeling like a lot of

226
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039

 

227
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,629

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,029
but what you're not doing is this.
You never touch the center. Okay. All

230
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
You never touch the center. Okay. All
 

231
00:06:53,039 --> 00:07:10,309

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,710

Let's look at what happens to his body.

330
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720

 

331
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,949

The angle is more.

332
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959

 

333
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,310

The foot knee ball is out of alignment.

334
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
The foot knee ball is out of alignment.
 

335
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,509
The foot knee ball is out of alignment.
The loud elbow shoulder is out of

336
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
The loud elbow shoulder is out of
 

337
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,030
The loud elbow shoulder is out of
alignment. You see that? You add the

338
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
alignment. You see that? You add the
 

339
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,230
alignment. You see that? You add the
inertia whenever he's going that way.

340
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
inertia whenever he's going that way.
 

341
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,230
inertia whenever he's going that way.
Will you Will you lean that way a little

342
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
Will you Will you lean that way a little
 

343
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,030
Will you Will you lean that way a little
bit that way? That way. This is perfect

344
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
bit that way? That way. This is perfect
 

345
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,150
bit that way? That way. This is perfect
for right. Wait till ready. Okay. And

346
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
for right. Wait till ready. Okay. And
 

347
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,030
for right. Wait till ready. Okay. And
you go.

348
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
you go.
 

349
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,269
you go.
Do you understand? So you do the other

350
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
Do you understand? So you do the other
 

351
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:10,150
Do you understand? So you do the other
one.

352
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160

 

353
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,190

Okay. We want to get him rotating. There

354
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
Okay. We want to get him rotating. There
 

355
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,670
Okay. We want to get him rotating. There
he is.

356
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
he is.
 

357
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,509
he is.
Okay. So do the shape because it does

358
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
Okay. So do the shape because it does
 

359
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,949
Okay. So do the shape because it does
different things to his body. Does

360
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
different things to his body. Does
 

361
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,990
different things to his body. Does
different things into you too. Okay. But

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,000
different things into you too. Okay. But
 

363
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:38,470
different things into you too. Okay. But
let's look at his body. Okay. Go.

364
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,480

 

365
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,670

Get his elbow out of alignment.

366
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680
Get his elbow out of alignment.
 

367
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:52,389
Get his elbow out of alignment.
Get his knee qual out of alignment.

368
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:52,399

 

369
00:13:52,399 --> 00:14:05,509

Okay, this I check

370
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519

 

371
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:17,030

it. But do it from the beginning.

372
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040

 

373
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,949

start speeding up when you touch the

374
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
start speeding up when you touch the
 

375
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,790
start speeding up when you touch the
center. If if you're having to do

376
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
center. If if you're having to do
 

377
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,710
center. If if you're having to do
mechanical attendance,

378
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720

 

379
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,269

I don't turn him. I know he turns. I

00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
I don't turn him. I know he turns. I
 

381
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,150
I don't turn him. I know he turns. I
know he's turning, but I'm not turning

382
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
know he's turning, but I'm not turning
 

383
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,150
know he's turning, but I'm not turning
him. Do you understand? I do that. I

386
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360

 

387
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:53,509

Always

388
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519

 

389
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,670

touching the center. Getting out of his

390
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
touching the center. Getting out of his
 

391
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,150
touching the center. Getting out of his
joints.

392
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160

 

393
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:18,310

Don't go back.

394
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320

 

395
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,030

All right. So, let's look now at

396
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
All right. So, let's look now at
 

397
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,389
All right. So, let's look now at
something I've been doing.

398
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
something I've been doing.
 

399
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,470
something I've been doing.
I have at the beginning I have my elbow

400
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
I have at the beginning I have my elbow
 

401
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,990
I have at the beginning I have my elbow
foot

402
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
foot
 

403
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,829
foot
long line.

404
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:31,839
long line.
 

405
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,750
long line.
Let's look at the shoulder grid. That

406
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:35,760
Let's look at the shoulder grid. That
 

407
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,750
Let's look at the shoulder grid. That
should outer rim, the outer shoulder,

408
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:37,760
should outer rim, the outer shoulder,
 

409
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,230
should outer rim, the outer shoulder,
that's my yong line. You draw a straight

410
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
that's my yong line. You draw a straight
 

411
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,470
that's my yong line. You draw a straight
line down my shoulder.

412
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
line down my shoulder.
 

413
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,910
line down my shoulder.
My yin line is halfway

414
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
My yin line is halfway
 

415
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,629
My yin line is halfway
through half chest. Everyone with me?

416
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:48,639
through half chest. Everyone with me?
 

417
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,150
through half chest. Everyone with me?
Okay. And then the middle, neither this

418
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
Okay. And then the middle, neither this
 

419
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,110
Okay. And then the middle, neither this
nor that. That I call the Wuji line.

420
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
nor that. That I call the Wuji line.
 

421
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,590
nor that. That I call the Wuji line.
I'm going to take

422
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm going to take
 

423
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,590
I'm going to take
the elbow and the elbow will go to the

424
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
the elbow and the elbow will go to the
 

425
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,670
the elbow and the elbow will go to the
yin line. Cannot go past it. You go past

426
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
yin line. Cannot go past it. You go past
 

427
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,310
yin line. Cannot go past it. You go past
it, you're going to lose what we want

428
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
it, you're going to lose what we want
 

429
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,069
it, you're going to lose what we want
energetically and you're going to lose

430
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
energetically and you're going to lose
 

431
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,030
energetically and you're going to lose
what we want marshally.

432
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
what we want marshally.
 

433
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,189
what we want marshally.
The elbow can only go to the yin

434
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:19,199
The elbow can only go to the yin
 

435
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,269
The elbow can only go to the yin
or to the yang. That is it.

436
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
or to the yang. That is it.
 

437
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,790
or to the yang. That is it.
The wrist can go to the boutique.

438
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
The wrist can go to the boutique.
 

439
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,670
The wrist can go to the boutique.
So elbow and the wrist is at the bi.

440
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
So elbow and the wrist is at the bi.
 

441
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,870
So elbow and the wrist is at the bi.
When you come back out like that, you're

442
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
When you come back out like that, you're
 

443
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,430
When you come back out like that, you're
going to do outer del. Okay? So I never

444
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,440
going to do outer del. Okay? So I never
 

445
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,030
going to do outer del. Okay? So I never
go

446
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040
go
 

447
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,110
go
this way.

448
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
this way.
 

449
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,230
this way.
If you want your wrist back, you have to

450
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
If you want your wrist back, you have to
 

451
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,150
If you want your wrist back, you have to
undo it or go outer spiral.

452
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
undo it or go outer spiral.
 

453
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,910
undo it or go outer spiral.
You see that? And when you go outer

454
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
You see that? And when you go outer
 

455
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,470
You see that? And when you go outer
spiral, it'll drop back this way. The

456
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,480
spiral, it'll drop back this way. The
 

457
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,350
spiral, it'll drop back this way. The
elbow stays on the in line, but the

458
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
elbow stays on the in line, but the
 

459
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,990
elbow stays on the in line, but the
wrist can go out. Okay. Now, if you

460
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
wrist can go out. Okay. Now, if you
 

461
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,390
wrist can go out. Okay. Now, if you
watch my elbows, this is going to give

462
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
watch my elbows, this is going to give
 

463
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,429
watch my elbows, this is going to give
you your anchored elbows the whole time

464
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
you your anchored elbows the whole time
 

465
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,270
you your anchored elbows the whole time
where we're more powerful from there

466
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,280
where we're more powerful from there
 

467
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,909
where we're more powerful from there
than moving out here distally. So, the

468
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
than moving out here distally. So, the
 

469
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,630
than moving out here distally. So, the
elbow moves the wrist.

470
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:16,640
elbow moves the wrist.
 

471
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,990
elbow moves the wrist.
The elbow moves the wrist. I'm not doing

472
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
The elbow moves the wrist. I'm not doing
 

473
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,549
The elbow moves the wrist. I'm not doing
this stuff. The elbow never came off the

474
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
this stuff. The elbow never came off the
 

475
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,230
this stuff. The elbow never came off the
shoulder line. Okay, does that make

476
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
shoulder line. Okay, does that make
 

477
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,230
shoulder line. Okay, does that make
sense? All right. So, I I understand

478
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240
sense? All right. So, I I understand
 

479
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,909
sense? All right. So, I I understand
you're like, smell it, but you smelling

480
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:31,919
you're like, smell it, but you smelling
 

481
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,549
you're like, smell it, but you smelling
it and going outer deltoid. Don't do it.

482
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
it and going outer deltoid. Don't do it.
 

483
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,029
it and going outer deltoid. Don't do it.
If he's bigger, it'll be harder. Okay,

484
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
If he's bigger, it'll be harder. Okay,
 

485
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,710
If he's bigger, it'll be harder. Okay,
you already got everything you need. So,

486
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
you already got everything you need. So,
 

487
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,789
you already got everything you need. So,
it's just

488
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
it's just
 

489
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,990
it's just
here. Elbow's doing it. Elbow's doing

490
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,000
here. Elbow's doing it. Elbow's doing
 

491
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,270

679
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,789

I'm passing him from one control hand to

680
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
I'm passing him from one control hand to
 

681
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,510
I'm passing him from one control hand to
the other control hand.

682
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:05,520

 

683
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,750

Keep it going. You're using the

684
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760
Keep it going. You're using the
 

685
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,750
Keep it going. You're using the
centrifugal energy so he can't stop.

686
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,760

 

687
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,870

00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:46,159

 

697
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,630

Keep her moving. Keep her moving. Keep

698
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640
Keep her moving. Keep her moving. Keep
 

699
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,710
Keep her moving. Keep her moving. Keep
her moving. Don't pull.

700
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:52,720
her moving. Don't pull.

Don't
 

705
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,149
Don't
Don't pull him. I know you smell the

706
00:25:58,149 --> 00:25:58,159
Don't pull him. I know you smell the
 

707
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,549
Don't pull him. I know you smell the
backwards. And so you want you want to

708
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
backwards. And so you want you want to
 

709
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,630
backwards. And so you want you want to
like pull him backwards. Do you see

710
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
like pull him backwards. Do you see
 

711
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,350
like pull him backwards. Do you see
that?

712
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:05,360
that?
 

713
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,669
that?
Go ahead and go that way. I I'm on this

714
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:07,679
Go ahead and go that way. I I'm on this
 

715
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,750
Go ahead and go that way. I I'm on this
side.

716
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:09,760
side.
 

717
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,190
side.
Do you see that difference? So, uh, a

718
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
Do you see that difference? So, uh, a
 

719
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,710
Do you see that difference? So, uh, a
lot of times when when you're over here

720
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:14,720
lot of times when when you're over here
 

721
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,149
lot of times when when you're over here
like that, you're going to pull

722
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
like that, you're going to pull
 

723
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,070
like that, you're going to pull
backwards. You can actually pull the

724
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
backwards. You can actually pull the
 

725
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,830
backwards. You can actually pull the
athlete back into their base.

726
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:21,840
athlete back into their base.
 

727
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,909
athlete back into their base.
So, you just keep it moving. In this

728
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:23,919
So, you just keep it moving. In this
 

729
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,190
So, you just keep it moving. In this
drill, all we're doing is I keep it

730
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,200
drill, all we're doing is I keep it
 

731
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,070
drill, all we're doing is I keep it
moving on. I'm on this side, making it

732
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
moving on. I'm on this side, making it
 

733
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,750
moving on. I'm on this side, making it
stronger. So, you can feel that it's on

734
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760
stronger. So, you can feel that it's on
 

735
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,830
stronger. So, you can feel that it's on
it's on the outside. I keep pressing

736
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:31,840
it's on the outside. I keep pressing
 

737
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,909
it's on the outside. I keep pressing
against it. Okay? Like a ride. You know

738
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:33,919
against it. Okay? Like a ride. You know
 

739
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,149
against it. Okay? Like a ride. You know
that ride where you go and you're like

740
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:36,159
that ride where you go and you're like
 

741
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,310
that ride where you go and you're like
stuck on the on the wall. That's exactly

742
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:38,320
stuck on the on the wall. That's exactly
 

743
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,950
stuck on the on the wall. That's exactly
what his head is stuck on my hand. Okay.

744
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:40,960
what his head is stuck on my hand. Okay.
 

745
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,190
what his head is stuck on my hand. Okay.
As long as I don't tense and I just stay

746
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,200
As long as I don't tense and I just stay
 

747
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,269
As long as I don't tense and I just stay
there and match it, it will stick on my

748
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:45,279
there and match it, it will stick on my
 

749
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,909
there and match it, it will stick on my
hand. Okay. Try it.

750
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919

 

751
00:26:49,919 --> 00:27:01,430

Thumb.

You got to get You got to get over here.
See the gravity.

756
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:08,240

 

757
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,549

I think you're on the wrong side. You're

758
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:10,559
I think you're on the wrong side. You're
 

759

Yeah,
you got to keep it moving.

770
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,799

 

771
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,029

You're on the back as he starts to turn

772
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:31,039
You're on the back as he starts to turn
 

773
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,350
You're on the back as he starts to turn
him. Okay.

That's where Tristan That's where
 

777
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,710
That's where Tristan That's where
Tristan all he's like, I don't know what

778
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:36,720
Tristan all he's like, I don't know what
 

779

787
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,870

You got to He has to move this way. So

788
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:08,880
You got to He has to move this way. So
 

789
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,710
You got to He has to move this way. So
why? Okay, think about it this way.

790
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:12,720
why? Okay, think about it this way.
 

791
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,789
why? Okay, think about it this way.
Imagine

792
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:14,799
Imagine
 

793
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,710
Imagine
that you were on that ride and the

794
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:16,720
that you were on that ride and the
 

795
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,590
that you were on that ride and the
centrical energy had you stuck to the

796
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,600
centrical energy had you stuck to the
 

797
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,029
centrical energy had you stuck to the
side of the wall. Does everyone know the

798
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:21,039
side of the wall. Does everyone know the
 

799
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,110
side of the wall. Does everyone know the
ride I'm talking about? Anyone not seen

800
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
ride I'm talking about? Anyone not seen
 

801
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,870
ride I'm talking about? Anyone not seen
that ride?

802
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:24,880
that ride?
 

803
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,950
that ride?
Okay.

804
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:26,960
Okay.
 

805
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,310
Okay.
Okay. Um, imagine if the ride could

806
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,320
Okay. Um, imagine if the ride could
 

807
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,549
Okay. Um, imagine if the ride could
immediately stop.

808
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:32,559
immediately stop.
 

809
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,710
immediately stop.
Would you stay stuck to the wall? No.

810
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:34,720
Would you stay stuck to the wall? No.
 

811
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,789
Would you stay stuck to the wall? No.
No. The inertia would keep you going for

812
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:36,799
No. The inertia would keep you going for
 

813
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,310
No. The inertia would keep you going for
a little bit, but you'd be coming off

814
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,320
a little bit, but you'd be coming off
 

815
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,430
a little bit, but you'd be coming off
the wall. Okay. a batch of the ride was

816
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:41,440
the wall. Okay. a batch of the ride was
 

817
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,029
the wall. Okay. a batch of the ride was
stopped,

818
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:43,039
stopped,
 

819
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,789
stopped,
right?

820
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:44,799
right?
 

821
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,830
right?
And um

822
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:47,840
And um
 

823
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,110
And um
would you ever get stuck to the wall?

824
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,120
would you ever get stuck to the wall?
 

825
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,190
would you ever get stuck to the wall?
No. The ride to start, nobody's stuck to

826
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,200
No. The ride to start, nobody's stuck to
 

827
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,310
No. The ride to start, nobody's stuck to
the wall. Okay. So again, one of my main

828
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
the wall. Okay. So again, one of my main
 

829
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,750
the wall. Okay. So again, one of my main
criticisms is that the stopping and

830
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
criticisms is that the stopping and
 

831
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,950
criticisms is that the stopping and
starting that we see all the time in

832
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:02,960
starting that we see all the time in
 

833
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,269
starting that we see all the time in
modern video after video, stopping,

834
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:05,279
modern video after video, stopping,
 

835
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,190
modern video after video, stopping,
starting, they're not using the what I

836
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,200
starting, they're not using the what I
 

837
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,789
starting, they're not using the what I
just will generally for now call

838
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:10,799
just will generally for now call
 

839
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,669
just will generally for now call
gravity. This is probably inertia,

840
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:13,679
gravity. This is probably inertia,
 

841
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,310
gravity. This is probably inertia,
centrifugal force, whatever. They're not

842
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,320
centrifugal force, whatever. They're not
 

843
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,789
centrifugal force, whatever. They're not
using the force. They're using the

844
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:18,799
using the force. They're using the
 

845
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,510
using the force. They're using the
materiality, the anatomy of the guy.

846
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,520
materiality, the anatomy of the guy.
 

847
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,710
materiality, the anatomy of the guy.
Okay, you guys understand? So that force

848
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:24,720
Okay, you guys understand? So that force
 

849
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,269
Okay, you guys understand? So that force
is present. That force is present even

850
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:27,279
is present. That force is present even
 

851
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,750
is present. That force is present even
with me not moving. The force is present

852
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:29,760
with me not moving. The force is present
 

853
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,710
with me not moving. The force is present
as long so that means that I could do it

854
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:32,720
as long so that means that I could do it
 

855
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,350
as long so that means that I could do it
very slowly and he'll feel the friction.

856
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,360
very slowly and he'll feel the friction.
 

857
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,110
very slowly and he'll feel the friction.
Okay, you got it. But if I am here and I

858
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,120
Okay, you got it. But if I am here and I
 

859
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,510
Okay, you got it. But if I am here and I
stop, that's different. That's

860
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:45,520
stop, that's different. That's
 

861
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,430
stop, that's different. That's
different. And this is where the guy

862
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:47,440
different. And this is where the guy
 

863
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,710
different. And this is where the guy
that's fighting you just

864
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:50,720
that's fighting you just
 

865
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,149
that's fighting you just
Okay, got it. So, no matter how slow you

866
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:54,159
Okay, got it. So, no matter how slow you
 

867
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,430
Okay, got it. So, no matter how slow you
go, he has to keep moving. Okay, try it.

868
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,440
go, he has to keep moving. Okay, try it.
 

869
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,350
go, he has to keep moving. Okay, try it.
I know that for a fact. And you do, too.

870
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,360

 

871
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,950

That means you have to get him to start

872
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
That means you have to get him to start
 

873
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:14,149
That means you have to get him to start
moving.

874
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:14,159

 

875
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:37,590

Yes. Keep moving.

876
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:37,600

 

877
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,350

Yeah, you got to be to the outside of

878
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,360
Yeah, you got to be to the outside of
 

879
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,549
Yeah, you got to be to the outside of
the cential force.

880
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:44,559

 

881
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:53,510

He stops ever so slightly.

882
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:53,520

 

883
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,110

It goes off and on as you step you the

884
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,120
It goes off and on as you step you the
 

885
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,470
It goes off and on as you step you the
radius. So here, watch for a second.

886
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,480
radius. So here, watch for a second.
 

887
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,870
radius. So here, watch for a second.
When you're here like this,

888
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:04,880
When you're here like this,
 

889
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,110
When you're here like this,
he's he is going

890
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,120
he's he is going
 

891
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,510
he's he is going
I have to generate the equal yang. Okay.

892
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:13,520
I have to generate the equal yang. Okay.
 

893
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,149
I have to generate the equal yang. Okay.
So I mean I I could do it here with my

894
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159
So I mean I I could do it here with my
 

895
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,630
So I mean I I could do it here with my
body which I prefer. I don't prefer that

896
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:18,640
body which I prefer. I don't prefer that
 

897
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,870
body which I prefer. I don't prefer that
I'm in close and I do it with my bicep.

898
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:20,880
I'm in close and I do it with my bicep.
 

899
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,110
I'm in close and I do it with my bicep.
Okay. So I'm here like this. We're going

900
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,120
Okay. So I'm here like this. We're going
 

901
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,350
Okay. So I'm here like this. We're going
there it is. But as I step you see my

902
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:27,360
there it is. But as I step you see my
 

903
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,269
there it is. But as I step you see my
elbow's going closer to him and off of

904
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
elbow's going closer to him and off of
 

905
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,430
elbow's going closer to him and off of
him. And so the pressure is going on and

906
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:31,440
him. And so the pressure is going on and
 

907
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,549
him. And so the pressure is going on and
off.

908
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:32,559
off.
 

909
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,789
off.
So you got to be careful where you step.

910
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:34,799
So you got to be careful where you step.
 

911
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,950
So you got to be careful where you step.
So I can't tell you where you step, but

912
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:36,960
So I can't tell you where you step, but
 

913
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,870
So I can't tell you where you step, but
I can tell you did you feel it go on and

914
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:38,880
I can tell you did you feel it go on and
 

915
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,430
I can tell you did you feel it go on and
off? Okay. So make sure it doesn't go on

916
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,440
off? Okay. So make sure it doesn't go on
 

917
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,750
off? Okay. So make sure it doesn't go on
and off because your cooperative boot

918
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
and off because your cooperative boot
 

919
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,389
and off because your cooperative boot
can't fall for you cuz Yeah. Okay. But

920
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:46,399
can't fall for you cuz Yeah. Okay. But
 

921
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,310
can't fall for you cuz Yeah. Okay. But
we're chasing the feeling, not whether

922
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,320
we're chasing the feeling, not whether
 

923
00:31:48,320 --> 00:32:10,310
we're chasing the feeling, not whether
he fell or not. Okay. Try it again.

924
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:10,320

 

925
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:23,430

There's the other way.

926
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:23,440

 

927
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:43,669

Taste butter.

928
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:43,679

 

929
00:32:43,679 --> 00:33:03,590

That's better.

930
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:03,600

 

931
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,190

Got to get it moving. You got to

932
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,200
Got to get it moving. You got to
 

933
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:15,350
Got to get it moving. You got to
generate the senses before.

934
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,360

 

935
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,029

Okay. Look at the shape of my hand.

936
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:19,039
Okay. Look at the shape of my hand.
 

937
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,909
Okay. Look at the shape of my hand.
Okay. Watch the shape of my hand.

938
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:23,919
Okay. Watch the shape of my hand.
 

939
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,149
Okay. Watch the shape of my hand.
I'll do two. I'll do two versions. I'll

940
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:26,159
I'll do two. I'll do two versions. I'll
 

941
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:37,269
I'll do two. I'll do two versions. I'll
go slow. Still feel it.

942
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:37,279

 

943
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,110

What would you say is the difference in

944
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,120
What would you say is the difference in
 

945
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,230
What would you say is the difference in
the shape of my hand? One's like a soft

946
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,240
the shape of my hand? One's like a soft
 

947
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,350
the shape of my hand? One's like a soft
cup and one's a clo now. One one is

948
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:45,360
cup and one's a clo now. One one is
 

949
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,430
cup and one's a clo now. One one is
trying to to grab. Okay. So, I know if

950
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440
trying to to grab. Okay. So, I know if
 

951
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,190
trying to to grab. Okay. So, I know if
you're grabbing, you're not feeling what

952
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,200
you're grabbing, you're not feeling what
 

953
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,430
you're grabbing, you're not feeling what
I need you to feel. Okay. So, try it

954
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,440
I need you to feel. Okay. So, try it
 

955
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:04,970
I need you to feel. Okay. So, try it
again.

1313
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,630

There is

1314
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:24,640
There is
 

1315
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,670
There is
pressure right

1316
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:29,680

 

1317
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,069

there. There is the centrifugal energy

1318
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:34,079
there. There is the centrifugal energy
 

1319
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,150
there. There is the centrifugal energy
that has his center. So I always feel

1320
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:36,160
that has his center. So I always feel
 

1321
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,790
that has his center. So I always feel
his center right in this technique

1322
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:40,800
his center right in this technique
 

1323
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,150
his center right in this technique
like if you if you

1324
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:44,160
like if you if you
 

1325
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,990
like if you if you
if you like try to pin me down if you go

1326
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,000
if you like try to pin me down if you go
 

1327
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,470
if you like try to pin me down if you go
D which technique is COQ well do you

1328
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:50,480
D which technique is COQ well do you
 

1329
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,630
D which technique is COQ well do you
mean which technique uses COQ? I say I

1330
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:52,640
mean which technique uses COQ? I say I
 

1331
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,470
mean which technique uses COQ? I say I
change your question. So which qu which

1332
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:54,480
change your question. So which qu which
 

1333
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,470
change your question. So which qu which
technique is co

1334
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:56,480
technique is co
 

1335
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,990
technique is co
and then I would go like do you mean

1336
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:58,000
and then I would go like do you mean
 

1337
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,309
and then I would go like do you mean
which technique uses coke and I change I

1338
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:00,319
which technique uses coke and I change I
 

1339
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,990
which technique uses coke and I change I
change it slightly. You see and then

1340
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:02,000
change it slightly. You see and then
 

1341
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,990
change it slightly. You see and then
what would be my answer?

1342
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
what would be my answer?
 

1343
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,630
what would be my answer?
All of them do. It's okay. No, no, no.

1344
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:06,640
All of them do. It's okay. No, no, no.
 

1345
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,790
All of them do. It's okay. No, no, no.
There's something called kokunag. Which

1346
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:08,800
There's something called kokunag. Which
 

1347
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,990
There's something called kokunag. Which
one uses kok nag? Kokun nag does not use

1348
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:12,000
one uses kok nag? Kokun nag does not use
 

1349
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,790
one uses kok nag? Kokun nag does not use
any of the things we do like for the the

1350
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:16,800
any of the things we do like for the the
 

1351
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,630
any of the things we do like for the the
uh my my materiality

1352
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:20,640
uh my my materiality
 

1353
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,230
uh my my materiality
um displacing his base. I use co to

1354
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:24,240
um displacing his base. I use co to
 

1355
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,390
um displacing his base. I use co to
displace the space but I don't use my

1356
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:26,400
displace the space but I don't use my
 

1357
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,829
displace the space but I don't use my
koshi to displace his base. I purely use

1358
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:29,839
koshi to displace his base. I purely use
 

1359
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,790
koshi to displace his base. I purely use
the energies that's going on. Okay. And

1360
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:32,800
the energies that's going on. Okay. And
 

1361
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,790
the energies that's going on. Okay. And
you still feel like all of a sudden it

1362
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:34,800
you still feel like all of a sudden it
 

1363
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,710
you still feel like all of a sudden it
got really fast. Okay. There's still a

1364
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:36,720
got really fast. Okay. There's still a
 

1365
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,390
got really fast. Okay. There's still a
percussiveness to it. Does that make

1366
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:38,400
percussiveness to it. Does that make
 

1367
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,589
percussiveness to it. Does that make
sense? Okay. So,

1368
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:41,599
sense? Okay. So,
 

1369
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,910
sense? Okay. So,
what I'm doing is going here, I feel

1370
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:45,920
what I'm doing is going here, I feel
 

1371
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,109
what I'm doing is going here, I feel
just a little outward pull. And the

1372
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:49,119
just a little outward pull. And the
 

1373
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,950
just a little outward pull. And the
second I feel that outward pull, I

1374
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:52,960
second I feel that outward pull, I
 

1375
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,990
second I feel that outward pull, I
shorten it this way. But I don't try to

1376
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:58,000
shorten it this way. But I don't try to
 

1377
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,390
shorten it this way. But I don't try to
increase it or take it off. And this is

1378
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:00,400
increase it or take it off. And this is
 

1379
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,630
increase it or take it off. And this is
where I want to make the correction.

1380
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
where I want to make the correction.
 

1381
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,430
where I want to make the correction.
Don't take it off. You feel his center

1382
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:05,440
Don't take it off. You feel his center
 

1383
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,430
Don't take it off. You feel his center
from the neck and you're like, "That is

1384
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:07,440
from the neck and you're like, "That is
 

1385
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,510
from the neck and you're like, "That is
heavy." And you're starting to go around

1386
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:09,520
heavy." And you're starting to go around
 

1387
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,950
heavy." And you're starting to go around
it by going with it. Do you understand?

1388
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:12,960
it by going with it. Do you understand?
 

1389
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,069
it by going with it. Do you understand?
And you don't want to do that. So there

1390
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:16,079
And you don't want to do that. So there
 

1391
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,230
And you don't want to do that. So there
is

1392
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:20,240

 

1393
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,230

this movement

1394
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:22,240
this movement
 

1395
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,270
this movement
against that energy and you have to move

1396
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:25,280
against that energy and you have to move
 

1397
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,390
against that energy and you have to move
in the same way. Ground the back foot.

1398
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:28,400
in the same way. Ground the back foot.
 

1399
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,950
in the same way. Ground the back foot.
Boom. and cut right through it. No

1400
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:30,960
Boom. and cut right through it. No
 

1401
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,230
Boom. and cut right through it. No
different than this part here. You get

1402
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:34,240
different than this part here. You get
 

1403
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,549
different than this part here. You get
it? Don't look for where is the where

1404
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:36,559
it? Don't look for where is the where
 

1405
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,710
it? Don't look for where is the where
does it stop and it's easy to move.

1406
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:38,720
does it stop and it's easy to move.
 

1407
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,670
does it stop and it's easy to move.
Okay? You you're not looking for that.

1408
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:41,680
Okay? You you're not looking for that.
 

1409
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,790
Okay? You you're not looking for that.
You're feeling where is his weight. Oh,

1410
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:44,800
You're feeling where is his weight. Oh,
 

1411
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,670
You're feeling where is his weight. Oh,
and I move through that weight. You guys

1412
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:47,680
and I move through that weight. You guys
 

1413
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,349
and I move through that weight. You guys
got it. You got to move through it. And

1414
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:49,359
got it. You got to move through it. And
 

1415
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,870
got it. You got to move through it. And
then you move through it. You have to

1416
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:50,880
then you move through it. You have to
 

1417
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,390
then you move through it. You have to
move through it the way we did the other

1418
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:52,400
move through it the way we did the other
 

1419
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,030
move through it the way we did the other
day. Travel that foot. Don't let your

1420
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:55,040
day. Travel that foot. Don't let your
 

1421
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,030
day. Travel that foot. Don't let your
feet point out against each other. Don't

1422
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:57,040
feet point out against each other. Don't
 

1423
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,030
feet point out against each other. Don't
keep trying to take energy off of it. Go

1424
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,040
keep trying to take energy off of it. Go
 

1425
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,790
keep trying to take energy off of it. Go
right through the source of that energy.

1426
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:00,800
right through the source of that energy.
 

1427
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:19,109
right through the source of that energy.
Okay, try it again.

1428
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:19,119

 

1429
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,750

Better. Yes.

1430
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:23,760

 

1431
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,670

Catching. Get your hand. Get your mind

1432
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:25,680
Catching. Get your hand. Get your mind
 

1433
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:39,670
Catching. Get your hand. Get your mind
ready.

1434
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:39,680

 

1435
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:48,630

Took it off.

1436
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:48,640

 

1437
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,549

Don't take it off. She'll be fine.

1438
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:52,559
Don't take it off. She'll be fine.
 

1439
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,390
Don't take it off. She'll be fine.
And that and that displaced you. But

1440
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,400
And that and that displaced you. But
 

1441
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,309
And that and that displaced you. But
that was the energy. All you got to do

1442
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:56,319
that was the energy. All you got to do
 

1443
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,150
that was the energy. All you got to do
now is ground that energy like you are

1444
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:58,160
now is ground that energy like you are
 

1445
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,630
now is ground that energy like you are
in the beginning. Right.

1446
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:00,640
in the beginning. Right.
 

1447
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:06,950
in the beginning. Right.
But that was it. That was the angle.

1448
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:06,960

 

1449
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:17,430

Not it. Right. You're going around it.

1450
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:17,440

 

1451
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,190

Yes. Yes. Yes. Trust them. Trust. Okay.

1452
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:21,200
Yes. Yes. Yes. Trust them. Trust. Okay.
 

1453
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,190
Yes. Yes. Yes. Trust them. Trust. Okay.
Move through it like you're displacing

1454
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:23,200
Move through it like you're displacing
 

1455
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,510
Move through it like you're displacing
someone that's standing there.

1456
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:27,520

 

1457
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,190

Go around. Go around. J your thumb. J

1458
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:29,200
Go around. Go around. J your thumb. J
 

1459
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,750
Go around. Go around. J your thumb. J
your thumb. J. There it is.

1460
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:33,760

 

1461
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,230

Better Sean. But you got to place it

1462
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:38,240
Better Sean. But you got to place it
 

1463
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,270
Better Sean. But you got to place it
taking energy off. Yes. Yes. But you

1464
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:41,280
taking energy off. Yes. Yes. But you
 

1465
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,670
taking energy off. Yes. Yes. But you
keep getting displaced.

1466
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:43,680
keep getting displaced.
 

1467
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,309
keep getting displaced.
You got displaced.

1468
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:46,319
You got displaced.
 

1469
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:50,309
You got displaced.

Okay.
 

1639
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:37,589
Okay.
Where did it go off here?

1640
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:37,599

 

1641
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,670

So there's a time there's a window for

1642
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:39,680
So there's a time there's a window for
 

1643
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:45,109
So there's a time there's a window for
it. You see? So if I stay still

1644
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:45,119

 

1645
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,950

and he's coming in, it's off.

1646
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:48,960
and he's coming in, it's off.
 

1647
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,750
and he's coming in, it's off.
And every is different. So, I have to

1648
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:51,760
And every is different. So, I have to
 

1649
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,710
And every is different. So, I have to
move out.

1650
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:54,720
move out.
 

1651
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,030
move out.
Didn't have to move out on anyone else.

1652
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,040
Didn't have to move out on anyone else.
 

1653
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,270
Didn't have to move out on anyone else.
Now, I know why I'm moving out because I

1654
00:57:59,270 --> 00:57:59,280
Now, I know why I'm moving out because I
 

1655
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,109
Now, I know why I'm moving out because I
have a a former federite and he likes to

1656
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:03,119
have a a former federite and he likes to
 

1657
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,430
have a a former federite and he likes to
do these weird leans towards the no.

1658
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:07,440
do these weird leans towards the no.
 

1659
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,950
do these weird leans towards the no.
Think about it. Okay. If he just doesn't

1660
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:10,960
Think about it. Okay. If he just doesn't
 

1661
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,190
Think about it. Okay. If he just doesn't
do anything, where' the lean go?

1662
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:15,200
do anything, where' the lean go?
 

1663
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,109
do anything, where' the lean go?
Okay, but I worked with him

1664
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:19,119
Okay, but I worked with him
 

1665
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:23,270
Okay, but I worked with him
to and I just the pressure. Okay. So,

1666
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:23,280
to and I just the pressure. Okay. So,
 

1667
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,549
to and I just the pressure. Okay. So,
his window is different from the next

1668
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:26,559
his window is different from the next
 

1669
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,630
his window is different from the next
two from the next, but you should have

1670
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:30,640
two from the next, but you should have
 

1671
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,309
two from the next, but you should have
felt

1672
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:32,319
felt
 

1673
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,349
felt
that your hand came back instead of

1674
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:35,359
that your hand came back instead of
 

1675
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:39,430
that your hand came back instead of
keeping kata dirty. So, if I have my

1676
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:39,440
keeping kata dirty. So, if I have my
 

1677
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,390
keeping kata dirty. So, if I have my
hand here, when I move, can you move his

1678
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:42,400
hand here, when I move, can you move his
 

1679
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,069
hand here, when I move, can you move his
center? You can move his center any

1680
00:58:44,069 --> 00:58:44,079
center? You can move his center any
 

1681
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,309
center? You can move his center any
direction. Obviously, I need it to move

1682
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:46,319
direction. Obviously, I need it to move
 

1683
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:49,030
direction. Obviously, I need it to move
there. I can't have it move here. You

1684
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:49,040
there. I can't have it move here. You
 

1685
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,630
there. I can't have it move here. You
see that? Now if in my technique

1686
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:52,640
see that? Now if in my technique
 

1687
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,390
see that? Now if in my technique
I consider that what he did is resisting

1688
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:56,400
I consider that what he did is resisting
 

1689
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,390
I consider that what he did is resisting
the technique. I consider it a counter.

1690
00:58:58,390 --> 00:58:58,400
the technique. I consider it a counter.
 

1691
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,670
the technique. I consider it a counter.
So now I have to adapt the technique. So

1692
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:01,680
So now I have to adapt the technique. So
 

1693
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,589
So now I have to adapt the technique. So
I know he's leaning in past that hand

1694
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:05,599
I know he's leaning in past that hand
 

1695
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,990
I know he's leaning in past that hand
like you are. Okay. You see that he's on

1696
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:08,000
like you are. Okay. You see that he's on
 

1697
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,630
like you are. Okay. You see that he's on
the inside of the hand. So hence my foot

1698
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:12,640
the inside of the hand. So hence my foot
 

1699
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,990
the inside of the hand. So hence my foot
moves to get the hand back there. Okay.

1700
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,000
moves to get the hand back there. Okay.
 

1701
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,829
moves to get the hand back there. Okay.
And um

1702
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:19,839

 

1703
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,069

again like there's there's two two

1704
00:59:22,069 --> 00:59:22,079
again like there's there's two two
 

1705
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,390
again like there's there's two two
things that you're trying to train here.

1706
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:24,400
things that you're trying to train here.
 

1707
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,670
things that you're trying to train here.
Even though it is kon and even though

1708
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:27,680
Even though it is kon and even though
 

1709
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,150
Even though it is kon and even though
I've controlled the environment because

1710
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:30,160
I've controlled the environment because
 

1711
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,950
I've controlled the environment because
every cook does something different it's

1712
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:32,960
every cook does something different it's
 

1713
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,470
every cook does something different it's
still gaza you see that as long as and

1714
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:36,480
still gaza you see that as long as and
 

1715
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,150
still gaza you see that as long as and
it's in fact it's the only way it could

1716
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:38,160
it's in fact it's the only way it could
 

1717
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,349
it's in fact it's the only way it could
be gaza is that I have a form I have to

1718
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:41,359
be gaza is that I have a form I have to
 

1719
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,710
be gaza is that I have a form I have to
end up with the exact same ending

1720
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:44,720
end up with the exact same ending
 

1721
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,630
end up with the exact same ending
from a multitude of infinite middles you

1722
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:48,640
from a multitude of infinite middles you
 

1723
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,829
from a multitude of infinite middles you
see that okay so um that's all that's

1724
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:51,839
see that okay so um that's all that's
 

1725
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,109
see that okay so um that's all that's
happening

1726
00:59:53,109 --> 00:59:53,119
happening
 

1727
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,910
happening
Now as the sensei I have the dual task

1728
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:57,920
Now as the sensei I have the dual task
 

1729
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,430
Now as the sensei I have the dual task
because I have to get rid of the fear

1730
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:01,440
because I have to get rid of the fear
 

1731
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,069
because I have to get rid of the fear
and the attachment to the institution

1732
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:04,079
and the attachment to the institution
 

1733
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,990
and the attachment to the institution
right but that's the teacher's job

1734
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:06,000
right but that's the teacher's job
 

1735
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,710
right but that's the teacher's job
that's not the no's job the no job is to

1736
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:08,720
that's not the no's job the no job is to
 

1737
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,750
that's not the no's job the no job is to
make whatever this is doing work you

1738
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:11,760
make whatever this is doing work you
 

1739
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,349
make whatever this is doing work you
guys understand that so um

1740
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:15,359
guys understand that so um
 

1741
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,510
guys understand that so um
like uh

1742
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:17,520
like uh
 

1743
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,430
like uh
in most places they would go like you're

1744
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:21,440
in most places they would go like you're
 

1745
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,270
in most places they would go like you're
not Oh, you're not going in right.

1746
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:23,280
not Oh, you're not going in right.
 

1747
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,589
not Oh, you're not going in right.
You're not going in right. Right. And

1748
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:25,599
You're not going in right. Right. And
 

1749
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,630
You're not going in right. Right. And
whatever variation of resistance it is.

1750
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:28,640
whatever variation of resistance it is.
 

1751
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,750
whatever variation of resistance it is.
Okay. Um that we don't do that here. You

1752
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:31,760
Okay. Um that we don't do that here. You
 

1753
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,309
Okay. Um that we don't do that here. You
make that technique work and then the

1754
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:34,319
make that technique work and then the
 

1755
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,230
make that technique work and then the
teacher will deal with the fear that's

1756
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:36,240
teacher will deal with the fear that's
 

1757
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,150
teacher will deal with the fear that's
behind or the institutional attachment

1758
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,160
behind or the institutional attachment
 

1759
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,750
behind or the institutional attachment
that's behind that. Does that make

1760
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:39,760
that's behind that. Does that make
 

1761
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,630
that's behind that. Does that make
sense? So, whatever they're doing, it's

1762
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:42,640
sense? So, whatever they're doing, it's
 

1763
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,630
sense? So, whatever they're doing, it's
the forces that we're working. You make

1764
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:44,640
the forces that we're working. You make
 

1765
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,030
the forces that we're working. You make
those work. Okay? Don't go back to other

1766
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:47,040
those work. Okay? Don't go back to other
 

1767
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,710
those work. Okay? Don't go back to other
forces. All right? Even though you're

1768
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:48,720
forces. All right? Even though you're
 

1769
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,270
forces. All right? Even though you're
like, he's so off balance.

1770
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:51,280
like, he's so off balance.
 

1771
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,270
like, he's so off balance.
Don't go back to that. Okay. All right.

1772
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:53,280
Don't go back to that. Okay. All right.
 

1773
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:59,589
Don't go back to that. Okay. All right.
Try.

1774
01:00:59,589 --> 01:00:59,599

 

1775
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,670

And Sean, you should just try to not do

1776
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:01,680
And Sean, you should just try to not do
 

1777
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:08,870
And Sean, you should just try to not do
anything.

1778
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:08,880

 

1779
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,549

You want that tighter circle.

1780
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:12,559
You want that tighter circle.
 

1781
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,349
You want that tighter circle.
Circle. Not an extension of the first

1782
01:01:15,349 --> 01:01:15,359
Circle. Not an extension of the first
 

1783
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:16,870
Circle. Not an extension of the first
circle.

1784
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:16,880
circle.
 

1785
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:23,589
circle.
Not a push down.

1786
01:01:23,589 --> 01:01:23,599

 

1787
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:26,549

your feel for it. So here you let's say

1788
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:26,559
your feel for it. So here you let's say
 

1789
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,030
your feel for it. So here you let's say
you're training here and I go, "Yeah, I

1790
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:29,040
you're training here and I go, "Yeah, I
 

1791
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,789
you're training here and I go, "Yeah, I
can see you feeling and working on what

1792
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:30,799
can see you feeling and working on what
 

1793

that they have to keep moving and then I

All of this in the end only lands on a
skill

1978
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:53,119
skill
 

1979
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:58,950
skill
which is relative and perishable.

1980
01:07:58,950 --> 01:07:58,960

overaggitation
 

1987
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:15,589
overaggitation
and my skill level has now faltered.

1989
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:21,269

And that can be very emotional.

1990
01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:21,279

 

1991
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:26,390

I'm becoming reactive. That's why the

1998
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:37,600
I'm becoming reactive. That's why the
 

1999
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,030
I'm becoming reactive. That's why the
training works on the spirit because

2000
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:39,040
training works on the spirit because
 

2001
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,390
training works on the spirit because
you're not allowed to be reactive. You

2002
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:40,400
you're not allowed to be reactive. You
 

2003
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,950
you're not allowed to be reactive. You
have to let go.

2004
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:42,960

2005
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,950

And then um
I grew up in Pomona.

2088
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:14,640
I grew up in Pomona.
 

2089
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,630
I grew up in Pomona.
There's a there's black gangs in Compton

2090
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:16,640
There's a there's black gangs in Compton
 

2091
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,470
There's a there's black gangs in Compton
and there was Mexican gangs in uh Pomona

2092
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:20,480
and there was Mexican gangs in uh Pomona
 

2093
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,750
and there was Mexican gangs in uh Pomona
and there it was so bad at certain times

2094
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:23,760
and there it was so bad at certain times
 

2095
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,070
and there it was so bad at certain times
that just don't go into that area. Do

2096
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:26,080
that just don't go into that area. Do
 

2097
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,910
that just don't go into that area. Do
not go into that area. You can't. So

2098
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:27,920
not go into that area. You can't. So
 

2099
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,510
not go into that area. You can't. So
that's why I was like Sean lives in that

2100
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:29,520
that's why I was like Sean lives in that
 

2101
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,229
that's why I was like Sean lives in that
area. I got to go pick up Sean. But my

2102
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:32,239
area. I got to go pick up Sean. But my
 

2103
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,630
area. I got to go pick up Sean. But my
whole instinct from the Pomona area is

2104
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:34,640
whole instinct from the Pomona area is
 

2105
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,790
whole instinct from the Pomona area is
like you see all the tagging. You see

2106
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:36,800
like you see all the tagging. You see
 

2107
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,310
like you see all the tagging. You see
all that kind of stuff is like you don't

2108
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:38,320
all that kind of stuff is like you don't
 

2109
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,830
all that kind of stuff is like you don't
go into that area. Okay. So these gangs

2110
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:41,840
go into that area. Okay. So these gangs
 

2111
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,910
go into that area. Okay. So these gangs
also run the prison and the jail systems

2112
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:45,920
also run the prison and the jail systems
 

2113
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:52,709
also run the prison and the jail systems
which to this day they do.

2114
01:11:52,709 --> 01:11:52,719

 

2115
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:56,709

So this gang task force is trying to get

2116
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:56,719
So this gang task force is trying to get
 

2117
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:02,870
So this gang task force is trying to get
early on. Okay.

2118
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:02,880

 

2119
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,030

And they try to give the kids, you know,

2120
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:05,040
And they try to give the kids, you know,
 

2121
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,189
And they try to give the kids, you know,
makes sense. I try to give them an

2122
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:07,199
makes sense. I try to give them an
 

2123
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,750
makes sense. I try to give them an
activity to do

2124
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:09,760
activity to do
 

2125
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,229
activity to do
something to lead them a different way

2126
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:12,239
something to lead them a different way
 

2127
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,590
something to lead them a different way
and give them different mentors.

2128
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:15,600
and give them different mentors.
 

2129
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,830
and give them different mentors.
But every activity sooner or later is

2130
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:17,840
But every activity sooner or later is
 

2131
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,350
But every activity sooner or later is
going to rub up against our own

2132
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:19,360
going to rub up against our own
 

2133
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,310
going to rub up against our own
fragility.

2134
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:22,320
fragility.
 

2135
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,709
fragility.
So they're like there's there's

2136
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:24,719
So they're like there's there's
 

2137
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:29,110
So they're like there's there's
fragility here.

2138
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:29,120

 

2139
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,350

We need grit.

2140
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:31,360
We need grit.
 

2141
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:35,189
We need grit.
you you would go

2142
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:35,199

 

2143
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:38,149

to symposium after symposium and they're

2144
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:38,159
to symposium after symposium and they're
 

2145
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:41,350
to symposium after symposium and they're
talking about this fragility that is

2146
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:41,360
talking about this fragility that is
 

2147
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,110
talking about this fragility that is
there and then

2148
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,120

 

2149
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,229

the need for grit.

2150
01:12:48,229 --> 01:12:48,239
the need for grit.
 

2151
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,750
the need for grit.
Now, it was interesting because

2152
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:51,760
Now, it was interesting because
 

2153
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,830
Now, it was interesting because
no one ever

2154
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:53,840
no one ever
 

2155
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,630
no one ever
at one of those conferences

2156
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:56,640
at one of those conferences
 

2157
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,550
at one of those conferences
said, "How do you cultivate grit?"

2158
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:00,560
said, "How do you cultivate grit?"
 

2159
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,510
said, "How do you cultivate grit?"
It was never brought up. And I always

2160
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:03,520
It was never brought up. And I always
 

2161
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,669
It was never brought up. And I always
suspected

2162
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:05,679
suspected
 

2163
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:08,390
suspected
because

2164
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:08,400
because
 

2165
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:14,950
because
it's become a dirty thing.

2166
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:14,960

 

2167
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,669

If you read that book grid and you just

2168
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:17,679
If you read that book grid and you just
 

2169
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:21,910
If you read that book grid and you just
go to the question, let me get to where

2170
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:21,920
go to the question, let me get to where
 

2171
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,990
go to the question, let me get to where
she's going to talk about cultivating

2172
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:24,000
she's going to talk about cultivating
 

2173
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,470
she's going to talk about cultivating
it. You're not going to get the clear

2174
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:26,480
it. You're not going to get the clear
 

2175
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,149
it. You're not going to get the clear
answer

2176
01:13:28,149 --> 01:13:28,159
answer
 

2177
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:31,189
answer
because the clear answer is someone

2178
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:31,199
because the clear answer is someone
 

2179
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:34,229
because the clear answer is someone
sooner or later told you to stop being a

01:13:34,229 --> 01:13:36,709
sooner or later told you to stop being a

2182
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:41,189

and held you to it.

2183
01:13:41,189 --> 01:13:41,199

 

2184
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:50,950

Well, those days are probably gone.

2185
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:50,960

 

2186
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,430

and not for bad reasons,

2187
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:55,440
and not for bad reasons,
 

2188
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,630
and not for bad reasons,
but we can do it to ourselves. We can

2189
01:13:58,630 --> 01:13:58,640
but we can do it to ourselves. We can
 

2190
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,830
but we can do it to ourselves. We can
hold ourselves to the fire

2191
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:01,840
hold ourselves to the fire
 

2192
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,830
hold ourselves to the fire
and be very mindful when we're wishing

2193
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:05,840
and be very mindful when we're wishing
 

2194
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,870
and be very mindful when we're wishing
our way out of the heat, okay? And try

2195
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:08,880
our way out of the heat, okay? And try
 

2196
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:18,470
our way out of the heat, okay? And try
to hold on a little bit more.

2197
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:18,480

 

2198
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:21,590

in that in that I told you someone

2199
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:21,600
in that in that I told you someone
 

2200
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,229
in that in that I told you someone
mentioned in the academy and the recruit

2201
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:24,239
mentioned in the academy and the recruit
 

2202
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:27,830
mentioned in the academy and the recruit
started crying and I got in his face and

2203
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:27,840
started crying and I got in his face and
 

2204
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,990
started crying and I got in his face and
I did your department issue you those

2205
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
I did your department issue you those
 

2206
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:37,830
I did your department issue you those
tears

2207
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:37,840

 

2208
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,910

then get them off your face you're out

2209
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:39,920
then get them off your face you're out
 

2210

then get them off your face you're out

01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:42,880
of policy and then He has to write a
 

2212
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,430
of policy and then He has to write a
memo on the importance of following

2213
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:45,440
memo on the importance of following

department policy.
But it's no different than that movie

But it's no different than that movie

2221
01:14:58,070 --> 01:14:58,080

 

2222
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,310

What what we're looking for is look the

2223
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:00,320
What what we're looking for is look the
 

2224
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,550
What what we're looking for is look the
training is going to be by default

2225
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:02,560
training is going to be by default
 

2226
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,470
training is going to be by default
uncomfortable.

2227
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:04,480
uncomfortable.
 

2228
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,149
uncomfortable.
The environment is going to be

2229
01:15:06,149 --> 01:15:06,159
The environment is going to be
 

2230
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:08,070
The environment is going to be
uncomfortable because only thing that's

2231
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:08,080
uncomfortable because only thing that's
 

2232
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,630
uncomfortable because only thing that's
comfortable is how I am right now.

2233
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:10,640
comfortable is how I am right now.
 

2234
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:15,270
comfortable is how I am right now.
Anything

2235
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:15,280

 

2236
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,110

that is comfortable is because I can do

2237
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:17,120
that is comfortable is because I can do
 

2238
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,270
that is comfortable is because I can do
it right now because I am right now what

2239
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:19,280
it right now because I am right now what
 

2240
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,310
it right now because I am right now what
that is asking me to be. By default then

2241
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:22,320
that is asking me to be. By default then
 

2242
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:26,870
that is asking me to be. By default then
any any growth has a growing pain to it.

2243
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:26,880
any any growth has a growing pain to it.
 

2244
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,030
any any growth has a growing pain to it.
And then by default my ability to take

2245
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:29,040
And then by default my ability to take
 

2246
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,430
And then by default my ability to take
the growing pain is also inhibiting how

2247
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:31,440
the growing pain is also inhibiting how
 

2248
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,229
the growing pain is also inhibiting how
much I progress or not.

2249
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:34,239
much I progress or not.
 

2250
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:39,430
much I progress or not.
There's just no way around it.

2251
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:39,440

 

2252
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,430

Now, a good teacher is going to balance

2253
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:41,440
Now, a good teacher is going to balance
 

2254
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,910
Now, a good teacher is going to balance
it because

2255
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:43,920
it because
 

2256
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:52,070
it because
you can't be broken that way, right?

2257
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:52,080

 

2258
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,709

That's how we got here. No more No more

2259
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:54,719
That's how we got here. No more No more
 

2260
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:57,430
That's how we got here. No more No more
calling each other No more saying

2261
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:57,440
calling each other No more saying
 

2262
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,510
calling each other No more saying
cowboy up. You get it? No more

2263
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:01,520
cowboy up. You get it? No more
 

2264
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:09,030
cowboy up. You get it? No more
teaching people by breaking people.

2265
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:09,040

 

2266
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,590

But we can't get away from this

2267
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:11,600
But we can't get away from this
 

2268
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,470
But we can't get away from this
structural relationship. Progress is

2269
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:14,480
structural relationship. Progress is
 

2270
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,149
structural relationship. Progress is
eventually got to be outside your

2271
01:16:16,149 --> 01:16:16,159
eventually got to be outside your
 

2272
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:18,870
eventually got to be outside your
comfort zone. Your ability to hang and

2273
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:18,880
comfort zone. Your ability to hang and
 

2274
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,510
comfort zone. Your ability to hang and
survive outside your comfort zone is

2275
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:21,520
survive outside your comfort zone is
 

2276
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,070
survive outside your comfort zone is
determining how much you progress and at

2277
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:24,080
determining how much you progress and at
 

2278
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:28,790
determining how much you progress and at
what rate. There's no way around it.

2279
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:28,800

 

2280
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,669

So just like the the UK does what

2281
01:16:31,669 --> 01:16:31,679
So just like the the UK does what
 

2282
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,110
So just like the the UK does what
they're supposed to do, does their

2283
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:33,120
they're supposed to do, does their
 

2284
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,430
they're supposed to do, does their
assignment, and then the Navia does

2285
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:35,440

does that make sense? It's still paying
 

2388
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:03,430
does that make sense? It's still paying
off. There's still people nowhere near

01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:03,440
off. There's still people nowhere near
 

2390
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,630
off. There's still people nowhere near
working on this stuff. Got it? They're

on you. You have to adjust to keep the

2445
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:06,880
on you. You have to adjust to keep the
 

2446
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,870
on you. You have to adjust to keep the
feeling, to keep the organization, to

2447
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:08,880
feeling, to keep the organization, to
 

2448
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,350
feeling, to keep the organization, to
keep the force tension going. So before

2449
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:11,360
keep the force tension going. So before
 

2450
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:15,750
keep the force tension going. So before
I let my elbow bend, I have all of this

2451
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:15,760
I let my elbow bend, I have all of this
 

2452
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,310
I let my elbow bend, I have all of this
range. And if that was not enough, then

2453
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:18,320
range. And if that was not enough, then
 

2454
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:22,070
range. And if that was not enough, then
I just moved.

2455
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:22,080

 

2456
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,510

Got it? Okay. So what we were doing

2457
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:25,520
Got it? Okay. So what we were doing
 

2458
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,950
Got it? Okay. So what we were doing
instead is

2459
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:28,960
instead is
 

2460
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,669
instead is
trying to hold it. And now we learning a

2461
01:21:31,669 --> 01:21:31,679
trying to hold it. And now we learning a
 

2462
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,189
trying to hold it. And now we learning a
lie that is not conducive to what we

2463
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:35,199
lie that is not conducive to what we
 

2464
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:39,270
lie that is not conducive to what we
could ever utilize. Okay. So let's do

2465
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:39,280
could ever utilize. Okay. So let's do
 

2466
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,870
could ever utilize. Okay. So let's do
that just for a little bit. Um so that

2467
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:42,880
that just for a little bit. Um so that
 

2468
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,270
that just for a little bit. Um so that
we understand what I just said. So when

2469
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:45,280
we understand what I just said. So when
 

2470
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,470
we understand what I just said. So when
we do kihon waza you do you make the

2471
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:48,480
we do kihon waza you do you make the
 

2472
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,950
we do kihon waza you do you make the
technique work as it's just given to you

2473
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:50,960
technique work as it's just given to you
 

2474
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,669
technique work as it's just given to you
for whatever the uk is doing in light of

2475
01:21:53,669 --> 01:21:53,679
for whatever the uk is doing in light of
 

2476
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:55,830
for whatever the uk is doing in light of
whatever you can do with that force

2477
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:55,840
whatever you can do with that force
 

2478
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,870
whatever you can do with that force
engine and you will fluctuate between

2479
01:21:58,870 --> 01:21:58,880
engine and you will fluctuate between
 

2480
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,189
engine and you will fluctuate between
external and internal you got it okay so

2481
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:03,199
external and internal you got it okay so
 

2482
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:06,149
external and internal you got it okay so
it's not that

2483
01:22:06,149 --> 01:22:06,159
it's not that
 

2484
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:10,470
it's not that
it's not that I let him push me

2485
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:10,480
it's not that I let him push me
 

2486
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:16,550
it's not that I let him push me
and do you get that I didn't do back

2487
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:16,560

 

2488
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,470

because as soon as I did it, I already

2489
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:18,480
because as soon as I did it, I already
 

2490
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,189
because as soon as I did it, I already
have his center.

2491
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:21,199
have his center.
 

2492
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:24,310
have his center.
He's He's moving. It's already seized.

2493
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:24,320
He's He's moving. It's already seized.
 

2494
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,629
He's He's moving. It's already seized.
Okay. And I'm already going to pass it

2495
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:26,639
Okay. And I'm already going to pass it
 

2496
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:27,990
Okay. And I'm already going to pass it
and I'm already going to do the

2497
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:28,000
and I'm already going to do the
 

2498
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,149
and I'm already going to do the
technique. Okay. All right. So, try

2499
01:22:30,149 --> 01:22:30,159
technique. Okay. All right. So, try
 

2500
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:37,350
technique. Okay. All right. So, try
that. You don't have to stay still. Go.

2501
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:37,360

 

2502
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,590

You have to do the energy equations.

2503
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:39,600
You have to do the energy equations.
 

2504
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,830
You have to do the energy equations.
That's all. So, let's see how light and

2505
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:41,840
That's all. So, let's see how light and
 

2506
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:58,709
That's all. So, let's see how light and
slow you can do this. Okay.

2507
01:22:58,709 --> 01:22:58,719

 

2508
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:00,310

That's from your downward your

2509
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:00,320
That's from your downward your
 

2510
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,990
That's from your downward your
downwardness. You need to tighten the

2511
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:02,000
downwardness. You need to tighten the
 

2512
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:09,669
downwardness. You need to tighten the
circle. Needs to keep going.

2513
01:23:09,669 --> 01:23:09,679

 

2514
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:14,070

See the down.

2515
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:14,080

 

2516
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,310

That's it.

2517
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:16,320
That's it.
 

2518
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:29,270
That's it.
Switch rolls if you have it.

2519
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:29,280

 

2520
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:42,709

Dude, do this.

2521
01:23:42,709 --> 01:23:42,719

 

2522
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:44,629

Better.

2523
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:44,639
Better.
 

2524
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:47,030
Better.
Okay. All right. The next thing, the

2525
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:47,040
Okay. All right. The next thing, the
 

2526
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:52,070
Okay. All right. The next thing, the
last point for the deep breach is,

2527
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:52,080
last point for the deep breach is,
 

2528
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:57,350
last point for the deep breach is,
did you notice how many times for no

2529
01:23:57,350 --> 01:23:57,360
did you notice how many times for no
 

2530
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,790
did you notice how many times for no
freaking reason?

2531
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:00,800

 

2532
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,629

Okay. So, what's that saying about my

2533
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:02,639
Okay. So, what's that saying about my
 

2534
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,830
Okay. So, what's that saying about my
body mind? I'm very institutionalized.

2535
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:05,840
body mind? I'm very institutionalized.
 

2536
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,470
body mind? I'm very institutionalized.
Okay. The form things for me, not the

2537
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:08,480
Okay. The form things for me, not the
 

2538
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,470
Okay. The form things for me, not the
inertia or the technique or things like

2539
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:10,480
inertia or the technique or things like
 

2540
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:15,590
inertia or the technique or things like
that. Okay. Um to me that's the same

2541
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:15,600
that. Okay. Um to me that's the same
 

2542
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,590
that. Okay. Um to me that's the same
thing when

2543
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:17,600
thing when
 

2544
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,350
thing when
I am uh basically I'm not present.

2545
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:21,360
I am uh basically I'm not present.
 

2546
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,550
I am uh basically I'm not present.
That's what's happening. I'm not

2547
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:22,560
That's what's happening. I'm not
 

2548
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,790
That's what's happening. I'm not
present. Okay. It's the same exact thing

2549
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:24,800
present. Okay. It's the same exact thing
 

2550
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,510
present. Okay. It's the same exact thing
when my I don't move my feet and I let

2551
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:27,520
when my I don't move my feet and I let
 

2552
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,430
when my I don't move my feet and I let
that happen. You get it? When

2553
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:31,440
that happen. You get it? When
 

2554
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,750
that happen. You get it? When
or you know like in weapons remember if

2555
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:33,760
or you know like in weapons remember if
 

2556
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,229
or you know like in weapons remember if
there's so much pressure don't don't try

2557
01:24:36,229 --> 01:24:36,239
there's so much pressure don't don't try
 

2558
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:37,910
there's so much pressure don't don't try
to do that footwork. get some pressure

2559
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:37,920
to do that footwork. get some pressure
 

2560
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,750
to do that footwork. get some pressure
off of there, then come in and do that

2561
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:39,760
off of there, then come in and do that
 

2562
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,149
off of there, then come in and do that
that kind of thing. Be in the in the

2563
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:42,159
that kind of thing. Be in the in the
 

2564
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:43,590
that kind of thing. Be in the in the
now. Be in the moment. What are you

2565
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:43,600
now. Be in the moment. What are you
 

2566
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,070
now. Be in the moment. What are you
actually facing? Instead of thinking

2567
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:46,080
actually facing? Instead of thinking
 

2568
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,870
actually facing? Instead of thinking
that a technique is what is going to

2569
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:48,880
that a technique is what is going to
 

2570
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,110
that a technique is what is going to
work, that's what the institution has

2571
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:51,120
work, that's what the institution has
 

2572
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,350
work, that's what the institution has
convinced us. Here's some techniques.

2573
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:53,360
convinced us. Here's some techniques.
 

2574
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,350
convinced us. Here's some techniques.
Here's your deck of techniques. And then

2575
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:55,360
Here's your deck of techniques. And then
 

2576
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,709
Here's your deck of techniques. And then
when you're ready, he's going to pull

2577
01:24:56,709 --> 01:24:56,719
when you're ready, he's going to pull
 

2578
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,310
when you're ready, he's going to pull
out,

2579
01:24:58,310 --> 01:24:58,320
out,
 

2580
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,229
out,
you know, the right card to do the right

2581
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:00,239
you know, the right card to do the right
 

2582
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:01,990
you know, the right card to do the right
technique. That's not how it happens.

2583
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:02,000
technique. That's not how it happens.
 

2584
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,350
technique. That's not how it happens.
Okay. Um

2585
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:05,360
Okay. Um
 

2586
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,270
Okay. Um
same thing like

2587
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:07,280
same thing like
 

2588
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,629
same thing like
uh when yes ground but can't ground

2589
01:25:10,629 --> 01:25:10,639
uh when yes ground but can't ground
 

2590
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:12,390
uh when yes ground but can't ground
where he's now going to break my ankle.

2591
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:12,400
where he's now going to break my ankle.
 

2592
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,030
where he's now going to break my ankle.
So ground and then get out of the way.

2593
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:15,040
So ground and then get out of the way.
 

2594
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,030
So ground and then get out of the way.
Okay. Right. Make sense? Right. You got

2595
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:17,040
Okay. Right. Make sense? Right. You got
 

2596
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,390
Okay. Right. Make sense? Right. You got
to stay in the moment. You got to stay

2597
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:18,400
to stay in the moment. You got to stay
 

2598
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,470
to stay in the moment. You got to stay
dynamic. You got to stay fluid natural

2599
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:20,480
dynamic. You got to stay fluid natural
 

2600
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:24,870
dynamic. You got to stay fluid natural
kind of stuff. Um

2601

just start stopping and thinking kind of

2661
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:42,080
just start stopping and thinking kind of
 

2662
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,990
just start stopping and thinking kind of
stuff. That's all just fettered. We're

2663
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:44,000
stuff. That's all just fettered. We're
 

2664
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,590
stuff. That's all just fettered. We're
just fettered right now. Okay. Um

2665
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:47,600
just fettered right now. Okay. Um
 

2666
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,790
just fettered right now. Okay. Um
so try to stay in that moment. Release.

2667
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:50,800
so try to stay in that moment. Release.
 

2668
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,430
so try to stay in that moment. Release.
We're getting tired. As we get tired, we

2669
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:53,440
We're getting tired. As we get tired, we
 

2670
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,470
We're getting tired. As we get tired, we
get agitated as I described it. And it's

2671
01:26:56,470 --> 01:26:56,480
get agitated as I described it. And it's
 

2672
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,149
get agitated as I described it. And it's
more difficult to release and

2673
01:26:58,149 --> 01:26:58,159
more difficult to release and
 

2674
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:00,229
more difficult to release and
deconstruct the ego tripartite mind

2675
01:27:00,229 --> 01:27:00,239
deconstruct the ego tripartite mind
 

2676
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,629
deconstruct the ego tripartite mind
which is why intensive camps are

2677
01:27:02,629 --> 01:27:02,639
which is why intensive camps are
 

2678
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:08,520
which is why intensive camps are
insightful into us. Okay. Thank you.
