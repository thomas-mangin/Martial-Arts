a few times so you can kind of see

32
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,130
a few times so you can kind of see
 

33
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,860
a few times so you can kind of see
what's going on we're gonna use the

34
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:36,870
what's going on we're gonna use the
 

35
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,720
what's going on we're gonna use the
infamous pool noodle for it the reason

36
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:38,730
infamous pool noodle for it the reason
 

37
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,820
infamous pool noodle for it the reason
we use this pool noodle is because the

38
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:40,830
we use this pool noodle is because the
 

39
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,460
we use this pool noodle is because the
pool noodle offers us the ability to

40
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:43,470
pool noodle offers us the ability to
 

41
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,430
pool noodle offers us the ability to
train the the defender to hit full steam

42
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:46,440
train the the defender to hit full steam
 

43
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,110
train the the defender to hit full steam
so you can hit as hard as he wants and

44
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,120
so you can hit as hard as he wants and
 

45
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,610
so you can hit as hard as he wants and
he won't feel guilty about it you won't

46
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:49,620
he won't feel guilty about it you won't
 

47
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,870
he won't feel guilty about it you won't
feel bad because the poolroom so it

48
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:50,880
feel bad because the poolroom so it
 

49
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,330
feel bad because the poolroom so it
doesn't actually hurt so we want to

50
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:53,340
doesn't actually hurt so we want to
 

51
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,950
doesn't actually hurt so we want to
train ourselves to have that ability so

52
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
train ourselves to have that ability so
 

53
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,060
train ourselves to have that ability so
if we were defending ourselves the

54
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,070
if we were defending ourselves the
 

55
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,380
if we were defending ourselves the
weapon and someone's coming at us we

56
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:57,390
weapon and someone's coming at us we
 

57
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,600
weapon and someone's coming at us we
learn how to hit and move it and move it

58
00:00:59,600 --> 00:00:59,610
learn how to hit and move it and move it
 

59
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,300
learn how to hit and move it and move it
move it's also good for our defender

60
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:02,310
move it's also good for our defender
 

61
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,440
move it's also good for our defender
because our defender won't take

62
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:03,450
because our defender won't take
 

63
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,020
because our defender won't take
unnecessary precautions right so while

64
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,030
unnecessary precautions right so while
 

65
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,120
unnecessary precautions right so while
an intelligent person will likely if I

66
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,130
an intelligent person will likely if I
 

67
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,069
an intelligent person will likely if I
swing a leg pipe what not to get hit by

68
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:10,079
swing a leg pipe what not to get hit by
 

69
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,080
swing a leg pipe what not to get hit by
the lead pipe a crazy person or a person

the box we're gonna use today
if Josh goes out of bounds for any

00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
if Josh goes out of bounds for any
 

93
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,309
if Josh goes out of bounds for any
reason while he's the the defender then

she tears it out of his hand that's it
 

109
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,969
she tears it out of his hand that's it
he loses so he loses if he steps out of

noodle he loses if mine is able to

114
00:01:56,809 --> 00:01:56,819
noodle he loses if mine is able to
 

115
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:58,849
noodle he loses if mine is able to
stagnate him okay so stagnation means

116
00:01:58,849 --> 00:01:58,859
stagnate him okay so stagnation means
 

117
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:00,949
stagnate him okay so stagnation means
that he's controlled in a way that he

118
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:00,959
that he's controlled in a way that he
 

119
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,510
that he's controlled in a way that he
can't really use that weapon right now

120
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,520
can't really use that weapon right now
 

121
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,889
can't really use that weapon right now
he could try to switch the weapon and do

122
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:03,899
he could try to switch the weapon and do
 

123
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,660
he could try to switch the weapon and do
whatever now if he can use the weapon

124
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:05,670
whatever now if he can use the weapon
 

125
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,330
whatever now if he can use the weapon
right so he can hit him with that weapon

126
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:07,340
right so he can hit him with that weapon
 

127
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,580
right so he can hit him with that weapon
then he's not stagnated so if he had

128
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:10,590
then he's not stagnated so if he had
 

129
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,740
then he's not stagnated so if he had
stagnated for around two three seconds

130
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:12,750
stagnated for around two three seconds
 

131
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,880
stagnated for around two three seconds
he's just kind of a judgment call it

132
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:13,890
he's just kind of a judgment call it
 

133
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,080
he's just kind of a judgment call it
looks like he's actually stagnated

134
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,090
looks like he's actually stagnated
 

135
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,710
looks like he's actually stagnated
meaning he can't really use that

136
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
meaning he can't really use that
 

137
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,830
meaning he can't really use that
and effectively then he's also out or if

138
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
and effectively then he's also out or if
 

139
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,780
and effectively then he's also out or if
any part other than his feet touches the

140
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:21,790
any part other than his feet touches the
 

141
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,190
any part other than his feet touches the
ground so this hand comes down and

142
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
ground so this hand comes down and
 

143
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,020
ground so this hand comes down and
touches the ground or he drops a knee or

144
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,030
touches the ground or he drops a knee or
 

145
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,640
touches the ground or he drops a knee or
definitely his butt hits the ground he's

146
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:26,650
definitely his butt hits the ground he's
 

147
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,530
definitely his butt hits the ground he's
out so all four of those things will end

148
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:28,540
out so all four of those things will end
 

149
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,450
out so all four of those things will end
it for Josh he goes out of bounds he

150
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:30,460
it for Josh he goes out of bounds he
 

151
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,060
it for Josh he goes out of bounds he
loses his weapon he gets stagnated or he

152
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,070
loses his weapon he gets stagnated or he
 

153
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,560
loses his weapon he gets stagnated or he
gets knocked on the ground or touches

154
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:34,570
gets knocked on the ground or touches
 

155
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,210
gets knocked on the ground or touches
the ground anyway with anything other

156
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:36,220
the ground anyway with anything other
 

157
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,090
the ground anyway with anything other
