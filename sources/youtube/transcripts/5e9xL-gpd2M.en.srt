00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:46,200
the moment she's present but probably if
you film her and she's watching it and

you film her and she's watching it and
 

655

adolescent view of non-resistance
 

709
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,120
adolescent view of non-resistance
and the art of peace is that adolescent

and the art of peace is that adolescent
 

711
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:11,940
and the art of peace is that adolescent
view very philosophically immature view

712

713
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,640

like to contrast this okay you can

714
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:15,650
like to contrast this okay you can
 

715
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,380
like to contrast this okay you can
either do martial arts where you're

either do martial arts where you're
going to kick the crap out of someone or

718
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:20,360
going to kick the crap out of someone or
 

719
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:27,100
going to kick the crap out of someone or
you can do this sube but that's that's

720
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,110
you can do this sube but that's that's
 

721
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:31,299
you can do this sube but that's that's
what how dabbler is always talk they

722
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:31,309
what how dabbler is always talk they
 

723
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:34,299
what how dabbler is always talk they
know the words but they don't have the

724
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:34,309
know the words but they don't have the
 

725
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:37,090
know the words but they don't have the
understanding and so they're like kids

726
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:37,100
understanding and so they're like kids
 

727
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:42,220
understanding and so they're like kids
they're like kids we kids here mommy and

728
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:42,230
they're like kids we kids here mommy and
 

729
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,500
they're like kids we kids here mommy and
daddy talking and they're playing their

730
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:44,510
daddy talking and they're playing their
 

731
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,750
daddy talking and they're playing their
little doll game they use the words but

732
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:46,760
little doll game they use the words but
 

733
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,480
little doll game they use the words but
they have no concept of how that works

734
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:49,490
they have no concept of how that works
 

735
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,510
they have no concept of how that works
and so you get these very strange ideas

736
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:52,520
and so you get these very strange ideas
 

737
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,930
and so you get these very strange ideas
that I can either be sube I can either

on form not stuck in form so take the
 

763
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,900
on form not stuck in form so take the
technique we had we just did one slight

764

that arm writing to this now I'm going

782
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,190
that arm writing to this now I'm going
 

783
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:11,660
that arm writing to this now I'm going
to push the hip with their arm

784
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:11,670

 

785
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:15,890

do you see how that the hip is a direct

786
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:15,900
do you see how that the hip is a direct
 

787
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,450
do you see how that the hip is a direct
manipulation of what needs to be

788
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:18,460
manipulation of what needs to be
 

789
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,210
manipulation of what needs to be
manipulated the arm is an indirect

790
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:21,220
manipulated the arm is an indirect
 

791
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,690
manipulated the arm is an indirect
manipulation so the arm indirect

792
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:24,700
manipulation so the arm indirect
 

793
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,980
manipulation so the arm indirect
manipulations allow you to almost they

794
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:28,990
manipulations allow you to almost they
 

795
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,680
manipulations allow you to almost they
work like a pulley in the sense that you

796
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:31,690
work like a pulley in the sense that you
 

797
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,860
work like a pulley in the sense that you
won't require as much strength to affect

798
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:34,870
won't require as much strength to affect
 

799
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,490
won't require as much strength to affect
whatever it is you want to affect but

800
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:37,500
whatever it is you want to affect but
 

801
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,650
whatever it is you want to affect but
you have a delay and you'll have slack

802
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:40,660
you have a delay and you'll have slack
 

803
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,160
you have a delay and you'll have slack
all that kind of stuff so in this case I

804
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,170
all that kind of stuff so in this case I
 

805
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:49,380
all that kind of stuff so in this case I
make the hip very light how how is it

806
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:49,390
make the hip very light how how is it
 

807
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:54,180
make the hip very light how how is it
hit made very life by bringing the head

808
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:54,190
hit made very life by bringing the head
 

809
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,520
hit made very life by bringing the head
around there ain't nothing on the hip so

810
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:56,530
around there ain't nothing on the hip so
 

811
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,950
around there ain't nothing on the hip so

go to that video that would be the
 

1143
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:09,840
go to that video that would be the
reconciliation of form anomaly what that

1144
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:09,850
reconciliation of form anomaly what that
 

1145
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:14,100
reconciliation of form anomaly what that
is what that that rejection of form for

1146
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,110
is what that that rejection of form for
 

1147
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,220
is what that that rejection of form for
an attachment to non form is what I

1148

an attachment to non form is what I
 

1149
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,660
an attachment to non form is what I
would call a part of that adolescent
