off so that you can enter. And what that
 

25
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,150
off so that you can enter. And what that
does is it stops his

00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,160
does is it stops his
 

27
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,110
does is it stops his
head. And that is him assisting you,

begins to fall, that's where this hand
 

103
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,509
begins to fall, that's where this hand
loses its

goes, "Okay, discovery learning. Go."
 

163
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,550
goes, "Okay, discovery learning. Go."
Okay. So, what I was saying was it's not

164
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
Okay. So, what I was saying was it's not
 

165
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,029
Okay. So, what I was saying was it's not
that I go here and I try to get there

166
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
that I go here and I try to get there
 

167
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,150
that I go here and I try to get there
really fast. It's just that I'm keeping

168
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
really fast. It's just that I'm keeping
 

169
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,790
really fast. It's just that I'm keeping
the control

170
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:01,800
the control
 

171
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:22,270
the control
points that keep his head moving on that

172
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:22,280

 

173
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,230

tilt. Just keep that head moving on the

174
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
tilt. Just keep that head moving on the
 

175
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:39,590
tilt. Just keep that head moving on the
tilt.

176
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600

 

177
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:57,350

That's all I'm doing.

178
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360

 

179
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,670

Then you put the trap

180
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:00,680

 

181
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:12,350

in. You

182
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:12,360

 

183
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,230

see? Do you see that? Okay. So, we've

184
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
see? Do you see that? Okay. So, we've
 

185
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,110
see? Do you see that? Okay. So, we've
done that drill before, right? Just

186
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
done that drill before, right? Just
 

187
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,710
done that drill before, right? Just
focus on the elbow. But you have to be

188
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:21,720
focus on the elbow. But you have to be
 

189
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,950
focus on the elbow. But you have to be
careful because the tilt is the spiral

190
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:27,960
careful because the tilt is the spiral
 

191
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,830
careful because the tilt is the spiral
rotation. It's not you're here and

192
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
rotation. It's not you're here and
 

193
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,230
rotation. It's not you're here and
you're pushing him away. Do do you get

194
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,240
you're pushing him away. Do do you get
 

195
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,710
you're pushing him away. Do do you get
that? You're you're you're tilting him

196
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:39,720
that? You're you're you're tilting him
 

197
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,469
that? You're you're you're tilting him
into the kazushi pattern.

198
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:43,479
into the kazushi pattern.
 

199
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:48,150
into the kazushi pattern.
Sorry. So he has to go around you. Boom.

200
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
Sorry. So he has to go around you. Boom.
 

201
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,909
Sorry. So he has to go around you. Boom.
This way.

202
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
This way.
 

203
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,550
This way.
which means you have to enter with the

204
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
which means you have to enter with the
 

205
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,869
which means you have to enter with the
turn.

206
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:53,879
turn.
 

207
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,550
turn.
Okay? So, you're doing all that and all

208
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
Okay? So, you're doing all that and all
 

209
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,950
Okay? So, you're doing all that and all
that gets easier as you control the

210
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
that gets easier as you control the
 

211
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,710
that gets easier as you control the
wrist, but you should not be dependent

212
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
wrist, but you should not be dependent
 

213
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,909
wrist, but you should not be dependent
on the wrist. Okay?

214
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
on the wrist. Okay?
 

215
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,319
on the wrist. Okay?
Try.
