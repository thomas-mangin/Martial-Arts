personally I don't think it works even

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:02,380
personally I don't think it works even
 

97
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,230
personally I don't think it works even
in that I'd realize the world I don't

98

in that I'd realize the world I don't
 

99
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,030
in that I'd realize the world I don't
think it works because there's certain

100
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:09,040
think it works because there's certain
 

101
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,220
think it works because there's certain
elements and aspects that not would be

elements and aspects that not would be
 

103
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:18,420
elements and aspects that not would be
in place in order for you to progress we

104
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:18,430
in place in order for you to progress we
 

105
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,090
in place in order for you to progress we
call that progressions because you have

106
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:21,100
call that progressions because you have
 

107
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,550
call that progressions because you have
to have this to do that to do that to do

108
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:23,560
to have this to do that to do that to do
 

109
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,980
to have this to do that to do that to do
that to do that it is no different than

00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:25,990
that to do that it is no different than

I can't take you to the range if you

112
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:28,419
I can't take you to the range if you
 

113
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:36,450
I can't take you to the range if you
cannot safely operate the firearm you

114
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:36,460
cannot safely operate the firearm you
 

115
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:50,410
cannot safely operate the firearm you
have to have that before we go

116
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:50,420

 

117
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:56,320

so when I say go do that technique over

118
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,330
so when I say go do that technique over
 

119
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,330
so when I say go do that technique over
there I'll tell you I'm going to share

120
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:58,340
there I'll tell you I'm going to share
 

121
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,390
there I'll tell you I'm going to share
with you my points of view

122
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
with you my points of view
 

123
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:08,500
with you my points of view
the first thing that happened is I said

124
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:08,510
the first thing that happened is I said
 

125
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,090
the first thing that happened is I said
to do an IP adhesion and then you did

126
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:13,100
to do an IP adhesion and then you did
 

127
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:20,470
to do an IP adhesion and then you did
deflections okay then we have a separate

128
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:20,480
deflections okay then we have a separate
 

129
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,080
deflections okay then we have a separate
the clouds because if you're going to do

130
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,090
the clouds because if you're going to do
 

131
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,010
the clouds because if you're going to do
a our deflections this just that would

132
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,020
a our deflections this just that would
 

133
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,890
a our deflections this just that would
speed reinforce together it does nothing

134
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:29,900
speed reinforce together it does nothing
 

135
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,410
speed reinforce together it does nothing
to do with what I want I don't want you

136
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:32,420
to do with what I want I don't want you
 

137
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:39,070
to do with what I want I don't want you
to do it our reflections but if I let

138
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,080
to do it our reflections but if I let
 

139
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,500
to do it our reflections but if I let
you do our reflections you really create

140
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:41,510
you do our reflections you really create
 

141
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,440
you do our reflections you really create
deflections and deflections are not as

142
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:44,450
deflections and deflections are not as
 

143
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,480
deflections and deflections are not as
good as you think they are nor are they

144
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:46,490
good as you think they are nor are they
 

145
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,560
good as you think they are nor are they
the arms okay so then we said okay you

146
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:50,570
the arms okay so then we said okay you
 

147
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,260
the arms okay so then we said okay you
guys aren't going to do this anymore but

148
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:53,270
guys aren't going to do this anymore but
 

149
00:06:53,270 --> 00:07:06,130
guys aren't going to do this anymore but
did you think I would do our reflections

150
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:06,140
did you think I would do our reflections
 

151
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,340
did you think I would do our reflections
you would be further from I can't even

152
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,350

 

153
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,720

wait if you keep looking then I said

154
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:13,730
wait if you keep looking then I said
 

155
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:25,720
wait if you keep looking then I said
change partners mix it up

156
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:25,730

 

157
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,650

then we just thought they went to the

158
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:29,660
then we just thought they went to the
 

159
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:35,260
then we just thought they went to the
old drill and then you guys think

160
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,270
old drill and then you guys think
 

161
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,880
old drill and then you guys think
techniques you're basically doing t1 was

162
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:38,890
techniques you're basically doing t1 was
 

163
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,900
techniques you're basically doing t1 was
do you understand that

164
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:40,910
do you understand that
 

165
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,090
do you understand that
so if I wait for you to grab me and I

166
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:43,100
so if I wait for you to grab me and I
 

167
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,490

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
okay so when the teacher says we're
 

219
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,100
okay so when the teacher says we're
going to do this and it's not that it

okay and I would say that there is a
 

227
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:44,200
okay and I would say that there is a

00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,210
deeper art when you can stop that the
 

229

it's so what would what would we say is

264
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:47,990
it's so what would what would we say is
 

265
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,980
it's so what would what would we say is
the difference that it could be the same

266
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:50,990
the difference that it could be the same
 

267

technique but what makes one technique
application G was that and what makes it

270
00:10:59,880 --> 00:10:59,890
application G was that and what makes it
 

271
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,050
application G was that and what makes it
yeah

272
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,060
yeah
 

273
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:12,060
yeah
I think that's a pretty good definition

274
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,070
I think that's a pretty good definition
 

275
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,400
I think that's a pretty good definition
okay pretty good

276
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,410
okay pretty good
 

277
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,280
okay pretty good
can you see it seems like but wait it's

278
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,290
can you see it seems like but wait it's
 

279
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,350
can you see it seems like but wait it's
the same technique but the emotional

280
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
the same technique but the emotional
 

281
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,770

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
core of the technique is entirely
 

285
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,150
core of the technique is entirely
different and if you don't think that

286
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
different and if you don't think that
 

287
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,690
different and if you don't think that
matters sooner maybe get kissed by

321
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,670

saves that problem it's the problem of

utilization and preoccupation and
enslave head to form it's the same okay

328
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:07,690
enslave head to form it's the same okay
 

329
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,620
enslave head to form it's the same okay
okay so we're going to hit us again next

330
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:11,630
