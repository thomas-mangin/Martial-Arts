I'm moving him
 

187
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,469
I'm moving him
by his Center

188
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:45,479
by his Center
 

189
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,090
by his Center
all that

190
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,100
all that
 

191
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,610
all that
so that you understand that it's an

192
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:49,620
so that you understand that it's an
 

193
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,969
so that you understand that it's an
energetic manipulation and not a

194
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:52,979
energetic manipulation and not a
 

195
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,270
energetic manipulation and not a
skeletal manipulation because sometimes

196
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:56,280
skeletal manipulation because sometimes
 

197
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,029
skeletal manipulation because sometimes

215
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,170
so mechanical that is to the detriment

of the actual lock that you're trying to
 

217
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,689
of the actual lock that you're trying to
use for him to fall into

00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:35,699
use for him to fall into
 

219
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,930

if you pay attention I do it a little
different every single time because the

224
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
different every single time because the
 

225
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,210
different every single time because the
the the surface level the mechanical

226
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:47,220
the the surface level the mechanical
 

227
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,790
the the surface level the mechanical
level is not important that that's not

228
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:49,800
level is not important that that's not
 

229
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,090
level is not important that that's not
important

230
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,100

 

231
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,070

okay so don't don't try to find some
