00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:38,750
we have some cones set up here and
 

37
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,270
we have some cones set up here and
that's basically the line that Maya

38
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:40,280
that's basically the line that Maya
 

39
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,130
that's basically the line that Maya
won't go past so she's gonna stay

40
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:42,140
won't go past so she's gonna stay
 

41
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,380
won't go past so she's gonna stay
outside of the corner and go side to

42
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:44,390
outside of the corner and go side to
 

43
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,869
outside of the corner and go side to
side now there you could run a quarter

44
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
side now there you could run a quarter
 

45
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,610
side now there you could run a quarter
drill where you don't make that criteria

46
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:48,620
drill where you don't make that criteria
 

47
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,690
drill where you don't make that criteria
absolutely for sure

48
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:49,700
absolutely for sure
 

49
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,850
absolutely for sure
but this is a good drill to practice for

50
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:51,860
but this is a good drill to practice for
 

51
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,770
but this is a good drill to practice for
Josh to practice skills of working out

52
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:53,780
Josh to practice skills of working out
 

53
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,930
Josh to practice skills of working out
of this corner when Maya is not coming

54
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:55,940
of this corner when Maya is not coming
 

55
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,790
of this corner when Maya is not coming
in sometimes when the other person comes

56
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:57,800
in sometimes when the other person comes
 

57
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,830
in sometimes when the other person comes
in it can be kind of easier because they

58
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840
in it can be kind of easier because they
 

59
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,720
in it can be kind of easier because they
give you more room to escape but you

60
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:01,730
give you more room to escape but you
 

61
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,250
give you more room to escape but you
know if Maya was waiting for a friend to

62
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:03,260
know if Maya was waiting for a friend to
 

63
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,260
know if Maya was waiting for a friend to
come in she might lock Josh into a

64
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:05,270
come in she might lock Josh into a
 

65
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,730
come in she might lock Josh into a
corner so he just can't escape and then

66
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:06,740
corner so he just can't escape and then
 

67
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,140
corner so he just can't escape and then
the two of them could attack John and

68
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,150
the two of them could attack John and
 

69
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,640
the two of them could attack John and
Josh needs to have the ability to get

70
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:09,650
Josh needs to have the ability to get
 

71
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,289
Josh needs to have the ability to get
out of there rather quickly so this is a

72
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:11,299
out of there rather quickly so this is a
 

73
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,090
out of there rather quickly so this is a
situation where mine is actually not

74
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:13,100
situation where mine is actually not
 

75
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,130
situation where mine is actually not
trying to encroach on Josh so he can't

76
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:15,140
trying to encroach on Josh so he can't
 

77
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,660
trying to encroach on Josh so he can't
really make good a one stay with that

78
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:16,670
really make good a one stay with that
 

79
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,120
really make good a one stay with that
but at the same time

80
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,130
but at the same time
 

81
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,520
but at the same time
Joshua still has the urgency to get out

82
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:21,530
Joshua still has the urgency to get out
 

83
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,649
Joshua still has the urgency to get out
so he's locked into a quarter he needs

84
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:23,659
so he's locked into a quarter he needs
 

85
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:25,570
so he's locked into a quarter he needs
to get out Maya won't come in so he

86
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:25,580
to get out Maya won't come in so he
 

87
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,070
to get out Maya won't come in so he
can't blend with her and so he's got to

88
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,080
can't blend with her and so he's got to
 

89
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,050
can't blend with her and so he's got to
find another way out at this corner so

90
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:29,060
find another way out at this corner so
 

91
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,850
find another way out at this corner so
my is gonna work on the outside of this

92
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:30,860
my is gonna work on the outside of this
