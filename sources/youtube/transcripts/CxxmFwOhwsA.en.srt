1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,470

okay so we'll play the game again where

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:04,480
okay so we'll play the game again where
 

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:28,950
okay so we'll play the game again where
uh he's trying to touch my chest okay we

4
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960

 

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:01:07,270

going

6
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280

 

7
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,390

all right so you said he kept getting

8
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:09,400
all right so you said he kept getting
 

9
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:28,830
all right so you said he kept getting
your chest all right let's see something

10
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:28,840

 

11
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,550

go

12
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:33,560

 

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,469

okay so some of these passes that you're

14
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:35,479
okay so some of these passes that you're
 

15
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,149
okay so some of these passes that you're
doing these these tabaki passes you're

16
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
doing these these tabaki passes you're
 

17
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,429
doing these these tabaki passes you're
doing they're they're okay but you don't

18
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:42,439
doing they're they're okay but you don't
 

19
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,389
doing they're they're okay but you don't
have uh any of your Ike or your Coq

20
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:47,399
have uh any of your Ike or your Coq
 

21
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,749
have uh any of your Ike or your Coq
taking his balance So eventually he's

22
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:50,759
taking his balance So eventually he's
 

23
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,990
taking his balance So eventually he's
going to get it because he's offense he

24
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,000
going to get it because he's offense he
 

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,749
going to get it because he's offense he
has the initiative your

26
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:54,759
has the initiative your
 

27
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,429
has the initiative your
reactionary at at how you're doing it

28
00:01:58,429 --> 00:01:58,439
reactionary at at how you're doing it
 

29
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,749
reactionary at at how you're doing it
okay so you for example uh he he pushed

30
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
okay so you for example uh he he pushed
 

31
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,230
okay so you for example uh he he pushed
okay and I saw you come around very nice

32
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,240
okay and I saw you come around very nice
 

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,510
okay and I saw you come around very nice
okay so he pushed you didn't block him

34
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
okay so he pushed you didn't block him
 

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,750
okay so he pushed you didn't block him
he pushed you yielded and you came to

36
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
he pushed you yielded and you came to
 

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,150
he pushed you yielded and you came to
this one but then nothing happened to

38
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
this one but then nothing happened to
 

39
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,150
this one but then nothing happened to
his balance and there it

40
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
his balance and there it
 

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,190
his balance and there it
is so the same thing he comes around you

42
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
is so the same thing he comes around you
 

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,550
is so the same thing he comes around you
yield but there you

44
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:23,560
yield but there you
 

45
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,869
yield but there you
see so if we watch again there's two

46
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
see so if we watch again there's two
 

47
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,949
see so if we watch again there's two
things that are doing this hand is

48
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:28,959
things that are doing this hand is
 

49
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,830
things that are doing this hand is
already taken off balance so I could

50
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:30,840
already taken off balance so I could
 

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,190
already taken off balance so I could
take this one

52
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
take this one
 

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,790
take this one
away but usually I go here and this

54
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:35,800
away but usually I go here and this
 

55
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,110
away but usually I go here and this
hand's just

56
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
hand's just
 

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,350
hand's just
dead that's how he got

58
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
dead that's how he got
 

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,750
dead that's how he got
in so if he comes around I yield here

60
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
in so if he comes around I yield here
 

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,070
in so if he comes around I yield here
this hand was not dead even though this

62
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
this hand was not dead even though this
 

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,710
this hand was not dead even though this
he's pushing here this hand is still

64
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:47,720
he's pushing here this hand is still
 

65
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,430
he's pushing here this hand is still
doing

66
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
doing
 

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,030
doing
something there it is

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,589
your there's your Q so you
passes it's in this hand right here and

76
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:04,599
passes it's in this hand right here and
 

77

your you have a Coq you have a
 

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,509
your you have a Coq you have a
separating Force right so we're here a

84
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
separating Force right so we're here a
 

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,229
separating Force right so we're here a
separating force and you have an

86
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:19,239
separating force and you have an
 

87
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,430
separating force and you have an
adhesion Force you understand so C

88
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:22,440
adhesion Force you understand so C
 

89
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,789
adhesion Force you understand so C
separating Force

boom around we'll do it again so here is
 

133
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,670
boom around we'll do it again so here is
the I key on this hand I key on this

134
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:36,680
the I key on this hand I key on this
 

135
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,590
the I key on this hand I key on this
hand C you on that hand to keep that

hand C you on that hand to keep that
corner out okay then I'll bring it

138
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
corner out okay then I'll bring it
 

139
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,350
corner out okay then I'll bring it
around pass through the IE face and now

140
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:44,360
around pass through the IE face and now
 

141
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,270
around pass through the IE face and now
it's back in the C phase on this hand

142
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
it's back in the C phase on this hand
 

143
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,350
it's back in the C phase on this hand
and this hand over here is the iy phase

144
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:50,360
and this hand over here is the iy phase
 

145
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,110
and this hand over here is the iy phase
okay so you can see that you're going uh

146
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
okay so you can see that you're going uh
 

147
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,510
okay so you can see that you're going uh
is that what we did I don't remember

148
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:54,520
is that what we did I don't remember
 

149
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,150
is that what we did I don't remember
what you did okay all right uh yeah was

150
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
what you did okay all right uh yeah was
 

151
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,710
what you did okay all right uh yeah was
I was on the outside so so this hand has

152
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
I was on the outside so so this hand has
 

153
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,150
I was on the outside so so this hand has
a c at first this hand will have a II at

154
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
a c at first this hand will have a II at
 

155
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,270
a c at first this hand will have a II at
first so this hand here has an adhesion

156
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
first so this hand here has an adhesion
 

157
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,070
first so this hand here has an adhesion
going you see it's not blocking him this

158
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,080
going you see it's not blocking him this
 

159
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,510
going you see it's not blocking him this
hand is blocking him but as this hand

160
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
hand is blocking him but as this hand
 

161
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,150
hand is blocking him but as this hand
passes through the IE phase it's now

162
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,160
passes through the IE phase it's now
 

163
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,189
passes through the IE phase it's now
going to be in the CQ phase and you

164
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
going to be in the CQ phase and you
 

165
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,390
going to be in the CQ phase and you
could see over here is the

166
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
could see over here is the
 

167
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,590
could see over here is the
adhesion but both of them are working

168
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
adhesion but both of them are working
 

169
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,909
adhesion but both of them are working
together to take his balance

170
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:30,919
together to take his balance
 

171
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:33,990
together to take his balance
okay so you can't just be here not take

172
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
okay so you can't just be here not take
 

173
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,749
okay so you can't just be here not take
violence you can only stick and follow

174
00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:36,759
violence you can only stick and follow
 

175
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,469
violence you can only stick and follow
for so long it's going to get you okay

176
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:39,479
for so long it's going to get you okay
 

177
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,550
for so long it's going to get you okay
and it's also not the drill all right

178
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
and it's also not the drill all right
 

179
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,070
and it's also not the drill all right
let's try

180
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
let's try
 

181
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,430
let's try
again all all right so you you were

182
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:46,440
again all all right so you you were
 

183
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,469
again all all right so you you were
talking about this will the power once

184
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
talking about this will the power once
 

185
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,870
talking about this will the power once
you feel like you can't get it you enter

186
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
you feel like you can't get it you enter
 

187
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,110
you feel like you can't get it you enter
into a contesta mindset you against

188
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,120
into a contesta mindset you against
 

189
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,790
into a contesta mindset you against
her okay so what what ends up happening

190
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
her okay so what what ends up happening
 

191
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,550
her okay so what what ends up happening
as I said is now you're in

192
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:01,560
as I said is now you're in
 

193
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,110
as I said is now you're in
dichotomy but it's a dichotomy that's

194
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,120
dichotomy but it's a dichotomy that's
 

195
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,070
dichotomy but it's a dichotomy that's
working through the through fear and

196
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
working through the through fear and
 

197
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,150
working through the through fear and
through a Will To Power and what ends up

198
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,160
through a Will To Power and what ends up
 

199
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,430
through a Will To Power and what ends up
happening is you you start this path of

200
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
happening is you you start this path of
 

201
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,150
happening is you you start this path of
annihilating the other okay so in this

202
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
annihilating the other okay so in this
 

203
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,270
annihilating the other okay so in this
case is where instead of one hand being

204
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
case is where instead of one hand being
 

205
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,830
case is where instead of one hand being
Yin one hand being Yang or in other

206
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
Yin one hand being Yang or in other
 

207
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,710
Yin one hand being Yang or in other
words one hand being iky one hand in

208
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
words one hand being iky one hand in
 

209
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,390
words one hand being iky one hand in
communion and the other hand in

210
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
communion and the other hand in
 

211
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,469
communion and the other hand in
separating Force Coq you have like two

212
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:27,479
separating Force Coq you have like two
 

213
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,430
separating Force Coq you have like two
just pushing hands Okay so

214
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440

 

215
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,350

go right there it

216
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360

 

217
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,070

was two pushing

218
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,080

 

219
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,670

hands pushing your thumb do you see your

220
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
hands pushing your thumb do you see your
 

221
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,909
hands pushing your thumb do you see your
thumb hooks her you're just trying to

222
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:47,919
thumb hooks her you're just trying to
 

223
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:58,390
thumb hooks her you're just trying to
stop her from going

224
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400

 

225
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,430

okay

226
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:02,440

 

227
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,990

okay and as you fluctuate in this

228
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
okay and as you fluctuate in this
 

229
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,869
okay and as you fluctuate in this
dichotomy and a lot of you are doing

230
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:05,879
dichotomy and a lot of you are doing
 

231
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,950
dichotomy and a lot of you are doing
this you you start to go on off in the

232
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:09,960
this you you start to go on off in the
 

233
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,589
this you you start to go on off in the
way that you're touching her Center like

234
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:12,599
way that you're touching her Center like
 

235
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,189
way that you're touching her Center like
you're you're sometimes you are then you

236
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
you're you're sometimes you are then you
 

237
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,070
you're you're sometimes you are then you
go off because you want to save yourself

238
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
go off because you want to save yourself
 

239
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,510
go off because you want to save yourself
and then you go back on and so and

240
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:20,520
and then you go back on and so and
 

241
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,029
and then you go back on and so and
because you go off that's what triggers

242
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
because you go off that's what triggers
 

243
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,350
because you go off that's what triggers
the fear response cuz now it comes at

244
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
the fear response cuz now it comes at
 

245
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,790
the fear response cuz now it comes at
you in an on Rush quickly or something

246
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:27,800
you in an on Rush quickly or something
 

247
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,110
you in an on Rush quickly or something
you feel behind you feel overpowered you

248
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,120
you feel behind you feel overpowered you
 

249
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,990
you feel behind you feel overpowered you
feel they're going to get you

250
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,000
feel they're going to get you
 

251
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,909
feel they're going to get you
okay okay so first thing to mention is

252
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
okay okay so first thing to mention is
 

253
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,230
okay okay so first thing to mention is
uh uh then this is probably for the more

254
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:41,240
uh uh then this is probably for the more
 

255
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,830
uh uh then this is probably for the more
advanced okay so yinong is a theory in

256
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:46,840
advanced okay so yinong is a theory in
 

257
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,629
advanced okay so yinong is a theory in
relativity so that means while it is

258
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
relativity so that means while it is
 

259
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,950
relativity so that means while it is
true it's only true from a point of view

260
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
true it's only true from a point of view
 

261
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,110
true it's only true from a point of view
which means it's false from another

262
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
which means it's false from another
 

263
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,869
which means it's false from another
point of view Okay so so uh the way I

264
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
point of view Okay so so uh the way I
 

265
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,270
point of view Okay so so uh the way I
described it um earlier it's very

266
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
described it um earlier it's very
 

267
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,469
described it um earlier it's very
convenient and is very easy for someone

268
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:07,479
convenient and is very easy for someone
 

269
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,149
convenient and is very easy for someone
to understand because it's presented in

270
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:10,159
to understand because it's presented in
 

271
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:13,149
to understand because it's presented in
a binary kind of fashion but it's

272
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:13,159
a binary kind of fashion but it's
 

273
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,469
a binary kind of fashion but it's
ultimately not true okay because it's

274
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:17,479
ultimately not true okay because it's
 

275
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,070
ultimately not true okay because it's
relative um I let's say you're not

276
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,080
relative um I let's say you're not
 

277
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,950
relative um I let's say you're not
you're not pushing on this hand there's

278
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
you're not pushing on this hand there's
 

279
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,510
you're not pushing on this hand there's
no there's no energy on this hand okay

280
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:26,520
no there's no energy on this hand okay
 

281
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,550
no there's no energy on this hand okay
that that's not true that's not a true

282
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
that that's not true that's not a true
 

283
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,070
that that's not true that's not a true
statement the energy on this hand

284
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,080
statement the energy on this hand
 

285
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,389
statement the energy on this hand
whether there is some or is not some is

286
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:33,399
whether there is some or is not some is
 

287
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,990
whether there is some or is not some is
only relative to in this case the energy

288
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
only relative to in this case the energy
 

289
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,029
only relative to in this case the energy
in my hand you see so if I'm trying to

290
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
in my hand you see so if I'm trying to
 

291
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,909
in my hand you see so if I'm trying to
shove this hand that feels like no

292
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:40,919
shove this hand that feels like no
 

293
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,029
shove this hand that feels like no
energy you see but if I match if I match

294
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:44,039
energy you see but if I match if I match
 

295
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,550
energy you see but if I match if I match
that I'm matching it I'm matching it

296
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
that I'm matching it I'm matching it
 

297
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,070
that I'm matching it I'm matching it
matching it matching

298
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
matching it matching
 

299
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,350
matching it matching
it so in other

300
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
it so in other
 

301
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,269
it so in other
words this will not project you if you

302
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:54,279
words this will not project you if you
 

303
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,389
words this will not project you if you
relax your hand you relax you're super

304
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
relax your hand you relax you're super
 

305
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,910
relax your hand you relax you're super
super Yin if you're super Yin that will

306
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:58,920
super Yin if you're super Yin that will
 

307
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,509
super Yin if you're super Yin that will
not project you but if I go more Yin

308
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
not project you but if I go more Yin
 

309
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,269
not project you but if I go more Yin
than you you see then this hand is now

310
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
than you you see then this hand is now
 

311
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,430
than you you see then this hand is now
young so you going more Yin I go more

312
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
young so you going more Yin I go more
 

313
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,030
young so you going more Yin I go more
Yin you go more Yin I go more Y is you

314
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,040
Yin you go more Yin I go more Y is you
 

315
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,069
Yin you go more Yin I go more Y is you
trying to relax I I relax more you see

316
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:13,079
trying to relax I I relax more you see
 

317
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:17,750
trying to relax I I relax more you see
and then you see it's still y hand do do

318
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
and then you see it's still y hand do do
 

319
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,630
and then you see it's still y hand do do
you understand that okay so this is the

320
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:21,640
you understand that okay so this is the
 

321
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,990
you understand that okay so this is the
downside of flexing and pushing because

322
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,000
downside of flexing and pushing because
 

323
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,350
downside of flexing and pushing because
you're going to

324
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:26,360
you're going to
 

325
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,829
you're going to
make their energy in by comparison okay
