okay let's go you cannot just step
wherever on the elimi for the

196
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
wherever on the elimi for the
 

197
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,710
wherever on the elimi for the
um so uh

198
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
um so uh
 

199
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,830
um so uh
when i go out i can't i can't step here

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
when i go out i can't i can't step here
 

201
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,950
when i go out i can't i can't step here
i can't step there i can't step too deep

202
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
i can't step there i can't step too deep
 

203
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,629
i can't step there i can't step too deep
i can't step too shallow

204
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
i can't step too shallow
 

205
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,070
i can't step too shallow
there is a particular place i have to be

206
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
there is a particular place i have to be
 

207
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,230
there is a particular place i have to be
and you're not going to have a new

208
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
and you're not going to have a new
 

209
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,430
and you're not going to have a new
uh tactic

210
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
uh tactic
 

211
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,469
uh tactic
aikido uses the same tactics

212
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
aikido uses the same tactics
 

213
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,510
aikido uses the same tactics
all the time so there's not a new

214
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
all the time so there's not a new
 

215
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,150
all the time so there's not a new
introduction of a tencon

216
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
introduction of a tencon
 

217
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,150
introduction of a tencon
or an elimi angle is the same

218
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
or an elimi angle is the same
 

219
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,990
or an elimi angle is the same
so if i was to do a mote

220
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
so if i was to do a mote
 

221
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,430
so if i was to do a mote
let's say let's just get to the elimi

222
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
let's say let's just get to the elimi
 

223
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,949
let's say let's just get to the elimi
same thing i can't go into the armpit it

224
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
same thing i can't go into the armpit it
 

225
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,909
same thing i can't go into the armpit it
doesn't matter even if i bring my arm

226
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
doesn't matter even if i bring my arm
 

227
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,550
doesn't matter even if i bring my arm
here you can see it starts to rotate him

228
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560

 

229
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,590

and i can't go obviously behind

230
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
and i can't go obviously behind
 

231
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,470
and i can't go obviously behind
there's a place i have to go and that

232
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
there's a place i have to go and that
 

233
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,910
there's a place i have to go and that
place

234
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
place
 

235
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,350
place
is always referencing his four corners

236
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
is always referencing his four corners
 

237
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,710
is always referencing his four corners
the four corners that i use i also use

238
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
the four corners that i use i also use
 

239
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,110
the four corners that i use i also use
against him

240
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
against him
 

241
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,670
against him
so this will make more sense if he's in

242
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
so this will make more sense if he's in
 

243
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,310
so this will make more sense if he's in
uh

244
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320

 

245
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,230

some kind of guard defense and let's

246
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
some kind of guard defense and let's
 

247
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,150
some kind of guard defense and let's
just look at a

248
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
just look at a
 

249
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,750
just look at a
knee pass so whatever knee pass you're

250
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
knee pass so whatever knee pass you're
 

251
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,190
knee pass so whatever knee pass you're
doing

252
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
doing
 

253
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,470
doing
this knee of mine always goes

254
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
this knee of mine always goes
 

255
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,269
this knee of mine always goes
into this hip area right here

256
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
into this hip area right here
 

257
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,110
into this hip area right here
if i go down low he'll bring he'll be

258
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
if i go down low he'll bring he'll be
 

259
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,030
if i go down low he'll bring he'll be
able to bring his knee up and i'm back

260
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
able to bring his knee up and i'm back
 

261
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,710
able to bring his knee up and i'm back
where i was

262
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
where i was
 

263
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,590
where i was
even if i'm threading down here as i

264
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
even if i'm threading down here as i
 

265
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,630
even if i'm threading down here as i
come around

266
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
come around
 

267
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,670
come around
i'll get half guard or he'll be able to

268
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
i'll get half guard or he'll be able to
 

269
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,230
i'll get half guard or he'll be able to
thread it

270
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
thread it
 

271
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,910
thread it
again and i'm back in

272
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920

 

273
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,949

so where when i thread the knee

274
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
so where when i thread the knee
 

275
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,269
so where when i thread the knee
the knee slice i'm always interested in

276
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
the knee slice i'm always interested in
 

277
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,710
the knee slice i'm always interested in
that pocket

278
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
that pocket
 

279
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,829
that pocket
right there another way of looking at it

280
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
right there another way of looking at it
 

281
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,870
right there another way of looking at it
is side control how does that mean

282
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
is side control how does that mean
 

283
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,310
is side control how does that mean
here if i want to

284
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
here if i want to
 

285
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,750
here if i want to
pressure my cross face on him and i

286
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
pressure my cross face on him and i
 

287
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,110
pressure my cross face on him and i
i want to lean let's say i do this leg

288
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
i want to lean let's say i do this leg
 

289
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,949
i want to lean let's say i do this leg
but let's say for some reason i do this

290
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
but let's say for some reason i do this
 

291
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,430
but let's say for some reason i do this
leg

292
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
leg
 

293
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,590
leg
i've now freed that hip and he's going

294
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
i've now freed that hip and he's going
 

295
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,870
i've now freed that hip and he's going
to get

296
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
to get
 

297
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,069
to get
me back in which is why if i'm going to

298
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
me back in which is why if i'm going to
 

299
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,069
me back in which is why if i'm going to
move this knee from that hip

300
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
move this knee from that hip
 

301
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,790
move this knee from that hip
i have to first replace it and now he

302
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
i have to first replace it and now he
 

303
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,269
i have to first replace it and now he
can't do that maneuver

304
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
can't do that maneuver
 

305
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,350
can't do that maneuver
this hip corner

306
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360

 

307
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,230

is vital because it checks his leg

308
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
is vital because it checks his leg
 

309
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,350
is vital because it checks his leg
weapons out

310
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
weapons out
 

311
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,190
weapons out
the ability for him to use his lower

312
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
the ability for him to use his lower
 

313
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,710
the ability for him to use his lower
extremities

314
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
extremities
 

315
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,870
extremities
so uh let's say he's going

316
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
so uh let's say he's going
 

317
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,150
so uh let's say he's going
boom and he comes let's say he comes

318
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
boom and he comes let's say he comes
 

319
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,389
boom and he comes let's say he comes
forward all right i'm going to be able

320
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
forward all right i'm going to be able
 

321
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,350
forward all right i'm going to be able
to rotate

322
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
to rotate
 

323
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,710
to rotate
behind him

324
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720

 

325
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,150

he was too far forward of the hip corner

326
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
he was too far forward of the hip corner
 

327
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,430
he was too far forward of the hip corner
now he's going to go back too far back

328
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
now he's going to go back too far back
 

329
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,190
now he's going to go back too far back
you see and just like

330
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
you see and just like
 

331
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,670
you see and just like
when i remove my knee from the side

332
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
when i remove my knee from the side
 

333
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,470
when i remove my knee from the side
control

334
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
control
 

335
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,670
control
he does not control my knee boom

336
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
he does not control my knee boom
 

337
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,750
he does not control my knee boom
what you want to see is the line of

338
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
what you want to see is the line of
 

339
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,670
what you want to see is the line of
attack potential there

340
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
attack potential there
 

341
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,710
attack potential there
so when i come in just like on a mote

342
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
so when i come in just like on a mote
 

343
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,470
so when i come in just like on a mote
i'm coming in in front of that hip

344
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
i'm coming in in front of that hip
 

345
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,509
i'm coming in in front of that hip
and like all aikido that angle of

346
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519

and what's going to happen it's one of

528
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
and what's going to happen it's one of
 

529
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,829
and what's going to happen it's one of
two things as i come into

530
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
two things as i come into
 

531
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,110

535
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,470

and what everyone should do is he will

536
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
and what everyone should do is he will
 

537
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,470

bring that foot around
 

539
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,830
bring that foot around
and that usually f's everyone up except

then i just stay up with him so he threw

594
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
then i just stay up with him so he threw
 

595
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,789
then i just stay up with him so he threw
himself

596
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
himself
 

597
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:12,730

and i stand with him

598
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:12,740

601
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,310

it looks like me going down is what

602
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
it looks like me going down is what
 

603
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,390
it looks like me going down is what
shoves him down

604
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:22,400
shoves him down
 

605
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:44,150
shoves him down
it is not i'm just staying with him

606
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160

 

607
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,549

so you actually need his countering

608
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
so you actually need his countering
 

609
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,430
so you actually need his countering

613
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,350

okay so going back to this

614
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360

 

615
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,710

so if he's got energy in his arm then

624
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
so if he's got energy in his arm then
 

625
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,070
so if he's got energy in his arm then
you can protect him but

626
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
you can protect him but
 

627
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,270
you can protect him but
as he goes mushy

628
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
as he goes mushy
 

629
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,590

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,789
your energy gets like steam out of a
leaky valve but

632

what you what you do is you find his

634
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,080
what you what you do is you find his
 

635
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,350
what you what you do is you find his
uh projection so even even though i

636
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,360
uh projection so even even though i
 

637
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,190
uh projection so even even though i
touch his uh chest i'm not pushing

638
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
touch his uh chest i'm not pushing
 

639
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,430
touch his uh chest i'm not pushing
so let's try to let me not make it so

640
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
so let's try to let me not make it so
 

641
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,549
so let's try to let me not make it so
confusing

642
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:46,559
confusing
 

643
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,909
confusing
okay so he's gonna he's trying he's

644
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
okay so he's gonna he's trying he's
 

645
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,909
okay so he's gonna he's trying he's
letting his arm bend this way

646
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:51,919
letting his arm bend this way
 

647
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,870
letting his arm bend this way
do you see that yes so i can find it

648
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
do you see that yes so i can find it
 

649
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,149
do you see that yes so i can find it
around

650
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:56,159
around
 

651
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,470
around
going around that point and find his

652
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:58,480
going around that point and find his
 

653
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,630
going around that point and find his
center back inside his hand

654
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:02,640
center back inside his hand
 

655
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,990
center back inside his hand
so here we're doing the technique

656
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,000
so here we're doing the technique
 

657
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,230
so here we're doing the technique
and you'll see he's not

658
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,240
and you'll see he's not
 

659
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,029
and you'll see he's not
taking that counterstep

660
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,039

 

661
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,789

and i said that's one of the two things

662
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
and i said that's one of the two things
 

663
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,110
and i said that's one of the two things
that shirouki will do

664
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,120
that shirouki will do
 

665
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,750
that shirouki will do
it does not mean that as you come around

666
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:23,760
it does not mean that as you come around

you're just doing it on that foot
 

681
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,110
you're just doing it on that foot
there we go that foot i still project
