number nine all these points you'll find

422
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,200
number nine all these points you'll find

431
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:31,490

so the things that are important are

432
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:31,500

 

433
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,310

number number nine

434
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:37,320

 

435
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:45,650

you must look first

436
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:45,660

 

437
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,269

and then ski don't ski leaving the Joe

438
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:50,279
and then ski don't ski leaving the Joe

443
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,670
there's different skis there's some on
this level where they must go past in

444
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:58,680
this level where they must go past in
 

445
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,530
this level where they must go past in
case somebody hits it

446
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:00,540

00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:05,579
looks what's going to happen
 

451
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:08,389
looks what's going to happen
okay

452
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399

 

453
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,190

the um

454
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:10,200

different skis then you need a bit of

460
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:17,880
different skis then you need a bit of
 

461
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,170
different skis then you need a bit of
other head so that it turns

462
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:21,180
other head so that it turns
 

463
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,769
other head so that it turns
another weak point is

464
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:24,779

 

465
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,769
