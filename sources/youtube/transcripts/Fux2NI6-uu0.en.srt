1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,309

all right so we have the the embryonic

2
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:06,319
all right so we have the the embryonic
 

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,509
all right so we have the the embryonic
uh training that's already now this is

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:08,519
uh training that's already now this is
 

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,629
uh training that's already now this is
no longer a cut this is just a line and

6
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:11,639
no longer a cut this is just a line and
 

7
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,789
no longer a cut this is just a line and
then I practice he makes connection and

8
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,799
then I practice he makes connection and
 

9
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,390
then I practice he makes connection and
then I go okay let's move past

10
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400

 

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,630

that this is not a block that would

12
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:23,640
that this is not a block that would
 

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,710
that this is not a block that would
violate IO principles you

14
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:27,720
violate IO principles you
 

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,509
violate IO principles you
see so I can't do the same timing of the

16
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:30,519
see so I can't do the same timing of the
 

17
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,790
see so I can't do the same timing of the
embryonic version okay I don't have to

18
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:33,800
embryonic version okay I don't have to
 

19
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,790
embryonic version okay I don't have to
kill my UK but it is more challenging to

20
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:37,800
kill my UK but it is more challenging to
 

21
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,990
kill my UK but it is more challenging to
all right because it's not hey get ready

22
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,000
all right because it's not hey get ready
 

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,590
all right because it's not hey get ready
get ready to receive you see that it's

24
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
get ready to receive you see that it's
 

25
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,330
get ready to receive you see that it's
in the motion okay so as I

26
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:51,340

 

27
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:58,910

[Music]

28
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920

 

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,709

go

30
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:01,719
go
 

31
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:04,429
go
when you're working this note that I

32
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:04,439
when you're working this note that I
 

33
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,550
when you're working this note that I
don't look at his

34
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:06,560
don't look at his
 

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,350
don't look at his
weapon keep your eyes in the fight okay

36
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:10,360
weapon keep your eyes in the fight okay
 

37
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:20,069
weapon keep your eyes in the fight okay
so

38
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:20,079

 

39
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,870

boom you're killing his weapon you

40
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
boom you're killing his weapon you
 

41
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,670
boom you're killing his weapon you
you're killing his cut so you're not

42
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
you're killing his cut so you're not
 

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,510
you're killing his cut so you're not
letting this cut get and attacking it on

44
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:28,520
letting this cut get and attacking it on
 

45
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,789
letting this cut get and attacking it on
his power AR before it even gets in you

46
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
his power AR before it even gets in you
 

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,789
his power AR before it even gets in you
you'll have shut it

48
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
you'll have shut it
 

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,670
you'll have shut it
down okay let's try it so uh some of

50
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
down okay let's try it so uh some of
 

51
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,069
down okay let's try it so uh some of
you some of you uh that you don't count

52
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
you some of you uh that you don't count
 

53
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,950
you some of you uh that you don't count
that as a block you see like you're

54
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:47,960
that as a block you see like you're
 

55
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,830
that as a block you see like you're
going to do the technique do the

56
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:50,840
going to do the technique do the
 

57
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,830
going to do the technique do the
technique you see that you don't you

58
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840
technique you see that you don't you
 

59
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,590
technique you see that you don't you
don't count that as a block you

60
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
don't count that as a block you
 

61
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,749
don't count that as a block you
understand it's like oh it's barely you

62
00:01:58,749 --> 00:01:58,759
understand it's like oh it's barely you
 

63
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,109
understand it's like oh it's barely you
see that when I go

64
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119

 

65
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,109

do you

66
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:04,119
do you
 

67
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:06,270
do you
understand why is that happening because

68
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:06,280
understand why is that happening because
 

69
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,389
understand why is that happening because
it's y y do you understand do you get

70
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:09,399
it's y y do you understand do you get
 

71
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,550
it's y y do you understand do you get
that okay so you had your weapon put

72
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:11,560
that okay so you had your weapon put
 

73
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,150
that okay so you had your weapon put
your weapon out on the

74
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,160
your weapon out on the
 

75
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,350
your weapon out on the
Block you

76
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360

 

77
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,550

see this thing is going to it's not

78
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
see this thing is going to it's not
 

79
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,790
see this thing is going to it's not
going to let you do what you think

80
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:21,800
going to let you do what you think
 

81
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,030
going to let you do what you think
you're going to do so it's going to go

82
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
you're going to do so it's going to go
 

83
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,550
you're going to do so it's going to go
here and it's starting what did you want

84
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:27,560
here and it's starting what did you want
 

85
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,470
here and it's starting what did you want
to do you wanted to drop the the uh the

86
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:31,480
to do you wanted to drop the the uh the
 

87
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,309
to do you wanted to drop the the uh the
hands you see and you wanted your tip to

88
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
hands you see and you wanted your tip to
 

89
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,949
hands you see and you wanted your tip to
raise but pressure is going pressure is

90
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
raise but pressure is going pressure is
 

91
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,509
raise but pressure is going pressure is
going there do you see so as it all

92
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:40,519
going there do you see so as it all
 

93
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,270
going there do you see so as it all
lowers it's it's a matter of fractions

94
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
lowers it's it's a matter of fractions
 

95
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,270
lowers it's it's a matter of fractions
of a second and fractions of an inch but

96
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,280
of a second and fractions of an inch but
 

97
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,030
of a second and fractions of an inch but
as this is going down that thing is

98
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
as this is going down that thing is
 

99
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,190
as this is going down that thing is
going less and less and less into the

100
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,200
going less and less and less into the
 

101
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,070
going less and less and less into the
atos very similar to the embryonic when

102
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
atos very similar to the embryonic when
 

103
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,110
atos very similar to the embryonic when
you're bringing it down my sword and

104
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
you're bringing it down my sword and
 

105
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,910
you're bringing it down my sword and
then you turn your grip remember as

106
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
then you turn your grip remember as
 

107
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,190
then you turn your grip remember as
opposed to rotating the cross and then

108
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,200
opposed to rotating the cross and then
 

109
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,070
opposed to rotating the cross and then
comes down you remember that okay so

110
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
comes down you remember that okay so
 

111
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,070
comes down you remember that okay so
same thing's happening it looks

112
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,080
same thing's happening it looks
 

113
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,630
same thing's happening it looks
like it looks like it's going to be fine

114
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
like it looks like it's going to be fine
 

115
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,149
like it looks like it's going to be fine
CU you barely do it do it how you were

116
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:19,159
CU you barely do it do it how you were
 

117
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,910
CU you barely do it do it how you were
doing come on dude you see come on it

118
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
doing come on dude you see come on it
 

119
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,789
doing come on dude you see come on it
looks like it's going to be fine but why

120
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
looks like it's going to be fine but why
 

121
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,470
looks like it's going to be fine but why
it happens cuz UK weits here

122
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
it happens cuz UK weits here
 

123
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,229
it happens cuz UK weits here
you see and UK is not supposed to wait

124
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:33,239
you see and UK is not supposed to wait
 

125
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,429
you see and UK is not supposed to wait
there UK is supposed to come around do

126
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:36,439
there UK is supposed to come around do
 

127
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,789
there UK is supposed to come around do
their KY gut and finish the

128
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
their KY gut and finish the
 

129
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,309
their KY gut and finish the
cut you got it but in your training

130
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
cut you got it but in your training
 

131
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,750
cut you got it but in your training
culture you go

132
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:46,760
culture you go
 

133
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,429
culture you go
here and then he gets to do what could

134
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:50,439
here and then he gets to do what could
 

135
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,710
here and then he gets to do what could
not happen in reality okay so you don't

136
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:53,720
not happen in reality okay so you don't
 

137
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,390
not happen in reality okay so you don't
have to go fast if you don't want to but

138
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
have to go fast if you don't want to but
