okay so the problem with forms
training is that when you go to giwaza

60
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
training is that when you go to giwaza
 

61
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,110
training is that when you go to giwaza
you try to do the form as if it's a

62
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,120
you try to do the form as if it's a
 

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,550
you try to do the form as if it's a
pre-programmed solution to what you're

64
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
pre-programmed solution to what you're
 

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,390
pre-programmed solution to what you're
facing

66
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
facing
 

67
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,630
facing
that's the wrong way to think about the

68
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
that's the wrong way to think about the
 

69
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,110
that's the wrong way to think about the
art what you want to do instead

70
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
art what you want to do instead
 

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,149
art what you want to do instead
is actually understand why the technique

72
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
is actually understand why the technique
 

73
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,110
is actually understand why the technique
works

74
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
works
 

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,430
works
and then you make sure those elements

76
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
and then you make sure those elements
 

77
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,229
and then you make sure those elements
are in

78
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
are in
 

79
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,949
are in
whatever you're trying to do okay so for

80
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
whatever you're trying to do okay so for
 

81
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:45,990
whatever you're trying to do okay so for
example

82
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
example
 

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,149
example
uh you're just gonna do the move you

84
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
uh you're just gonna do the move you
 

85
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,190
uh you're just gonna do the move you
have a tank

86
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
have a tank
 

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,110
have a tank
you come around here and then you have

88
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
you come around here and then you have
 

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,030
you come around here and then you have
this step all right

90
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
this step all right
 

91
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,750
this step all right
but a certain thing has to be in place

92
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
but a certain thing has to be in place
 

93
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,350
but a certain thing has to be in place
for that to work

94
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
for that to work
 

95
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,429
for that to work
you can't just you can't just do the

96
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
you can't just you can't just do the
 

97
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,910
you can't just you can't just do the
form as if you're doing it in the air

98
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
form as if you're doing it in the air
 

99
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,589
form as if you're doing it in the air
and then it'll work okay so as i'm going

100
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
and then it'll work okay so as i'm going
 

101
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,470
and then it'll work okay so as i'm going
around here

102
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
around here
 

103
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,990
around here
i can't go like this but that outside

104
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000

leg is in front
 

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,390
leg is in front
of this leg he doesn't have the same

108
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
of this leg he doesn't have the same
 

109
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,590
of this leg he doesn't have the same
uh weakness

110
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600

aspects
 

119
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,590
aspects
are in place so this we're out of line

120
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
are in place so this we're out of line
 

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,430
are in place so this we're out of line
there it is and then i can come in

say same beginning now we're going to
 

151
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,909
say same beginning now we're going to
use this principle more so

152
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
use this principle more so
 

153
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,430
use this principle more so
if i stop here that's why i had to do it

154

moving myself

178
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
moving myself
 

179
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,629
moving myself
so that i always end up

180
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
so that i always end up
 

181
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,150
so that i always end up
in that angle you see that and i don't

182
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
in that angle you see that and i don't
 

183
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,189
in that angle you see that and i don't
have to

184
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
have to
 

185
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,790
have to
go here and then move you

186
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800

 

187
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:47,350

i'm moving myself

188
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360

 

189
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,430

i'll find the vector that i need

190
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
i'll find the vector that i need
 

191
00:06:51,440 --> 00:07:08,790
i'll find the vector that i need
to get it if i move over here it'll work

192
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800

 

193
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:18,150

we'll work here

194
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160

 

195
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,909

okay let's go you're trying to learn

196
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
okay let's go you're trying to learn
 

197
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,950
okay let's go you're trying to learn
what makes

198
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
what makes
 

199
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,550
what makes
that chica spread your feet up okay

200
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
that chica spread your feet up okay
 

201
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,390
that chica spread your feet up okay
so i need his weight distribution

202
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
so i need his weight distribution
 

203
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,430
so i need his weight distribution
such that this foot is further back go

204
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
such that this foot is further back go
 

205
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,950
such that this foot is further back go
ahead and do it for me

206
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
ahead and do it for me
 

207
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,749
ahead and do it for me
you see behind that then this shikaku

208
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
you see behind that then this shikaku
 

209
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,550
you see behind that then this shikaku
works

210
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
works
 

211
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,909
works
okay if if the other leg is

212
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
okay if if the other leg is
 

213
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,270
okay if if the other leg is
forward then that chicago does not work

214
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
forward then that chicago does not work
 

215
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,270
forward then that chicago does not work
okay a lot of times we just force

216
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
okay a lot of times we just force
 

217
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,309
okay a lot of times we just force
somebody but

218
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
somebody but
 

219
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,350
somebody but
it's not the same now

220
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
it's not the same now
 

221
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,029
it's not the same now
in the first drill you you went ahead

222
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
in the first drill you you went ahead
 

223
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,580
in the first drill you you went ahead
and you manually

224
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:57,590

227
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,830

the leg okay

228
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840

 

229
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,309

now the point to realize is when he

230
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
now the point to realize is when he
 

231
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,589
now the point to realize is when he
opens his feet can just stand like that

232
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
opens his feet can just stand like that
 

233
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,950
opens his feet can just stand like that
it's if i stand from this

234
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
it's if i stand from this
 

235
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,749
it's if i stand from this
his angle are even but if i enter from

236
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
his angle are even but if i enter from
 

237
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,869
his angle are even but if i enter from
this angle from

00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
this angle from
 

239
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,350
this angle from
this angle that foot is behind this foot

240
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
this angle that foot is behind this foot
 

241
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,630
this angle that foot is behind this foot
you see so from this angle this is very

242
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
you see so from this angle this is very
 

243
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,829
you see so from this angle this is very
heavy

244
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
heavy
 

245
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,670
heavy
but from this angle this foot is very

246
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
but from this angle this foot is very
 

247
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,190
but from this angle this foot is very
long

248
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,200

 

249
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,949

okay and so what happens when you do

00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
okay and so what happens when you do
 

251
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,230
okay and so what happens when you do
your plug and play

what happened

262
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
what happened
 

263
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,630
what happened
is that supposed to work and it's

264
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
is that supposed to work and it's
 

265
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,670
is that supposed to work and it's
because you're not

266
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
because you're not
 

267
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,110
because you're not
you're not setting up the angle

268
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120

 

269
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,509

or you're entering an angle that you

270
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
or you're entering an angle that you
 

271
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,389
or you're entering an angle that you
you're not

272
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
you're not
 

273
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,030
you're not
actually going to be able to do it so i

274
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
actually going to be able to do it so i
 

275
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,990
actually going to be able to do it so i
could take this

276
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
could take this
 

277
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,829
could take this
same straight thing in terms of my

278
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
same straight thing in terms of my
 

279
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,110
same straight thing in terms of my
body but if i enter from this

280
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
body but if i enter from this
 

281
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,310
body but if i enter from this
part now now it all happens

282
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
part now now it all happens
 

283
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,630
part now now it all happens
so i want to understand the principle so

284
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
so i want to understand the principle so
 

285

i could do it mechanically but it's

288
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
i could do it mechanically but it's
 

289
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,389
i could do it mechanically but it's
there

290
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
there
 

291
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,310
there
okay good legacy or

292
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
okay good legacy or
 

293
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,750
okay good legacy or
i can just play with what i'm doing

294
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
i can just play with what i'm doing
 

295
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,030
i can just play with what i'm doing
what's that and find that angle

296
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
what's that and find that angle
 

297
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,949
what's that and find that angle
again don't throw yourself you'll either

298
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
again don't throw yourself you'll either

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,670
again don't throw yourself you'll either
be tripped or not

301
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,949

so that that foot is always going to be

302
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
so that that foot is always going to be
 

303
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,150
so that that foot is always going to be
behind so put it put it uh in front

304
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
behind so put it put it uh in front
 

305
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,829
behind so put it put it uh in front
you see if i enter here it's heavy

306
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
you see if i enter here it's heavy
 

307
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,430
you see if i enter here it's heavy
but if i enter here it will be light

308
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
but if i enter here it will be light
 

309
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,389

okay
 

325
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,310
okay
so we've just stepped out of kiwan

326
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
so we've just stepped out of kiwan
 

327
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,030
so we've just stepped out of kiwan
and we're going to see if shikaku is

328
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
and we're going to see if shikaku is
 

329
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,509
and we're going to see if shikaku is
actually

330
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
actually
 

331
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,790
actually
active because if it is the front leg

332
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
active because if it is the front leg
 

333
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,230
active because if it is the front leg
will be lightened

334
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
will be lightened
 

335
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,829
will be lightened
which will allow me to sweep it

336
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
which will allow me to sweep it
 

337
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,829
which will allow me to sweep it
do you get it it's just a test so

338
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
do you get it it's just a test so
 

339
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:49,090
do you get it it's just a test so
i'm doing the movement right
