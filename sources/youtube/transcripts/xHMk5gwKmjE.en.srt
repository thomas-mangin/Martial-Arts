all the way through the black lights
 

41
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,950
all the way through the black lights
they can make lots of errors but still

42
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:57,960
they can make lots of errors but still
 

43
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,350
they can make lots of errors but still
think they're making it work

44
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:00,360
think they're making it work
 

45
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,750
think they're making it work
and the person falls down and you say no

46
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:02,760
and the person falls down and you say no
 

47
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,969
and the person falls down and you say no
I must have got it I like that technique

48
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:04,979
I must have got it I like that technique
 

49
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,130
I must have got it I like that technique
so I must have got it where really the

50
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:07,140
so I must have got it where really the
 

51
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,649
so I must have got it where really the
higher you get the more you realize that

52
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:09,659
higher you get the more you realize that
 

53
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,170
higher you get the more you realize that
in the end if you can take a piece of

54
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:12,180
in the end if you can take a piece of
 

55
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,210
in the end if you can take a piece of
tracing paper and pull it through the

56
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:14,220
tracing paper and pull it through the
 

57
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,109
tracing paper and pull it through the
gap

58
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
gap
 

59
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,270
gap
that's about as close as you need to

60
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
that's about as close as you need to
 

61
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,210
that's about as close as you need to
really get it so it's very it's a it's a

62
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:20,220
really get it so it's very it's a it's a
 

63
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,969
really get it so it's very it's a it's a
martial art that is for I think for

64
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:22,979
martial art that is for I think for
 

65
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,370
martial art that is for I think for
perfectionists and with a perfectionist

66
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:25,380
perfectionists and with a perfectionist
 

67
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,109
perfectionists and with a perfectionist
you'll never perfect it so that means

68
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
you'll never perfect it so that means
 

69
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,609
you'll never perfect it so that means
you can keep doing it till you die oh

70
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:30,619
you can keep doing it till you die oh
 

71
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:38,390
you can keep doing it till you die oh
Okay so

72
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400

 

73
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,149

we go

74
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:41,159

 

75
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,590

so

76
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:42,600
so
 

77
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,990
so
we always start with um

78
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000

 

79
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,929

four movement of coupling with your

80
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:50,939
four movement of coupling with your
 

81
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,530
four movement of coupling with your
partner

82
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:54,540

 

83
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,210

and for many years you'll do it and

84
00:01:59,210 --> 00:01:59,220
and for many years you'll do it and
 

85
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,609
and for many years you'll do it and
not really get much out of it you do it

86
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:01,619
not really get much out of it you do it
 

87
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,889
not really get much out of it you do it
because the teacher shows you to get

88
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:03,899
because the teacher shows you to get
 

89
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,469
because the teacher shows you to get
out so you just keep doing it

90
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
out so you just keep doing it
 

91
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,710
out so you just keep doing it
but in the end you realize that this is

92
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:09,720
but in the end you realize that this is
 

93
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,490
but in the end you realize that this is
like the letter A the alphabet it's it's

94
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:13,500
like the letter A the alphabet it's it's
 

95
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,210
like the letter A the alphabet it's it's
actually the most important part of

96
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:17,220
actually the most important part of
 

97
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,150
actually the most important part of
like uh is the man now

98
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
like uh is the man now
 

99
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,369
like uh is the man now
why is that

100
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:22,379
why is that
 

101
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,190
why is that
I'm already connected with him you know

102
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm already connected with him you know
 

103
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,190
I'm already connected with him you know
if we could see auras and energies just

104
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,200
if we could see auras and energies just
 

105
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,470
if we could see auras and energies just
by putting my hand out there I'll

106
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
by putting my hand out there I'll
 

107
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,449
by putting my hand out there I'll
automatically connect with him well

108
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:32,459
automatically connect with him well
 

109
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,809
automatically connect with him well
before he gets to me I smell stimulate

110
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:35,819
before he gets to me I smell stimulate
 

111
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,670
before he gets to me I smell stimulate
the from the toe to the hands

112
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:40,680
the from the toe to the hands
 

113
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,250
the from the toe to the hands
by then my hands are going in his

114
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:43,260
by then my hands are going in his
 

115
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,869
by then my hands are going in his
Direction but he's coming this direction

116
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
Direction but he's coming this direction
 

117
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,910
Direction but he's coming this direction
so I have to couple up and make this

118
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:46,920
so I have to couple up and make this
 

119
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,610
so I have to couple up and make this
shape so now my fingers are going in his

120
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:49,620
shape so now my fingers are going in his
 

121
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,630
shape so now my fingers are going in his
Direction

122
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
Direction
 

123
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,330
Direction
that's the direction of his energy

124
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:53,340
that's the direction of his energy
 

125
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,449
that's the direction of his energy
so at my level that's what I'm thinking

126
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:56,459
so at my level that's what I'm thinking
 

127
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,910
so at my level that's what I'm thinking
about I'm thinking more about the the

128
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:58,920
about I'm thinking more about the the
 

129
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,009
about I'm thinking more about the the
flow

130
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:01,019
flow
 

131
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,410
flow
of movement than I am

132
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:03,420
of movement than I am
 

133
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,809
of movement than I am
gonna have to move him you know if I

134
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:05,819
gonna have to move him you know if I
 

135
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,030

hold you
and give him a hundred percent in the

138
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,200
and give him a hundred percent in the
 

139
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,369
and give him a hundred percent in the
grip

140
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:13,379

 

141
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,830

he's got to overcome that somehow one

142
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
he's got to overcome that somehow one
 

143
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,540
he's got to overcome that somehow one
day he's got to overcome it okay
