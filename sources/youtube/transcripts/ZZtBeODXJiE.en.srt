and they have to be at depth
 

55
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,510
and they have to be at depth
it is it is

56
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520

a lot of his escapes
 

199
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,789
a lot of his escapes
require

200
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
require
 

201
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,190
require
that this hip be able to move like for

202
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
that this hip be able to move like for
 

203
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,550
that this hip be able to move like for
example

204
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
example
 

205
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,470
example
um he wants to do elbow knee escape here

206
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
um he wants to do elbow knee escape here
 

207
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,190
um he wants to do elbow knee escape here
if he has space here at this hip he can

208
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
if he has space here at this hip he can
 

209
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,789
if he has space here at this hip he can
get this knee in and now he got out of

210
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
get this knee in and now he got out of
 

211
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,469
get this knee in and now he got out of
sight control

212
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
sight control
 

213
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,390
sight control
so

214
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
so
 

215
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,749
so
one way

216
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
one way
 

217
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,110
one way
is no space have that knee there so he

218
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
is no space have that knee there so he
 

219
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,950
is no space have that knee there so he
can't get in there

220
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
can't get in there
 

221
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,550
can't get in there
since we're doing ghee another way is

222
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
since we're doing ghee another way is
 

223
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,510
since we're doing ghee another way is
that you can grab

224
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
that you can grab
 

225
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,510
that you can grab
the ghee around his

the ghee around his
 

227
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,030
the ghee around his
buttocks area

228
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
buttocks area
 

229
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,430
buttocks area
and you can take that knee away

230
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
and you can take that knee away
 

231
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,590
and you can take that knee away
and your arm is kind of go ahead and try

and your arm is kind of go ahead and try
 

233
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,230
and your arm is kind of go ahead and try
it again your arm is duplicating that

234
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
it again your arm is duplicating that
 

235
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,749
it again your arm is duplicating that
same block

236
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
same block
 

237
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,310
same block
if there's no ghee and you want your

two weigh stations so it's kind of like

302
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
two weigh stations so it's kind of like
 

303
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,150
two weigh stations so it's kind of like
you're in star trek and you beam in here

304
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
you're in star trek and you beam in here
 

305
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,309
you're in star trek and you beam in here
and then you beam in here and then you

306
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
and then you beam in here and then you
 

307
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,749
and then you beam in here and then you
beam in here and that's not gu

308
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
beam in here and that's not gu
 

309
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,710
beam in here and that's not gu
in gu it's like you're on a pilgrimage

310

in gu it's like you're on a pilgrimage
 

311
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,950
in gu it's like you're on a pilgrimage
and you go from this station and you

312
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
and you go from this station and you
 

313
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,670
and you go from this station and you
gotta walk to this station and it's

314
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
gotta walk to this station and it's
 

315
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,909
gotta walk to this station and it's
actually the walking part that is the

316
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
actually the walking part that is the
 

317
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,150

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
so
 

321
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,390
so
it's all the stuff in between

322
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
it's all the stuff in between
 

323
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,950
it's all the stuff in between
that allows you to get to the next weigh

324
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
that allows you to get to the next weigh
 

325
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,110
that allows you to get to the next weigh
station that counts all right

326
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
station that counts all right
 

327
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,909
station that counts all right
so

328
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
so
 

329
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:38,950
so
um

330
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
um
 

331
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,230
um

you can't just go for the mount

334
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
you can't just go for the mount
 

335
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,469
you can't just go for the mount
because you're going to have to create

336
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
because you're going to have to create
 

337
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,350
because you're going to have to create
space to move out of side control and

338
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
space to move out of side control and
 

339
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,589
space to move out of side control and
that's going to create in space

340
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
that's going to create in space
 

341
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,589
that's going to create in space
and then he's going to use that to

342
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
and then he's going to use that to
 

343
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,150
and then he's going to use that to
create openings maneuvers counters

344
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
create openings maneuvers counters
 

345
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,830
create openings maneuvers counters
attacks of his own

346
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
attacks of his own
 

347
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,830
attacks of his own
so what you have to do is you have two

348
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840
so what you have to do is you have two
 

349
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,950
so what you have to do is you have two
choices uh you get him to move

350
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
choices uh you get him to move
 

351
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,150
choices uh you get him to move
got it

352
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
got it
 

353
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,350
got it
or you wait for him to move but if he's

354
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
or you wait for him to move but if he's
 

355
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,710
or you wait for him to move but if he's
skilled he's gonna wait for me to move

356
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
skilled he's gonna wait for me to move
 

357
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,909
skilled he's gonna wait for me to move
okay so you have to know how to do both

358
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:15,919
okay so you have to know how to do both
 

359
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,950
okay so you have to know how to do both
got it

360
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
got it
 

361
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,830
got it
in terms of getting him to move there's

362
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
in terms of getting him to move there's
 

363
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,150
in terms of getting him to move there's
really two ways and again you want to

364
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,160
really two ways and again you want to
 

365
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,150
really two ways and again you want to
combine these two ways

366
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
combine these two ways
 

367
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,950
combine these two ways
so

368
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
so
 

369
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,909
so
one way is to preoccupy him with an

370
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
one way is to preoccupy him with an
 

371
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,870
one way is to preoccupy him with an
attack so he has to defend the attack

372
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
attack so he has to defend the attack
 

373
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,189
attack so he has to defend the attack
and then he has to move okay

374
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
and then he has to move okay
 

375
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,390
and then he has to move okay
the other way is to uh make him

376
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
the other way is to uh make him
 

377
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,670
the other way is to uh make him
uncomfortable where he is

378
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
uncomfortable where he is
 

379
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,469
uncomfortable where he is
with pressure than he wants to move to

380
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
with pressure than he wants to move to
 

381
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,950
with pressure than he wants to move to
relieve the pressure okay

382
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
relieve the pressure okay
 

383
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,029
relieve the pressure okay
in terms of the first one

384
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
in terms of the first one
 

385
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,990
in terms of the first one
the best preoccupying attack is striking

386
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
the best preoccupying attack is striking
 

387
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,309
the best preoccupying attack is striking
if you have a weapon it's pulling the

388
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
if you have a weapon it's pulling the
 

389
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,430
if you have a weapon it's pulling the
weapon it's gonna preoccupy him okay

390
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
weapon it's gonna preoccupy him okay
 

391
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,309
weapon it's gonna preoccupy him okay
but probably in a bjj club there's no

392
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
but probably in a bjj club there's no
 

393
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,710
but probably in a bjj club there's no
striking there's definitely no weapons

394
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
striking there's definitely no weapons
 

395
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,589
striking there's definitely no weapons
okay

396
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
okay
 

397
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,309
okay
so

398
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
so
 

399
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,790
so
we'll go over some basic attacks

400
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
we'll go over some basic attacks
 

401
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,110
we'll go over some basic attacks
at the beginner level you want to know

402
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
at the beginner level you want to know
 

403
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,909
at the beginner level you want to know
how to attack the arms and the neck area

404
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
how to attack the arms and the neck area
 

405
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,670
how to attack the arms and the neck area
because you're here controlling this

406
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
because you're here controlling this
 

407
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,790
because you're here controlling this
area okay so we're going to give her

408
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
area okay so we're going to give her
 

409
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,390
area okay so we're going to give her
one of each and for those

410
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
one of each and for those
 

411
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,990
one of each and for those
that know the

412
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
that know the
 

413
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,469
that know the
americana or the figure four

414
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
americana or the figure four
 

415
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,869
americana or the figure four
we're gonna reintroduce the details

416
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
we're gonna reintroduce the details
 

417
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,510
we're gonna reintroduce the details
which she does not have because she

418
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
which she does not have because she
 

419
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,430
which she does not have because she
forgot the technique on top of

420
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
forgot the technique on top of
 

421
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,790
forgot the technique on top of
everything okay

422
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
everything okay
 

423
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,709

all right so
 

425
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,589
all right so
uh again the figure four is this one the

426
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
uh again the figure four is this one the
 

427
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,750
uh again the figure four is this one the
americana right you're here like that

428
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760

 

429
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,990

the way that we do this here there's

430
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
the way that we do this here there's
 

431
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,070
the way that we do this here there's
there's all these little tweaks and and

432
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
there's all these little tweaks and and
 

433
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,630
there's all these little tweaks and and
things that work okay

434
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
things that work okay
 

435
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,389

okay here we go let's get some rips on
that and then we'll get to the details

504
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
that and then we'll get to the details
 

505
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,150
that and then we'll get to the details
okay

506

so and the way that we're going to do it
 

509
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,230
so and the way that we're going to do it
is we're going to attack the outside of

510
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
is we're going to attack the outside of
 

511
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,389
is we're going to attack the outside of

the ball and socket joint or the bottom
socket joint itself

514
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
socket joint itself
 

515
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,230
socket joint itself
then we're going to attack

516
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
then we're going to attack
 

517
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,110
then we're going to attack
the

518
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
the
 

519
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,590
the
shoulder mechanism itself

520
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
shoulder mechanism itself
 

521
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,550
shoulder mechanism itself
and then we're going to attack the elbow

522
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
and then we're going to attack the elbow
 

523
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,990
and then we're going to attack the elbow
okay

524
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,000
okay
 

525
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,430
okay
so the way you attack the

526
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
so the way you attack the
 

527
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,829
so the way you attack the
ball and socket joint

528
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
ball and socket joint
 

529
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,030
ball and socket joint
is to pull this thing

530
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
is to pull this thing
 

531
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,750
is to pull this thing
in

532
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
in
 

533
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,790
in
to tighten this thing

534
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
to tighten this thing
 

535
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,150
to tighten this thing
like that

536
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
like that
 

537
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,990
like that
okay

538
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,000
okay
 

539
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,790
okay
so

540
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
so
 

541
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,190
so
i'm gonna go here and the first thing i

542
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
i'm gonna go here and the first thing i
 

543
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,069
i'm gonna go here and the first thing i
do

544
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
do
 

545
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,190
do
is crank this thing towards them

546
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
is crank this thing towards them
 

547
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,990
is crank this thing towards them
a lot of people will tap out there a lot

548
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
a lot of people will tap out there a lot
 

549
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,710
a lot of people will tap out there a lot
of people and then you don't need this

550
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
of people and then you don't need this
 

551
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,750
of people and then you don't need this
mad arm strength okay you're just

552
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
mad arm strength okay you're just
 

553
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,630
mad arm strength okay you're just
bringing it into your body all right so

554
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
bringing it into your body all right so
 

555
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,430
bringing it into your body all right so
i have to reduce that a little bit

556
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
i have to reduce that a little bit
 

557
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,630
i have to reduce that a little bit
or a lot to get to where i would take it

558
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
or a lot to get to where i would take it
 

559
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,230
or a lot to get to where i would take it
next okay

560
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
next okay
 

561
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,269
next okay
so from the ball and socket joint attack

562
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
so from the ball and socket joint attack
 

563
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,350
so from the ball and socket joint attack
i'm now going to attack the shoulder

564
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
i'm now going to attack the shoulder
 

565
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,069
i'm now going to attack the shoulder
mechanism the scapula mechanism itself

566
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
mechanism the scapula mechanism itself
 

567
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,150
mechanism the scapula mechanism itself
okay so i'm not going to pull it in so

568
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
okay so i'm not going to pull it in so
 

569
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,389
okay so i'm not going to pull it in so
tight and this is kind of the standard

570
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
tight and this is kind of the standard
 

571
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,110
tight and this is kind of the standard

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
arm mechanism down towards the hip
 

577
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,949
arm mechanism down towards the hip
you got it okay so first i'm pulling it

578
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
you got it okay so first i'm pulling it
 

579
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,069
you got it okay so first i'm pulling it
in and then that's what goes into the

580
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
in and then that's what goes into the
 

581
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,790
in and then that's what goes into the
shoulder mechanism and then

582
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
shoulder mechanism and then
 

583
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,590
shoulder mechanism and then
before i get to his hip i'm going to

584
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
before i get to his hip i'm going to
 

585
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,150
before i get to his hip i'm going to
attack his elbow all right

586

attack his elbow all right
 

587
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,470
attack his elbow all right
so i'm going to again loosen up the

588
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
so i'm going to again loosen up the
 

589
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,790
so i'm going to again loosen up the
first ball and socket attack

590
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
first ball and socket attack
 

591
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,389
first ball and socket attack
loosen up the

592
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
loosen up the
 

593
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,550
loosen up the
shoulder mechanism attack and i'm gonna

594
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
shoulder mechanism attack and i'm gonna
 

595
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,590
shoulder mechanism attack and i'm gonna
get to the elbow okay so it's loose i'm

596
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
get to the elbow okay so it's loose i'm
 

597

not in tight on his neck and at that
 

599
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,829
not in tight on his neck and at that
point his hand doesn't keep traveling i

600
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
point his hand doesn't keep traveling i
 

601
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,470
point his hand doesn't keep traveling i
just twist his arm i twist this forearm

602
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
just twist his arm i twist this forearm
 

603
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,829
just twist his arm i twist this forearm
do you see that okay so when i get to

604
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
do you see that okay so when i get to
 

605
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,750
do you see that okay so when i get to
all three when i get to all three

606
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:19,760
all three when i get to all three
 

607
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,910
all three when i get to all three
there's not much movement that is

608
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
there's not much movement that is
 

609
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,990
there's not much movement that is
required you see that it's about a half

610
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
required you see that it's about a half
 

611
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,150
required you see that it's about a half
inch of movement which means i have a

612
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
inch of movement which means i have a
 

613
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,949
inch of movement which means i have a
better chance of getting that uh against

614
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
better chance of getting that uh against
 

615
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,350
better chance of getting that uh against
somebody as opposed to moving his arm

616
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
somebody as opposed to moving his arm
 

617
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,750
somebody as opposed to moving his arm
all this way that's a lot of room and a

618
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
all this way that's a lot of room and a
 

619
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,829
all this way that's a lot of room and a
lot of space and a lot of time

620
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839
lot of space and a lot of time
 

621
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,710
lot of space and a lot of time
okay um

622
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720

 

623
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,670

once you understand this uh

624

just quit you're gonna get it right here
first

636
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
first
 

637
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,310
first
the first one do you see how i'm doing

you to understand
that first part which is the tricky part

644
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
that first part which is the tricky part
 

645
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,550
that first part which is the tricky part
that's what we're gonna do okay

646
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
that's what we're gonna do okay
 

647
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,350
that's what we're gonna do okay
so

648
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
so
 

649
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,790
so
this arm is here

650
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
this arm is here
 

651
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,389
this arm is here
this arm is here so palm up on the wrist

652
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
this arm is here so palm up on the wrist
 

653
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,069
this arm is here so palm up on the wrist
palm down here

654
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
palm down here
 

655
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,069
palm down here
and you just bring it in towards him

656
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:20,079
and you just bring it in towards him
 

657
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,750
and you just bring it in towards him
okay let's get that in and then we'll do

658
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
okay let's get that in and then we'll do
 

659
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,150
okay let's get that in and then we'll do
the whole thing together that first part

660
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
the whole thing together that first part
 

661
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,150
the whole thing together that first part
is the tricky part without that in my

662
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
is the tricky part without that in my
 

663
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,829
is the tricky part without that in my
opinion the arm often gets loose and he

664
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
opinion the arm often gets loose and he
 

665
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:39,350
opinion the arm often gets loose and he
moves around and stuff okay let's try it

666
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360

 

667
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,030

is your arm okay let me let me give

668
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
is your arm okay let me let me give
 

669
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,189
is your arm okay let me let me give
tristan

670
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:45,199

 

671
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,350

okay so i'm here

672
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
okay so i'm here
 

673
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,910
okay so i'm here
boom pushing it down bringing it in

674
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
boom pushing it down bringing it in
 

675
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,269
boom pushing it down bringing it in
first

676
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
first
 

677
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,750
first
and if that's not working then i start

678
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760

right
 

1197
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,710
right
and this arm is trapped in here

1198
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:46,720
and this arm is trapped in here
 

1199
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,830
and this arm is trapped in here
okay and

1200
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
okay and
 

1201
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,470
okay and
uh i'm going to take advantage of that

1202
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,480
uh i'm going to take advantage of that
 

1203
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,110
uh i'm going to take advantage of that
and get to my weapon

1204
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
and get to my weapon
 

1205
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,470
and get to my weapon
here like this and now he can't stop me

1206
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,480
here like this and now he can't stop me
 

1207
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,669
here like this and now he can't stop me
from drawing my handgun because again

1208
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:01,679
from drawing my handgun because again
 

1209
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,990
from drawing my handgun because again
try to get the bottom arm out can't get

1210
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
try to get the bottom arm out can't get
 

1211
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,669
try to get the bottom arm out can't get
the bottom arm out

1212
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679
the bottom arm out
 

1213
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,590
the bottom arm out
and this arm

1214
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600
and this arm
 

1215
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,710
and this arm
cannot reach over to stop that because

1216
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,720
cannot reach over to stop that because
 

1217
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,430
cannot reach over to stop that because
of how i have it out of the way so

1218
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,440
of how i have it out of the way so
 

1219
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,590
of how i have it out of the way so
you see it's not going to get there it's

1220
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600
you see it's not going to get there it's
 

1221
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,310
you see it's not going to get there it's
trapped here like this and i can draw

1222
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,320
trapped here like this and i can draw
 

1223
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,909
trapped here like this and i can draw
for free

1224
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:19,919
for free
 

1225
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:20,789
for free
and

1226

and
 

1227
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,070
and
fire my hand

1228
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,080
fire my hand
 

1229
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,710
fire my hand
okay

1230
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720

 

1231
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,710

um

1232

um
 

1233
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,710
um
but we're playing a game no strikes no

1234

weapons
 

1237
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,350
weapons
okay

1238
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
okay
 

1239
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,950
okay
so

1240
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
so
 

1241
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,549
so
um

1242
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
um
 

1243
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,630
um
the way you would do it

1244
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:36,640
the way you would do it
 

1245
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,990
the way you would do it
as i said

1246
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,000
as i said
 

1247
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,230
as i said
well you get him to move

1248
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,240
well you get him to move
 

1249
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,750
well you get him to move
but

1250
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
but
 

1251
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,750
but
he might be skilled he's like no you

1252
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:43,760
he might be skilled he's like no you
 

1253
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,830
he might be skilled he's like no you
move first you're not doing anything to

1254
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:45,840
move first you're not doing anything to
 

1255
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,110
move first you're not doing anything to
me i'm fine here do you see that okay so

1256
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
me i'm fine here do you see that okay so
 

1257
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,070
me i'm fine here do you see that okay so
i go to move like i'm gonna go to mount

1258
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
i go to move like i'm gonna go to mount
 

1259
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,149
i go to move like i'm gonna go to mount
and your defend the mount

1260
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:54,159
and your defend the mount
 

1261
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,390
and your defend the mount
oh sh

1262
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:56,400
oh sh
 

1263
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,269
oh sh
he got it in and so he keeps working it

1264
00:24:59,269 --> 00:24:59,279
he got it in and so he keeps working it
 

1265
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,470
he got it in and so he keeps working it
and oh crawl crap

1266
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480

 

1267
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,350

so

1268
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,360
so
 

1269
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,350
so
it's always better to use these

1270
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:07,360
it's always better to use these
 

1271
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,110
it's always better to use these
strategies

1272
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,120
strategies
 

1273
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,990
strategies
uh

1274
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
uh
 

1275
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,950
uh
make him want to move so to speak and

1276
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:12,960
make him want to move so to speak and
 

1277
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,149
make him want to move so to speak and
one way of making him want to move

1278
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:16,159
one way of making him want to move
 

1279
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,310
one way of making him want to move
for somebody who's not moving but is

1280
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
for somebody who's not moving but is
 

1281
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,870
for somebody who's not moving but is
waiting for me to do that

1282
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
waiting for me to do that
 

1283
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,789
waiting for me to do that
is

1284
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
is
 

1285
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,390
is
attack

1286
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,400
attack
 

1287
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,630
attack
okay then he has to move he has to

1288
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:26,640
okay then he has to move he has to
 

1289
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,789
okay then he has to move he has to
defend the attack

1290
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:28,799
defend the attack
 

1291
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,269
defend the attack
the second way i mentioned is pressure

1292
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
the second way i mentioned is pressure
 

1293
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,310
the second way i mentioned is pressure
makes him uncomfortable do you see that

1294
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,320
makes him uncomfortable do you see that
 

1295
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,549
makes him uncomfortable do you see that
and

1296
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:38,559

 

1297
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,909

pressure though

1298
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:39,919
pressure though
 

1299
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,710
pressure though
is is a lot of size dependent and a lot

1300
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
is is a lot of size dependent and a lot
 

1301
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,789
is is a lot of size dependent and a lot
of strength dependent

1302
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:44,799
of strength dependent
 

1303
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,269
of strength dependent
so if you're much smaller than that

1304
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
so if you're much smaller than that
 

1305
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,190
so if you're much smaller than that
person

1306
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,200
person
 

1307
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,110
person
if you have a good pressure game you can

1308
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,120
if you have a good pressure game you can
 

1309
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,909
if you have a good pressure game you can
still generate some pressure but if you

1310
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
still generate some pressure but if you
 

1311
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,710
still generate some pressure but if you
measure that relative to somebody who's

1312
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
measure that relative to somebody who's
 

1313
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,710
measure that relative to somebody who's
heavier than their

1314
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:58,720
heavier than their
 

1315
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,750
heavier than their
uh

1316
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
uh
 

1317
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,310
uh
partner their opponent

1318
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
partner their opponent
 

1319
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,350
partner their opponent
and you would rate it like a pain scale

1320
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:05,360
and you would rate it like a pain scale
 

1321
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,149
and you would rate it like a pain scale
you see you would give them that's a ten

1322
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:08,159
you see you would give them that's a ten
 

1323
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,470
you see you would give them that's a ten
and then the other lighter person with

1324
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:10,480
and then the other lighter person with
 

1325
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,909
and then the other lighter person with
good technique

1326
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:11,919
good technique
 

1327
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,110
good technique
they'll go like it's like a four okay

1328
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,120
they'll go like it's like a four okay
 

1329
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,909
they'll go like it's like a four okay
it is still important to know pressure

1330
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:17,919
it is still important to know pressure
 

1331
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,630
it is still important to know pressure
because you doing pressure in all your

1332
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640
because you doing pressure in all your
 

1333
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,350
because you doing pressure in all your
attacks anyways okay

1334
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,360
attacks anyways okay
 

1335
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,590
attacks anyways okay
but the kind of pressure it won't ever

1336
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:25,600
but the kind of pressure it won't ever
 

1337
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,870
but the kind of pressure it won't ever
be if you're lighter and weaker it won't

1338
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880
be if you're lighter and weaker it won't
 

1339
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,830
be if you're lighter and weaker it won't
ever

1340
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:29,840
ever
 

1341
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,630
ever
be the pressure that will do this

1342
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:32,640
be the pressure that will do this
 

1343
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,789
be the pressure that will do this
generating they want to get out of this

1344
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799
generating they want to get out of this
 

1345
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,510
generating they want to get out of this
it's not comfortable do you understand

1346
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,520
it's not comfortable do you understand
 

1347
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,870
it's not comfortable do you understand
okay

1348
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:38,880
okay
 

1349
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,310
okay
um so try to work somebody around your

1350
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,320
um so try to work somebody around your
 

1351
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,470
um so try to work somebody around your
size you can be smaller than them you

1352
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:44,480
size you can be smaller than them you
 

1353
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,950
size you can be smaller than them you
just can't be a lot smaller than them

1354
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:46,960
just can't be a lot smaller than them
 

1355
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,909
just can't be a lot smaller than them
okay

1356
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,919
okay
 

1357
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,630
okay
and then also remember that even if you

1358
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,640
and then also remember that even if you
 

1359
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,070
and then also remember that even if you
are bigger pressure does involve more

1360
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,080
are bigger pressure does involve more
 

1361
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,669
are bigger pressure does involve more
strength output

1362
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:55,679
strength output
 

1363
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,510
strength output
than non-pressure it just does okay

1364
00:26:59,510 --> 00:26:59,520
than non-pressure it just does okay
 

1365
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,430
than non-pressure it just does okay
so you would always have to measure your

1366
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,440
so you would always have to measure your
 

1367
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,909
so you would always have to measure your
reserves on how you're going along

1368
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:03,919
reserves on how you're going along
 

1369
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,710
reserves on how you're going along
through whatever match you're doing okay

1370
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
through whatever match you're doing okay
 

1371
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,590
through whatever match you're doing okay
so

1372
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
so
 

1373
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,470
so
um

1374
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,480
um
 

1375
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,190
um
if i am tasking myself

1376
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:11,200
if i am tasking myself
 

1377
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,230
if i am tasking myself
with

1378
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,240
with
 

1379
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,190
with
mounting and using pressure to open the

1380
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,200
mounting and using pressure to open the
 

1381
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,630
mounting and using pressure to open the
mount i want to create pressure

1382
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:18,640
mount i want to create pressure
 

1383
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,389
mount i want to create pressure
in that when he wants to move

1384
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:22,399
in that when he wants to move
 

1385
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,470
in that when he wants to move
he either bridges

1386
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
he either bridges
 

1387
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,909
he either bridges
or tries to turn away from me then that

1388
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:27,919
or tries to turn away from me then that
 

1389
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,990
or tries to turn away from me then that
opens the mouth

1390
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,000
opens the mouth
 

1391
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,909
opens the mouth
do you understand so i already showed

1392
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:31,919
do you understand so i already showed
 

1393
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,149
do you understand so i already showed
you when he turned away then his legs

1394
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:34,159
you when he turned away then his legs
 

1395
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,029
you when he turned away then his legs
are not

1396
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
are not
 

1397
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,950
are not
uh

1398
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:36,960
uh
 

1399
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,549
uh
defending by

1400
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:38,559
defending by
 

1401
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,990
defending by
keeping my mouth out okay and then when

1402
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,000
keeping my mouth out okay and then when
 

1403
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,269
keeping my mouth out okay and then when
when he bridges it's when so he he would

1404
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:45,279
when he bridges it's when so he he would
 

1405
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,510
when he bridges it's when so he he would
bridge do you see and i'm gonna get

1406
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:47,520
bridge do you see and i'm gonna get
 

1407
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,830
bridge do you see and i'm gonna get
really really tight on here and i'm

1408
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:49,840
really really tight on here and i'm
 

1409
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,230
really really tight on here and i'm
waiting for him to go back down you see

1410
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,240
waiting for him to go back down you see
 

1411
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,870
waiting for him to go back down you see
that so as he goes back down

1412
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,880
that so as he goes back down
 

1413
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,909
that so as he goes back down
that's when i am on i got kind of timed

1414
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:57,919
that's when i am on i got kind of timed
 

1415
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,669
that's when i am on i got kind of timed
that thing okay

1416
00:27:59,669 --> 00:27:59,679
that thing okay
 

1417
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,430
that thing okay
um so

1418
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:01,440
um so
 

1419
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,350
um so
let's first look at how to create

1420
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:03,360
let's first look at how to create
 

1421
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,990
let's first look at how to create
pressure we'll give you several several

1422
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,000
pressure we'll give you several several
 

1423
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,710
pressure we'll give you several several
uh techniques to do this all right

1424
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:08,720
uh techniques to do this all right
 

1425
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,110
uh techniques to do this all right
um so again we'll go into administrative

1426
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,120
um so again we'll go into administrative
 

1427
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,470
um so again we'll go into administrative
mode

1428
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:12,480
mode
 

1429
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,350
mode
right

1430
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,360
right
 

1431
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,310
right
and the first one we're going to do from

1432
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,320
and the first one we're going to do from
 

1433
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,750
and the first one we're going to do from
side control

1434
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:17,760
side control
 

1435
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,870
side control
is

1436
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:18,880
is
 

1437
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,990
is
come around

1438
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,000

 

1439
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,669

lift up

1440
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:23,679
lift up
 

1441
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,590
lift up
go high

1442
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:25,600
go high
 

1443
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,269
go high
and come around this way okay

1444
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:29,279
and come around this way okay
 

1445
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,430
and come around this way okay
so i want to get instead of being here

1446
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,440
so i want to get instead of being here
 

1447
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,430
so i want to get instead of being here
i'm going to put things under him

1448
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,440
i'm going to put things under him
 

1449
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,669
i'm going to put things under him
put those things under him and then i'm

1450
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:35,679
put those things under him and then i'm
 

1451
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,430
put those things under him and then i'm
going to use those things to press into

1452
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
going to use those things to press into
 

1453
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,430
going to use those things to press into
him on the top okay

1454
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440
him on the top okay
 

1455
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,029
him on the top okay
so here

1456
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:41,039
so here
 

1457
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:41,909
so here
roll

1458
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:41,919
roll
 

1459
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,389
roll
come up you can do it this way you can

1460
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:44,399
come up you can do it this way you can
 

1461
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,630
come up you can do it this way you can
get this other arm in there and now what

1462
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640
get this other arm in there and now what
 

1463
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,830
get this other arm in there and now what
i'm going to do

1464
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:47,840
i'm going to do
 

1465
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,230
i'm going to do
is start to put my back into watch my

1466
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
is start to put my back into watch my
 

1467
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,350
is start to put my back into watch my
back

1468
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,360

 

1469
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,190

okay so i'm not i'm not resting anymore

okay so i'm not i'm not resting anymore
 

1471
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,430
okay so i'm not i'm not resting anymore
i'm going to use my back and after my

1472
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,440
i'm going to use my back and after my
 

1473
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,630
i'm going to use my back and after my
back goes

1474
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:00,640
back goes
 

1475
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,630
back goes
i'm going to use my arms and then i'm

1476

i'm going to use my arms and then i'm
 

1477
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,430
i'm going to use my arms and then i'm
going to roll him onto this even more so

1478
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:05,440
going to roll him onto this even more so
 

1479
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,430
going to roll him onto this even more so
i go my back

1480

i go my back
 

1481
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,870
i go my back
then my arms

1482
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:08,880
then my arms
 

1483

my posture
 

1487
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,830
my posture
see how i did that okay so that's our

1488
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:13,840
see how i did that okay so that's our
 

1489
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,590
see how i did that okay so that's our
first one

1490
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:15,600
first one
 

1491
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,190
first one
us here

1492
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200
us here
 

1493
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,510
us here
boom roll on two you put it underneath

1494
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:19,520
boom roll on two you put it underneath
 

1495
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,470
boom roll on two you put it underneath
him come underneath that

1496
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,480
him come underneath that
 

1497
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,990
him come underneath that
go back

1498
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,000
go back
 

1499
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,870
go back
boom

1500
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:24,880
boom
 

1501
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,789
boom
your arms and then put him on top of it

1502
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
your arms and then put him on top of it
 

1503
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,310
your arms and then put him on top of it
okay let's try that yeah okay

1504
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,320
okay let's try that yeah okay
 

1505
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,190
okay let's try that yeah okay
okay so again a review

1506
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,200
okay so again a review
 

1507
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,470
okay so again a review
the principle is put things under him

1508
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:38,480
the principle is put things under him
 

1509
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,110
the principle is put things under him
engage your back then the thing that's

1510
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,120
engage your back then the thing that's
 

1511
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,510
engage your back then the thing that's
under him pull it towards you

1512
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
under him pull it towards you
 

1513
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,630
under him pull it towards you
and then

1514
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:44,640
and then
 

1515
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,230
and then
put it put him over it more okay

1516
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,240
put it put him over it more okay
 

1517
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,669
put it put him over it more okay
so

1518
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
so
 

1519
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,630
so
um and again he's he's much smaller than

1520
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:52,640
um and again he's he's much smaller than
 

1521
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,190
um and again he's he's much smaller than
me so if it's too much you just say tap

1522
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:55,200
me so if it's too much you just say tap
 

1523
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,750
me so if it's too much you just say tap
tap or tap okay but i'm just to show it

1524
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:57,760
tap or tap okay but i'm just to show it
 

1525
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,510
tap or tap okay but i'm just to show it
technically okay

1526
00:29:59,510 --> 00:29:59,520
technically okay
 

1527
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,510
technically okay

increase the pressure and also it's good
 

1565
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,710
increase the pressure and also it's good
to know how to increase pressure from

1566
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:42,720
to know how to increase pressure from
 

1567
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,269
to know how to increase pressure from
different positions okay

1568
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:45,279
different positions okay
 

1569
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,149
different positions okay
so um

1570
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:48,159

so it's a matter of driving the left hip
 

1701
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,750
so it's a matter of driving the left hip
into the floating ribs and as i go

00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:33,760
into the floating ribs and as i go
 

1703

into the floating ribs and as i go
i'm picking him up

get everything where i want it to be i
 

1747
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,510
get everything where i want it to be i
have the pressure game pull

1748
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:39,520
have the pressure game pull
 

1749
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,629
have the pressure game pull
over okay what and the way that i use

1750
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:42,639
over okay what and the way that i use
 

1751

this
 

1753
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,669
this
is because of the strength cost

1754
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:47,679
is because of the strength cost
 

1755
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,430

diaphragm moving
 

1783
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,310
diaphragm moving
so i'm gonna start doing more pressure

1784
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,320

 

1785
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,430

me it's too much strength right so
 

1793
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,790
me it's too much strength right so

you're using it to set up

1824
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:12,640
you're using it to set up
 

1825
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,670
you're using it to set up
what you needed for the mount

1826
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:15,680
what you needed for the mount
 

1827
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,190
what you needed for the mount
okay

1828
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,200
okay

so
 

1831
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,910
so
rashida you're tasked with the mount

1832
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:19,920
rashida you're tasked with the mount
 

1833
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,950
rashida you're tasked with the mount
because

1834
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:20,960
because
 

1835
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,950
because
you get more points from going from side

1836
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:22,960
you get more points from going from side
 

1837
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,510
you get more points from going from side
control to mount

1838
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:25,520
control to mount
 

1839
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,910
control to mount
for us here we're interested in the

1840
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:27,920
for us here we're interested in the
 

1841
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,670
for us here we're interested in the
strategy

1842
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:29,680
strategy
 

1843
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,150
strategy
and but we do different tactics to

and but we do different tactics to
 

1845
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,790
and but we do different tactics to
utilize the strategy okay

1846
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:34,800
utilize the strategy okay
 

1847
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,670
utilize the strategy okay
all right

1848
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:39,680
