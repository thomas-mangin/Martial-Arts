unarmed situations right in japan when
 

59
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,110
unarmed situations right in japan when

so aikido has a relationship to
old-style jiu-jitsu and that's why we

72
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
old-style jiu-jitsu and that's why we
 

73
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,149
old-style jiu-jitsu and that's why we
have those techniques in our system

74
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
have those techniques in our system
 

75
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,830
have those techniques in our system
and for the context in which we're

76
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840

is going to provide
 

227
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,350
is going to provide
no resistance right so zero resistance

228
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
no resistance right so zero resistance
 

229
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,670

so she's gonna turn that dowel somehow

230
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
so she's gonna turn that dowel somehow
 

231
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,190

right none of that because josh is
holding it really light so there's no

242
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
holding it really light so there's no
 

243
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,470
holding it really light so there's no
need for that so all this is is a

244
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
need for that so all this is is a
 

245
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,990
need for that so all this is is a
technical understanding or a

246
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
technical understanding or a
 

247
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,990
technical understanding or a
clarification of technical understanding

248
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
clarification of technical understanding
 

249
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,070
clarification of technical understanding
of what's happening when she lightly

250
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
of what's happening when she lightly
 

251

now when she's doing this she's trying
 

257
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,270
now when she's doing this she's trying
to find good simple easy little angles

258
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
to find good simple easy little angles
 

259
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,110
to find good simple easy little angles
that make it easy for the stick to come

260
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
that make it easy for the stick to come
 

261
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,190
that make it easy for the stick to come
out of the hand and that's it that's all

out of the hand and that's it that's all
 

263
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,309
out of the hand and that's it that's all
she's looking for and josh isn't

264
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
she's looking for and josh isn't
 

265
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,589
she's looking for and josh isn't
resisting her at all and she's going

266
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
resisting her at all and she's going
 

267
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,070
resisting her at all and she's going
through that

268
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
through that
 

269
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,990
through that
okay generally what we'll do is three on

270
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
okay generally what we'll do is three on
 

271
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,670
okay generally what we'll do is three on
one hand three on the other hand

272
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
one hand three on the other hand
 

273
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,110
one hand three on the other hand
and then we'll switch over and josh will

274
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
and then we'll switch over and josh will
 

275
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,789
and then we'll switch over and josh will
get to do the drill for her so that's

276
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
get to do the drill for her so that's
 

277
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,390
get to do the drill for her so that's
phase one right that's the number one

278
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
phase one right that's the number one
 

279
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,309
phase one right that's the number one
face okay now the next one

280
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
face okay now the next one
 

281
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,229
face okay now the next one
josh is going to stay in the basic same

282
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
josh is going to stay in the basic same
 

283
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,589
josh is going to stay in the basic same
position but all he's going to do is

284
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
position but all he's going to do is
 

285
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,429
position but all he's going to do is
hold it as hard as he can

286
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
hold it as hard as he can
 

287
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,789
hold it as hard as he can
so with his hand he's going to hold it

288
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
so with his hand he's going to hold it
 

289
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,550
so with his hand he's going to hold it
as hard as he possibly can

290
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
as hard as he possibly can
 

291
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,229
as hard as he possibly can

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
is pretty rigid right now so
 

311
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,110
is pretty rigid right now so
it's still not super hard but what she's

312
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
it's still not super hard but what she's
 

313
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,150
it's still not super hard but what she's
doing is she's starting to get the

doing is she's starting to get the
 

315
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,230
doing is she's starting to get the
general idea of what it's like to remove

316
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
general idea of what it's like to remove
 

317
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,870
general idea of what it's like to remove
something

318
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
something
 

319
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,629
something
with resistance right so he's really

320
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
with resistance right so he's really
 

321
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,310
with resistance right so he's really
trying to hold it hard and she's trying

322

to remove it from his hand so
 

325
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,909
to remove it from his hand so
this is the next phase up again maya's

326
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
this is the next phase up again maya's
 

327
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,510
this is the next phase up again maya's
gonna really refrain from using any

328
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
gonna really refrain from using any
 

329
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,189
gonna really refrain from using any
explosive actions that she can

330
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
explosive actions that she can
 

331
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,590
explosive actions that she can
although she might need to right so josh

332
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
although she might need to right so josh
 

333
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,030
although she might need to right so josh
could be so strong that she will need to

334
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
could be so strong that she will need to
 

335
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,909
could be so strong that she will need to
use a little oomph

336
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
use a little oomph
 

337
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,510
use a little oomph
to get it out of there but if she can

338
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
to get it out of there but if she can
 

339
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,189
to get it out of there but if she can
that's that she wants to avoid that kind

340
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
that's that she wants to avoid that kind
 

341
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:53,670
that's that she wants to avoid that kind
of stuff

342
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
of stuff
 

343
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,990
of stuff
okay so that's phase two all right and

344
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
okay so that's phase two all right and
 

345
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,870
okay so that's phase two all right and
again we do it

346
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
again we do it
 

347
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,790
again we do it
uh three right hand three left hand then

348
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
uh three right hand three left hand then
 

349
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,909
uh three right hand three left hand then
switch over okay

350
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
switch over okay
 

351
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,070
switch over okay
phase three so in phase three what's

352
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
phase three so in phase three what's
 

353
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,110
phase three so in phase three what's
gonna happen here

354
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
gonna happen here
 

355
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,749
gonna happen here
is maya is going to try to remove it but

356
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
is maya is going to try to remove it but
 

357
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,870
is maya is going to try to remove it but
josh is gonna use

358
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
josh is gonna use
 

359
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,270
josh is gonna use
more dynamic resistance right now what i

360
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
more dynamic resistance right now what i
 

361
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,950
more dynamic resistance right now what i
mean by dynamic resistance is

362
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
mean by dynamic resistance is
 

363
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,310
mean by dynamic resistance is
and just kind of fake it real slow here

364
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
and just kind of fake it real slow here
 

365
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,990
and just kind of fake it real slow here
so they can see us as maya starts to

366
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
so they can see us as maya starts to
 

367
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,550
so they can see us as maya starts to
move it

368
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
move it
 

369
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,310
move it
josh is going to move his arm around and

370
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
josh is going to move his arm around and
 

371
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,150
josh is going to move his arm around and
configure himself in different positions

372
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
configure himself in different positions
 

373
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,830
configure himself in different positions
to make it more difficult for her to

374
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
to make it more difficult for her to
 

375
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,909
to make it more difficult for her to
take it out of his hand now this is not

376
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
take it out of his hand now this is not
 

377
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,870
take it out of his hand now this is not
hugely

378
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
hugely
 

379
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,310
hugely
more difficult because josh still isn't

380
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
more difficult because josh still isn't
 

381
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,990
more difficult because josh still isn't
moving his feet or anything but as

382
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
moving his feet or anything but as
 

383
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,670
moving his feet or anything but as
john go ahead and move at real speed now

384
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
john go ahead and move at real speed now
 

385
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,270
john go ahead and move at real speed now
so but as maya's trying to get this out

386
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
so but as maya's trying to get this out
 

387
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,990
so but as maya's trying to get this out
of his hand

388
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
of his hand
 

389
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,350
of his hand
josh is going to move his body around

390
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
josh is going to move his body around
 

391
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,110
josh is going to move his body around
until she can find a way to get it out

392
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
until she can find a way to get it out
 

393
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,310
until she can find a way to get it out
now it's important to understand that

394
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
now it's important to understand that
 

395
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,150
now it's important to understand that
the way she's taking it out of his hand

396
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
the way she's taking it out of his hand
 

397
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,029
the way she's taking it out of his hand
his hand is still exactly the same way

398
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
his hand is still exactly the same way
 

399
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,710
his hand is still exactly the same way
she was using before it's just now josh

400
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
she was using before it's just now josh
 

401
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,310
she was using before it's just now josh
is dynamically opposing her so he's

402
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
is dynamically opposing her so he's
 

403
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,670
is dynamically opposing her so he's
moving his arm in different ways to

404
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
moving his arm in different ways to
 

405
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,390
moving his arm in different ways to
trying to

406
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
trying to
 

407
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,710
trying to
oppose her actions okay good so that's

408
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
oppose her actions okay good so that's
 

409
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,510
oppose her actions okay good so that's
phase three

410
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
phase three
 

411
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,469
phase three
and this is a dynamic phase now phase

412
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
and this is a dynamic phase now phase
 

413
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,230
and this is a dynamic phase now phase
four in this oh and in that by the way

414
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
four in this oh and in that by the way
 

415
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,070
four in this oh and in that by the way
maya might use some explosive actions

416
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
maya might use some explosive actions
 

417
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,670
maya might use some explosive actions
because she needs to but again she's

418
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
because she needs to but again she's
 

419
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,189
because she needs to but again she's
always trying to keep herself

420
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
always trying to keep herself
 

421
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,430
always trying to keep herself
using as few dynamic actions as possible

422
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
using as few dynamic actions as possible
 

423
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,629
using as few dynamic actions as possible
and the reason is because she wants to

424
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
and the reason is because she wants to
 

425
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,550
and the reason is because she wants to
get as good at the technique as possible

426
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
get as good at the technique as possible
 

427
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,150
get as good at the technique as possible
and not just good at going faster or

428
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
and not just good at going faster or
 

429
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,710
and not just good at going faster or
harder okay now sorry phase four

430
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
harder okay now sorry phase four
 

431
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,390
harder okay now sorry phase four
phase four so in phase four what we're

432
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
phase four so in phase four what we're
 

433
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,710
phase four so in phase four what we're
going to do here is josh is allowed to

434
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
going to do here is josh is allowed to
 

435
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,070
going to do here is josh is allowed to
turn his hand over so

436
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
turn his hand over so
 

437
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,670
turn his hand over so
let's say maya and go real easy right

438
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
let's say maya and go real easy right
 

439
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,029
let's say maya and go real easy right
now my gets it to a point where it's

440
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
now my gets it to a point where it's
 

441
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,469
now my gets it to a point where it's
about to come out of the hand

442
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
about to come out of the hand
 

443
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,550
about to come out of the hand
josh can turn his hand over and re-grip

444
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
josh can turn his hand over and re-grip
 

445
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,070
josh can turn his hand over and re-grip
right and he can re-grip any way he

446
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
right and he can re-grip any way he
 

447
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,909
right and he can re-grip any way he
wants right so as she turns it over bang

448
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
wants right so as she turns it over bang
 

449
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,950
wants right so as she turns it over bang
he's going to try and re-grip

450
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
he's going to try and re-grip
 

451
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,550
he's going to try and re-grip
in a good way so as maya's trying to

452
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
in a good way so as maya's trying to
 

453
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,230
in a good way so as maya's trying to
twist it out now you guys can go life's

454
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
twist it out now you guys can go life's
 

455
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,870
twist it out now you guys can go life's
full speed

456
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
full speed
 

457
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,629
full speed
okay so an esme is trying to twist it

458
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
okay so an esme is trying to twist it
 

459
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,469
okay so an esme is trying to twist it
out josh is going to be able to re-grip

460
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
out josh is going to be able to re-grip
 

461
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,510
out josh is going to be able to re-grip
and grab it now is

462
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
and grab it now is
 

463
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,990
and grab it now is
if his hand comes off that's fine josh

464
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
if his hand comes off that's fine josh
 

465
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,790
if his hand comes off that's fine josh
is still working

466
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
is still working
 

467
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,790
is still working
what maya wants to do is now learn to to

468
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
what maya wants to do is now learn to to
 

469
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,309
what maya wants to do is now learn to to
separate it out just like that so she

470
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
separate it out just like that so she
 

471
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,270
separate it out just like that so she
wants to pull it away

472
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
wants to pull it away
 

473
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,710
wants to pull it away
so as she's working to get it out and

474
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
so as she's working to get it out and
 

475
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,309
so as she's working to get it out and
josh is switching his grip over she's

476
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
josh is switching his grip over she's
 

477
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,270
josh is switching his grip over she's
trying to find a way

478
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
trying to find a way
 

479
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,550
trying to find a way
to do it now she's not going to block

480
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
to do it now she's not going to block
 

481
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,990
to do it now she's not going to block
his hands like she just did they're

482
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
his hands like she just did they're
 

483
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,430
his hands like she just did they're
starting to amp up over here because i'm

484
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
starting to amp up over here because i'm
 

485
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,390
starting to amp up over here because i'm
talking too much

486
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
talking too much
 

487
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,390
talking too much
and they're getting antsy but um so

488
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
and they're getting antsy but um so
 

489
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,990
and they're getting antsy but um so
basically she's gonna try and just stick

490
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
basically she's gonna try and just stick
 

491
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,270
basically she's gonna try and just stick

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,550
i use to start getting the students used
to what risk techniques are how to do

658
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
to what risk techniques are how to do
 

659
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,470
to what risk techniques are how to do
them how to resist against them

660
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
them how to resist against them
 

661
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,069
them how to resist against them
how to move and change and adapt with

662
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
how to move and change and adapt with
 

663
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,150
how to move and change and adapt with
them so that's a really basic practice

664
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
them so that's a really basic practice
 

665
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,069
them so that's a really basic practice
that practice can go into a much more

666
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
that practice can go into a much more
 

667
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,350
that practice can go into a much more
live practice later

668
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
live practice later
 

669
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,949
live practice later
so that is totally live practice in and

670
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
so that is totally live practice in and
 

671
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,310
so that is totally live practice in and
of itself they're both trying as hard as

672
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
of itself they're both trying as hard as
 

673
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,509
of itself they're both trying as hard as
they can to get the stick out of each

674
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:13,519
they can to get the stick out of each
 

675
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,069
they can to get the stick out of each
other's hands

676
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
other's hands
 

677
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,710
other's hands
and you can see in phase six once both

678
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
and you can see in phase six once both
 

679
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,350
and you can see in phase six once both
hands are on

680
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
hands are on
 

681
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,350
hands are on
either person could tear it out so you

682
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
either person could tear it out so you
 

683
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,030
either person could tear it out so you
had josh tearing it out sometimes am i

684
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
had josh tearing it out sometimes am i
 

685
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,230
had josh tearing it out sometimes am i
tearing it out the other time so whoever

686
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
tearing it out the other time so whoever
 

687
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,430
tearing it out the other time so whoever
gets it gets the stick

688
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
gets it gets the stick
 

689
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,110
gets it gets the stick
and the whole objective of that practice

690
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
and the whole objective of that practice
 

691
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,190
and the whole objective of that practice
is just to get the stick so

692
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
is just to get the stick so
 

693
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,030
is just to get the stick so
you could try throws and stuff too and

694
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
you could try throws and stuff too and
 

695
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,710
you could try throws and stuff too and
you notice they didn't it's not because

696
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
you notice they didn't it's not because
 

697
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,990
you notice they didn't it's not because
throws were off the table

698
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
throws were off the table
 

699
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,829
throws were off the table
it's because a lot of times throws don't

700
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
it's because a lot of times throws don't
 

701
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,829
it's because a lot of times throws don't
actually help and if you start focusing

702
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
actually help and if you start focusing
 

703
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,269
actually help and if you start focusing
more on doing a throw

704
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
more on doing a throw
 

705
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,030
more on doing a throw
than you do on getting the weapon out a

706
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
than you do on getting the weapon out a
 

707
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,550
than you do on getting the weapon out a
lot of times you'll throw them with the

708
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
lot of times you'll throw them with the
 

709
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,509
lot of times you'll throw them with the
weapon in their hand

710
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
weapon in their hand
 

711
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,110
weapon in their hand
and then that doesn't help you right and

712
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
and then that doesn't help you right and
 

713
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,470
and then that doesn't help you right and
there might be times that that does help

714
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
there might be times that that does help
 

715
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:44,949
there might be times that that does help
you but

716
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
you but
 

717
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,509
you but
the goal of that practice is to get good

718
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
the goal of that practice is to get good
 

719
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,150
the goal of that practice is to get good
at

720
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
at
 

721
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,750
at
taking something out of someone's hand

722
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
taking something out of someone's hand
 

723
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,829
taking something out of someone's hand
which is what a wrist technique actually

724
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
which is what a wrist technique actually
 

725
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,230
which is what a wrist technique actually
is

726
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
is
 

727
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,389
is
so i could take any brand new person off

728
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
so i could take any brand new person off
 

729
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,910
so i could take any brand new person off
the street and i've done this

730
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
the street and i've done this
 

731
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,509
the street and i've done this
in our self-defense seminars i take a

732
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
in our self-defense seminars i take a
 

733
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,190
in our self-defense seminars i take a
brand new person off the street and i

734
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
brand new person off the street and i
 

735
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,590
brand new person off the street and i
just

736
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
just
 

737
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,269
just
teach them the drill i don't teach them

738
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
teach them the drill i don't teach them
 

739
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,550
teach them the drill i don't teach them
how you're going to take anything out of

740
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
how you're going to take anything out of
 

741
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,069
how you're going to take anything out of
anyone's hand or anything else

742
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
anyone's hand or anything else
 

743
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,069
anyone's hand or anything else
and by the end of that drill the

744
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
and by the end of that drill the
 

745
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,990
and by the end of that drill the
students who never saw wrist technique

746
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
students who never saw wrist technique
 

747
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,470
students who never saw wrist technique
before

748
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
before
 

749
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,470
before
will instantly be doing coda geishas and

750
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
will instantly be doing coda geishas and
 

751
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,550
will instantly be doing coda geishas and
nico's like crazy they'll be doing tons

752
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
nico's like crazy they'll be doing tons
 

753
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,949
nico's like crazy they'll be doing tons
of them

754
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
of them
 

755
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,150
of them
and the reason is because those

756
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
and the reason is because those
 

757
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,230
and the reason is because those
techniques are super high percentage

758
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
techniques are super high percentage
 

759
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,230
techniques are super high percentage
for that context and the context is

760
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
for that context and the context is
 

761
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,990
for that context and the context is
taking something out of someone's hand

762
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
taking something out of someone's hand
 

763
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,910
taking something out of someone's hand
so you will see tons of nikki's encoded

764
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
so you will see tons of nikki's encoded
 

765
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,190
so you will see tons of nikki's encoded
issues from people who have never been

766
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
issues from people who have never been
 

767
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,389
issues from people who have never been
taught the technique before

768
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
taught the technique before
 

769
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,069
taught the technique before
you'd be shocked at how quickly people

770
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
you'd be shocked at how quickly people
 

771
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,910
you'd be shocked at how quickly people
can learn this stuff when you just give

772
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
can learn this stuff when you just give
 

773
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,430
can learn this stuff when you just give
them a live drill like this to work with

774
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
them a live drill like this to work with
 

775
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,870
them a live drill like this to work with
so this live drill starts teaching you

776
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
so this live drill starts teaching you
 

777
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,310
so this live drill starts teaching you
how to work with wrist techniques

778
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
how to work with wrist techniques
 

779
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,910
how to work with wrist techniques
now one more caveat i have to add

780
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
now one more caveat i have to add
 

781
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,350
now one more caveat i have to add
actually probably two more caveats

782
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
actually probably two more caveats
 

783
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,509
actually probably two more caveats
one for safety and one for practicality

784
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
one for safety and one for practicality
 

785
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,430
one for safety and one for practicality
this is not the system of aikido so what

786
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
this is not the system of aikido so what
 

787
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,269
this is not the system of aikido so what
you just saw is not the system of aikido

788
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
you just saw is not the system of aikido
 

789
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,190
you just saw is not the system of aikido
it is not the ideal way to use a

00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
it is not the ideal way to use a
 

791
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,550
it is not the ideal way to use a
systematic approach to deal with

792
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
systematic approach to deal with
 

793
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,269
systematic approach to deal with
conflict

794
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
conflict
 

795
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,590
conflict
this is a struggle right so this is a

796
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
this is a struggle right so this is a
 

797
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,190
this is a struggle right so this is a
struggling method so not the system of

798
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
struggling method so not the system of
 

799
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,030
struggling method so not the system of
aikido now it uses some of the

800
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
aikido now it uses some of the
 

801
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,710
aikido now it uses some of the
techniques we see in aikido

802
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
techniques we see in aikido
 

803
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,949
techniques we see in aikido
and it's a good way to improve and get

804
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
and it's a good way to improve and get
 

805
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,629
and it's a good way to improve and get
better at those techniques but this is

806
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
better at those techniques but this is
 

807
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,990
better at those techniques but this is
systematically not what you would want

808
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
systematically not what you would want
 

809
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,509
systematically not what you would want
to do in aikido right and aikido i

810
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
to do in aikido right and aikido i
 

811
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,310
to do in aikido right and aikido i
wouldn't want to

812
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
wouldn't want to
