1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,110

so this is Topsy turby and in order to

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,120
so this is Topsy turby and in order to
 

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,990
so this is Topsy turby and in order to
get a topsy turby effect that's

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,000
get a topsy turby effect that's
 

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,350
get a topsy turby effect that's
mechanically efficient I have to

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360
mechanically efficient I have to
 

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,509
mechanically efficient I have to
establish a relationship between one end

8
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
establish a relationship between one end
 

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,109
establish a relationship between one end
of the lever and the other end of the

10
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:16,119
of the lever and the other end of the
 

11
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:18,109
of the lever and the other end of the
lever the two distal ends of the lever

12
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:18,119
lever the two distal ends of the lever
 

13
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,470
lever the two distal ends of the lever
you do that by establishing the center

14
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
you do that by establishing the center
 

15
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,670
you do that by establishing the center
and then you manipulate those distal

16
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:22,680
and then you manipulate those distal
 

17
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,750
and then you manipulate those distal
ends of the lever as far as possible in

18
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
ends of the lever as far as possible in
 

19
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,310
ends of the lever as far as possible in
the Topsy turbia effect so that's one

20
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
the Topsy turbia effect so that's one
 

21
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,470
the Topsy turbia effect so that's one
thing and then the other thing is you're

22
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
thing and then the other thing is you're
 

23
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,470
thing and then the other thing is you're
going to maintain connection with him so

24
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:33,480
going to maintain connection with him so
 

25
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,350
going to maintain connection with him so
that his weight will pull you over okay

26
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:36,360
that his weight will pull you over okay
 

27
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,510
that his weight will pull you over okay
and that's an adhesion all right so you

28
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
and that's an adhesion all right so you
 

29
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,709
and that's an adhesion all right so you
get you know you have to

30
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:41,719
get you know you have to
 

31
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,430
get you know you have to
depose

32
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
depose
 

33
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,510
depose
okay and here's one side of the lever up

34
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
okay and here's one side of the lever up
 

35
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,029
okay and here's one side of the lever up
here at the head and down here at this

36
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:50,039
here at the head and down here at this
 

37
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,310
here at the head and down here at this
foot

38
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:51,320
foot
 

39
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,389
foot
okay and then the other side of the

40
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:53,399
okay and then the other side of the
 

41
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,389
okay and then the other side of the
lever is here but if I try to do this

42
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
lever is here but if I try to do this
 

43
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,630
lever is here but if I try to do this
his Center is kind of gooy what I want

44
00:00:59,630 --> 00:00:59,640
his Center is kind of gooy what I want
 

45
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,910
his Center is kind of gooy what I want
to do is bring him on to me that makes I

46
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:02,920
to do is bring him on to me that makes I
 

47
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,710
to do is bring him on to me that makes I
don't know why but people tense okay and

48
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:05,720
don't know why but people tense okay and
 

49
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,670
don't know why but people tense okay and
they tense just enough and I've taken

50
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:08,680
they tense just enough and I've taken
 

51
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,670
they tense just enough and I've taken
weight off of there but if he was like

52
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:10,680
weight off of there but if he was like
 

53
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,749
weight off of there but if he was like
super Slinky Slinky then you'll feel

54
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:13,759
super Slinky Slinky then you'll feel
 

55
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:16,670
super Slinky Slinky then you'll feel
like ah man that's heavy again okay so

56
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,680
like ah man that's heavy again okay so
 

57
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,429
like ah man that's heavy again okay so
it's more than there's just weight off

58
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:18,439
it's more than there's just weight off
 

59
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,590
it's more than there's just weight off
his knees okay you want you as you move

60
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:22,600
his knees okay you want you as you move
 

61
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,990
his knees okay you want you as you move
people will stiffen up and now now this

62
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
people will stiffen up and now now this
 

63
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,109
people will stiffen up and now now this
works okay and then I maintain

64
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
works okay and then I maintain
 

65
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,830
works okay and then I maintain
connection so I do my scissors sweep and

66
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
connection so I do my scissors sweep and
 

67
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,830
connection so I do my scissors sweep and
as he goes over just whever I'm touching

68
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:34,840
as he goes over just whever I'm touching
 

69
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,950
as he goes over just whever I'm touching
without locking up his

70
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
without locking up his
 

71
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:56,830
without locking up his
weight will pull me

72
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:56,840

 

73
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,389

over okay let's try it is very

74
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:01,399
over okay let's try it is very
 

75
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,310
over okay let's try it is very
tempting to uh go just do a like a a a

tempting to uh go just do a like a a a
 

77
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,550
tempting to uh go just do a like a a a
cap on this and then you push him over

78
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
cap on this and then you push him over
 

79
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,750
cap on this and then you push him over
with

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,589
with
that okay then but we want to work both

82
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:14,599
that okay then but we want to work both
 

83
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,790
that okay then but we want to work both
ends of the lever so I'm going to move

84
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
ends of the lever so I'm going to move
 

85
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,030
ends of the lever so I'm going to move
this it's going all the way over

86
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,040

 

87
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,350

there even if I smell that he's

88
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:28,360
there even if I smell that he's
 

89
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:41,149
there even if I smell that he's
going I still do it all the

90
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:41,159

 

91
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,710

way

92
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
way
 

93
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,949
way
okay don't get

94
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
okay don't get
 

95
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,710
okay don't get
lazy that's

96
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:47,720
lazy that's
 

97
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,270
lazy that's
got so even even as I'm holding him I'm

98
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:52,280
got so even even as I'm holding him I'm
 

99
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,030
got so even even as I'm holding him I'm
in that connection with him okay so as

100
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,040
in that connection with him okay so as
 

101
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,350
in that connection with him okay so as
he some people go one leg at a time they

102
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:58,360
he some people go one leg at a time they
 

103
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,750
he some people go one leg at a time they
start to stand you see I don't want to

104
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:00,760
start to stand you see I don't want to
 

105
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,470
start to stand you see I don't want to
contest this movement I'll I'll fall

106
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,480
contest this movement I'll I'll fall
 

107
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,750
contest this movement I'll I'll fall
into where I need to go and that's where

108
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:06,760
into where I need to go and that's where
 

109
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,789
into where I need to go and that's where
you're going to find the scissors sweep

110
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:08,799
you're going to find the scissors sweep
 

111
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:11,949
you're going to find the scissors sweep
okay and then you can

112
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:11,959
okay and then you can
 

113
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,630
okay and then you can
see if because you want to move the

114
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
see if because you want to move the
 

115
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,430
see if because you want to move the
distal ends as much as possible you have

116
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
distal ends as much as possible you have
 

117
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,670
distal ends as much as possible you have
to get to the distal end don't short

118
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
to get to the distal end don't short
 

119
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,470
to get to the distal end don't short
change it in here you were you stayed

120
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:21,480
change it in here you were you stayed
 

121
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,750
change it in here you were you stayed
attached to that point Let It Drop and

122
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:24,760
attached to that point Let It Drop and
 

123
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,110
attached to that point Let It Drop and
then you can see how much he's ready to

124
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
then you can see how much he's ready to
 

125
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,149
then you can see how much he's ready to
fall this way okay yes sir so doesn't

126
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
fall this way okay yes sir so doesn't
 

127
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,229
fall this way okay yes sir so doesn't
take as much as the administrative

128
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
take as much as the administrative
 

129
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,270
take as much as the administrative
version to get these relationships and

130
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
version to get these relationships and
 

131
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,630
version to get these relationships and
now you just do the same scissors sweep

132
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
now you just do the same scissors sweep
 

133
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,190
now you just do the same scissors sweep
stay

134
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200

 

135
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,869

connected so you you maintain connection

136
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
connected so you you maintain connection
 

137
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,110
connected so you you maintain connection
he goes it's going to move you it moves

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,830
okay once you touch the back of his neck
he's going to be trying to get it up so

166
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:36,840
he's going to be trying to get it up so
 

167
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,790
he's going to be trying to get it up so
let's get

168
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
let's get
 

169
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,469
let's get
there okay once you grab his neck he he

170
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
there okay once you grab his neck he he
 

171
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,110
there okay once you grab his neck he he
he's going to feel that precariousness

172
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
he's going to feel that precariousness
 

173
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,670
he's going to feel that precariousness
so as he goes up you don't want to hold

174
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
so as he goes up you don't want to hold
 

175
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,510
so as he goes up you don't want to hold
here you don't want to clench down on

176
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
here you don't want to clench down on
 

177
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,029
here you don't want to clench down on
that as he goes up you taking it that

178
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:53,039
that as he goes up you taking it that
 

179
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:55,590
that as he goes up you taking it that
way okay just

180
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
way okay just
 

181
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,670
way okay just
like uh when he gets up here you know I

182
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:00,680
like uh when he gets up here you know I
 

183
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,430
like uh when he gets up here you know I
don't try to shove it down I bring It

184
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:04,440
don't try to shove it down I bring It
 

185
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,350
don't try to shove it down I bring It
Forward same exact

186
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:08,360

 

187
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,790

thing I'm I'm light wherever I'm

188
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
thing I'm I'm light wherever I'm
 

189
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,469
thing I'm I'm light wherever I'm
touching

190
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:13,479

 

191
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,590

him light he tries to get up I'm

192
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:16,600
him light he tries to get up I'm
 

193
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,309
him light he tries to get up I'm
bringing it

194
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:18,319
bringing it
 

195
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,469
bringing it
Forward okay otherwise you got to be

196
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
Forward okay otherwise you got to be
 

197
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,350
Forward okay otherwise you got to be
stronger than him okay here we

198
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
stronger than him okay here we
 

199
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,909
stronger than him okay here we
go back to admin pendulum sweep okay you

200
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
go back to admin pendulum sweep okay you
 

201
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,309
go back to admin pendulum sweep okay you
got a couple choices you can either go

202
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:30,319
got a couple choices you can either go
 

203
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,590
got a couple choices you can either go
on the hip you can go on the

204
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:32,600
on the hip you can go on the
 

205
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,790
on the hip you can go on the
leg but you're going to try to turn 90°

206
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:35,800
leg but you're going to try to turn 90°
 

207
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,629
leg but you're going to try to turn 90°
to

208
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:37,639
to
 

209
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,469
to
him you can use your arm to come in okay

210
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
him you can use your arm to come in okay
 

211
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,029
him you can use your arm to come in okay
and what you want is this knee in the

212
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
and what you want is this knee in the
 

213
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,350
and what you want is this knee in the
armpit so keep your locks in there but

214
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:48,360
armpit so keep your locks in there but
 

215
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,230
armpit so keep your locks in there but
here's the part you do have to have that

216
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
here's the part you do have to have that
 

217
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,110
here's the part you do have to have that
arm in there okay so he doesn't post out

218
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,120
arm in there okay so he doesn't post out
 

219
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,230
arm in there okay so he doesn't post out
the bottom leg keeps straight cuz it's

220
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:57,240
the bottom leg keeps straight cuz it's
 

221
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,990
the bottom leg keeps straight cuz it's
going to attack the distal end of the

222
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
going to attack the distal end of the
 

223
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,550
going to attack the distal end of the
pendulum at the

224
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
pendulum at the
 

225
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,150
pendulum at the
bottom at the

226
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,160
bottom at the
 

227
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,029
bottom at the
end and you'll come

228
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:10,039

 

229
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,710

over keep this leg straight so you don't

230
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:13,720
over keep this leg straight so you don't
 

231
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,870
over keep this leg straight so you don't
make him land on you so

232
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880

 

233
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,550

boom again bring him on you then start

234
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
boom again bring him on you then start
 

235
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,790
boom again bring him on you then start
to sweep you can keep this long this leg

236
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
to sweep you can keep this long this leg
 

237
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,950
to sweep you can keep this long this leg
so you get a good base and when you're

238
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
so you get a good base and when you're
 

239
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,189
so you get a good base and when you're
ready

240
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:30,199
ready
 

241
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,469
ready
then you take it

242
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479

 

243
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,469

out stay connected so when the center of

244
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
out stay connected so when the center of
 

245
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,309
out stay connected so when the center of
gravity moves it moves you

246
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319

 

247
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,749

too okay let's try

248
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
too okay let's try
 

249
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,909
too okay let's try
sir okay so any Topsy Turvy that you do

250
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
sir okay so any Topsy Turvy that you do
 

251
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,150
sir okay so any Topsy Turvy that you do
in a single plane so in the vertical

252
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,160
in a single plane so in the vertical
 

253
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,550
in a single plane so in the vertical
plane that as much mechanical advantage

254
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
plane that as much mechanical advantage
 

255
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,430
plane that as much mechanical advantage
as you have by working the distal ends

256
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:00,440
as you have by working the distal ends
 

257
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,309
as you have by working the distal ends
of the lever that still requires a great

258
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:03,319
of the lever that still requires a great
 

259
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,950
of the lever that still requires a great
deal of energy if you make this Topsy

260
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
deal of energy if you make this Topsy
 

261
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,790
deal of energy if you make this Topsy
turby thing travel across the mat in the

262
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
turby thing travel across the mat in the
 

263
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,270
turby thing travel across the mat in the
sagittal plane it takes less energy okay

264
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,280
sagittal plane it takes less energy okay
 

265
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,629
sagittal plane it takes less energy okay
so we were doing that in the other one

266
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
so we were doing that in the other one
 

267
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,710
so we were doing that in the other one
if you posts up here and when I brought

268
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:19,720
if you posts up here and when I brought
 

269
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,550
if you posts up here and when I brought
him this way you see he's traversing if

270
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:23,560
him this way you see he's traversing if
 

271
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,510
him this way you see he's traversing if
he stays here and I try to flip this

272
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:26,520
he stays here and I try to flip this
 

273
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,749
he stays here and I try to flip this
it's doable but that takes way more

274
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
it's doable but that takes way more
 

275
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,150
it's doable but that takes way more
energy than if I'm bringing it this way

276
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
energy than if I'm bringing it this way
 

277
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,749
energy than if I'm bringing it this way
then it's effortless okay so the more

278
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:36,759
then it's effortless okay so the more
 

279
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,150
then it's effortless okay so the more
ples you add especially the sagittal one

280
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
ples you add especially the sagittal one
 

281
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,629
ples you add especially the sagittal one
the less energy it takes to make the two

282
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:43,639
the less energy it takes to make the two
 

283
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,110
the less energy it takes to make the two
distal ends trade places all right so

284
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,120
distal ends trade places all right so
 

285
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,670
distal ends trade places all right so
same thing here when you come around

286
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:48,680
same thing here when you come around
 

287
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,270
same thing here when you come around
here you don't you want to make him

288
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
here you don't you want to make him
 

289
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,390
here you don't you want to make him
Traverse okay so this leg is I'm going

290
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:55,400
Traverse okay so this leg is I'm going
 

291
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,629
Traverse okay so this leg is I'm going
to game this leg this leg is actually

292
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:57,639
to game this leg this leg is actually
 

293
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,550
to game this leg this leg is actually
bringing him this way

294
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560

 

295
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,390

when you add the arm and the hook and

296
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:05,400
when you add the arm and the hook and
 

297
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,110
when you add the arm and the hook and
everything it's much easier I'm going to

298
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,120
everything it's much easier I'm going to
 

299
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,029
everything it's much easier I'm going to
bring him this way you

300
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
bring him this way you
 

301
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,270
bring him this way you
see not this

302
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:14,280
see not this
 

303
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,070
see not this
way so bring him on you and he goes this

304
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,080
way so bring him on you and he goes this
 

305
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,029
way so bring him on you and he goes this
way much

306
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
way much
 

307
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,029
way much
easier

308
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
easier
 

309
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,390
easier
Okay add that sagittal plan try it again

310
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
Okay add that sagittal plan try it again
 

311
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,710
Okay add that sagittal plan try it again
in all your techniques right so find

312
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
in all your techniques right so find
 

313
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,350
in all your techniques right so find
doing

314
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:30,360
doing
 

315
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,909
doing
and he's going to try to resist uh it's

316
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:32,919
and he's going to try to resist uh it's
 

317
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,350
and he's going to try to resist uh it's
not that I drop on him and try to take

318
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
not that I drop on him and try to take
 

319
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,350
not that I drop on him and try to take
him down okay the energy that he resists

320
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:38,360
him down okay the energy that he resists
 

321
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,909
him down okay the energy that he resists
going up I take

322
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
going up I take
 

323
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,509
going up I take
forward okay every every technique's

324
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:42,519
forward okay every every technique's
 

325
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:49,110
forward okay every every technique's
like that so this is no

326
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120

 

327
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,949

different okay so a guy is trying to get

328
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:51,959
different okay so a guy is trying to get
 

329
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,949

359
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,949
trying to hold it down down as he goes
to stand up this motion is going forward

360
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:33,959
to stand up this motion is going forward
 

361
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,470
to stand up this motion is going forward
on the neck and then the knee pull is

362
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
on the neck and then the knee pull is
 

363
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,030
on the neck and then the knee pull is
going forward okay and as he starts to

364
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,040
going forward okay and as he starts to

go up I'm going to take him to the
 

367
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,949
go up I'm going to take him to the
side so that I get the side scissor get

368
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
side so that I get the side scissor get
 

369
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,990
side so that I get the side scissor get
my elbow Out start climbing on the back

370
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
my elbow Out start climbing on the back
 

371
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,069
my elbow Out start climbing on the back
he's not going to let me do that he's

372
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:52,079
he's not going to let me do that he's
 

373

00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
start pushing back and now here
 

377
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:05,389
start pushing back and now here
is your pendulum sweep

378
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:05,399

 

379
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,150

again don't contest anything directly he

380
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
again don't contest anything directly he
 

381
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,069
again don't contest anything directly he
goes one there it is Boom up here he

382
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
goes one there it is Boom up here he
 

383
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,630
goes one there it is Boom up here he
comes

384
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:17,640

 

385
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:28,030

pendulum okay try it

386
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,040

 

387
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040

again
