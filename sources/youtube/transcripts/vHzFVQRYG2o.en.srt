successfully with the stick then you're

58
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:05,430
successfully with the stick then you're
 

59
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,219
successfully with the stick then you're
really training nothing so remember

60
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:07,229

with this so if you don't have the
 

67
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,240
with this so if you don't have the
ability to do that you're really kind of

68
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,250
ability to do that you're really kind of

to also use a hold these in different

136
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:22,810
to also use a hold these in different
 

137
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,510
to also use a hold these in different
configurations that's really high that's

138
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:24,520
configurations that's really high that's
 

139
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,699
configurations that's really high that's
maybe that's a head that's super high so

140
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:26,709
maybe that's a head that's super high so
 

141
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,920
maybe that's a head that's super high so
maybe chest this is a normal target here

142
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:28,930
maybe chest this is a normal target here
 

143
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,199
maybe chest this is a normal target here

target every time low so maybe I have to

148
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:35,620
target every time low so maybe I have to
 

149
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,320
target every time low so maybe I have to
do a low thrust so we see this in the
