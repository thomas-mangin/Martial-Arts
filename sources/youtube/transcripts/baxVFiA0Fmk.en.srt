495
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,910

that you'll

496
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
that you'll
 

497
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,590

picturing

498
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
picturing
 

499
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,389

this you you're picturing bending them

00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
this you you're picturing bending them
 

501
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,430
this you you're picturing bending them
backwards but that's not the throw

502
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:30,440
backwards but that's not the throw
 

503
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,790

that's not the throwing mechanics okay

504
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
that's not the throwing mechanics okay
 

505
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,590
that's not the throwing mechanics okay
so without the without the Ed he kind of

506
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:36,600
so without the without the Ed he kind of
 

507
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,749
so without the without the Ed he kind of
just goes around me do you get it it's

508
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:39,759
just goes around me do you get it it's
 

509
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,550
just goes around me do you get it it's
