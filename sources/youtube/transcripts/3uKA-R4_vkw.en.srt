00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,120
almost like facing me
 

9
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,990
almost like facing me
so

10
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000

got to do it
 

49
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,310
got to do it
so let's do it

50
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
so let's do it
 

51
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,670
so let's do it
so i'm looking at my

52
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
so i'm looking at my
 

53
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,189
so i'm looking at my
hand

54
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
hand
 

55
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,910
hand
when it allows me to move in

56
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
when it allows me to move in
 

57
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,830
when it allows me to move in
it fits perfectly in

58
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840

 

59
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,070

that shoulder and i can even do this

60
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
that shoulder and i can even do this
 

61
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,750
that shoulder and i can even do this
grab one gig

62
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
grab one gig
 

63
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,310
grab one gig
i can come down here hold on

64
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
i can come down here hold on
 

65
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,670
i can come down here hold on
i can change

66
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
i can change
 

67
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,789
i can change
techniques

68
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799

 

69
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,670

so there's lots of variants

70
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
so there's lots of variants
 

71
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,310
so there's lots of variants
to this right so let's try again but

72
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
to this right so let's try again but
 

73
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,990
to this right so let's try again but
your hand is sometimes going on the back

74
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
your hand is sometimes going on the back
 

75
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,590
your hand is sometimes going on the back
of the head and then you're changing it

76
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
of the head and then you're changing it
 

77
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,550
of the head and then you're changing it
and

78
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
and
 

79
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:41,109
and
you haven't got time it's got to be

80
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,119

 

81
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,030

and that's when it becomes beautiful i'm

82
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
and that's when it becomes beautiful i'm
 

83
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,910
and that's when it becomes beautiful i'm
gonna get up i'm still locking down

84
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
gonna get up i'm still locking down
 

85
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,069
gonna get up i'm still locking down
i'm still locking the arm

86
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
i'm still locking the arm
 

87
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,749
i'm still locking the arm
so there's a whole package of what this

88
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
so there's a whole package of what this
 

89
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,389
so there's a whole package of what this
can do rather than what just these can

90
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
can do rather than what just these can
 

91
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,910
can do rather than what just these can
do

92
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
do
 

93
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,240
do
let's try
