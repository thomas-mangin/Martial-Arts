environment incident that you're
 

71
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,950
environment incident that you're
addressing so for example I don't stand

72
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:57,960

incident that calls for that but don't

78
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,200
incident that calls for that but don't
 

79
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,190
incident that calls for that but don't
adopt it right from the beginning

80
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,200
adopt it right from the beginning
 

81
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,470
adopt it right from the beginning
doesn't work so if you're

82
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:13,480
doesn't work so if you're
 

83
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,910
doesn't work so if you're
up and we're sparring this would be the

84
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:16,920
up and we're sparring this would be the
 

85
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,589
up and we're sparring this would be the
worst thing for me to do

86
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
worst thing for me to do
 

87
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,869
worst thing for me to do
okay um it's not very mobile right

88
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:23,879
okay um it's not very mobile right
 

89
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,229
okay um it's not very mobile right
you're just going to be able to close

90
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:25,239
you're just going to be able to close
 

91
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:27,630
you're just going to be able to close
and get angles on me very very

92
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:27,640
and get angles on me very very
 

93
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,990
and get angles on me very very
quickly um it's wrong it's wrong not

94
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,000
quickly um it's wrong it's wrong not
 

95
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,589
quickly um it's wrong it's wrong not
because it's iido it's wrong because in

96
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
because it's iido it's wrong because in
 

97
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,990
because it's iido it's wrong because in
that

98
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,000
that
 

99
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,149
that
situation it's in the wrong place at the

100
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:40,159
situation it's in the wrong place at the
 

101
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,750
situation it's in the wrong place at the
wrong time so for example what is that

102
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
wrong time so for example what is that
 

103
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,670
wrong time so for example what is that
situation well that situation is not

104
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:46,680
situation well that situation is not
 

105
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,670
situation well that situation is not
calling

106
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
calling
 

107
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,670
calling
for

108
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
for
 

109
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,470
for
stability of a bracing angle on this

110
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:53,480
stability of a bracing angle on this
 

111
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,070
stability of a bracing angle on this
line you see so if you just slightly get

112
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
line you see so if you just slightly get
 

113
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,550
line you see so if you just slightly get
offline then I don't don't have that

114
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
offline then I don't don't have that
 

115
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,430
offline then I don't don't have that
stability would just push you see I

116
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
stability would just push you see I
 

117
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,190
stability would just push you see I
don't have that

118
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
don't have that
 

119
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,589
don't have that
stability and so if you get in that

120
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:08,599
stability and so if you get in that
 

121
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,110
stability and so if you get in that
stance again he's very strong right

122
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,120
stance again he's very strong right
 

123
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,110
stance again he's very strong right
here so it seems cool but as I'm coming

124
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,120
here so it seems cool but as I'm coming
 

125
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,309
here so it seems cool but as I'm coming
in I'll change angle very quickly very

126
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:19,319
in I'll change angle very quickly very
 

127
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,630
in I'll change angle very quickly very
subtly and just I don't know anything

128
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:21,640
subtly and just I don't know anything
 

129
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,270
subtly and just I don't know anything
but to push and it takes away the

130
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,280
but to push and it takes away the
 

131
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,390
but to push and it takes away the
practicality of that stance it's in the

132
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
practicality of that stance it's in the
 

133
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,149
practicality of that stance it's in the
wrong place at the wrong time

134
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:31,159
wrong place at the wrong time
 

135
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,670
wrong place at the wrong time
okay of course some stances are so

136
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
okay of course some stances are so
 

137
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,470
okay of course some stances are so
specialized that there's very few times

138
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
specialized that there's very few times
 

139
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,789
specialized that there's very few times
that they will be natural and therefore

140
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
that they will be natural and therefore
 

141
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,509
that they will be natural and therefore
right therefore correspond to an

142
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:46,519
right therefore correspond to an
 

143
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,589
right therefore correspond to an
environment incident it's just like that

144
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:48,599
environment incident it's just like that
 

145
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,350
environment incident it's just like that
environment incident almost never comes

146
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:50,360
environment incident almost never comes
 

147
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,030
environment incident almost never comes
up okay and that's one of that's an

148
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
up okay and that's one of that's an
 

149
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,069
up okay and that's one of that's an
additional problem to the

150
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:57,079

 

151
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,470

k um so

152
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
k um so
 

153
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,069
k um so
we have to understand yet my footwork

154
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:03,079
we have to understand yet my footwork
 

155
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:04,910
we have to understand yet my footwork
has to correspond to what's actually

156
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:04,920
has to correspond to what's actually
 

157
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,470
has to correspond to what's actually
going on what's the environment incident

158
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:07,480
going on what's the environment incident
 

159
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,750
going on what's the environment incident
has to do

160
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:08,760
has to do
 

161
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,630
has to do
that but are there any

162
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:13,640

 

163
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,710

universal elements or aspects to my

164
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
universal elements or aspects to my
 

165
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,710
universal elements or aspects to my
footwork yes there there are okay and

166
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
footwork yes there there are okay and
 

167
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,030
footwork yes there there are okay and
that's midfoot vectran I'm going to try

168
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
that's midfoot vectran I'm going to try
 

169
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,749
that's midfoot vectran I'm going to try
to midfoot

170
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:24,759
to midfoot
 

171
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,310
to midfoot
Vector um I'm going to have my line of

172
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
Vector um I'm going to have my line of
 

173
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,990
Vector um I'm going to have my line of
gravity inside my b of

174
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,000
gravity inside my b of
 

175
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,909

support um I'm going to

176
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
support um I'm going to
 

177
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,270
support um I'm going to
have um a prioritization of Mobility

178
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,280
have um a prioritization of Mobility
 

179
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,350
have um a prioritization of Mobility
things like that okay so for example if

180
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
things like that okay so for example if
 

181
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,310
things like that okay so for example if
we go into that sparring

182
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
we go into that sparring
 

183
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,590
we go into that sparring
thing I don't want my weight on my heel

184
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
thing I don't want my weight on my heel
 

185
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,550
thing I don't want my weight on my heel
on the front foot my weight is on that

186
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
on the front foot my weight is on that
 

187
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,510
on the front foot my weight is on that
is on that midfoot so here's here's

188
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:52,520
is on that midfoot so here's here's
 

189
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,270
is on that midfoot so here's here's
weight on my heel do you see I shift

190
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
weight on my heel do you see I shift
 

191
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,670
weight on my heel do you see I shift
weight onto that onto that midfoot in

192
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:58,680
weight onto that onto that midfoot in
 

193
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,550
weight onto that onto that midfoot in
order to get there I'm going to have to

194
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
order to get there I'm going to have to
 

195
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,310
order to get there I'm going to have to
bend my knees drop my

196
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
bend my knees drop my
 

197
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,950
bend my knees drop my
Center then on the other foot I'm on the

198
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
Center then on the other foot I'm on the
 

199
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,909
Center then on the other foot I'm on the
I have my heel up but I'm still on the

200
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:06,919
I have my heel up but I'm still on the
 

201
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,710
I have my heel up but I'm still on the
midfoot I'm not on my toes the heel is

202
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:09,720
midfoot I'm not on my toes the heel is
 

203
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,550
midfoot I'm not on my toes the heel is
up but I'm still here and so now I can

204
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
up but I'm still here and so now I can
 

205
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,029
up but I'm still here and so now I can
move around so he tries to change that

206
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:16,039
move around so he tries to change that
 

207
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,350
move around so he tries to change that
angle again and I can

208
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:18,360
angle again and I can
 

209
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,990
angle again and I can
move because in that time incident you

210
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
move because in that time incident you
 

211
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,870
move because in that time incident you
haven't committed you haven't done

212
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:23,880
haven't committed you haven't done
 

213
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,629
haven't committed you haven't done
anything I don't know what you're doing

214
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:25,639
anything I don't know what you're doing
 

215
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,629
anything I don't know what you're doing
I don't know where your openings are yet

216
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:27,639
I don't know where your openings are yet
 

217
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,909
I don't know where your openings are yet
I haven't chosen my offense

218
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:30,919
I haven't chosen my offense
 

219
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:32,749
I haven't chosen my offense
so I want to prioritize the kind of

220
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:32,759
so I want to prioritize the kind of
 

221
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,550
so I want to prioritize the kind of
neutrality the kind of Maximum potential

222
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
neutrality the kind of Maximum potential
 

223
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,990
neutrality the kind of Maximum potential
so I adopt that stance that stance is

224
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,000
so I adopt that stance that stance is
 

225
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,510
so I adopt that stance that stance is
correct this stance is not correct

226
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
correct this stance is not correct
 

227
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,550
correct this stance is not correct
okay so yes it has to match the

228
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:47,560
okay so yes it has to match the
 

229
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,950
okay so yes it has to match the
environment incident and yes there are

230
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:49,960
environment incident and yes there are
 

231
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,870
environment incident and yes there are
Universal kind of

232
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:51,880
Universal kind of
 

233
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,749
Universal kind of
principles uh that I do I will always

234
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:54,759
principles uh that I do I will always
 

235
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,469
principles uh that I do I will always
have to buy by as I'm matching my

236
00:05:57,469 --> 00:05:57,479
have to buy by as I'm matching my
 

237
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,830
have to buy by as I'm matching my
footwork to the environment incident

238
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
footwork to the environment incident
 

239
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,510
footwork to the environment incident
okay so let's go into the drill we were

240
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
okay so let's go into the drill we were
 

241
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,670
okay so let's go into the drill we were
doing and let's say I think we're doing

242
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
doing and let's say I think we're doing
 

243
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,150
doing and let's say I think we're doing
from

244
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,160
from
 

245
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:18,629
from
De and he's got his spinal

246
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639

 

247
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,550

displacement and of course I don't want

248
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:21,560
displacement and of course I don't want
 

249
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,670
displacement and of course I don't want
to go like

250
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
to go like
 

251
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:31,670
to go like
this this isn't going to cut it

252
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680

 

253
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,390

but at the same time I don't want to go

254
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
but at the same time I don't want to go
 

255
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,589
but at the same time I don't want to go
here because I'm overc committed to one

256
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:37,599
here because I'm overc committed to one
 

257
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:39,950
here because I'm overc committed to one
angle when there's still lots of angles

258
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:39,960
angle when there's still lots of angles
 

259
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,990
angle when there's still lots of angles
that he could

260
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,000

 

261
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,710

take so we use the internals he's

262
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:47,720
take so we use the internals he's
 

263
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,670
take so we use the internals he's
pressing and I can hold my ground here

264
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
pressing and I can hold my ground here
 

265
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,270
pressing and I can hold my ground here
pretty much in

266
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
pretty much in
 

267
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,909
pretty much in
50/50 the only difference is I didn't

268
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:56,919
50/50 the only difference is I didn't
 

269
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:58,510
50/50 the only difference is I didn't
put that heel

270
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:58,520
put that heel
 

271
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,390
put that heel
up in the phasing stance where there was

272
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
up in the phasing stance where there was
 

273
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,629
up in the phasing stance where there was
more potential of what it all could be

274
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:05,639
more potential of what it all could be
 

275
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,189
more potential of what it all could be
so I'm going to prioritize

276
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:08,199
so I'm going to prioritize
 

277
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,830
so I'm going to prioritize
Mobility

278
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
Mobility
 

279
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,749
Mobility
but it's pretty much the same

280
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:12,759
but it's pretty much the same
 

281
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,430
but it's pretty much the same
stance

282
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:14,440
stance
 

283
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,950
stance
okay it doesn't mean you can't do it

284
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
okay it doesn't mean you can't do it
 

285
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,510
okay it doesn't mean you can't do it
with your heel up you can you can you

286
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
with your heel up you can you can you
 

287
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,869
with your heel up you can you can you
can it's still the

288
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:23,879
can it's still the
 

289
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,350
can it's still the
midfoot but I know I'm not moving I'm

290
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
midfoot but I know I'm not moving I'm
 

291
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,670
midfoot but I know I'm not moving I'm
not shuffling so it doesn't give me

292
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
not shuffling so it doesn't give me
 

293
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,110
not shuffling so it doesn't give me
anything let me put the heel

294
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,120

 

295
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,309

down when it comes to how much pressure

296
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:37,319
down when it comes to how much pressure
 

297
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,670
down when it comes to how much pressure
you have It's a combination of things

298
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
you have It's a combination of things
 

299
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,309
you have It's a combination of things
again specific to the environment

300
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
again specific to the environment
 

301
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,950
again specific to the environment
incident so for

302
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
incident so for
 

303
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,830
incident so for
example if I can internalize a lot I can

304
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
example if I can internalize a lot I can
 

305
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,869
example if I can internalize a lot I can
stay more still longer meaning more in

306
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:55,879
stay more still longer meaning more in
 

307
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:03,510
stay more still longer meaning more in
place and move in

308
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520

 

309
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,390

but if he got to go slow so I can talk

310
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:07,400
but if he got to go slow so I can talk
 

311
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,149
but if he got to go slow so I can talk
if he starts to break my midfoot V

312
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:11,159
if he starts to break my midfoot V
 

313
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:16,270
if he starts to break my midfoot V
Journey before I got here and I lost

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:16,280
Journey before I got here and I lost
 

315
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,790

organization I can always take whatever

320
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:23,479
organization I can always take whatever
 

321
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,629

value I have on on midfoot vectory and

322
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:27,639
value I have on on midfoot vectory and
 

323
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,589
value I have on on midfoot vectory and
take some pressure off of him by

324
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
take some pressure off of him by
 

325
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,870
take some pressure off of him by
changing

326
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:31,880
changing
 

327
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,029
changing
angles and that's where I now start to

328
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
angles and that's where I now start to
 

329
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,670
angles and that's where I now start to
bring not just the stance but my foot

330
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:38,680
bring not just the stance but my foot
 

331
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,389
bring not just the stance but my foot
work so I'm here and I don't have to go

332
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:43,399
work so I'm here and I don't have to go
 

333
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,590
work so I'm here and I don't have to go
like this until I figure something

334
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:48,600

 

335
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,790

out I'll

336
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
out I'll
 

337
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,110
out I'll
feel the compromisation and before it

338
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,120
feel the compromisation and before it
 

339
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,389
feel the compromisation and before it
takes over I move to take pressure off

340
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:57,399
takes over I move to take pressure off
 

341
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,110
takes over I move to take pressure off
of him pressure

342
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,120
of him pressure
 

343
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,110
of him pressure
value from him

344
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
value from him
 

345
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,750
value from him
okay and that way my

346
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:06,760
okay and that way my
 

347
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,750
okay and that way my
footwork is

348
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:08,760
footwork is
 

349
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,990
footwork is
very

350
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000

 

351
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,710

simple this is very

352
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
simple this is very
 

353
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,190
simple this is very
complicated doesn't

354
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:20,200

 

355
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:27,150

work this is very

356
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,160

 

357
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,350

simple to that I can add my

358
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,360
simple to that I can add my
 

359
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,470
simple to that I can add my
tabaki so right here the pressure that I

360
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:35,480
tabaki so right here the pressure that I
 

361
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,230
tabaki so right here the pressure that I
felt that wanted me to

362
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,240
felt that wanted me to
 

363
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,949
felt that wanted me to
step I can take pressure off to with my

364
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
step I can take pressure off to with my
 

365
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,230
step I can take pressure off to with my
pattern so the pressure that I'm feeling

366
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
pattern so the pressure that I'm feeling
 

367
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,509
pattern so the pressure that I'm feeling
that led me to be compromised there that

368
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
that led me to be compromised there that
 

369
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,230
that led me to be compromised there that
wanted me to

370
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:51,240
wanted me to
 

371
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,030
wanted me to
step you can change with your hand

372
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
step you can change with your hand
 

373
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,509
step you can change with your hand
work by nonc contesting at the hand work

374
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:02,519

 

375
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,870

so I'm doing all of these

376
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
so I'm doing all of these
 

377
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,910
so I'm doing all of these
things as I need to all of them as I

378
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:08,920
things as I need to all of them as I
 

379
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,430
things as I need to all of them as I
need to or as I want to if you're still

getting pinned before I got here I
should have just taken some pressure

420
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:14,279
should have just taken some pressure
 

421
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:21,949
should have just taken some pressure
value from him or move

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
it feels
 

469
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,590
it feels
like in your reps that there is a direct

00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:36,600
like in your reps that there is a direct
 

471
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,110
like in your reps that there is a direct
one to one connection to my input and

the timing of your foot that's moving to
 

475
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,189
the timing of your foot that's moving to
maintain that X

maintain that X
and when I'm training with these guys I

478
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
and when I'm training with these guys I
 

479
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,949
and when I'm training with these guys I
feel like that happens before the

480
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
feel like that happens before the
 

481
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,110
feel like that happens before the
actual balls push before before the

482
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,120
actual balls push before before the
 

483
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,150
actual balls push before before the
energy kind

484
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
energy kind
 

485
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,790
energy kind
of it is before so they're not y y

486
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
of it is before so they're not y y
 

487
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,629
of it is before so they're not y y
clashing but it feels like it's ahead of

488
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
clashing but it feels like it's ahead of
 

489
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,990
clashing but it feels like it's ahead of
me and therefore there's a

490
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,000
me and therefore there's a
 

491
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,350
me and therefore there's a
delay on the projection point where

492
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
delay on the projection point where
 

493
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,310
delay on the projection point where
yours feels like this I move your foot

494
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
yours feels like this I move your foot
 

495
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,230
yours feels like this I move your foot
foot ground and that immediately sends

496
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,240
foot ground and that immediately sends
 

497
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,949
foot ground and that immediately sends
me pop out but it feels like I get

498
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:21,959
me pop out but it feels like I get
 

499
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,069
me pop out but it feels like I get
sucked in yeah the longer there okay so

500
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:25,079
sucked in yeah the longer there okay so
 

501
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,389
sucked in yeah the longer there okay so
this so if I'm and correct me if I'm not

502
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
this so if I'm and correct me if I'm not
 

503
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,590
this so if I'm and correct me if I'm not
understanding this your question so uh

504
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
understanding this your question so uh
 

505
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,310
understanding this your question so uh
when when he pushes on

506
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:35,320
when when he pushes on
 

507
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,949
when when he pushes on
me as he gets deeper into the the

508
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
me as he gets deeper into the the
 

509
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,750
me as he gets deeper into the the
pressure then he goes right away into

510
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
pressure then he goes right away into
 

511
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,189
pressure then he goes right away into
the projection as as opposed

512
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:46,199

 

513
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:50,550

to this okay so what what so what is

514
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
to this okay so what what so what is
 

515
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,430
to this okay so what what so what is
what's let me give words to the second

516
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:52,440
what's let me give words to the second
 

517
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,110
what's let me give words to the second
one the second one is this is how I

518
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,120
one the second one is this is how I
 

519
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,069
one the second one is this is how I
understand it you have an external

520
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
understand it you have an external
 

521
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,749
understand it you have an external
deviation

522
00:13:59,749 --> 00:13:59,759
deviation
 

523
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,269
deviation
and then you press the ground Vector

524
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:04,279
and then you press the ground Vector
 

525
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:08,310
and then you press the ground Vector
into their Center so again I I'm moving

526
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
into their Center so again I I'm moving
 

527
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,269
into their Center so again I I'm moving
over here and then I push okay but as

528
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:14,279
over here and then I push okay but as
 

529
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,030
over here and then I push okay but as
he's going you already have the the

530
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,040
he's going you already have the the
 

531
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,990
he's going you already have the the
center so you can move it this way you

532
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,000
center so you can move it this way you
 

533
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,110
center so you can move it this way you
see you can move it this way and you can

534
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,120
see you can move it this way and you can
 

535
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,790
see you can move it this way and you can
put it on whatever foot you want so

536
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:27,800
put it on whatever foot you want so
 

537
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,470
put it on whatever foot you want so
let's say I want to Bounce It Off the

538
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
let's say I want to Bounce It Off the
 

539
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,509
let's say I want to Bounce It Off the
front foot you see so he's hitting the

540
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
front foot you see so he's hitting the
 

541
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,870
front foot you see so he's hitting the
front foot when he does that or or he'll

542
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880
front foot when he does that or or he'll
 

543
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,069
front foot when he does that or or he'll
hit my left foot when when I project

544
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:41,079
hit my left foot when when I project
 

545
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,749
hit my left foot when when I project
that okay and so one of the ways you can

546
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:43,759
that okay and so one of the ways you can
 

547
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:50,710
that okay and so one of the ways you can
tell aside from feeling it is the extra

548
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
tell aside from feeling it is the extra
 

549
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,069
tell aside from feeling it is the extra
movement you see I had to shift and my

550
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,079
movement you see I had to shift and my
 

551
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,389
movement you see I had to shift and my
hands had

552
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:55,399
hands had
 

553
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,189
hands had
to move okay um and well okay what is

554
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:00,199
to move okay um and well okay what is
 

555
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,350
to move okay um and well okay what is
that well that's about from the moment

556
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:02,360
that well that's about from the moment
 

557
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,749
that well that's about from the moment
of contact wherever he touches you you

558
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:05,759
of contact wherever he touches you you
 

559
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,350
of contact wherever he touches you you
already are in his Center what what's

560
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:08,360
already are in his Center what what's
 

561
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,949
already are in his Center what what's
happening now is I'm not in his Center

562
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
happening now is I'm not in his Center
 

563
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,910
happening now is I'm not in his Center
not in his Center till I push into him

564
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:14,920
not in his Center till I push into him
 

565
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,310
not in his Center till I push into him
okay and that is I think obviously

566
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
okay and that is I think obviously
 

567
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,030
okay and that is I think obviously
that's something different and

568
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
that's something different and
 

569
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,030
that's something different and
obviously you won't really have

570
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,040
obviously you won't really have
 

571
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,509
obviously you won't really have
kazushi that's why I say the center

572
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:26,519
kazushi that's why I say the center
 

573
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,470
kazushi that's why I say the center
seizure is what I do at the beginning is

574
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,480
seizure is what I do at the beginning is
 

575
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,990
seizure is what I do at the beginning is
the seed of kazushi so

576
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,000
the seed of kazushi so
 

577
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,949
the seed of kazushi so
um what happens when you do an external

578
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
um what happens when you do an external
 

579
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,790
um what happens when you do an external
kazushi in real life is the person just

580
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:39,800
kazushi in real life is the person just
 

581
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,230
kazushi in real life is the person just
adjusts to it and now you're just you go

582
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
adjusts to it and now you're just you go
 

583
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,949
adjusts to it and now you're just you go
back and forth and if they're stronger

584
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
back and forth and if they're stronger
 

585
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,670
back and forth and if they're stronger
faster if they have initiative you're

586
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:46,680
faster if they have initiative you're
 

587
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,749
faster if they have initiative you're
never going to get kazushi okay um so

588
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
never going to get kazushi okay um so
 

589
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,189
never going to get kazushi okay um so
the difference is Center seizure at

590
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:54,199
the difference is Center seizure at
 

591
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:58,470
the difference is Center seizure at
contact versus external deviation and

592
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
contact versus external deviation and
 

593
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,150
contact versus external deviation and
then a projection through the center

594
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
then a projection through the center
 

595
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,590
then a projection through the center
okay um while it's not correct and it's

596
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:06,600
okay um while it's not correct and it's
 

597
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,949
okay um while it's not correct and it's
not right I do think it's a stepping

598
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:09,959
not right I do think it's a stepping
 

599
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,829
not right I do think it's a stepping
stone okay because

600
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
stone okay because
 

601
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,110
stone okay because
even here we might see like our brand

602
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
even here we might see like our brand
 

603
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,189
even here we might see like our brand
brand new people okay so our brand new

604
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:20,199
brand new people okay so our brand new
 

605
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,749
brand new people okay so our brand new
people they're going to do the external

606
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
people they're going to do the external
 

607
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,030
people they're going to do the external
deviation

608
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,040
deviation
 

609
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,590
deviation
right but once they do the external

610
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:26,600
right but once they do the external
 

611
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,670
right but once they do the external
deviation they like miss his Center

612
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
deviation they like miss his Center
 

613
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,670
deviation they like miss his Center
you see so even even if I'm in here and

614
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:32,680
you see so even even if I'm in here and
 

615
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,949
you see so even even if I'm in here and
you're like at least you know where the

616
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:35,959
you're like at least you know where the
 

617
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,430
you're like at least you know where the
center is you can feel the center I

618
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:38,440
center is you can feel the center I
 

619
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,629
center is you can feel the center I
think it is a step but like all steps

620
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:41,639
think it is a step but like all steps
 

621
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,790
think it is a step but like all steps
leading to where we want to

622
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
leading to where we want to
 

623
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,629
leading to where we want to
go

624
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:47,639
go
 

625
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,230
go
they're there snakes in the

626
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
they're there snakes in the
 

627
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,870
they're there snakes in the
tree you see they're

628
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
tree you see they're
 

629
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,030
tree you see they're
they're they're there to entice you away

630
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
they're they're there to entice you away
 

631
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,590
they're they're there to entice you away
from where you need to be

632
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
from where you need to be
 

633
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,750
from where you need to be
okay um and you have to not trust them

634
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:04,760
okay um and you have to not trust them
 

635
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,390
okay um and you have to not trust them
uh don't stay there don't don't listen

636
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
uh don't stay there don't don't listen
 

637
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,029
uh don't stay there don't don't listen
to that serpent whisper okay you just

00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:12,039
to that serpent whisper okay you just
 

639
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,870
to that serpent whisper okay you just
keep working on with the pointers that

640
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
keep working on with the pointers that
 

641
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,760
keep working on with the pointers that

serpent is the person who didn't
 

649
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,669
serpent is the person who didn't
listen to what the teacher said

650
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
listen to what the teacher said
 

651
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,750
listen to what the teacher said
okay so always come back to the

652
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,760
okay so always come back to the
 

653
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,549
okay so always come back to the
mechanics and just you're right in

654
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:33,559
mechanics and just you're right in
 

655
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,630
mechanics and just you're right in
pointing out that is something different

656
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:35,640
pointing out that is something different
 

657
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,590
pointing out that is something different
yes it is something different and

658
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600
yes it is something different and
 

659
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,950
yes it is something different and
everyone here should be working to move

660
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:39,960
everyone here should be working to move
 

661
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,990
everyone here should be working to move
past that okay but it it is a step your

662
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,000
past that okay but it it is a step your
 

663
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,590
past that okay but it it is a step your

okay so we like to think as

756
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:33,159
okay so we like to think as

00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:35,750
okay so we like to think as
moderns that in this drill I'm going to

00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
moderns that in this drill I'm going to
 

759
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,070
moderns that in this drill I'm going to
take advantage that he

760
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,080
take advantage that he
 

761
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,870
take advantage that he
has okay and now I'm going to do my

762
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
has okay and now I'm going to do my
 

763
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,070
has okay and now I'm going to do my
technique you can see he's already kind

764
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,080
technique you can see he's already kind
 

765
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,630
technique you can see he's already kind
of going into

766
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:48,640
of going into
 

767
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,430
of going into
that and that's kind of what

768
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440
that and that's kind of what
 

769
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,270
that and that's kind of what
happens that

770
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,280
happens that
 

771
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,430
happens that
we we start to believe that this works

00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
we we start to believe that this works
 

773
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,390
we we start to believe that this works
because myuk

774
00:20:59,390 --> 00:20:59,400
because myuk
 

775
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,350
because myuk
is going to try to figure out what I'm

776
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360
is going to try to figure out what I'm
 

777
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,149
is going to try to figure out what I'm
doing okay but what I like to do is uh

778
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:07,159
doing okay but what I like to do is uh
 

779
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:09,190
doing okay but what I like to do is uh
let's say he does that again so he's

780
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,200
let's say he does that again so he's
 

781
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,029
let's say he does that again so he's
he's moving himself over there CU as I

782
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:12,039
he's moving himself over there CU as I
 

783
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:15,190
he's moving himself over there CU as I
go faster which way did you

784
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
go faster which way did you
 

785
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,110
go faster which way did you
go you see he went to the other side but

786
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,120
go you see he went to the other side but
 

787
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,510
go you see he went to the other side but
somehow he got over there somehow he

788
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:23,520
somehow he got over there somehow he
 

789
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,870
somehow he got over there somehow he
goes over there with that step you see

790
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:26,880
goes over there with that step you see
 

791
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,710
goes over there with that step you see
so that's his agency so what I do in the

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
so that's his agency so what I do in the
 

793

that's what that is my UK counter so I
 

797
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,149
that's what that is my UK counter so I
take him where he doesn't want to go

take him where he doesn't want to go
 

799

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
that's what
 

831
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,590
that's what
turn but he took that step and there's

832
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
turn but he took that step and there's
 

833
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,149
turn but he took that step and there's
no way I could know in Gaza that you're

834
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
no way I could know in Gaza that you're
 

835
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,789
no way I could know in Gaza that you're
going to do that so my point is that the

836
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:43,799
going to do that so my point is that the
 

837
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,789
going to do that so my point is that the
UK is always going to do something

838
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:47,799
UK is always going to do something
 

839
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,310
UK is always going to do something
weird when weird here

840
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,320
weird when weird here
 

841
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,230
weird when weird here
means they just saw agency in it okay

842
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
means they just saw agency in it okay
 

843
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,630
means they just saw agency in it okay
that's just what happened um in all kind

844
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:58,640
that's just what happened um in all kind
 

845
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,630
that's just what happened um in all kind
of ways and then now I can't match it

846
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:03,640
of ways and then now I can't match it
 

847
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,029
of ways and then now I can't match it
the way that I thought I could in other

848
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:07,039
the way that I thought I could in other
 

849
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,510
the way that I thought I could in other
words I thought I that he would

850
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
words I thought I that he would
 

851
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,590
words I thought I that he would
recognize this and I could go here and I

852
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:12,600
recognize this and I could go here and I
 

853
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,110
recognize this and I could go here and I
could go like that can you see but you

854
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,120
could go like that can you see but you
 

855
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,669
could go like that can you see but you
can't because sometimes he's coming in

856
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:19,679
can't because sometimes he's coming in
 

857
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,470
can't because sometimes he's coming in
straight like this sometimes for some

858
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,480
straight like this sometimes for some
 

859
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,149
straight like this sometimes for some
reason he took that step sometimes he's

860
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:25,159
reason he took that step sometimes he's
 

861
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:28,190
reason he took that step sometimes he's
at an angle do you see one hand has this

862
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:28,200
at an angle do you see one hand has this
 

863
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,750
at an angle do you see one hand has this
PR pressure one hand has that pressure

864
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:30,760
PR pressure one hand has that pressure
 

865
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,390
PR pressure one hand has that pressure
and as a result the environment incident

866
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:33,400
and as a result the environment incident
 

867
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,830
and as a result the environment incident
is constantly in flux do do you see it's

868
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:36,840
is constantly in flux do do you see it's
 

869
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,350
is constantly in flux do do you see it's
constantly influx to the degree that sh

870
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,360
constantly influx to the degree that sh
 

871
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,110
constantly influx to the degree that sh
or ten that you were planning is could

872
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
or ten that you were planning is could
 

873
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,149
or ten that you were planning is could
be now out of whack with the environment

874
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:49,159
be now out of whack with the environment
 

875
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,310
be now out of whack with the environment
incident okay so for example you do that

876
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,320
incident okay so for example you do that
 

877
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,510
incident okay so for example you do that
same step and I'm oh what the hell do

878
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
same step and I'm oh what the hell do
 

879
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,190
same step and I'm oh what the hell do
you

880
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,200
you
 

881
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,830
you
see it's not right I'm forcing the

882
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
see it's not right I'm forcing the
 

883
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,710
see it's not right I'm forcing the
technique

884
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:01,720
technique
 

885
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,630
technique
okay this doesn't work it just doesn't

886
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640
okay this doesn't work it just doesn't
 

887
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,590
okay this doesn't work it just doesn't
work but more than that it's not to you

888
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:06,600
work but more than that it's not to you
 

889
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,149
work but more than that it's not to you
wasn't

890
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159
wasn't
 

891
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,669
wasn't
okay what you have to do instead in

892
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:12,679
okay what you have to do instead in
 

893
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:16,230
okay what you have to do instead in
order to be and let's say in harmony

894
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,240
order to be and let's say in harmony
 

895
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,630
order to be and let's say in harmony
with the environment incident is not be

896
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:19,640
with the environment incident is not be
 

897
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,669
with the environment incident is not be
that's the

898
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:20,679
that's the
 

899
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:23,590
that's the
problem when you

900
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
problem when you
 

901
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,389
problem when you
are following

902
00:24:26,389 --> 00:24:26,399
are following
 

903
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:29,190
are following
desires intentions

904
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
desires intentions
 

905
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,990
desires intentions
fears you're going to

906
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,000
fears you're going to
 

907
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,190
fears you're going to
eventually be out of sync with what this

908
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:36,200
eventually be out of sync with what this
 

909
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,909
eventually be out of sync with what this
person is doing under those kind of

910
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:37,919
person is doing under those kind of
 

911
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,909
person is doing under those kind of
training parameters and as a result so

912
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:40,919
training parameters and as a result so
 

913
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,430
training parameters and as a result so
we'll do let's say I go I'm telling

914
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:43,440
we'll do let's say I go I'm telling
 

915
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,870
we'll do let's say I go I'm telling
myself my intention my desire is to do

your arms is not going to work do you

922
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,080
your arms is not going to work do you
 

923
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,510
your arms is not going to work do you
see and but you take that step

924
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
see and but you take that step
 

925
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,909
see and but you take that step
you see and I'm trying to do this

926
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
you see and I'm trying to do this
 

927
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,350
you see and I'm trying to do this
technique now and now I have to do

928
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,360
technique now and now I have to do
 

929
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,029
technique now and now I have to do
something that isn't real and I force it

930
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,039
something that isn't real and I force it
 

931
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,190
something that isn't real and I force it
and technique stopped and the D get

932
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200
and technique stopped and the D get
 

933
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,990
and technique stopped and the D get
stopped and my foot work got all weird

934
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,000
stopped and my foot work got all weird
 

935
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,909
stopped and my foot work got all weird
as a result of that okay what I do

936
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:18,919
as a result of that okay what I do
 

937
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:22,590
as a result of that okay what I do
instead is he push he pushed I have this

938
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:22,600
instead is he push he pushed I have this
 

939
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,269
instead is he push he pushed I have this
weird say there okay I have uh a inward

940
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:27,279
weird say there okay I have uh a inward
 

941
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,149
weird say there okay I have uh a inward
pressure here there's a there's an

942
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:29,159
pressure here there's a there's an
 

943
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,310
pressure here there's a there's an
actual inward pressure there do you see

944
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,320
actual inward pressure there do you see
 

945
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,350
actual inward pressure there do you see
this one not so much it's a little in

946
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:35,360
this one not so much it's a little in
 

947
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,750
this one not so much it's a little in
but not so much so I feel that and I

948
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:38,760
but not so much so I feel that and I
 

949
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,389
but not so much so I feel that and I
don't try to go how do I get from there

950
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:42,399
don't try to go how do I get from there
 

951
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:47,070
don't try to go how do I get from there
to tenin I don't do that the pressure

952
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,080
to tenin I don't do that the pressure
 

953
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,710
to tenin I don't do that the pressure
that I feel there well let me just have

954
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,720
that I feel there well let me just have
 

955
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,190
that I feel there well let me just have
this hand I don't go against it I don't

the tenin Naga over

970
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:18,760
the tenin Naga over
 

971
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,669
the tenin Naga over
here you

972
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:23,679

 

973
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,190

see in other words you have to not have

974
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,200
see in other words you have to not have
 

975
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,830
see in other words you have to not have
a desire not have an intention not have

976
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:29,840
a desire not have an intention not have
 

977
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,149
a desire not have an intention not have
a fear and just be with what he's doing

978
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:33,159
a fear and just be with what he's doing
 

979
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:37,590
a fear and just be with what he's doing
so what is what am I doing he moved the

980
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:37,600
so what is what am I doing he moved the
 

981
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,269
so what is what am I doing he moved the
hand you moved the hand I know for

982
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:41,279
hand you moved the hand I know for
 

983
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,909
hand you moved the hand I know for
example if this hand gets all the way to

984
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:46,919
example if this hand gets all the way to
 

985
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,990
example if this hand gets all the way to
this Y Line it's wrong you see how

986
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,000
this Y Line it's wrong you see how
 

987
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,830
this Y Line it's wrong you see how
smashed I

988
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:51,840
smashed I
 

989
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,990
smashed I
