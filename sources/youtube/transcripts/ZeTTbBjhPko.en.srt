1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,390

all right

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:03,400
all right
 

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,750
all right
so we have one of the disciplines of the

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:07,760
so we have one of the disciplines of the
 

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,270
so we have one of the disciplines of the
four is uh Fitness Physical conditioning

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,280
four is uh Fitness Physical conditioning
 

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,429
four is uh Fitness Physical conditioning
and the metrics you want are strength

8
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:17,439
and the metrics you want are strength
 

9
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:21,990
and the metrics you want are strength
and

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000

 

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,950

Mobility you're not really

12
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
Mobility you're not really
 

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,830
Mobility you're not really
after uh V2 Max you don't you don't want

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
after uh V2 Max you don't you don't want
 

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,189
after uh V2 Max you don't you don't want
to be

16
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
to be
 

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,750
to be
um super strong at the cost Mobility so

18
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:34,760
um super strong at the cost Mobility so
 

19
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,110
um super strong at the cost Mobility so
there's a lot of very strong overweight

20
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
there's a lot of very strong overweight
 

21
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,790
there's a lot of very strong overweight
people but they're not very mobile so

22
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:39,800
people but they're not very mobile so
 

23
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,110
people but they're not very mobile so
that's a no no okay then you have a lot

24
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
that's a no no okay then you have a lot
 

25
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,630
that's a no no okay then you have a lot
of very mobile people they can do

26
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
of very mobile people they can do
 

27
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,630
of very mobile people they can do
chinups all day but uh they can't stand

28
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:51,640
chinups all day but uh they can't stand
 

29
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,510
chinups all day but uh they can't stand
straight up in a strong wind that's not

30
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:54,520
straight up in a strong wind that's not
 

31
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,150
straight up in a strong wind that's not
good either

32
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
good either
 

33
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,189
good either
okay uh you have to be strong and mobile

34
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:00,199
okay uh you have to be strong and mobile
 

35
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,310
okay uh you have to be strong and mobile
so not strong for you it's objective

36
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:03,320
so not strong for you it's objective
 

37
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,390
so not strong for you it's objective
strength okay and what we mean by that

38
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
strength okay and what we mean by that
 

39
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,789
strength okay and what we mean by that
is that you could you could hold your

40
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:09,799
is that you could you could hold your
 

41
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,149
is that you could you could hold your
own pretty much across the human

42
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:13,159
own pretty much across the human
 

43
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,590
own pretty much across the human
Spectrum now of course you're going to

44
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
Spectrum now of course you're going to
 

45
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,950
Spectrum now of course you're going to
get overpowered by somebody so let's

46
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:17,960
get overpowered by somebody so let's
 

47
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,149
get overpowered by somebody so let's
take my size my size uh a 350 lb dude is

48
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
take my size my size uh a 350 lb dude is
 

49
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,030
take my size my size uh a 350 lb dude is
going to overpower me all the time but

50
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
going to overpower me all the time but
 

51
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,030
going to overpower me all the time but
he's not going to be able to do it to

52
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
he's not going to be able to do it to
 

53
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,469
he's not going to be able to do it to
such a degree as if I was uh 140 lbs

54
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
such a degree as if I was uh 140 lbs
 

55
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,389
such a degree as if I was uh 140 lbs
it's not going to work

56
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:37,399
it's not going to work
 

57
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,350
it's not going to work
okay um that strength and conditioning

58
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
okay um that strength and conditioning
 

59
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,190
okay um that strength and conditioning
that

60
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,200
that
 

61
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,230
that
that emphasis on strength and Mobility

62
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,240
that emphasis on strength and Mobility
 

63
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,190
that emphasis on strength and Mobility
is

64
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
is
 

65
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,830
is
not um so that I can now better

66
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
not um so that I can now better
 

67
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,030
not um so that I can now better
contest my

68
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,040
contest my
 

69
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,190
contest my
opponent um if I need to I will and if

70
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,200
opponent um if I need to I will and if
 

71
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,069
opponent um if I need to I will and if
you're in the if you're in the ship

72
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
you're in the if you're in the ship
 

73
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,709
you're in the if you're in the ship
which I mean by

74
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:01,719
which I mean by
 

75
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:04,709
which I mean by
reality uh and your only way out is to

76
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
reality uh and your only way out is to
 

77
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,790
reality uh and your only way out is to
push or to do some crazy uh gymnast like

78
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
push or to do some crazy uh gymnast like
 

79
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,070
push or to do some crazy uh gymnast like
movement to get out or off the line of

80
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,080
movement to get out or off the line of
 

81
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,350
movement to get out or off the line of
attack yes do it but the strength and

82
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:14,360
attack yes do it but the strength and
 

83
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,910
attack yes do it but the strength and
the con and the

84
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:16,920
the con and the
 

85
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,990
the con and the
mobility is really what is going to

86
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,000
mobility is really what is going to
 

87
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,110
mobility is really what is going to
allow you to meet the necessary training

88
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,120
allow you to meet the necessary training
 

89
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,869
allow you to meet the necessary training
requirements okay the person who's not

90
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
requirements okay the person who's not
 

91
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,390
requirements okay the person who's not
weak and is not mobile uh

92
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
weak and is not mobile uh
 

93
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,990
weak and is not mobile uh
and I'll just give one reason why is

94
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,000
and I'll just give one reason why is
 

95
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,110
and I'll just give one reason why is
they just can't train every day they

96
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
they just can't train every day they
 

97
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,790
they just can't train every day they
just can't okay and so they have to have

98
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:37,800
just can't okay and so they have to have
 

99
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,470
just can't okay and so they have to have
days off in between uh they have to

100
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
days off in between uh they have to
 

101
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,670
days off in between uh they have to
recover for injuries and things like

102
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:42,680
recover for injuries and things like
 

103
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,030
recover for injuries and things like
that and so it just takes them uh much

104
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,040
that and so it just takes them uh much
 

105
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,270
that and so it just takes them uh much
longer if one lifetime is enough uh

106
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
longer if one lifetime is enough uh
 

107
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,990
longer if one lifetime is enough uh
there's not enough time they won't meet

108
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,000
there's not enough time they won't meet
 

109
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,869
there's not enough time they won't meet
the training requirements to develop the

110
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
the training requirements to develop the
 

111
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,070
the training requirements to develop the
skills that we want okay and then

112
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:57,080
skills that we want okay and then
 

113
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,750
skills that we want okay and then
secondarily uh to train for both

114
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
secondarily uh to train for both
 

115
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,790
secondarily uh to train for both
strength and Mobility you cannot remain

116
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
strength and Mobility you cannot remain
 

117
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,630
strength and Mobility you cannot remain
who you are and remember there is a

118
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:05,640
who you are and remember there is a
 

119
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,550
who you are and remember there is a
spiritual

120
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:07,560
spiritual
 

121
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,110
spiritual
reasoning um that is the primary reason

122
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,120
reasoning um that is the primary reason
 

123
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,030
reasoning um that is the primary reason
for all the four disciplines is you you

124
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
for all the four disciplines is you you
 

125
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,910
for all the four disciplines is you you
cannot remain attached to self uh and

126
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:17,920
cannot remain attached to self uh and
 

127
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,630
cannot remain attached to self uh and
take yourself from strength from

128
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
take yourself from strength from
 

129
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,190
take yourself from strength from
weakness to strength or from stiffness

130
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
weakness to strength or from stiffness
 

131
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,990
weakness to strength or from stiffness
and sub and and uh uh immobility to

132
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,000
and sub and and uh uh immobility to
 

133
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,990
and sub and and uh uh immobility to
Mobility you're going to have to change

134
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
Mobility you're going to have to change
 

135
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,630
Mobility you're going to have to change
a huge portion of your

136
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
a huge portion of your
 

137
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,830
a huge portion of your
lifestyle and uh you will have to in

138
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
lifestyle and uh you will have to in
 

139
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,190
lifestyle and uh you will have to in
many ways from a subjective point of

140
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,200
many ways from a subjective point of
 

141
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,270
many ways from a subjective point of
view you will have to suffer a death

142
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
view you will have to suffer a death
 

143
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,830
view you will have to suffer a death
okay which is part of all spiritual

144
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
okay which is part of all spiritual
 

145
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,949
okay which is part of all spiritual
Traditions you must die unto

146
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
Traditions you must die unto
 

147
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,470
Traditions you must die unto
yourself when you see people who can't

148
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:49,480
yourself when you see people who can't
 

149
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,670
yourself when you see people who can't
get weak or can't get strong and remain

get weak or can't get strong and remain
 

151
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,429
get weak or can't get strong and remain
weak or you see people who can not

weak or you see people who can not
become mobile and remain stiff you

154
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
become mobile and remain stiff you
 

155
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,589
become mobile and remain stiff you
really are seeing attachment to self

156
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:00,599
really are seeing attachment to self
 

157
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,910
really are seeing attachment to self
they will not let go of that identity

158
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
they will not let go of that identity
 

159
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,309
they will not let go of that identity
and do whatever it takes to meet that

those two goals

162
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
those two goals
 

163
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,190
those two goals
okay so towards this discipline of

164
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,200
okay so towards this discipline of
 

165
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,830
okay so towards this discipline of
gaining strength and Mobility we do

166
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
gaining strength and Mobility we do

and when we say strength we're not

196
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:06,919
and when we say strength we're not
 

197
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,950
and when we say strength we're not
talking about physique okay your your

198

talking about physique okay your your
 

199
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,469
talking about physique okay your your
your your bicep might get strong but you

200

your your bicep might get strong but you
 

201
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,070
your your bicep might get strong but you
are not really or or might show

definition but there is a difference

204
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
definition but there is a difference
 

205
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,350
definition but there is a difference
between definition muscle size and

206
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,360
between definition muscle size and
 

207
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,430
between definition muscle size and
strength okay so you can have some

208
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
strength okay so you can have some
 

209
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,070
strength okay so you can have some
pretty slim people and they can be very

210
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
pretty slim people and they can be very
 

211
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,790
pretty slim people and they can be very
very strong um um and it's just the

212
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:31,800
very strong um um and it's just the
 

213
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,189
very strong um um and it's just the
popular ignorance that

214
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:34,199
popular ignorance that
 

215
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,070
popular ignorance that
confuses muscle size or muscle

216
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,080
confuses muscle size or muscle
 

217
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,909

you will see that the body will start to
 

245
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,189
you will see that the body will start to
adapt for those lifts and in that

246

adapt for those lifts and in that
 

247
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,950
adapt for those lifts and in that
adaptation it loses a lot of its

we do use physical conditioning here not
directly for strength or for Mobility

316
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:12,599
directly for strength or for Mobility
 

317
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,270
directly for strength or for Mobility
but you have to learn how to be

318
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
but you have to learn how to be
 

319

then lastly we use kettle bells okay um
 

329
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,149
then lastly we use kettle bells okay um
kettle bells are not going to get you

330
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:35,159
kettle bells are not going to get you
 

331
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,589
kettle bells are not going to get you
strong because the weight is not strong

332
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:38,599
strong because the weight is not strong
 

333
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,389
strong because the weight is not strong
enough and the path of action is not

334
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
enough and the path of action is not
 

335
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,430
enough and the path of action is not
long enough so if you want to get strong

336
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:46,440
long enough so if you want to get strong
 

337
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,710
long enough so if you want to get strong
you do those Riot lifts uh the kettle

338
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:49,720
you do those Riot lifts uh the kettle
 

339
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,070
you do those Riot lifts uh the kettle
bells are often misunderstood in that

340
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:53,080
bells are often misunderstood in that
 

341
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,509
bells are often misunderstood in that
people think if you lift a heavy Bell

342
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
people think if you lift a heavy Bell
 

343
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,910
people think if you lift a heavy Bell
you're really working out

344
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
you're really working out
 

345
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,630
you're really working out
uh and so you don't need to do back

346
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:01,640
uh and so you don't need to do back
 

347
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,710
uh and so you don't need to do back
squats or deadlifts that's not how the

348
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:03,720
squats or deadlifts that's not how the
 

349
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,630
squats or deadlifts that's not how the
kettle bells work okay what we're doing

350
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
kettle bells work okay what we're doing
 

351
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,230
kettle bells work okay what we're doing
with them is working on almost in a way

352
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,240
with them is working on almost in a way
 

353
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,430
with them is working on almost in a way
on the muscles

354
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
on the muscles
 

355
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,710
on the muscles
required for stabilizing the body to do

356
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:17,720
required for stabilizing the body to do
 

357
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,430
required for stabilizing the body to do
the movement with the Bell so the bell

358
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
the movement with the Bell so the bell
 

359
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,190
the movement with the Bell so the bell
for example on kettle bell swings might

360
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,200
for example on kettle bell swings might
 

361
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,790
for example on kettle bell swings might
look like it's going to work your inner

362
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
look like it's going to work your inner
 

363
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,670
look like it's going to work your inner
and outer deltoid here but we're not

364
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:30,680
and outer deltoid here but we're not
 

365
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,350
and outer deltoid here but we're not
you're not it's going to work uh in

366
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:34,360
you're not it's going to work uh in
 

367
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,670
you're not it's going to work uh in
through this uh qua region and through

368
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:38,680
through this uh qua region and through
 

369
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,269
through this uh qua region and through
your glutes and through your core to

370
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
your glutes and through your core to
 

371
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,470
your glutes and through your core to
hold the spine and the pelvis in a

372
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
hold the spine and the pelvis in a
 

373
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,910
hold the spine and the pelvis in a
particular

374
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
particular
 

375
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,590
particular
relationship so that the Bell

376
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:48,600
relationship so that the Bell
 

377
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,310
relationship so that the Bell
moves in a particular pattern such that

378
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
moves in a particular pattern such that
 

379
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,310
moves in a particular pattern such that
an in experienced person thinks it's a

380
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,320
an in experienced person thinks it's a
 

381
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,870
an in experienced person thinks it's a
deltoid thing okay so again why you do

382
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
deltoid thing okay so again why you do
 

383
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,150
deltoid thing okay so again why you do
the Bells is you're going to have to

384
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,160
the Bells is you're going to have to
 

385
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,509
the Bells is you're going to have to
stabilize your body you're going to have

386
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
stabilize your body you're going to have
 

387
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,750
stabilize your body you're going to have
to organize your posture in a particular

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:06,760
to organize your posture in a particular
 

389
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,230
to organize your posture in a particular
way to move the Bell as

390
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
way to move the Bell as
 

391
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,150
way to move the Bell as
required um and to do this we're going

392
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,160
required um and to do this we're going
 

393
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,630
required um and to do this we're going
to have to Vector the moving

394
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
to have to Vector the moving
 

395
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,269
to have to Vector the moving
Bell onto our midfoot in a dynamic way

396
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
Bell onto our midfoot in a dynamic way
 

397
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,190
Bell onto our midfoot in a dynamic way
and so that is where the you take what

398
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:26,200
and so that is where the you take what
 

399
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,150
and so that is where the you take what
looks like a conditioning exercise and

400
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,160
looks like a conditioning exercise and
 

401
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,389
looks like a conditioning exercise and
you're really

402
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
you're really
 

403
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,350
you're really
strengthening um the tissues related to

404
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:34,360
strengthening um the tissues related to
 

405
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,550
strengthening um the tissues related to
holding

406
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:35,560
holding

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
Organization for midfoot grounding for
 

409
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,430
Organization for midfoot grounding for
for ground vectoring okay um there's

410
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:42,440
for ground vectoring okay um there's
 

411
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,990
for ground vectoring okay um there's
three lifts that we prioritize with the

412
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
three lifts that we prioritize with the
 

413
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,629
three lifts that we prioritize with the
bells or three movements one is the

414
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:48,639
bells or three movements one is the
 

415
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,110
bells or three movements one is the
kettle bell

416
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,120
kettle bell
 

417
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,590
kettle bell
swing um one is the Turkish getup and

418
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:54,600
swing um one is the Turkish getup and
 

419
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,750
swing um one is the Turkish getup and
the other one is the Halo there's tons

420
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
the other one is the Halo there's tons
 

421
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,550
the other one is the Halo there's tons
of kettle bell

422
00:10:59,550 --> 00:10:59,560
of kettle bell
 

423
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,509
of kettle bell
exercises just like there's tons of free

424
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:02,519
exercises just like there's tons of free
 

425
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,949
exercises just like there's tons of free
weight exercises we only do five free

426
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:05,959
weight exercises we only do five free
 

427
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:09,310
weight exercises we only do five free
weight exercises and we predominantly

428
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:09,320
weight exercises and we predominantly
 

429
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,870
weight exercises and we predominantly
land on three kettle bell exercises

430
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:13,880
land on three kettle bell exercises
 

431
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,949
land on three kettle bell exercises
sometimes we mix it up um but really we

432
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:17,959
sometimes we mix it up um but really we
 

433
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,870
sometimes we mix it up um but really we
kind of just do these three okay so

434
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
kind of just do these three okay so
 

435
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,550
kind of just do these three okay so
we'll demonstrate those three and how to

436
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:23,560
we'll demonstrate those three and how to
 

437
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,710
we'll demonstrate those three and how to
do them and I will explain why you're

438
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:25,720
do them and I will explain why you're
 

439
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,670
do them and I will explain why you're
doing them several Bell weights and

440
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
doing them several Bell weights and
 

441
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,389
doing them several Bell weights and
they're weird they are

442
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
they're weird they are
 

443
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,629
they're weird they are
weird um and kettle bells have become

444
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:34,639
weird um and kettle bells have become
 

445
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,110
weird um and kettle bells have become
popular and they there are sets that do

446
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
popular and they there are sets that do
 

447
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,870
popular and they there are sets that do
not follow the original Soviet breakdown

448
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
not follow the original Soviet breakdown
 

449
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,150
not follow the original Soviet breakdown
of the Bells okay I like the Soviet

450
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
of the Bells okay I like the Soviet
 

451
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,870
of the Bells okay I like the Soviet
breakdown of the Bells because again

452
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:48,880
breakdown of the Bells because again
 

453
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,670
breakdown of the Bells because again
they build mental

454
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
they build mental
 

455
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,389
they build mental
toughness um there is a kind

456
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:55,399
toughness um there is a kind
 

457
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:58,629
toughness um there is a kind
of I like to take advantage of the fact

458
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:58,639
of I like to take advantage of the fact
 

459
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,389
of I like to take advantage of the fact
that if you start on a 12 kilogram Bell

460
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:03,399
that if you start on a 12 kilogram Bell
 

461
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,910
that if you start on a 12 kilogram Bell
and you want to go up to the next one so

462
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
and you want to go up to the next one so
 

463
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,069
and you want to go up to the next one so
this one in pounds is 26 lbs if you want

464
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:09,079
this one in pounds is 26 lbs if you want
 

465
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,269
this one in pounds is 26 lbs if you want
to go up to the next one you got to jump

466
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
to go up to the next one you got to jump
 

467
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,110
to go up to the next one you got to jump
all the way to 35 okay there's no

468
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,120
all the way to 35 okay there's no
 

469
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,069
all the way to 35 okay there's no
28 got it and I like that idea so here I

470
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:21,079
28 got it and I like that idea so here I
 

471
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:25,069
28 got it and I like that idea so here I
don't really let the dasy go to Amazon

472
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:25,079
don't really let the dasy go to Amazon
 

473
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,590
don't really let the dasy go to Amazon
and buy you know the American versions

474
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:28,600
and buy you know the American versions
 

475
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,110
and buy you know the American versions
where was like 8 10 12

476
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
where was like 8 10 12
 

477
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,509
where was like 8 10 12
12.5 okay so they have these weird

478
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
12.5 okay so they have these weird
 

479
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,910
12.5 okay so they have these weird
weights um the general rule of thumb is

480
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:42,920
weights um the general rule of thumb is
 

481
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,949
weights um the general rule of thumb is
that women women can start with this one

482
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:47,959
that women women can start with this one
 

483
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:54,750
that women women can start with this one
8 kg or 18 lbs okay and

484
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:54,760
8 kg or 18 lbs okay and
 

485
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,829
8 kg or 18 lbs okay and
men will start with 35 lb

486
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
men will start with 35 lb
 

487
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,430
men will start with 35 lb
that if you if you can't but however you

488
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440

the Turkish Get Up is very technical and
as far as doing what I initially said we

1062
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:43,320
as far as doing what I initially said we
 

1063
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,710
as far as doing what I initially said we
trying to do with the kettle bell the

1064
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:45,720
trying to do with the kettle bell the
 

1065
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,590
trying to do with the kettle bell the
Turkish Get Up is the best exercise okay

1066
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:50,600
Turkish Get Up is the best exercise okay
 

1067
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,269
Turkish Get Up is the best exercise okay

I'm going to use a lighter weight and

1070
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:55,960
I'm going to use a lighter weight and
 

1071
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,990

make sure you guys can all see this this

1072
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,000

 

1073
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,389

okay you do not want to make this a

1074
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:06,399
okay you do not want to make this a
 

1075
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,149
okay you do not want to make this a
shoulder exercise okay um and the

1076
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:11,159
shoulder exercise okay um and the
 

1077
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:15,470
shoulder exercise okay um and the
movement that you're using is the inward

1078
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:15,480
movement that you're using is the inward
 

1079
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,470
movement that you're using is the inward
spiral which takes away the shoulders so

1080
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
spiral which takes away the shoulders so
 

1081
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,389
spiral which takes away the shoulders so
the inward spiral of the eal for example

1082
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:22,399
the inward spiral of the eal for example
 

1083
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,470
the inward spiral of the eal for example
it doesn't involve my

1084
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:24,480
it doesn't involve my
 

1085
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,389
it doesn't involve my
deltoid and I'm going to take that and

1086
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:27,399
deltoid and I'm going to take that and
 

1087
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:28,470
deltoid and I'm going to take that and
it's going to

1088
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:28,480
it's going to
 

1089
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,269
it's going to
be my upward inward spiral okay so like

1090
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:33,279
be my upward inward spiral okay so like
 

1091
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,990
be my upward inward spiral okay so like
for example if I'm doing po hle it's

1092
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,000
for example if I'm doing po hle it's
 

1093
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,430
for example if I'm doing po hle it's
right there that I'm do that uh inward

1094
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,440
right there that I'm do that uh inward
 

1095
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,509
right there that I'm do that uh inward
spiral going upward okay we've other

1096
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:44,519
spiral going upward okay we've other
 

1097
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,590
spiral going upward okay we've other
places we've done it is let's say I do a

1098
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:48,600
places we've done it is let's say I do a
 

1099
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,389
places we've done it is let's say I do a
knee strike to the groin I come up with

1100
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:51,399
knee strike to the groin I come up with
 

1101
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:54,070
knee strike to the groin I come up with
that forearm underneath his chin as the

1102
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,080
that forearm underneath his chin as the
 

1103
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,630
that forearm underneath his chin as the
same movement and don't want to use my

1104
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
same movement and don't want to use my
 

1105
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,470
same movement and don't want to use my
outer til toy or my inner Del toy to do

1106
00:29:59,470 --> 00:29:59,480
outer til toy or my inner Del toy to do
 

1107
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,269
outer til toy or my inner Del toy to do
this so you have to be

1108
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:02,279
this so you have to be
 

1109
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:05,350
this so you have to be
careful that you use more skeletal

1110
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,360
careful that you use more skeletal
 

1111
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,630
careful that you use more skeletal
alignment on the

1112
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:07,640
alignment on the
 

1113
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,430
alignment on the
exercise if on that inward spiral as it

1114
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:11,440
exercise if on that inward spiral as it
 

1115
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,710
exercise if on that inward spiral as it
comes up this is how the the arm is

1116
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:14,720
comes up this is how the the arm is
 

1117
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,789
comes up this is how the the arm is
going to go here's where it's going to
