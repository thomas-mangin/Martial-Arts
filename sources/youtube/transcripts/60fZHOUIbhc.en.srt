1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,869

okay so uh you have to use all your

2
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:02,879
okay so uh you have to use all your
 

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,309
okay so uh you have to use all your
aspects right

4
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
aspects right
 

5
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,110
aspects right
you can't you can't be going there and

6
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,120
you can't you can't be going there and
 

7
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,430
you can't you can't be going there and
then

8
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440
then
 

9
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,669
then
oh crap um so when you're doing cookie

10
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:11,679
oh crap um so when you're doing cookie
 

11
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,310
oh crap um so when you're doing cookie
nugget

12
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
nugget
 

13
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,110
nugget
you can change it a lot a lot of degrees

14
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
you can change it a lot a lot of degrees
 

15
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,150
you can change it a lot a lot of degrees
do you see that

16
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
do you see that
 

17
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,070
do you see that
so depending on let's say let's say he's

18
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,080
so depending on let's say let's say he's
 

19
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,550
so depending on let's say let's say he's
he's behind me right i'm going to move

20
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
he's behind me right i'm going to move
 

21
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,189
he's behind me right i'm going to move
this guy

22
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
this guy
 

23
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,230
this guy
between us by taking more

24
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
between us by taking more
 

25
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,630
between us by taking more
degrees on the rotation right um

26
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
degrees on the rotation right um
 

27
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,590
degrees on the rotation right um
second element you can do so instead of

28
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
second element you can do so instead of
 

29
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,310
second element you can do so instead of
moving

30
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
moving
 

31
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,389
moving
this way you want to try to stack them

32
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
this way you want to try to stack them
 

33
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,310
this way you want to try to stack them
so you're gonna go this this way okay

34
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
so you're gonna go this this way okay
 

35
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,470
so you're gonna go this this way okay
uh the only time you're not going to do

36
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,480
uh the only time you're not going to do
 

37
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,709
uh the only time you're not going to do
that is when you can't do that

38
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719
that is when you can't do that
 

39
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,190
that is when you can't do that
so he's he's going to surround me i

40
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
so he's he's going to surround me i
 

41
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,430
so he's he's going to surround me i
don't want to give my back to that guy

42
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
don't want to give my back to that guy
 

43
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,069
don't want to give my back to that guy
that that's where you're giving me

44
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
that that's where you're giving me
 

45
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,189
that that's where you're giving me
you're up here

46
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
you're up here
 

47
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,069
you're up here
okay and uh

48
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:02,079

 

49
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,429

so watch how i'm going to try to stack

50
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439
so watch how i'm going to try to stack
 

51
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,710
so watch how i'm going to try to stack
them

52
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
them
 

53
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,990
them
um i'm going to use all the degrees of

54
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
um i'm going to use all the degrees of
 

55
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,630
um i'm going to use all the degrees of
the

56
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
the
 

57
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,230
the
cooking on yet and then also you don't

58
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
cooking on yet and then also you don't
 

59
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,070
cooking on yet and then also you don't
have to throw everyone you might not

60
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
have to throw everyone you might not
 

61
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,830
have to throw everyone you might not
have time for the throat

62
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
have time for the throat
 

63
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,830
have time for the throat
okay and then watch how

64
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
okay and then watch how
 

65
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,749
okay and then watch how
you can play with the timing of the

66
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
you can play with the timing of the
 

67
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,510
you can play with the timing of the
throw so for example

68
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
throw so for example
 

69
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,429
throw so for example
if he's if he's way here and he's

70
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
if he's if he's way here and he's
 

71
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,710
if he's if he's way here and he's
way behind him to go

72
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
way behind him to go
 

73
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,429
way behind him to go
and throw him very fast and now he comes

74
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
and throw him very fast and now he comes
 

75
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:35,990
and throw him very fast and now he comes
in

76
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
in
 

77
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,550
in
that this dude's gonna get up and he's

78
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
that this dude's gonna get up and he's
 

79
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,789
that this dude's gonna get up and he's
not you're not in the same place

80
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
not you're not in the same place
 

81
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,710
not you're not in the same place
okay so we'll do the same thing

82
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
okay so we'll do the same thing
 

83
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,550
okay so we'll do the same thing
you can play with the timing of the move

84
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
you can play with the timing of the move
 

85
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,310
you can play with the timing of the move
so the other guy's coming in and i'm

86
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
so the other guy's coming in and i'm
 

87
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,950
so the other guy's coming in and i'm
done here

88
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960

 

89
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,069

so i have the degree of rotation the

90
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
so i have the degree of rotation the
 

91
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,350
so i have the degree of rotation the
timing of the move

92
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
timing of the move
 

93
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,990
timing of the move
which also could be like they're really

94
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
which also could be like they're really
 

95
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,230
which also could be like they're really
close and we come in

96
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
close and we come in
 

97
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:20,830
close and we come in
and it's just quick quick

98
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840

 

99
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:31,270

so

100
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280

 

101
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,830

so play with all those things if it's

102
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
so play with all those things if it's
 

103
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:45,120
so play with all those things if it's
too routine i do use
