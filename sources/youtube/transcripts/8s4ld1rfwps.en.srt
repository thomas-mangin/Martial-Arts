1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,429

okay so the first technique i want to

2
00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:01,439
okay so the first technique i want to
 

3
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:02,710
okay so the first technique i want to
look at is

4
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:02,720
look at is
 

5
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,070
look at is
ikeo

6
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,080
ikeo
 

7
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,309
ikeo
we're looking at this picture here

8
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:06,319
we're looking at this picture here
 

9
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,310
we're looking at this picture here
and

10
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:07,320
and
 

11
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,470
and
a few of my thoughts so i heard some

12
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480
a few of my thoughts so i heard some
 

13
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,749
a few of my thoughts so i heard some
stories of ikkyo working some bjj people

14
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
stories of ikkyo working some bjj people
 

15
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,509
stories of ikkyo working some bjj people
using the elbow to not like really to

16
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:15,519
using the elbow to not like really to
 

17
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,269
using the elbow to not like really to
immobilize people on the ground

18
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:17,279
immobilize people on the ground
 

19
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,830
immobilize people on the ground
but to manipulate the elbow to get into

20
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
but to manipulate the elbow to get into
 

21
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,349
but to manipulate the elbow to get into
a better position

22
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359
a better position
 

23
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,950
a better position
and i guess it kind of makes sense the

24
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
and i guess it kind of makes sense the
 

25
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,630
and i guess it kind of makes sense the
technique but i haven't explored it that

26
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
technique but i haven't explored it that
 

27
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,470
technique but i haven't explored it that
much i haven't encountered functional

28
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
much i haven't encountered functional
 

29
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,750
much i haven't encountered functional
versions of it so my guess is

30
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,760
versions of it so my guess is
 

31
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,509
versions of it so my guess is
i'd say ikkyo

32
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
i'd say ikkyo
 

33
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,670
i'd say ikkyo
i put it somewhere in the middle

34
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
i put it somewhere in the middle
 

35
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,350
i put it somewhere in the middle
thinking that it may have that potential

36
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
thinking that it may have that potential
 

37
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,150
thinking that it may have that potential
to work but i'm not really sure and i

38
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
to work but i'm not really sure and i
 

39
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,670
to work but i'm not really sure and i
think i even heard you once saying

40
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
think i even heard you once saying
 

41
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,510
think i even heard you once saying
something good about ekio so so where

42
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
something good about ekio so so where
 

43
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,670
something good about ekio so so where
would you put that

44
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
would you put that
 

45
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,510
would you put that
one time i said something good about eco

46
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
one time i said something good about eco
 

47
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,430
one time i said something good about eco
yeah no i would actually put it maybe

48
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
yeah no i would actually put it maybe
 

49
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,270
yeah no i would actually put it maybe
even in the super category i'd put it in

50
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
even in the super category i'd put it in
 

51
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,990
even in the super category i'd put it in
the a category um but but not yeah but

52
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000
the a category um but but not yeah but
 

53
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,750
the a category um but but not yeah but
not eco um as a form and so i think it's

54
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
not eco um as a form and so i think it's
 

55
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,590
not eco um as a form and so i think it's
important to distinguish the technique

56
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
important to distinguish the technique
 

57
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,549
important to distinguish the technique
itself from the form so forms are this

58
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559
itself from the form so forms are this
 

59
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,630
itself from the form so forms are this
process i go through like show me cheek

60
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
process i go through like show me cheek
 

61
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,789
process i go through like show me cheek
or something but eq itself is elbow

62
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:04,799
or something but eq itself is elbow
 

63
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,350
or something but eq itself is elbow
control i mean that's the basic idea of

64
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
control i mean that's the basic idea of
 

65
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,230
control i mean that's the basic idea of
ikkyo and i think some people might see

66
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
ikkyo and i think some people might see
 

67
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,149
ikkyo and i think some people might see
it more as like um in japanese you call

68
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
it more as like um in japanese you call
 

69
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,750
it more as like um in japanese you call
it consetsuwaza right it's like joint

70
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
it consetsuwaza right it's like joint
 

71
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,510
it consetsuwaza right it's like joint
techniques or something i don't think of

72
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
techniques or something i don't think of
 

73
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,950
techniques or something i don't think of
it as a joint technique at all i think

74
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:16,960
it as a joint technique at all i think
 

75
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,030
it as a joint technique at all i think
of it as elbow control and the reason i

76
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
of it as elbow control and the reason i
 

77
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,190
of it as elbow control and the reason i
would put it so high is because if

78
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
would put it so high is because if
 

79
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,310
would put it so high is because if
you've ever been in any kind of

80
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
you've ever been in any kind of
 

81
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,429
you've ever been in any kind of
situation especially if you're talking

82
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
situation especially if you're talking
 

83
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,149
situation especially if you're talking
about

84
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
about
 

85
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,710
about
dangerous self-defense arm situations

86
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
dangerous self-defense arm situations
 

87
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,310
dangerous self-defense arm situations
controlling someone's elbow is

88
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
controlling someone's elbow is
 

89
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,469
controlling someone's elbow is
absolutely essential because when

90
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
absolutely essential because when
 

91
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,069
absolutely essential because when
someone's arms flailing around it's

92
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
someone's arms flailing around it's
 

93
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,749
someone's arms flailing around it's
really hard to get their wrists to grab

94
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
really hard to get their wrists to grab
 

95
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,190
really hard to get their wrists to grab
their wrist out of the air super super

96
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
their wrist out of the air super super
 

97
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,069
their wrist out of the air super super
hard to do that um and if you grab at

98
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
hard to do that um and if you grab at
 

99
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,910
hard to do that um and if you grab at
their shoulder it's easy to get a hold

100
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:39,920
their shoulder it's easy to get a hold
 

101
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,190
their shoulder it's easy to get a hold
of their shoulder but their shoulder

102
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
of their shoulder but their shoulder
 

103
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,469
of their shoulder but their shoulder
doesn't really give you any control over

104
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
doesn't really give you any control over
 

105
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,510
doesn't really give you any control over
the arm so elbow control is the nice

106
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
the arm so elbow control is the nice
 

107
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,990
the arm so elbow control is the nice
midsection between the the shoulder and

108
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
midsection between the the shoulder and
 

109
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,990
midsection between the the shoulder and
the wrist and it's usually pretty easy

110
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
the wrist and it's usually pretty easy
 

111
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,910
the wrist and it's usually pretty easy
to get and if i control someone's elbow

112
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
to get and if i control someone's elbow
 

113
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,270
to get and if i control someone's elbow
usually i keep them from stabbing me or

114
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
usually i keep them from stabbing me or
 

115
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,270
usually i keep them from stabbing me or
hitting me or doing anything else so

116
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
hitting me or doing anything else so
 

117
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,270
hitting me or doing anything else so
elbow control i think is super super

118
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280
elbow control i think is super super
 

119
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,670
elbow control i think is super super
important and then eco as it starts to

120
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
important and then eco as it starts to
 

121
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,190
important and then eco as it starts to
become a form shows a way that we can

122
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
become a form shows a way that we can
 

123
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,030
become a form shows a way that we can
turn that elbow control into an

124
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,040
turn that elbow control into an
 

125
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,630
turn that elbow control into an
unbalancing technique that we could use

126
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
unbalancing technique that we could use
 

127
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,149
unbalancing technique that we could use
as a takedown or we could use it as a

128
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
as a takedown or we could use it as a
 

129
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,270
as a takedown or we could use it as a
projection

130
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
projection
 

131
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,869
projection
and then we could hold someone on the

132
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
and then we could hold someone on the
 

133
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,110
and then we could hold someone on the
ground with it and i've made uh videos

134
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
ground with it and i've made uh videos
 

135
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,710
ground with it and i've made uh videos
talking about the eco pin and there are

136
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
talking about the eco pin and there are
 

137
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,390
talking about the eco pin and there are
definitely a lot of weaknesses to the

138
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
definitely a lot of weaknesses to the
 

139
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,110
definitely a lot of weaknesses to the
eco pin um it's not super secure i would

140
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
eco pin um it's not super secure i would
 

141
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,910
eco pin um it's not super secure i would
take top mount over ikkyo pin any day in

142
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
take top mount over ikkyo pin any day in
 

143
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,830
take top mount over ikkyo pin any day in
a security situation but in a situation

144
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
a security situation but in a situation
 

145
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,030
a security situation but in a situation
where i didn't know if the other guy was

146
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
where i didn't know if the other guy was
 

147
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,790
where i didn't know if the other guy was
armed or not i would rather have ethio

148
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
armed or not i would rather have ethio
 

149
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,150
armed or not i would rather have ethio
because i could bail out of there

150
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
because i could bail out of there
 

151
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,670
because i could bail out of there
quicker than i can something like top

152
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
quicker than i can something like top
 

153
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,470
quicker than i can something like top
mount so so i think echo is highly

154
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
mount so so i think echo is highly
 

155
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,550
mount so so i think echo is highly
functional but in a gross sense and not

156
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
functional but in a gross sense and not
 

157
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,309
functional but in a gross sense and not
in a specific like here's how you take

158
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
in a specific like here's how you take
 

159
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,750
in a specific like here's how you take
them down and hold them to the ground i

160
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
them down and hold them to the ground i
 

161
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,270
them down and hold them to the ground i
don't think it's that functional in that

162
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
don't think it's that functional in that
 

163
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,430
don't think it's that functional in that
sense all right hey that that's awesome

164
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
sense all right hey that that's awesome
 

165
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,589
sense all right hey that that's awesome
and i had doubts if we'll get to any

166
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
and i had doubts if we'll get to any
 

167
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,509
and i had doubts if we'll get to any
super techniques

168
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
super techniques
 

169
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,710
super techniques
so that's

170
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
so that's
 

171
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,470
so that's
good i mean i use it constantly so like

172
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
good i mean i use it constantly so like
 

173
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,949
good i mean i use it constantly so like
when we do raw dory and stuff i use eco

174
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
when we do raw dory and stuff i use eco
 

175
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,309
when we do raw dory and stuff i use eco
non-stop nice and i i do think i saw

176
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
non-stop nice and i i do think i saw
 

177
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,229
non-stop nice and i i do think i saw
like you posted those great videos of

178
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
like you posted those great videos of
 

179
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,350
like you posted those great videos of
you

180
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
you
 

181
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,150
you
uh

182
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
uh
 

183
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,949
uh
working in your garage or or some other

184
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
working in your garage or or some other
 

185
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,309
working in your garage or or some other
area with your

186
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
area with your
 

187
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,149
area with your
with your students and people like still

188
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
with your students and people like still
 

189
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,830
with your students and people like still
exploring at your early days i think i

190
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
exploring at your early days i think i
 

191
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,750
exploring at your early days i think i
saw you maybe that's where i picked up

192
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
saw you maybe that's where i picked up
 

193
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,670
saw you maybe that's where i picked up
that you were using sometimes echo

194
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
that you were using sometimes echo
 

195
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,190
that you were using sometimes echo
naturally would come up

196
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
naturally would come up
 

197
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,990
naturally would come up
and and you'd say said that it's a

198
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
and and you'd say said that it's a
 

199
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,550
and and you'd say said that it's a
decent technique do you think i'm

200
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
decent technique do you think i'm
 

201
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,149
decent technique do you think i'm
remembering that right

202
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
remembering that right
 

203
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,589
remembering that right
no you're remembering right yeah yeah

204
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
no you're remembering right yeah yeah
 

205
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,670
no you're remembering right yeah yeah
i've got some live footage of it coming

206
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
i've got some live footage of it coming
 

207
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,390
i've got some live footage of it coming
off in live situations um and it does um

208
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
off in live situations um and it does um
 

209
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,630
off in live situations um and it does um
but to see it completely like a form is

210
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
but to see it completely like a form is
 

211
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,949
but to see it completely like a form is
kind of rare um and i think that's a lot

212
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
kind of rare um and i think that's a lot
 

213
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,229
kind of rare um and i think that's a lot
of the problems with the ikea techniques

214
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
of the problems with the ikea techniques
 

215
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,070
of the problems with the ikea techniques
is it's hard to not confuse them with

216
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
is it's hard to not confuse them with
 

217
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,149
is it's hard to not confuse them with
the form and it forms one really

218
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
the form and it forms one really
 

219
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,710
the form and it forms one really
specific situation you know so um the

220
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
specific situation you know so um the
 

221
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,869
specific situation you know so um the
technique of eq which is elbow control

222
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
technique of eq which is elbow control
 

223
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,550
technique of eq which is elbow control
super functional you need it like in a

224
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
super functional you need it like in a
 

225
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,869
super functional you need it like in a
self-defense situation it's you can't

226
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
self-defense situation it's you can't
 

227
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,869
self-defense situation it's you can't
live without it in lots of ways because

228
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
live without it in lots of ways because
 

229
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,869
live without it in lots of ways because
people's arms are just too dangerous

230
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
people's arms are just too dangerous
 

231
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,789
people's arms are just too dangerous

that's great if someone's just going to
 

237
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,949
that's great if someone's just going to
hit me but if someone's coming in with a

238

hit me but if someone's coming in with a
 

239
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,710
hit me but if someone's coming in with a
knife i can't really hide cover the

240
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
knife i can't really hide cover the
 

241
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,990
knife i can't really hide cover the
knife goes right through there and gets

242
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
knife goes right through there and gets
 

243
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,070
knife goes right through there and gets
me anyways you know so um something that

244
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
me anyways you know so um something that
 

245
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,309
me anyways you know so um something that
gives me elbow control is real essential

246
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
gives me elbow control is real essential
 

247
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,990
gives me elbow control is real essential
awesome now i'm even more looking

248
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
awesome now i'm even more looking

nikkio

258
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
nikkio
 

259
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,270
nikkio
and my first thoughts

260
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
and my first thoughts
 

261
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,670
and my first thoughts
uh i know a bunch of people in brazilian

262
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
uh i know a bunch of people in brazilian
 

263
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,110
uh i know a bunch of people in brazilian
jiu-jitsu

264
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120

pulling off nikki or or certain like uh

266
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
pulling off nikki or or certain like uh
 

267
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,189
pulling off nikki or or certain like uh
nico-esque type of technique i still

268
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
nico-esque type of technique i still
 

269
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,430
nico-esque type of technique i still
haven't got to that point although it's

270
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
haven't got to that point although it's
 

271
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,870
haven't got to that point although it's
high on my list

272
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
high on my list
 

273
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,070
high on my list
but

274
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
but
 

275
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,310
but
just that wrist manipulation i think

276
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
just that wrist manipulation i think
 

277
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,749
just that wrist manipulation i think
especially like not if not necessarily

278
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
especially like not if not necessarily
 

279
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,189
especially like not if not necessarily
if somebody's grabbing

280
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
if somebody's grabbing
 

281
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,270
if somebody's grabbing
because i i would for a moment i would

282
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
because i i would for a moment i would
 

283
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,189
because i i would for a moment i would
doubt okay if i would really secure the

284
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
doubt okay if i would really secure the
 

285
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,710
doubt okay if i would really secure the
hand strong enough so they wouldn't pull

286
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
hand strong enough so they wouldn't pull
 

287
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,390
hand strong enough so they wouldn't pull
out but there's that you know locked

288
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
out but there's that you know locked
 

289
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,230
out but there's that you know locked
version where you can kind of get that

290
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
version where you can kind of get that
 

291
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,270
version where you can kind of get that
person

292
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
person
 

293
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,270
person
still i have those questions how would i

294
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
still i have those questions how would i
 

295
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,870
still i have those questions how would i
get to that point

296
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
get to that point
 

297
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,749
get to that point
uh

298
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
uh
 

299
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,830
uh
is that does it really come up often

300
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
is that does it really come up often
 

301
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,590
is that does it really come up often
that that place like in jiu jitsu i

302
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
that that place like in jiu jitsu i
 

303
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,950
that that place like in jiu jitsu i
guess it makes sense because we're

304
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
guess it makes sense because we're
 

305
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,790
guess it makes sense because we're
grabbing so much each other we're using

306
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
grabbing so much each other we're using
 

307
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,550
grabbing so much each other we're using
the ghee and

308
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
the ghee and
 

309
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,510
the ghee and
doing g-game it's so

310
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
doing g-game it's so
 

311
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,629
doing g-game it's so
grip reliant that the nikki can come up

312
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
grip reliant that the nikki can come up
 

313
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,110
grip reliant that the nikki can come up
other than that i have some questions

314
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
other than that i have some questions
 

315
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,110
other than that i have some questions
but i think i definitely imagine that

316
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
but i think i definitely imagine that
 

317
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,710
but i think i definitely imagine that
nikkio is

318
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
nikkio is
 

319
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,870
nikkio is
potentially good technique

320
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
potentially good technique
 

321
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,830
potentially good technique
i guess i'd be between b and c but let's

322
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
i guess i'd be between b and c but let's
 

323
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,270
i guess i'd be between b and c but let's
say b

324
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
say b
 

325
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,990
say b
what about you

326
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000

 

327
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,230

um i'd probably it really depends on how

328
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
um i'd probably it really depends on how
 

329
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,870
um i'd probably it really depends on how
you're using it so um you know if you're

330
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
you're using it so um you know if you're
 

331
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,390
you're using it so um you know if you're
talking about the kiawaza so ikkyo

332
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
talking about the kiawaza so ikkyo
 

333
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,990
talking about the kiawaza so ikkyo
through rokyo nico is definitely in

334
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
through rokyo nico is definitely in
 

335
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,990
through rokyo nico is definitely in
there um

336
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
there um
 

337
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,830
there um
those are principles and they can do a

338
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
those are principles and they can do a
 

339
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,510
those are principles and they can do a
bunch of stuff so if you're talking

340
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
bunch of stuff so if you're talking
 

341
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,749
bunch of stuff so if you're talking
about nico as a controlling technique

342
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
about nico as a controlling technique
 

343
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,590
about nico as a controlling technique
like i want to take someone down with it

344
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
like i want to take someone down with it
 

345
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,749
like i want to take someone down with it
or i want to hold someone still with it

346
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
or i want to hold someone still with it
 

347
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,189
or i want to hold someone still with it
it's okay i would maybe put it at a a d

348
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
it's okay i would maybe put it at a a d
 

349
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,350
it's okay i would maybe put it at a a d
um or an e you know like if that's where

350
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
um or an e you know like if that's where
 

351
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,469
um or an e you know like if that's where
you're looking at it now if you're

352
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
you're looking at it now if you're
 

353
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,749
you're looking at it now if you're
looking at it as a clearing technique

354
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
looking at it as a clearing technique
 

355
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,710
looking at it as a clearing technique
how to get someone's uh arm off of me i

356
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
how to get someone's uh arm off of me i
 

357
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,310
how to get someone's uh arm off of me i
would say it's pretty high right so

358
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
would say it's pretty high right so
 

359
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,029
would say it's pretty high right so
maybe a b or an a right so like nico can

360
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
maybe a b or an a right so like nico can
 

361
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,790
maybe a b or an a right so like nico can
really reach someone's arm off you if

362
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
really reach someone's arm off you if
 

363
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,230
really reach someone's arm off you if
they've got a good control on the side

364
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
they've got a good control on the side
 

365
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,230
they've got a good control on the side
now that's not you know taking them down

366
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
now that's not you know taking them down
 

367
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,070
now that's not you know taking them down
with it or making them cry uncle or tap

368
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
with it or making them cry uncle or tap
 

369
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,550
with it or making them cry uncle or tap
or anything like that it's just clearing

370
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
or anything like that it's just clearing
 

371
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,070
or anything like that it's just clearing
if we're talking about disarming i would

372
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
if we're talking about disarming i would
 

373
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,230
if we're talking about disarming i would
put it in the a or s category because

374
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
put it in the a or s category because
 

375
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,430
put it in the a or s category because
it's a super disarming technique so nico

376
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
it's a super disarming technique so nico
 

377
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,629
it's a super disarming technique so nico
and korigaisch to me and we'll probably

378
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
and korigaisch to me and we'll probably
 

379
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,469
and korigaisch to me and we'll probably
get to coda geisha in a minute are our

380
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
get to coda geisha in a minute are our
 

381
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,150
get to coda geisha in a minute are our
essential disarming techniques so if

382
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
essential disarming techniques so if
 

383
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,950
essential disarming techniques so if
you're going to take something out of

384
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
you're going to take something out of
 

385
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,870
you're going to take something out of
someone's hand you have to know those

386
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
someone's hand you have to know those
 

387
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,029
someone's hand you have to know those
two and so it really depends on how

388
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
two and so it really depends on how
 

389
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,950
two and so it really depends on how
you're looking at it and nico's hard so

390
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
you're looking at it and nico's hard so
 

391
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,710
you're looking at it and nico's hard so
it's always ikyo and a lot of other uh

392
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
it's always ikyo and a lot of other uh
 

393
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,230
it's always ikyo and a lot of other uh
in the kyowasa because they're

394
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
in the kyowasa because they're
 

395
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,469
in the kyowasa because they're
principles and so it's not like you know

396
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
principles and so it's not like you know
 

397
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,390
principles and so it's not like you know
if you're talking about like an armbar

398
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
if you're talking about like an armbar
 

399
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,629
if you're talking about like an armbar
and brazilian jiu jitsu like um you know

400
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
and brazilian jiu jitsu like um you know
 

401
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,590
and brazilian jiu jitsu like um you know
juju garuma like so the uh regular

402
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
juju garuma like so the uh regular
 

403
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,189
juju garuma like so the uh regular
armbar where you'd have their their arm

404
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
armbar where you'd have their their arm
 

405
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,670
armbar where you'd have their their arm
between your legs you know

406
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
between your legs you know
 

407
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,510
between your legs you know
so that's a functional technique but

408
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
so that's a functional technique but
 

409
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,830
so that's a functional technique but
locking someone's elbow out is a

410
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
locking someone's elbow out is a
 

411
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,990
locking someone's elbow out is a
principle and it's bigger right and so

412
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
principle and it's bigger right and so
 

413
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,430
principle and it's bigger right and so
you know you could say like well you

414
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
you know you could say like well you
 

415
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,029
you know you could say like well you
know what about the technique of locking

416
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
know what about the technique of locking
 

417
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,110
know what about the technique of locking
someone's uh elbow on my shoulder like

418
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
someone's uh elbow on my shoulder like
 

419
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,270
someone's uh elbow on my shoulder like
how useful is that well that itself is

420
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
how useful is that well that itself is
 

421
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,790
how useful is that well that itself is
not that useful but the principle of

422
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
not that useful but the principle of
 

423
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,350
not that useful but the principle of
locking an elbow is really useful right

424
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
locking an elbow is really useful right
 

425
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,950
locking an elbow is really useful right
and so that's the way i look at nico

426
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
and so that's the way i look at nico
 

427
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,550
and so that's the way i look at nico
because what nico does is it folds the

428
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
because what nico does is it folds the
 

429
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,469
because what nico does is it folds the
wrist down and it takes the wrist to the

430
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
wrist down and it takes the wrist to the
 

431
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,390
wrist down and it takes the wrist to the
side and so when it does that your grip

432
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
side and so when it does that your grip
 

433
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,070
side and so when it does that your grip
just gets so weak that it's hard to hold

434
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
just gets so weak that it's hard to hold
 

435
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,189
just gets so weak that it's hard to hold
on and so i bet you use nico all the

436
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
on and so i bet you use nico all the
 

437
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,950
on and so i bet you use nico all the
time when you're rolling it's just

438
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
time when you're rolling it's just
 

439
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,629
time when you're rolling it's just
you're not thinking of it because it's

440
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
you're not thinking of it because it's
 

441
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,710
you're not thinking of it because it's
not you know you're not making someone

442
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
not you know you're not making someone
 

443
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,390
not you know you're not making someone
tap with it you're just using it to get

444
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
tap with it you're just using it to get
 

445
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,550
tap with it you're just using it to get
someone's arm off of you and i bet a lot

446
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
someone's arm off of you and i bet a lot
 

447
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,150
someone's arm off of you and i bet a lot
of people use nikki all the time because

448
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
of people use nikki all the time because
 

449
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,830
of people use nikki all the time because
it when the hand gets put in that

450
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
it when the hand gets put in that
 

451
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,830
it when the hand gets put in that
position it's just so natural to happen

452
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
position it's just so natural to happen
 

453
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,189
position it's just so natural to happen
so nico as a principal is indispensable

454
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
so nico as a principal is indispensable
 

455
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,029
so nico as a principal is indispensable
but you know as a hold or like how we

456
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
but you know as a hold or like how we
 

457
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,790
but you know as a hold or like how we
see it a lot in the forums is is not

458
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
see it a lot in the forums is is not
 

459
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,390
see it a lot in the forums is is not
very useful you know it's pretty pretty

460
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
very useful you know it's pretty pretty
 

461
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,510
very useful you know it's pretty pretty
low i mean especially if you're

462
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
low i mean especially if you're
 

463
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,189
low i mean especially if you're
considering something like uh you know

464
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
considering something like uh you know
 

465
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,990
considering something like uh you know
like uh an american lock or a kimura or

466
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
like uh an american lock or a kimura or
 

467
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,350
like uh an american lock or a kimura or
something like those are so much more

468
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
something like those are so much more
 

469
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,749
something like those are so much more
useful as far as holding someone still

470
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
useful as far as holding someone still
 

471
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,150
useful as far as holding someone still
or jam damaging the joint nico's not as

472
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
or jam damaging the joint nico's not as
 

473
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,790
or jam damaging the joint nico's not as
good as those at that right so sorry

474
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
good as those at that right so sorry
 

475
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,710
good as those at that right so sorry
that wasn't a clear no no no we can

476
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
that wasn't a clear no no no we can
 

477
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,469
that wasn't a clear no no no we can
still clarify i really like how you're

478

distinguishing you know it's it's

480
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
distinguishing you know it's it's
 

481
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,670
distinguishing you know it's it's
a or b for this element it's your d for

482
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
a or b for this element it's your d for
 

483
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,749
a or b for this element it's your d for
that element so i guess to kind of find

484
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
that element so i guess to kind of find
 

485
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,430
that element so i guess to kind of find
the middle if we'd

486
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
the middle if we'd
 

487
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,589
the middle if we'd
qualify the technique for specifically

488
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
qualify the technique for specifically
 

489
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,110
qualify the technique for specifically
how useful

490
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
how useful
 

491
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,629
how useful
it could be

492
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
it could be
 

493
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,350
it could be
if we made it and kind of finding the at

494
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
if we made it and kind of finding the at
 

495
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,629
if we made it and kind of finding the at
the average usefulness of its potential

496
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
the average usefulness of its potential
 

497
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,110
the average usefulness of its potential
uh let's say what would be

498
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
uh let's say what would be
 

499
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,710
uh let's say what would be
the the middle

500
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
the the middle
 

501
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,869
the the middle
score that you choose for it

502
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
score that you choose for it
 

503
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,790
score that you choose for it
yeah i mean i think where you put it at

504
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
yeah i mean i think where you put it at
 

505
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,510
yeah i mean i think where you put it at
b is fine because um it to me it's

506
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
b is fine because um it to me it's
 

507
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,869
b is fine because um it to me it's
really low

508
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
really low
 

509
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,909
really low
for um a hold or a submission like

510
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
for um a hold or a submission like
 

511
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,150
for um a hold or a submission like
pretty low for that but very very high

512
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
pretty low for that but very very high
 

513
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,469
pretty low for that but very very high
for a clear or a disarm and so you know

514
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
for a clear or a disarm and so you know
 

515
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,309
for a clear or a disarm and so you know
averaging out it's probably in the b ish

516
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
averaging out it's probably in the b ish
 

517
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,230
averaging out it's probably in the b ish
category i would say got it

518
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
category i would say got it
 

519
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,990
category i would say got it
cool it's awesome

520
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
cool it's awesome
 

521
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,149
cool it's awesome
okay so next one we're looking at senkyo

522
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
okay so next one we're looking at senkyo
 

523
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,029
okay so next one we're looking at senkyo
uh

524
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
uh
 

525
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,909
uh
i know sankyo works as a back escape you

526
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
i know sankyo works as a back escape you
 

527
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,709
i know sankyo works as a back escape you
say my computer sorry oh did i first

528
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
say my computer sorry oh did i first
 

529
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,350
say my computer sorry oh did i first

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
i'll just repeat what i said like
 

531

okay so yeah thank you
i know it works as a back escape like

534
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
i know it works as a back escape like
 

535
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,790
i know it works as a back escape like
you know if somebody has you like in a

536
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
you know if somebody has you like in a
 

537
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,550
you know if somebody has you like in a
lock and you grab the arm and you start

538
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
lock and you grab the arm and you start
 

539
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,630
lock and you grab the arm and you start
twisting and they freak out and you

540
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
twisting and they freak out and you
 

541
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,470
twisting and they freak out and you
squeeze yourself out i tried that that

542
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
squeeze yourself out i tried that that
 

543
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,150
squeeze yourself out i tried that that
was great but that's a very specific

544
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
was great but that's a very specific
 

545
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,269
was great but that's a very specific
situation

546
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
situation
 

547
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,070
situation
uh i did lift up a couple of people by

548
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
uh i did lift up a couple of people by
 

549
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,670
uh i did lift up a couple of people by
by thank you i did catch a couple of

550
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
by thank you i did catch a couple of
 

551
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,150
by thank you i did catch a couple of
people even in standing i mean the the

552
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
people even in standing i mean the the
 

553
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,470
people even in standing i mean the the
part where i go under the

554
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
part where i go under the
 

555
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,829
part where i go under the
armpit that kind of is questionable

556
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
armpit that kind of is questionable
 

557
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,070
armpit that kind of is questionable
uh but

558
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
uh but
 

559
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,750
uh but
again this is for me it's still just

560
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
again this is for me it's still just
 

561
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,750
again this is for me it's still just
exploration but i can definitely see

562
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
exploration but i can definitely see
 

563
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,750
exploration but i can definitely see
like how the wrist can be twisted and

564
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
like how the wrist can be twisted and
 

565
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,269
like how the wrist can be twisted and
especially if the elbow's really locked

566
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
especially if the elbow's really locked
 

567
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,350
especially if the elbow's really locked
up high and you're able to get to that

568
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
up high and you're able to get to that
 

569
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,710
up high and you're able to get to that
position i think there's potential in

570
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
position i think there's potential in
 

571
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,829
position i think there's potential in
senko

572
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
senko
 

573
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,430
senko
i'm also maybe affected by your

574
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
i'm also maybe affected by your
 

575
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,350
i'm also maybe affected by your
positivity i didn't expect the

576
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
positivity i didn't expect the
 

577
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,350
positivity i didn't expect the
techniques to score so high

578
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,360
techniques to score so high
 

579
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,110
techniques to score so high
so i'm kind of naturally wanting to go

580
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,120
so i'm kind of naturally wanting to go
 

581
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,310
so i'm kind of naturally wanting to go
to

582
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
to
 

583
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,190
to
a b a but let's say

584
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
a b a but let's say
 

585
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,389
a b a but let's say
i put it on a w what about you

586
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
i put it on a w what about you
 

587
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,829
i put it on a w what about you
it's interesting to

588
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
it's interesting to
 

589
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,470
it's interesting to
watch kind of how you're um

590
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
watch kind of how you're um
 

591
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,070
watch kind of how you're um
you're assessing them because i think

592
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
you're assessing them because i think
 

593
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,630
you're assessing them because i think
you're assessing them um really from a

594
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
you're assessing them um really from a
 

595
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,509
you're assessing them um really from a
um a domination standpoint and and

596
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
um a domination standpoint and and
 

597
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,790
um a domination standpoint and and
that's the way a lot of people look at

598
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
that's the way a lot of people look at
 

599
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,310
that's the way a lot of people look at
martial arts is that you know martial

600
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
martial arts is that you know martial
 

601
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,070
martial arts is that you know martial
arts are about dominating and i tend to

602
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
arts are about dominating and i tend to
 

603
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,750
arts are about dominating and i tend to
look at martial arts that i'm interested

604
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
look at martial arts that i'm interested
 

605
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,670
look at martial arts that i'm interested
in as about survival right so i just

606
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
in as about survival right so i just
 

607
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,110
in as about survival right so i just
want to get the hell out of there most

608
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
want to get the hell out of there most
 

609
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,790
want to get the hell out of there most
of the time i don't want to sit and

610
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
of the time i don't want to sit and
 

611
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,310
of the time i don't want to sit and
prove who's the best i'm not interested

612
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
prove who's the best i'm not interested
 

613
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,389
prove who's the best i'm not interested
in that anymore you know um and so like

614
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
in that anymore you know um and so like
 

615
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,190
in that anymore you know um and so like
i see how to you um sankyo seems better

616
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
i see how to you um sankyo seems better
 

617
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,110
i see how to you um sankyo seems better
than nikyo because i think it is a

618
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
than nikyo because i think it is a
 

619
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,110
than nikyo because i think it is a
little bit better for controls and holds

620
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
little bit better for controls and holds
 

621
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,470
little bit better for controls and holds
and submissions it's a little more

622
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
and submissions it's a little more
 

623
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,630
and submissions it's a little more
useful than nico in that category but

624
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
useful than nico in that category but
 

625
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,990
useful than nico in that category but
it's also less useful to me

626
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
it's also less useful to me
 

627
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,710
it's also less useful to me
in in clearing and uh disarming

628
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
in in clearing and uh disarming
 

629
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,949
in in clearing and uh disarming
techniques now it is a decent disarming

630
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
techniques now it is a decent disarming
 

631
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,470
techniques now it is a decent disarming
technique and it is a decent clearing

632
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
technique and it is a decent clearing
 

633
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,750
technique and it is a decent clearing
technique but it's not nearly as

634
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
technique but it's not nearly as
 

635
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,750
technique but it's not nearly as
functional as nico is for that and so to

636
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
functional as nico is for that and so to
 

637
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,910
functional as nico is for that and so to
me it's a little lower than nico i think

638
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
me it's a little lower than nico i think
 

639
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,829
me it's a little lower than nico i think
nico's a little better you know so i

640
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
nico's a little better you know so i
 

641
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,990
nico's a little better you know so i
think really the kilwaza which are one

642
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
think really the kilwaza which are one
 

643
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,430
think really the kilwaza which are one
through six or depending on the aikido

644
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
through six or depending on the aikido
 

645
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,710
through six or depending on the aikido
style maybe one through five or one

646
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
style maybe one through five or one
 

647
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,829
style maybe one through five or one
through seven but um

648
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
through seven but um
 

649
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,990
through seven but um
uh they really do kind of go in a level

650
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
uh they really do kind of go in a level
 

651
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,150
uh they really do kind of go in a level
of importance in a lot of ways and so to

652
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
of importance in a lot of ways and so to
 

653
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,630
of importance in a lot of ways and so to
me i would put sankyo underneath nikyo

654
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640
me i would put sankyo underneath nikyo
 

655
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,069
me i would put sankyo underneath nikyo
but if we're averaging out like you're

656
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
but if we're averaging out like you're
 

657
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,590
but if we're averaging out like you're
talking about i would say let's go for a

658
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
talking about i would say let's go for a
 

659
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,750
talking about i would say let's go for a
b because to me it is a better

660
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
b because to me it is a better
 

661
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,750
b because to me it is a better
controlling technique and a better

662
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
controlling technique and a better
 

663
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,910
controlling technique and a better
submission technique just not as good at

664
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
submission technique just not as good at
 

665
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,750
submission technique just not as good at
clearing and disarming right so if we're

666
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
clearing and disarming right so if we're
 

667
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,269
clearing and disarming right so if we're
averaging them out i'd probably stick it

668
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:05,279
averaging them out i'd probably stick it
 

669
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,670
averaging them out i'd probably stick it
around b um yeah b or c somewhere in

670
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
around b um yeah b or c somewhere in
 

671
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,630
around b um yeah b or c somewhere in
there all right uh again i really

672
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
there all right uh again i really
 

673
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,550
there all right uh again i really
i'm really enjoying the your thought

674
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
i'm really enjoying the your thought
 

675
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,230
i'm really enjoying the your thought
process and it's a great insight that is

676
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
process and it's a great insight that is
 

677
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,389
process and it's a great insight that is
that you just noticed

678
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:16,399
that you just noticed
 

679
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,630
that you just noticed
i guess i am in that stage i'm

680
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
i guess i am in that stage i'm

interested in self defense and i always
think about self defense uh

684
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
think about self defense uh
 

685
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,710
think about self defense uh
but

686
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720

693
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,670
classes per week some jiu-jitsu and and
i realized that this it's not

694
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
i realized that this it's not
 

695
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,389
i realized that this it's not
self-defense but at the same time just

696
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
self-defense but at the same time just
 

697
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,910
self-defense but at the same time just
that's that's what i do these days you

698
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
that's that's what i do these days you
 

699
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,509
that's that's what i do these days you

nothing wrong with that right and i
 

703
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,710
nothing wrong with that right and i
think maybe that's one of the reasons

704
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
think maybe that's one of the reasons
 

705
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,350
think maybe that's one of the reasons
why my focus is more like okay how does

706
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360

that's kind of
 

885
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,870
that's kind of
dangerous in regards to the aftermath

886
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
dangerous in regards to the aftermath

those are the thoughts which are going
 

909
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,189
those are the thoughts which are going
for my mind but in terms of making it

910
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
for my mind but in terms of making it
 

911
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,389
for my mind but in terms of making it
functional

912
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:16,399
functional
 

913
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,710
functional
just kind of working it making it work

914
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
just kind of working it making it work
 

915
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,790
just kind of working it making it work
in in various conditions

916
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
in in various conditions
 

917
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,389
in in various conditions
i think it has a pretty decent

918
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
i think it has a pretty decent
 

919
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,629
i think it has a pretty decent
shot but again as i said the entry is

920
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
shot but again as i said the entry is
 

921
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,230
shot but again as i said the entry is
puzzling still for me

922
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240
puzzling still for me
 

923
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,949
puzzling still for me
but i guess let's say i'd say a b but

924
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
but i guess let's say i'd say a b but
 

925
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,230
but i guess let's say i'd say a b but
let's say a

926
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
let's say a
 

927
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,509
let's say a
let's be positive

928
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
let's be positive
 

929
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,670
let's be positive
okay so again it depends on kind of what

930
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
okay so again it depends on kind of what
 

931
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,590
okay so again it depends on kind of what

966
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
pulled it off um in that situation i
 

967
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,430
pulled it off um in that situation i
have pulled it off with weapons in a

968
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
have pulled it off with weapons in a
 

969
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,110
have pulled it off with weapons in a
couple different situations working with

970
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,120
couple different situations working with
 

971
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,590
couple different situations working with
my guys but it it just never had a lot

972
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
my guys but it it just never had a lot
 

973
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,710
my guys but it it just never had a lot
of functionality for me um now for as

974
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
of functionality for me um now for as
 

975
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,350
of functionality for me um now for as
far as we break down the principle to me

976
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
far as we break down the principle to me
 

977
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,790
far as we break down the principle to me
the principle of eating menage and the

978
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
the principle of eating menage and the
 

979
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,949
the principle of eating menage and the
way i talk about idiom is

980
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
way i talk about idiom is
 

981
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,110
way i talk about idiom is
a throw that happens from the rear

982
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
a throw that happens from the rear
 

983
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,350
a throw that happens from the rear
position so once you get behind someone

984
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
position so once you get behind someone
 

985
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,350
position so once you get behind someone
how do you throw someone and i call any

986
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
how do you throw someone and i call any
 

987
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,710
how do you throw someone and i call any
kind of throw that happens from that

988
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
kind of throw that happens from that
 

989
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,470
kind of throw that happens from that
position and eating

990
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
position and eating
 

991
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,150
position and eating
and i think that's highly functional

992
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
and i think that's highly functional
 

993
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,230
and i think that's highly functional
like trying to get behind someone in and

994
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
like trying to get behind someone in and
 

995
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,069
like trying to get behind someone in and
it's surprisingly easy if people aren't

996
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:46,079
it's surprisingly easy if people aren't
 

997
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,509
it's surprisingly easy if people aren't
trained you know so you work with

998
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
trained you know so you work with
 

999
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,790
trained you know so you work with
someone who's done some judo or some

1000
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
someone who's done some judo or some
 

1001
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,389
someone who's done some judo or some
boxing or something it's pretty hard to

1002
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
boxing or something it's pretty hard to
 

1003
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,310
boxing or something it's pretty hard to
get behind them but you know brand new

1004
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320
get behind them but you know brand new
 

1005
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,069
get behind them but you know brand new
people i can slide behind them quite

1006
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
people i can slide behind them quite
 

1007
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,509
people i can slide behind them quite
often and then there's a myriad of

1008
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
often and then there's a myriad of
 

1009
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,990
often and then there's a myriad of
throws that can happen from that so um

1010
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
throws that can happen from that so um
 

1011
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,670
throws that can happen from that so um
so you know if you're talking about the

1012
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
so you know if you're talking about the
 

1013
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,030
so you know if you're talking about the
functionality of throwing when you're

1014
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
functionality of throwing when you're
 

1015
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,110
functionality of throwing when you're
behind someone it's highly highly

1016
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
behind someone it's highly highly
 

1017
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,110
behind someone it's highly highly
functional and a good thing to have but

1018
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
functional and a good thing to have but
 

1019
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,870
functional and a good thing to have but
as far as practicality is the way we

1020
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
as far as practicality is the way we
 

1021
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,789
as far as practicality is the way we
really see it regularly in aikido it's

1022
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
really see it regularly in aikido it's
 

1023
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,549
really see it regularly in aikido it's
not been very functional for me so you

1024
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
not been very functional for me so you
 

1025
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,549
not been very functional for me so you
know if i was judging my sport martial

1026
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
know if i was judging my sport martial
 

1027
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,630
know if i was judging my sport martial
arts experience and edie minage i would

1028
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
arts experience and edie minage i would
 

1029
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,710
arts experience and edie minage i would
say you know it's maybe a d or an e

1030
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
say you know it's maybe a d or an e
 

1031
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,549
say you know it's maybe a d or an e
because i i just i didn't i didn't get

1032
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
because i i just i didn't i didn't get
 

1033
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,789
because i i just i didn't i didn't get
it you know um as far as like

1034
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
it you know um as far as like
 

1035
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,150
it you know um as far as like
where it goes um like what the potential

1036
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
where it goes um like what the potential
 

1037
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,150
where it goes um like what the potential
is i would put it you know it's very

1038
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
is i would put it you know it's very
 

1039
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,390
is i would put it you know it's very
high so so it's kind of a similar answer

1040
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
high so so it's kind of a similar answer
 

1041
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,390
high so so it's kind of a similar answer
i'm giving you uh consistently which is

1042
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:30,400
i'm giving you uh consistently which is
 

1043
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,470
i'm giving you uh consistently which is
the idea of eating me nuggets we look at

1044
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
the idea of eating me nuggets we look at
 

1045
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,870
the idea of eating me nuggets we look at
it in a general sense is really good but

1046
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:34,880
it in a general sense is really good but
 

1047
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,110
it in a general sense is really good but
um it's hard the way we show the forms

1048
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
um it's hard the way we show the forms
 

1049
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,590
um it's hard the way we show the forms
it's very hard to get that to come off

1050
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
it's very hard to get that to come off
 

1051
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,350
it's very hard to get that to come off
so let's see i know this is tricky this

1052
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
so let's see i know this is tricky this
 

1053
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,350
so let's see i know this is tricky this
is very uh subjective it depends

1054
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
is very uh subjective it depends
 

1055
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,190
is very uh subjective it depends
relative uh but let's say the average

1056
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
relative uh but let's say the average
 

1057
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,750
relative uh but let's say the average
where would you average the technique

1058
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
where would you average the technique
 

1059
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,750
where would you average the technique
i put it a c or a b

1060
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
i put it a c or a b
 

1061
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,870
i put it a c or a b
okay

1062
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
okay
 

1063
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,390
okay
so

1064
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
so
 

1065
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,870
so
let's let's say final decision crb

1066
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880

 

1067
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,669

uh let's leave it at c okay good nice it

1068
00:17:59,669 --> 00:17:59,679
uh let's leave it at c okay good nice it
 

1069
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,270
uh let's leave it at c okay good nice it
looks better that way too

1070
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
looks better that way too
 

1071
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,350
looks better that way too
okay so

1072
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
okay so
 

1073
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,230
okay so
i guess i'll i'll try to throw in a

1074
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
i guess i'll i'll try to throw in a
 

1075
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,430
i guess i'll i'll try to throw in a
curveball

1076
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
curveball
 

1077
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,870
curveball
and choose a technique now which i have

1078
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:10,880
and choose a technique now which i have
 

1079
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,390
and choose a technique now which i have
pretty big doubt

1080
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
pretty big doubt
 

1081
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,350
pretty big doubt
about and that's okay

1082
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
about and that's okay
 

1083
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,350
about and that's okay
uh okay

1084
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,360
uh okay
 

1085
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,750
uh okay
interesting i'll put it here so now um

1086
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:21,760
interesting i'll put it here so now um
 

1087
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,430
interesting i'll put it here so now um
okay i have my thoughts how if it would

1088
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440
okay i have my thoughts how if it would
 

1089
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,750
okay i have my thoughts how if it would
be heavily modified like if we look at

1090
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
be heavily modified like if we look at
 

1091
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,430
be heavily modified like if we look at
like the underlying principles of it

1092
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
like the underlying principles of it
 

1093
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,390
like the underlying principles of it
especially the the moment where you know

1094
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,400
especially the the moment where you know
 

1095
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,230
especially the the moment where you know
snapping down the neck and maybe using

1096
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
snapping down the neck and maybe using
 

1097
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,789
snapping down the neck and maybe using
the arm to fro

1098
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
the arm to fro
 

1099
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,029
the arm to fro
maybe i could imagine it working but

1100
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
maybe i could imagine it working but
 

1101
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,870
maybe i could imagine it working but
that would be a lot about snapping the

1102
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
that would be a lot about snapping the
 

1103
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,390
that would be a lot about snapping the
neck

1104
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,400
neck
 

1105
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,789
neck
locking the arm somehow but if we're

1106
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
locking the arm somehow but if we're
 

1107
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,150
locking the arm somehow but if we're
thinking about

1108
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
thinking about
 

1109
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,909
thinking about
and that's the part which is confusing

1110
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
and that's the part which is confusing
 

1111
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,470
and that's the part which is confusing
for me with kaitenag is the whole going

1112
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
for me with kaitenag is the whole going
 

1113
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,029
for me with kaitenag is the whole going
under the armpit turning out doing this

1114
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
under the armpit turning out doing this
 

1115
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,350
under the armpit turning out doing this
big circle of an arm and getting the arm

1116
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,360
big circle of an arm and getting the arm
 

1117
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,110
big circle of an arm and getting the arm
up top like that whole approach just

1118
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
up top like that whole approach just
 

1119
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,390
up top like that whole approach just
seems

1120
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
seems
 

1121
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,909
seems
almost impossible i don't i don't know

1122
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:57,919
almost impossible i don't i don't know
 

1123
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,990
almost impossible i don't i don't know
what made people think that someone

1124
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
what made people think that someone
 

1125
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,070
what made people think that someone
could pull that off in a fight

1126
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
could pull that off in a fight
 

1127
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,190
could pull that off in a fight
uh

1128
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,200
uh
 

1129
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,070
uh
but if we modified heavily and skipped

1130
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
but if we modified heavily and skipped
 

1131
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,150
but if we modified heavily and skipped
the beginning and we'd look just at the

1132
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
the beginning and we'd look just at the
 

1133
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,510
the beginning and we'd look just at the
point where it's the hand is on the head

1134
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
point where it's the hand is on the head
 

1135
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,590
point where it's the hand is on the head
somehow locking the elbow maybe even not

1136
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
somehow locking the elbow maybe even not
 

1137
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,590
somehow locking the elbow maybe even not
throwing maybe just sitting with the

1138
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600
throwing maybe just sitting with the
 

1139
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,710
throwing maybe just sitting with the
person down i could see that is if we

1140
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
person down i could see that is if we
 

1141
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,070
person down i could see that is if we
would still call it titan like i could

1142
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
would still call it titan like i could
 

1143
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,710
would still call it titan like i could
see that being

1144
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
see that being
 

1145
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,710
see that being
possible but but my doubts about

1146
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
possible but but my doubts about
 

1147
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,230
possible but but my doubts about
kaitanagi are are high so i'd say wow

1148
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
kaitanagi are are high so i'd say wow
 

1149
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,350
kaitanagi are are high so i'd say wow
that's funny d okay hit me

1150
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360

 

1151
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,789

um so i find variations of kaitenage

1152
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
um so i find variations of kaitenage
 

1153
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,070
um so i find variations of kaitenage
fairly useful um and i would put it much

1154
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
fairly useful um and i would put it much
 

1155
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,430
fairly useful um and i would put it much
higher and i would put it higher as far

1156
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
higher and i would put it higher as far
 

1157
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,950
higher and i would put it higher as far
as sport martial arts go and i would put

1158
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960
as sport martial arts go and i would put
 

1159
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,590
as sport martial arts go and i would put
it higher as far as self-defense goes um

1160
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
it higher as far as self-defense goes um
 

1161
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,310
it higher as far as self-defense goes um
because uh i think

1162
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,320
because uh i think
 

1163
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,789
because uh i think
when you got someone going low for a low

1164
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
when you got someone going low for a low
 

1165
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,110
when you got someone going low for a low
leg tackle especially if they're not

1166
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
leg tackle especially if they're not
 

1167
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,710
leg tackle especially if they're not
someone who's a trained wrestler and

1168
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
someone who's a trained wrestler and
 

1169
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,390
someone who's a trained wrestler and
they're doing a perfect shot where

1170
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,400
they're doing a perfect shot where
 

1171
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,590
they're doing a perfect shot where
they're keeping their back straight you

1172
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:57,600
they're keeping their back straight you
 

1173
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,190
they're keeping their back straight you
know when when you're doing a really

1174
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
know when when you're doing a really
 

1175
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,190
know when when you're doing a really
nice shot you're back straight and that

1176
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200
nice shot you're back straight and that
 

1177
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,510
nice shot you're back straight and that
makes kaitenage just about impossible

1178
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520
makes kaitenage just about impossible
 

1179
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,669
makes kaitenage just about impossible
right so that straight back it defends

1180
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
right so that straight back it defends
 

1181
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,270
right so that straight back it defends
against that but most people don't most

1182
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280
against that but most people don't most
 

1183
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,750
against that but most people don't most
people dive with their head and

1184
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
people dive with their head and
 

1185
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,230
people dive with their head and
so when people are diving in at you head

1186
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,240
so when people are diving in at you head
 

1187
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,630
so when people are diving in at you head
first kaitenage appears kind of a lot

1188
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
first kaitenage appears kind of a lot
 

1189
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,350
first kaitenage appears kind of a lot
and

1190
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
and
 

1191
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,870
and
you can't think of it like so to me

1192
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
you can't think of it like so to me
 

1193
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,710
you can't think of it like so to me
again you have to separate the form from

1194
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
again you have to separate the form from
 

1195
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,630
again you have to separate the form from
what the technique itself is and to me

1196
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
what the technique itself is and to me
 

1197
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,630
what the technique itself is and to me
all the technique is is i'm keeping one

1198
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:22,640
all the technique is is i'm keeping one
 

1199
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,870
all the technique is is i'm keeping one
arm open to the side right and i'm

1200
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
arm open to the side right and i'm
 

1201
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,789
arm open to the side right and i'm
controlling the head and so if you look

1202
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:26,799
controlling the head and so if you look
 

1203
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,669
controlling the head and so if you look
at that off of any bad shot if i get the

1204
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:29,679
at that off of any bad shot if i get the
 

1205
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,669
at that off of any bad shot if i get the
back of neck control and i get one arm

1206
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
back of neck control and i get one arm
 

1207
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,029
back of neck control and i get one arm
out to the side and i can go that

1208
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,039
out to the side and i can go that
 

1209
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,590
out to the side and i can go that
direction that will come up a lot um and

1210
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600
direction that will come up a lot um and
 

1211
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,110
direction that will come up a lot um and
i have students who come up with it

1212
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
i have students who come up with it
 

1213
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,270
i have students who come up with it
regularly you know so it happens fairly

1214
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
regularly you know so it happens fairly
 

1215
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,590
regularly you know so it happens fairly
often um i would put it much higher for

1216
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:41,600
often um i would put it much higher for
 

1217
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,270
often um i would put it much higher for
sport martial arts now i think if you

1218
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
sport martial arts now i think if you
 

1219
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,470
sport martial arts now i think if you
think of the forum where it's like

1220
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:44,480
think of the forum where it's like
 

1221
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,909
think of the forum where it's like
someone's holding your wrist and you

1222
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
someone's holding your wrist and you
 

1223
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,430
someone's holding your wrist and you
turn to the outside and you cut your

1224
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,440
turn to the outside and you cut your
 

1225
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,270
turn to the outside and you cut your
hand down and you catch the top of their

1226
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280
hand down and you catch the top of their
 

1227
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,350
hand down and you catch the top of their
head and you extend their spine and so

1228
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
head and you extend their spine and so
 

1229
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,710
head and you extend their spine and so
it's tight and then when you move just a

1230
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
it's tight and then when you move just a
 

1231
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,310
it's tight and then when you move just a
little bit they fly through the air

1232
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320
little bit they fly through the air
 

1233
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,909
little bit they fly through the air
that's not going to happen so what's

1234
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:55,919
that's not going to happen so what's
 

1235
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,669
that's not going to happen so what's
really interesting for me when regarding

1236
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:57,679
really interesting for me when regarding
 

1237
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,230
really interesting for me when regarding
what you said makes me reflect about my

1238
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:00,240
what you said makes me reflect about my
 

1239
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,830
what you said makes me reflect about my

1247
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,870
considered that may be a
kind of a flaw in my approach to

kind of a flaw in my approach to
 

1249
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,310
kind of a flaw in my approach to
exploring it

1250

exploring it
 

1251
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,029

1285
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,789
you know to pull off against them like i
couldn't even pull off

1286
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
couldn't even pull off
 

1287
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,950
couldn't even pull off
most functional techniques which i know

1288
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
most functional techniques which i know
 

1289
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,710
most functional techniques which i know
are functional i i did them on many

1290
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
are functional i i did them on many
 

1291
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,190
are functional i i did them on many
people but i can't even pull off that

1292
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
people but i can't even pull off that
 

1293
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,270
people but i can't even pull off that
against them because they're so good

1294
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
against them because they're so good
 

1295
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,430
against them because they're so good
and and maybe that's that's not maybe

1296
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,440
and and maybe that's that's not maybe
 

1297
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,190
and and maybe that's that's not maybe
you know that's a clear

1298
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200
you know that's a clear
 

1299
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,950
you know that's a clear
kind of a flaw in my approach that

1300
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
kind of a flaw in my approach that
 

1301
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,549
kind of a flaw in my approach that
should be like the last step i should go

1302
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
should be like the last step i should go
 

1303
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,630
should be like the last step i should go
to these people only after i'm like so

1304
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:08,640
to these people only after i'm like so
 

1305
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,789
to these people only after i'm like so
good at these techniques so so yeah

1306
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799
good at these techniques so so yeah
 

1307
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,789
good at these techniques so so yeah
maybe that's why kaiten that's one of

1308
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
maybe that's why kaiten that's one of
 

1309
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,630
maybe that's why kaiten that's one of
the reasons why kaitenage

1310
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:14,640
the reasons why kaitenage
 

1311
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,149
the reasons why kaitenage
was so low for me

1312
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
was so low for me
 

1313
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,070
was so low for me
in the scoreboard and also too when you

1314
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,080
in the scoreboard and also too when you
 

1315
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,470
in the scoreboard and also too when you
mentioned that people tend to dive in

1316
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480
mentioned that people tend to dive in
 

1317
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,310
mentioned that people tend to dive in
i'm thinking like yeah that makes sense

1318
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,320
i'm thinking like yeah that makes sense
 

1319
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,470
i'm thinking like yeah that makes sense
i can see that but it's just

1320
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
i can see that but it's just
 

1321
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,070
i can see that but it's just
yeah training with combat sports guys

1322
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,080
yeah training with combat sports guys
 

1323
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,789
yeah training with combat sports guys
all the time i think my my radar is

1324
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
all the time i think my my radar is
 

1325
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,630
all the time i think my my radar is
flawed in that regard i think an

1326
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
flawed in that regard i think an
 

1327
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,710
flawed in that regard i think an
important thing to to point out and i

1328
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
important thing to to point out and i
 

1329
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,870
important thing to to point out and i
this is an argument i've heard a lot and

1330
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880
this is an argument i've heard a lot and
 

1331
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,270
this is an argument i've heard a lot and
it's good argument that well if you can

1332
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,280
it's good argument that well if you can
 

1333
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,710
it's good argument that well if you can
pull off those things against high-level

1334
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
pull off those things against high-level
 

1335
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,110
pull off those things against high-level
people then of course you'll be able to

1336
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120
people then of course you'll be able to
 

1337
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,470
people then of course you'll be able to
pull off the stuff that works against

1338
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480
pull off the stuff that works against
 

1339
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,070
pull off the stuff that works against
high-level people against low-level

1340
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080
high-level people against low-level
 

1341
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,070
high-level people against low-level
people right but the only problem with

1342
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
people right but the only problem with
 

1343
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,870
people right but the only problem with
that idea is that a lot of times you can

1344
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
that idea is that a lot of times you can
 

1345
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,190
that idea is that a lot of times you can
kind of round corners with people who

1346
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,200
kind of round corners with people who
 

1347
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,390
kind of round corners with people who
don't know what they're doing that you

1348
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400
don't know what they're doing that you
 

1349
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,710
don't know what they're doing that you
can't round with people who are really

1350
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:56,720
can't round with people who are really
 

1351
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,110
can't round with people who are really
good and though that rounding of corners

1352
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120
good and though that rounding of corners
 

1353
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,549
good and though that rounding of corners
can make things come off faster and

1354
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:00,559
can make things come off faster and
 

1355
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,549
can make things come off faster and
better and so a lot of times if i'm just

1356
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:02,559
better and so a lot of times if i'm just
 

1357
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,630
better and so a lot of times if i'm just
trying to preserve myself i can take a

1358
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
trying to preserve myself i can take a
 

1359
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,510
trying to preserve myself i can take a
lot of quick chances with someone who um

1360
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
lot of quick chances with someone who um
 

1361
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,190
lot of quick chances with someone who um
doesn't know how to grapple that i could

1362
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,200
doesn't know how to grapple that i could
 

1363
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,789
doesn't know how to grapple that i could
never do with someone who knows how to

1364
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:10,799
never do with someone who knows how to
 

1365
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,430
never do with someone who knows how to
grapple right and so um there is an

1366
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
grapple right and so um there is an
 

1367
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,470
grapple right and so um there is an
importance i think if you're looking

1368
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,480
importance i think if you're looking
 

1369
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,549
importance i think if you're looking
about self-defense what is the average

1370
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
about self-defense what is the average
 

1371
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,390
about self-defense what is the average
person going to do most of the time and

1372
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
person going to do most of the time and
 

1373
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,510
person going to do most of the time and
you know that's not to say that you

1374
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520
you know that's not to say that you
 

1375
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,190
you know that's not to say that you
shouldn't do some heavy stuff with guys

1376
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,200
shouldn't do some heavy stuff with guys
 

1377
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,390
shouldn't do some heavy stuff with guys
who are really good because you should

1378
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:22,400
who are really good because you should
 

1379
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,789
who are really good because you should
understand that game too but look i am

1380
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:24,799
understand that game too but look i am
 

1381
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,310
understand that game too but look i am
never going to in a self-defense

1382
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
never going to in a self-defense
 

1383
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,830
never going to in a self-defense
situation grapple a black belt in

1384
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
situation grapple a black belt in
 

1385
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,669
situation grapple a black belt in
brazilian jiu jitsu i i'm going to shoot

1386
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
brazilian jiu jitsu i i'm going to shoot
 

1387
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,430
brazilian jiu jitsu i i'm going to shoot
him from as far away as i possibly can

1388
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
him from as far away as i possibly can
 

1389
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,110
him from as far away as i possibly can
right so if he's attacking me i want to

1390
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
right so if he's attacking me i want to
 

1391
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,110
right so if he's attacking me i want to
be as far away from that guy as possible

1392
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,120
be as far away from that guy as possible
 

1393
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,510
be as far away from that guy as possible
um and so so it's like you know what is

1394
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
um and so so it's like you know what is
 

1395
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,669
um and so so it's like you know what is
the regular guy gonna do who maybe comes

1396
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:39,679
the regular guy gonna do who maybe comes
 

1397
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,110
the regular guy gonna do who maybe comes
up on me right and that that's what i'm

1398
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
up on me right and that that's what i'm
 

1399
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,029
up on me right and that that's what i'm
looking at most of the time right

1400
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:43,039
looking at most of the time right
 

1401
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,110
looking at most of the time right
and that makes a lot of sense so so

1402
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
and that makes a lot of sense so so
 

1403
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,190
and that makes a lot of sense so so
that's i think i think that that's

1404
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
that's i think i think that that's
 

1405
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,870
that's i think i think that that's
something i should start incorporating

1406
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:48,880
something i should start incorporating
 

1407
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,190
something i should start incorporating
more into my explorations

1408
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
more into my explorations
 

1409
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,230
more into my explorations
uh

1410
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240
uh
 

1411
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,750
uh
well

1412
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,760
well
 

1413
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,149
well
just to end the the argument about

1414
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159
just to end the the argument about
 

1415
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,710
just to end the the argument about
caitanya so what's what score would you

1416
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720
caitanya so what's what score would you
 

1417
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,110
caitanya so what's what score would you
give like what's the average between

1418
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,120
give like what's the average between
 

1419
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,070
give like what's the average between
uh it's i mean i would definitely put it

1420
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,080
uh it's i mean i would definitely put it
 

1421
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,070
uh it's i mean i would definitely put it
up in the in the b ish category for sure

1422
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,080
up in the in the b ish category for sure
 

1423
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,350
up in the in the b ish category for sure
i mean even even if we're looking at

1424
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
i mean even even if we're looking at
 

1425
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,350
i mean even even if we're looking at
sport sport martial arts it's highly

1426
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
sport sport martial arts it's highly
 

1427
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,750
sport sport martial arts it's highly
functional and to me it's aikido's only

1428
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
functional and to me it's aikido's only
 

1429
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,549
functional and to me it's aikido's only
answer for low stuff and i think it

1430
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
answer for low stuff and i think it
 

1431
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,789
answer for low stuff and i think it
answers most of the common low attack

1432
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
answers most of the common low attack
 

1433
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,350
answers most of the common low attack
problems so it's it's a really good

1434
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,360
problems so it's it's a really good
 

1435
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,990
problems so it's it's a really good
technique nice okay i'm i'm glad you

1436
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
technique nice okay i'm i'm glad you
 

1437
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,070
technique nice okay i'm i'm glad you
said that it changed my mind i was very

1438
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,080
said that it changed my mind i was very

1599
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,070
they quit escalating and that's all he
wants is to de-escalate them right so he

1600
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,080
wants is to de-escalate them right so he

1605
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,269
that goes in the newspaper right
but if he pokes someone with a pin a

1606
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:17,279
but if he pokes someone with a pin a
 

1607

little bit now look if that guy really
 

1609
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,549

wanted to hurt the celebrity that pin

1610
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:22,559
wanted to hurt the celebrity that pin
 

1611
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,710
wanted to hurt the celebrity that pin
would do nothing but if he's on the

00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
would do nothing but if he's on the
 

1613
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,950
would do nothing but if he's on the
fence at all and he realizes oh man this

1614
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:26,960
fence at all and he realizes oh man this

that was more than enough to stop me and
 

1621
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,110
that was more than enough to stop me and
so yonkyo to me is that kind of thing

1622
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
so yonkyo to me is that kind of thing
 

1623
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,990
so yonkyo to me is that kind of thing
where it's encouragement to de-escalate

1624
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,000
where it's encouragement to de-escalate
 

1625
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,430
where it's encouragement to de-escalate

a little bit yonko is a really good

1642
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
a little bit yonko is a really good
 

1643
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,430
a little bit yonko is a really good
technique and can be applied so subtly

1644
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,440
technique and can be applied so subtly
 

1645
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,950
technique and can be applied so subtly
by just grabbing someone and applying a

1646
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960
by just grabbing someone and applying a
 

1647
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,549
by just grabbing someone and applying a
little yonkyo and it's like oh i didn't

1648
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:00,559
little yonkyo and it's like oh i didn't
 

1649
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,830
little yonkyo and it's like oh i didn't
like that feeling and maybe it's going

1650
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:01,840
like that feeling and maybe it's going
 

1651
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,510
like that feeling and maybe it's going
to get worse so i think it's good in

1652
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:03,520
to get worse so i think it's good in
 

1653
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,870
to get worse so i think it's good in
that capacity

1654
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:04,880
that capacity
 

1655
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,950
that capacity
that's again really interesting because

1656
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:06,960
that's again really interesting because
 

1657
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,190
that's again really interesting because
i just realized what happened in my mind

1658
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,200
i just realized what happened in my mind
 

1659
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,269
i just realized what happened in my mind
when i was looking at yonkyo the way i

1660
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,279
when i was looking at yonkyo the way i
 

1661
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,590
when i was looking at yonkyo the way i
was taught yonkyo was a lot based on

1662
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,600
was taught yonkyo was a lot based on
 

1663
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,430
was taught yonkyo was a lot based on
what was called connection

1664
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,440
what was called connection
 

1665
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,990
what was called connection
and that's you know very difficult term

1666
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,000
and that's you know very difficult term
 

1667
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,230
and that's you know very difficult term
to use to be honest but but the idea was

1668
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240
to use to be honest but but the idea was
 

1669
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,830
to use to be honest but but the idea was
it was connecting to the shoulder

1670
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:21,840
it was connecting to the shoulder
 

1671
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,950
it was connecting to the shoulder
through the forearm and the focus was

1672
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:24,960
through the forearm and the focus was
 

1673
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,950
through the forearm and the focus was
very much not on the

1674
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:26,960
very much not on the
 

1675
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,070
very much not on the
the pain

1676
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
the pain
 

1677
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,070
the pain
you know causing pain part which that's

1678
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,080
you know causing pain part which that's
 

1679
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,070
you know causing pain part which that's
why i just almost eluded my mind i kind

1680
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,080
why i just almost eluded my mind i kind
 

1681
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,990
why i just almost eluded my mind i kind
of forgot like that exists there and i

1682
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,000
of forgot like that exists there and i
 

1683
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,669
of forgot like that exists there and i
was thinking about the okay use the

1684
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:35,679
was thinking about the okay use the
 

1685
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,070
was thinking about the okay use the
forearm just bring the person down which

1686
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,080
forearm just bring the person down which
 

1687
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,149
forearm just bring the person down which
was my skeptical part now that you

1688
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
was my skeptical part now that you
 

1689
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,029
was my skeptical part now that you
reminded me of of the pain part and that

1690
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:43,039
reminded me of of the pain part and that
 

1691
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,549
reminded me of of the pain part and that
actually is there and that that's

1692
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:44,559
actually is there and that that's
 

1693
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,269
actually is there and that that's
actually that may be like the

1694
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:47,279
actually that may be like the
 

1695
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,669
actually that may be like the
the yonkyo that's like the essence of it

1696
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:49,679
the yonkyo that's like the essence of it
 

1697
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,149
the yonkyo that's like the essence of it
that makes much more sense so

1698
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:52,159
that makes much more sense so
 

1699
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,830
that makes much more sense so
that's interesting

1700
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:53,840
that's interesting
 

1701
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,789
that's interesting
so

1702
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:54,799
so
 

1703
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,990
so
i think i've had the same lesson oh yeah

1704
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,000
i think i've had the same lesson oh yeah
 

1705
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,590
i think i've had the same lesson oh yeah
i think i've had exactly the same lesson

1706
00:28:59,590 --> 00:28:59,600
i think i've had exactly the same lesson
 

1707
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,789
i think i've had exactly the same lesson
you had with the connection um and uh

1708
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:02,799
you had with the connection um and uh
 

1709
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,310
you had with the connection um and uh
you know while that's an okay way to

1710
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:04,320
you know while that's an okay way to
 

1711
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,750
you know while that's an okay way to
think about it my thought on that was

1712
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
think about it my thought on that was
 

1713
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,430
think about it my thought on that was
always well why wouldn't you just use

1714
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:07,440
always well why wouldn't you just use
 

1715
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,430
always well why wouldn't you just use
ekyo then because ikyo is better at

1716
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:09,440
ekyo then because ikyo is better at
 

1717
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,510
ekyo then because ikyo is better at
connecting someone's center than the

1718
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:11,520
connecting someone's center than the
 

1719
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,029
connecting someone's center than the
yonkyo is you connect from a stronger

1720
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:13,039
yonkyo is you connect from a stronger
 

1721
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,430
yonkyo is you connect from a stronger
point so to me the essence of the yonkyo

1722
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:15,440
point so to me the essence of the yonkyo
 

1723
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,909
point so to me the essence of the yonkyo
is that grip that grip is what makes the

1724
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:17,919
is that grip that grip is what makes the
 

1725
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,510
is that grip that grip is what makes the
yonkyo yunkyo nice that's a great point

1726
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,520
yonkyo yunkyo nice that's a great point
 

1727
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,190
yonkyo yunkyo nice that's a great point
so coming back to the board of

1728
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,200
so coming back to the board of
 

1729
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,669
so coming back to the board of
maker uh

1730
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:27,679
maker uh
 

1731
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,830
maker uh
considering all of that where would you

1732

considering all of that where would you
would you where would you reestablish

1734
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440
would you where would you reestablish
 

1735
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,950
would you where would you reestablish
young kyoto

1736
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
young kyoto
 

1737
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,310
young kyoto

it's an f for a situation i need to

1742
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:38,720
it's an f for a situation i need to
 

1743
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,870
it's an f for a situation i need to
de-escalate a little bit um it might be

1744
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:40,880
de-escalate a little bit um it might be
 

1745
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,430
de-escalate a little bit um it might be
a c or a b you know it's useful and i've

1746
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:43,440
a c or a b you know it's useful and i've
 

1747
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,669
a c or a b you know it's useful and i've
used it a few times um i've used it with

1748
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
used it a few times um i've used it with
 

1749
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,430
used it a few times um i've used it with
drunks who want to leave and drive their

1750
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:47,440
drunks who want to leave and drive their
 

1751
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,230
drunks who want to leave and drive their
car and that was a bad idea um so so

1752
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,240
car and that was a bad idea um so so
 

1753
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,070
car and that was a bad idea um so so
it's it's functional you know but it

1754
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,080
it's it's functional you know but it
 

1755
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,269
it's it's functional you know but it
depends on your situation you're not

1756
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:53,279
depends on your situation you're not
 

1757
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,389
depends on your situation you're not
going to win a fight with it you're not

1758
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:54,399
going to win a fight with it you're not
 

1759
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,430
going to win a fight with it you're not
going to you know you're not going to

1760
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:55,440
going to you know you're not going to
 

1761
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,029
going to you know you're not going to
prove to every kid on the school ground

1762
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:57,039
prove to every kid on the school ground
 

1763
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,230
prove to every kid on the school ground
that you're tough because you can yank

1764
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
that you're tough because you can yank
 

1765
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,430
that you're tough because you can yank
it to someone because it isn't going to

1766
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,440
it to someone because it isn't going to
 

1767
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,950
it to someone because it isn't going to
work you know

1768
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:00,960
work you know
 

1769
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,789
work you know
but i guess based on the potential of

1770
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:02,799
but i guess based on the potential of
 

1771
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,990
but i guess based on the potential of
usefulness

1772
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
usefulness
 

1773
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,310
usefulness
what would be your

1774
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,320
what would be your
 

1775
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,789
what would be your
final average score like what's the i

1776
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:08,799
final average score like what's the i
 

1777
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,510
final average score like what's the i
lost you again ah shoot let's see okay

1778
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:11,520
lost you again ah shoot let's see okay
 

1779
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,789
lost you again ah shoot let's see okay
so let's finish this one and then i'll

1780
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:12,799
so let's finish this one and then i'll
 

1781
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,430
so let's finish this one and then i'll
restart um a router i'll give it a serie

1782
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:15,440
restart um a router i'll give it a serie
 

1783
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,230
restart um a router i'll give it a serie
d

1784
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,240
d
 

1785
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,950
d
scary so let's see

1786
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:18,960
scary so let's see
 

1787
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,549
scary so let's see
let's see

1788
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:20,559
let's see
 

1789
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,590
let's see
you have so you final decision like

1790
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:23,600
you have so you final decision like
 

1791
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,190
you have so you final decision like
what's what's the

1792
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
what's what's the
 

1793
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,350
what's what's the
where if you have to choose yeah it's

1794
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,360
where if you have to choose yeah it's
 

1795
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,830
where if you have to choose yeah it's
clear it's so hard because it's like i

1796
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:29,840
clear it's so hard because it's like i
 

1797
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,950
clear it's so hard because it's like i
can see

1798
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
can see
 

1799
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,110
can see
i can see different contexts you know

1800
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,120
i can see different contexts you know
 

1801
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,950
i can see different contexts you know
and so like to me you know if you're

1802
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:34,960
and so like to me you know if you're
 

1803
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,710
and so like to me you know if you're
looking at self-defense like if we are

1804
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:36,720
looking at self-defense like if we are
 

1805
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,549
looking at self-defense like if we are
really looking at self-defense then i

1806
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:38,559
really looking at self-defense then i
 

1807
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,909
really looking at self-defense then i
would give it uh

1808
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:39,919
would give it uh
 

1809
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,510
would give it uh
a b probably a b actually because i i

1810
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:41,520
a b probably a b actually because i i
 

1811
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,430
a b probably a b actually because i i
think it's it's fairly useful i've used

1812
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,440
think it's it's fairly useful i've used
 

1813
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,190
think it's it's fairly useful i've used
it um but if we're looking at sport

1814
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,200
it um but if we're looking at sport
 

1815
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,149
it um but if we're looking at sport
martial arts it's an f so so it really

1816
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:48,159
martial arts it's an f so so it really
 

1817
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,909
martial arts it's an f so so it really
really really depends it's almost like

1818
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:49,919
really really depends it's almost like
 

1819
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,510
really really depends it's almost like
we need two lists one that's like self

1820
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,520
we need two lists one that's like self
 

1821
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,870
we need two lists one that's like self
defense and one that's like sport

1822
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:52,880
defense and one that's like sport
 

1823
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,110
defense and one that's like sport
martial arts um because

1824
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,120
martial arts um because
 

1825
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,950
martial arts um because
they're different animals you know like

1826
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:56,960
they're different animals you know like
 

1827
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,110
they're different animals you know like
i'm never going to yonkyo someone in a

1828
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,120
i'm never going to yonkyo someone in a
 

1829
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,950
i'm never going to yonkyo someone in a
grappling match and then go oh tap tap

1830
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:00,960
grappling match and then go oh tap tap
 

1831
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,549
grappling match and then go oh tap tap
that's it i'm done right it's never just

1832
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:02,559
that's it i'm done right it's never just
 

1833
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,870
that's it i'm done right it's never just
never gonna happen right

1834
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:04,880
never gonna happen right
 

1835
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,509
never gonna happen right
so i guess uh i realized now okay this

1836
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:07,519
so i guess uh i realized now okay this
 

1837
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,190
so i guess uh i realized now okay this
this this list could be made more

1838
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,200
this this list could be made more
 

1839
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,710
this this list could be made more
sophisticated it could be two different

1840
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:10,720
sophisticated it could be two different
 

1841
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,029
sophisticated it could be two different
lists but let's see if we still commit

1842
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:13,039
lists but let's see if we still commit
 

1843
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,110
lists but let's see if we still commit
to finishing off that that middle ground

1844
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,120
to finishing off that that middle ground
 

1845
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,789
to finishing off that that middle ground
let's give it a d and i think that'll

1846
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:16,799
let's give it a d and i think that'll
 

1847
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,149
let's give it a d and i think that'll
average everything out let's give it a

1848
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:18,159
average everything out let's give it a
 

1849
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,630
average everything out let's give it a
okay perfect cool start looking at

1850
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
okay perfect cool start looking at
 

1851
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,470
okay perfect cool start looking at
jujin again

1852

1855
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,950
but at the same time i can't say i'm too
skeptical i can imagine

00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:26,960
skeptical i can imagine
 

1857
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,190
skeptical i can imagine
my hands getting there again but that

1858
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,200
my hands getting there again but that
 

1859
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,789
my hands getting there again but that
question is always there like how do you

get to that point like what has to
 

1863
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,470
get to that point like what has to
happen if i'm thinking about trained

1864
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:34,480
happen if i'm thinking about trained
 

1865
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,430
happen if i'm thinking about trained

um so it's it's hard to say part of me

1878
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
um so it's it's hard to say part of me

getting in an unarmed situation is

1892
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:04,399
getting in an unarmed situation is
 

1893
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,430
getting in an unarmed situation is
highly unlikely um because people don't

1894
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
highly unlikely um because people don't
 

1895
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,190
highly unlikely um because people don't
cross themselves like that very often

1896
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,200
cross themselves like that very often
 

1897
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,110
cross themselves like that very often
and most people are strong enough to

1898
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,120
and most people are strong enough to
 

1899
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,269
and most people are strong enough to
resist you crossing them unless you're

1900
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:13,279
resist you crossing them unless you're
 

1901
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,630
resist you crossing them unless you're
really strong right so you could

1902
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:14,640
really strong right so you could
 

1903
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,549
really strong right so you could
probably get it regularly with children

1904
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:16,559
probably get it regularly with children
 

1905
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,070
probably get it regularly with children
right because they're just they're too

1906
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,080
right because they're just they're too
 

1907

list uh
 

2009
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,110
list uh
uh so

2010
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
uh so
 

2011
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:15,510
uh so
one version to call it is rocky

2012
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:15,520

 

2013
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,589

right so same here same here i came from

2014
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:17,599
right so same here same here i came from
 

2015
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,190
right so same here same here i came from
the rokyo

2016
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
the rokyo
 

2017
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,430
the rokyo
teachings so

2018
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:21,440
teachings so
 

2019
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,950
teachings so
i guess

2020
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:22,960
i guess
 

2021
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,069
i guess
again

2022
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:24,079
again
 

2023
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,310
again
train people very hard but

2024
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:26,320
train people very hard but
 

2025
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,909
train people very hard but
well that's always probably not always

2026
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:27,919
well that's always probably not always
 

2027
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:30,069
well that's always probably not always
the case but but that's that is the case

2028
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:30,079
the case but but that's that is the case
 

2029
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,829
the case but but that's that is the case
uh untrained people i think i can

2030
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:31,839
uh untrained people i think i can
 

2031
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,550
uh untrained people i think i can
imagine like how maybe you can lock that

2032
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:34,560
imagine like how maybe you can lock that
 

2033
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,310
imagine like how maybe you can lock that
elbow there still that getting the

2034
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:36,320
elbow there still that getting the
 

2035
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,270
elbow there still that getting the
person low down low

2036
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:39,280
person low down low
 

2037
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,589
person low down low
and lifting that arm up now that could

2038
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:41,599
and lifting that arm up now that could
 

2039
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,629
and lifting that arm up now that could
be a tricky part but i can imagine

2040
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:44,639
be a tricky part but i can imagine
 

2041
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,950
be a tricky part but i can imagine
it working like i don't know police type

2042
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:46,960
it working like i don't know police type
 

2043
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,109
it working like i don't know police type
of situation police students for

2044
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:49,119
of situation police students for
 

2045
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,030
of situation police students for
enforcing whatever so again can't

2046
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,040
enforcing whatever so again can't
 

2047
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,510
enforcing whatever so again can't
say a lot of it didn't try it yet

2048
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:55,520
say a lot of it didn't try it yet
 

2049
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,430
say a lot of it didn't try it yet
but i imagine it could be product like

2050
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:57,440
but i imagine it could be product like
 

2051
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,190
but i imagine it could be product like
effective so let's say i'll try i'll try

2052
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,200
effective so let's say i'll try i'll try
 

2053
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,990
effective so let's say i'll try i'll try

00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:15,760
these five okay
 

2383
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,630
these five okay
uh koshinaga is the next one

2384
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:18,640
uh koshinaga is the next one
 

2385
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,309
uh koshinaga is the next one
and

2386
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:20,319
and
 

2387
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,950
and
that probably is like when i think about

2388
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:22,960
that probably is like when i think about
 

2389
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,790
that probably is like when i think about
hit on functionality besides the

2390
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:24,800
hit on functionality besides the
 

2391
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,990
hit on functionality besides the
corrugation which is actually going to

2392
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,000
corrugation which is actually going to
 

2393
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,030
corrugation which is actually going to
be next uh that gives a lot of ideas to

2394
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,040
be next uh that gives a lot of ideas to
 

2395
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,109
be next uh that gives a lot of ideas to
me like how that could be used again i i

2396
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:31,119
me like how that could be used again i i
 

2397
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,030
me like how that could be used again i i
think about if i throw the person down

2398
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,040
think about if i throw the person down
 

2399
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,069
think about if i throw the person down
on the ground

2400
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:34,079
on the ground
 

2401
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,990
on the ground
if that's a like a real self-defense

2402
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,000
if that's a like a real self-defense
 

2403
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,470
if that's a like a real self-defense
situation and i use the hips to throw

2404
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:38,480
situation and i use the hips to throw
 

2405
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,309
situation and i use the hips to throw
i'm always concerned okay is he not

2406
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:40,319
i'm always concerned okay is he not
 

2407
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,950
i'm always concerned okay is he not
gonna break his on concrete

2408
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
gonna break his on concrete
 

2409
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,430
gonna break his on concrete
uh so that that's a question there

2410
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,440
uh so that that's a question there
 

2411
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,510
uh so that that's a question there
but but yeah getting your hips in

2412
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:47,520
but but yeah getting your hips in
 

2413
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,550
but but yeah getting your hips in
throwing seems like a lot of judo to me

2414
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:50,560
throwing seems like a lot of judo to me
 

2415
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,710
throwing seems like a lot of judo to me
uh makes sense

2416
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:52,720
uh makes sense
 

2417
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,710
uh makes sense
i imagine that it could be a very

2418
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:54,720
i imagine that it could be a very
 

2419
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,390
i imagine that it could be a very
functional technique

2420
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:56,400
functional technique
 

2421
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,349
functional technique
um

2422
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:57,359
um
 

2423
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,870
um
so i guess i'll i'll i'll put it at a

2424
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:00,880
so i guess i'll i'll i'll put it at a
 

2425
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,349
so i guess i'll i'll i'll put it at a
and what about you

2426
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:03,359
and what about you
 

2427
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:10,309
and what about you
um

2428
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:10,319

 

2429
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,230

live a bunch of times and it's funny

2430
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,240
live a bunch of times and it's funny
 

2431
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,190
live a bunch of times and it's funny
because

2432
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:13,200
because
 

2433
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,150
because
aikido koshinaga is just any throw that

2434
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,160
aikido koshinaga is just any throw that
 

2435
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,750
aikido koshinaga is just any throw that
comes off the hip so i mean like you

2436
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:17,760
comes off the hip so i mean like you
 

2437
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,190
comes off the hip so i mean like you
know if you're looking in judo that

2438
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:19,200
know if you're looking in judo that
 

2439
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,670
know if you're looking in judo that
could be like an ogo shahanai ghosh

2440
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:21,680
could be like an ogo shahanai ghosh
 

2441
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,510
could be like an ogo shahanai ghosh
maybe even like an uchimada like you

2442
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:23,520
maybe even like an uchimada like you
 

2443
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,870
maybe even like an uchimada like you
know like so anything where they're

2444
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:24,880
know like so anything where they're
 

2445
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,390
know like so anything where they're
lined up on your hip and you throw them

2446

lined up on your hip and you throw them
 

2447
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,309
lined up on your hip and you throw them
we call that koshinage and so you know

2448
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:28,319
we call that koshinage and so you know
 

2449
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,950
we call that koshinage and so you know
you know from judo um and grappling

2450
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:30,960
you know from judo um and grappling
 

2451
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,150
you know from judo um and grappling
around that

2452
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,160
around that
 

2453
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,589
around that
throwing someone on your hip is a very

2454
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:33,599
throwing someone on your hip is a very
 

2455
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,510
throwing someone on your hip is a very
viable way to throw someone so that's

2456
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:35,520
viable way to throw someone so that's
 

2457
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,270
viable way to throw someone so that's
that's real deal stuff the way it

2458
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:37,280
that's real deal stuff the way it
 

2459
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,670
that's real deal stuff the way it
happens in aikido is generally because

2460
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:39,680
happens in aikido is generally because
 

2461
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,829
happens in aikido is generally because
they're running at you and you get low

2462
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:41,839
they're running at you and you get low
 

2463
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,510
they're running at you and you get low
enough that they pop over no now that's

2464
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:43,520
enough that they pop over no now that's
 

2465
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,109
enough that they pop over no now that's
whether they're running from like uh you

2466
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:45,119
whether they're running from like uh you
 

2467
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,710
whether they're running from like uh you
know from shomonucci so we're in a tight

2468
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:46,720
know from shomonucci so we're in a tight
 

2469
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,230
know from shomonucci so we're in a tight
position where we're up here and i

2470
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,240
position where we're up here and i
 

2471
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,829
position where we're up here and i
transition in and they're pushing in at

2472
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:49,839
transition in and they're pushing in at
 

2473
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,270
transition in and they're pushing in at
me and i get down low and let them come

2474
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:51,280
me and i get down low and let them come
 

2475
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,829
me and i get down low and let them come
over my hips um i've got it i i have a

2476
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:53,839
over my hips um i've got it i i have a
 

2477
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,470
over my hips um i've got it i i have a
video of me getting it years ago um but

2478
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:56,480
video of me getting it years ago um but
 

2479
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,270
video of me getting it years ago um but
it's not it it's not that functional in

2480
00:41:59,270 --> 00:41:59,280
it's not it it's not that functional in
 

2481
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,390
it's not it it's not that functional in
my opinion and the reason it's not that

2482
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:00,400
my opinion and the reason it's not that
 

2483
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,390
my opinion and the reason it's not that
functional is because aikido doesn't

2484
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400
functional is because aikido doesn't
 

2485
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,309
functional is because aikido doesn't
teach you all the clinch positions to

2486
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:04,319
teach you all the clinch positions to
 

2487
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,109
teach you all the clinch positions to
get into that to use it like a sport

2488
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:07,119
get into that to use it like a sport
 

2489
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,750
get into that to use it like a sport
martial art would so like the concept as

2490
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:09,760
martial art would so like the concept as
 

2491
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,510
martial art would so like the concept as
far as like goes throwing some with your

2492
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:11,520
far as like goes throwing some with your
 

2493
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,990
far as like goes throwing some with your
hip yes that's a good concept aikido

2494
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,000
hip yes that's a good concept aikido
 

2495
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,750
hip yes that's a good concept aikido
doesn't really teach you how to get

2496
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:15,760
doesn't really teach you how to get
 

2497
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,829
doesn't really teach you how to get
there to do it right most the time so

2498
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:17,839
there to do it right most the time so
 

2499
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,349
there to do it right most the time so
that's not very functional and the way

2500
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:19,359
that's not very functional and the way
 

2501
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,109
that's not very functional and the way
we see it done in aikido what aikido

2502
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:21,119
we see it done in aikido what aikido
 

2503
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,390
we see it done in aikido what aikido
does teach you to do with it that

2504
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:22,400
does teach you to do with it that
 

2505
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,190
does teach you to do with it that
situation doesn't arise all that often

2506
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:25,200
situation doesn't arise all that often
 

2507
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,910
situation doesn't arise all that often
it comes up but it's not not traumatic

2508
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:27,920
it comes up but it's not not traumatic
 

2509
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,990
it comes up but it's not not traumatic
so you know if i was judging it inside

2510
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,000
so you know if i was judging it inside
 

2511
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,470
so you know if i was judging it inside
the system of aikido i would say it's

2512
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:32,480
the system of aikido i would say it's
 

2513
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,670
the system of aikido i would say it's
probably like a a c technique maybe um

2514
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:35,680
probably like a a c technique maybe um
 

2515
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,190
probably like a a c technique maybe um
if i was judging in sport martial arts

2516
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,200
if i was judging in sport martial arts
 

2517
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,670
if i was judging in sport martial arts
because the lack of ability to get to

2518
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:39,680
because the lack of ability to get to
 

2519
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,510
because the lack of ability to get to
the right clinch position to set it up

2520
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,520
the right clinch position to set it up
 

2521
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,030
the right clinch position to set it up
you know and you know from doing this

2522
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,040
you know and you know from doing this
 

2523
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,270
you know and you know from doing this
the setup is everything right so because

2524
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,280
the setup is everything right so because
 

2525
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,750
the setup is everything right so because
it has a lack of how to set it up um i

2526
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:47,760
it has a lack of how to set it up um i
 

2527
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,510
it has a lack of how to set it up um i
would give it an an f you know i don't

2528
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:49,520
would give it an an f you know i don't
 

2529
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,589
would give it an an f you know i don't
think it's good at all because

2530
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:51,599
think it's good at all because
 

2531
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,309
think it's good at all because
they don't teach you how to set it up um

2532
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:54,319
they don't teach you how to set it up um
 

2533
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,829
they don't teach you how to set it up um
as far as like self-defense goes it's

2534
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:55,839
as far as like self-defense goes it's
 

2535
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,910
as far as like self-defense goes it's
probably like a d or something you know

2536
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:57,920
probably like a d or something you know
 

2537
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,190
probably like a d or something you know
because it's like

2538
00:42:59,190 --> 00:42:59,200
because it's like
 

2539
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,630
because it's like
it's just doesn't that happen doesn't

2540
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:00,640
it's just doesn't that happen doesn't
 

2541
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,230
it's just doesn't that happen doesn't
happen very often so i would put it

2542
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:02,240
happen very often so i would put it
 

2543
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,230
happen very often so i would put it
pretty low um i would probably put it

2544
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:04,240
pretty low um i would probably put it
 

2545
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,309
pretty low um i would probably put it
like in the c or d category where you

2546
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:06,319
like in the c or d category where you
 

2547
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,069
like in the c or d category where you
know it comes up and it's nice to know

2548
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:08,079
know it comes up and it's nice to know
 

2549
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,510
know it comes up and it's nice to know
but you know if you want to compare it

2550
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:09,520
but you know if you want to compare it
 

2551
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,670
but you know if you want to compare it
to what you would get in hip tosses uh

2552
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:11,680
to what you would get in hip tosses uh
 

2553
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,230
to what you would get in hip tosses uh
from judo or or any other real grappling

2554
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:14,240
from judo or or any other real grappling
 

2555
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,510
from judo or or any other real grappling
system it's not comparable you know not

2556
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:17,520
system it's not comparable you know not
 

2557
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,190
system it's not comparable you know not
it's a great point then right after

2558
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,200
it's a great point then right after
 

2559
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,190
it's a great point then right after
actually i finished my thought and i

2560
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:21,200
actually i finished my thought and i
 

2561
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,309
actually i finished my thought and i
thought about

2562
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:22,319
thought about
 

2563
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,030
thought about
your

2564
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,040
your
 

2565
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,589
your
soon-to-be answer i also thought about

2566
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:25,599
soon-to-be answer i also thought about
 

2567
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,710
soon-to-be answer i also thought about
weapons

2568
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:26,720
weapons
 

2569
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,230
weapons
and again

2570
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,240
and again
 

2571
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,950
and again
i'm far far from anything like an expert

2572
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:30,960
i'm far far from anything like an expert
 

2573
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,910
i'm far far from anything like an expert
so i'm just kind of guessing but

2574
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:33,920
so i'm just kind of guessing but
 

2575
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,790
so i'm just kind of guessing but
that's a very close technique and to get

2576
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:36,800
that's a very close technique and to get
 

2577
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,829
that's a very close technique and to get
there and

2578
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:37,839
there and
 

2579
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:38,790
there and
to get

2580
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:38,800
to get
 

2581
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,470
to get
first of all to get in there may be

2582
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:40,480
first of all to get in there may be
 

2583
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,230
first of all to get in there may be
dangerous and to be there and if

2584
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:42,240
dangerous and to be there and if
 

2585
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,069
dangerous and to be there and if
somebody has a knife or something

2586
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:44,079
somebody has a knife or something
 

2587
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,790
somebody has a knife or something
i imagine that can be also uh dangerous

2588
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:46,800
i imagine that can be also uh dangerous
 

2589
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,230
i imagine that can be also uh dangerous
and tricky i mean yeah i can see the

2590
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,240
and tricky i mean yeah i can see the
 

2591
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,470
and tricky i mean yeah i can see the
dangers of just just getting in under

2592
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:50,480
dangers of just just getting in under
 

2593
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,990
dangers of just just getting in under
the person i don't know do you have any

2594
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:52,000
the person i don't know do you have any
 

2595
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,150
the person i don't know do you have any
thoughts about that aspect of the danger

2596
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:54,160
thoughts about that aspect of the danger
 

2597
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,910
thoughts about that aspect of the danger
of i mean if you were going to hip toss

2598
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:55,920
of i mean if you were going to hip toss
 

2599
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,630
of i mean if you were going to hip toss
someone with um

2600
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:58,640
someone with um
 

2601
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,230
someone with um
with a weapon then

2602
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,240
with a weapon then
 

2603
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,470
with a weapon then
the way we do koshinage is about the

2604
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:02,480
the way we do koshinage is about the
 

2605
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,390
the way we do koshinage is about the
right way to do it because we hold the

2606
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:04,400
right way to do it because we hold the
 

2607
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,309
right way to do it because we hold the
arms really clearly when we're setting

2608
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:06,319
arms really clearly when we're setting
 

2609
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,990
arms really clearly when we're setting
it up so that is kind of where it's

2610
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
it up so that is kind of where it's
 

2611
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,309
it up so that is kind of where it's
going to come up um but it's just you

2612
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:10,319
going to come up um but it's just you
 

2613
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,550
going to come up um but it's just you
know if we're dealing with the arms i

2614
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:12,560
know if we're dealing with the arms i
 

2615
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,910
know if we're dealing with the arms i
generally don't want them in that

2616
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:13,920
generally don't want them in that
 

2617
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,430
generally don't want them in that
position for me because it's not too

2618
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:15,440
position for me because it's not too
 

2619
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,430
position for me because it's not too
strong and so i'm not going to choose it

2620
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:17,440
strong and so i'm not going to choose it
 

2621
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,950
strong and so i'm not going to choose it
and so it's only going to happen when

2622
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
and so it's only going to happen when
 

2623
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,589
and so it's only going to happen when
they force that situation to come up and

2624
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:21,599
they force that situation to come up and
 

2625
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,030
they force that situation to come up and
in my experience they don't force that

2626
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,040
in my experience they don't force that
 

2627
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,710
in my experience they don't force that
situation all that often you know

2628
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:26,720
situation all that often you know
 

2629
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,670
situation all that often you know
so

2630
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:27,680

turns out but probably a would have been

2858
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:13,520
turns out but probably a would have been
 

2859
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,430
turns out but probably a would have been
my rightful

2860
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:15,440
my rightful
 

2861
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,390
my rightful
choice but i like it so

2862
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:18,400
choice but i like it so
 

2863
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,670
choice but i like it so
okay

2864
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:19,680
okay
 

2865

quick reflection from my end uh i did

2868
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:24,640
quick reflection from my end uh i did
 

2869
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,589
quick reflection from my end uh i did
catch it

2870
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:25,599
catch it
 

2871
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,349
catch it
once or

2872
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:27,359
once or
 

2873
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:28,870
once or
oh no actually that wasn't strong i got

2874
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:28,880
oh no actually that wasn't strong i got
 

2875
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,630
oh no actually that wasn't strong i got
to be honest i i'm i actually was

00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:30,640
to be honest i i'm i actually was
 

2877
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,790
to be honest i i'm i actually was
thinking about a sankyo pulling it off

2878
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:32,800
thinking about a sankyo pulling it off
 

2879
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,109
thinking about a sankyo pulling it off
in grappling when going under a full-on

2880
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:35,119
in grappling when going under a full-on
 

2881
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,750
in grappling when going under a full-on
shield yeah no it's too far i remember

2882
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:37,760
shield yeah no it's too far i remember
 

2883
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,910
shield yeah no it's too far i remember
that i never got it there

2884
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:39,920
that i never got it there
 

2885
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,750
that i never got it there
i'm doubtful about the whole

2886
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:41,760
i'm doubtful about the whole
 

2887
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,990
i'm doubtful about the whole
again enter under the armpit turn the

2888
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,000
again enter under the armpit turn the
 

2889
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,710
again enter under the armpit turn the
arm get it to the person but if if let's

2890
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:46,720
arm get it to the person but if if let's
 

2891
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,950
arm get it to the person but if if let's
say there's some sort of situation

2892
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:48,960
say there's some sort of situation
 

2893
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,430
say there's some sort of situation
to get it to the arm to the shoulder

2894
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:51,440
to get it to the arm to the shoulder
 

2895
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,589
to get it to the arm to the shoulder
pull the person in fro i imagine that

2896
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:53,599
pull the person in fro i imagine that
 

2897

pull the person in fro i imagine that
could happen

2898
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:55,119
could happen
 

2899
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,549
could happen
again there's a lot of guessing in my

2900
00:48:56,549 --> 00:48:56,559
again there's a lot of guessing in my
 

2901
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:57,750
again there's a lot of guessing in my
mind

2902
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:57,760
mind
 

2903
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,030
mind
uh

2904
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,040
uh
 

2905
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,670
uh
but okay i'll put it a c i yes i end up

2906
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
but okay i'll put it a c i yes i end up
 

2907
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,430
but okay i'll put it a c i yes i end up
being honest ca a lot but

2908
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:03,440
being honest ca a lot but
 

2909
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,430
being honest ca a lot but
okay now now the truth moment the moment

2910
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:05,440
okay now now the truth moment the moment
 

2911
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,710
okay now now the truth moment the moment
of truth

2912
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:06,720
of truth
 

2913
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,750
of truth
if you're talking about sport martial

2914
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:07,760
if you're talking about sport martial
 

2915
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,990
if you're talking about sport martial
arts i would give it an f it it's i mean

2916

arts i would give it an f it it's i mean
 

2917
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,870
arts i would give it an f it it's i mean
it's just so difficult to to do um

2918
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:12,880
it's just so difficult to to do um
 

2919
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,670
it's just so difficult to to do um
shionage is highly situation dependent

2920
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:15,680
shionage is highly situation dependent
 

2921
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,990
shionage is highly situation dependent
um you know it's one that i really can't

2922
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:18,000
um you know it's one that i really can't
 

2923
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,069
um you know it's one that i really can't
hunt um you know so but by that i mean

2924
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:20,079
hunt um you know so but by that i mean
 

2925
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,750
hunt um you know so but by that i mean
like sometimes i come to class and i'm

2926
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:21,760
like sometimes i come to class and i'm
 

2927
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,589
like sometimes i come to class and i'm
rolling with the guys or something and i

2928
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:23,599
rolling with the guys or something and i
 

2929
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,030
rolling with the guys or something and i
want to hunt out techniques and i'm like

2930
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,040
want to hunt out techniques and i'm like
 

2931
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,630
want to hunt out techniques and i'm like
i'm going to see if i can make the

2932
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:26,640
i'm going to see if i can make the
 

2933
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,950
i'm going to see if i can make the
setups happen for this or this or this

2934
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:28,960
setups happen for this or this or this
 

2935
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,270
setups happen for this or this or this
shionage is really impossible because

2936
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:31,280
shionage is really impossible because
 

2937
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,349
shionage is really impossible because
it's so long to get the technique

2938
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:33,359
it's so long to get the technique
 

2939
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,030
it's so long to get the technique
completed because of the turn it's

2940
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:35,040
completed because of the turn it's
 

2941
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,870
completed because of the turn it's
really really hard to get completed now

2942
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:36,880
really really hard to get completed now
 

2943
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,710
really really hard to get completed now
that being said it comes off really

2944
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:38,720
that being said it comes off really
 

2945
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,510
that being said it comes off really
naturally off of if you're doing like a

2946
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:41,520
naturally off of if you're doing like a
 

2947
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,670
naturally off of if you're doing like a
an elbow bar off my shoulder right and

2948
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:43,680
an elbow bar off my shoulder right and
 

2949
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,030
an elbow bar off my shoulder right and
they're pulling their arm back it'll

2950
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:45,040
they're pulling their arm back it'll
 

2951
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,950
they're pulling their arm back it'll
come off fairly naturally and then the

2952
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:46,960
come off fairly naturally and then the
 

2953
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,589
come off fairly naturally and then the
setups where i don't have to turn it

2954
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:49,599
setups where i don't have to turn it
 

2955
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,430
setups where i don't have to turn it
comes up right so people's hands will be

2956
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:51,440
comes up right so people's hands will be
 

2957
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,790
comes up right so people's hands will be
high or whatever and you can kind of get

2958
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:52,800
high or whatever and you can kind of get
 

2959
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,470
high or whatever and you can kind of get
a hold of it it'll work for sport

2960
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
a hold of it it'll work for sport
 

2961
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,230
a hold of it it'll work for sport
martial arts it sucks you know like i

2962
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:56,240
martial arts it sucks you know like i
 

2963
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,230
martial arts it sucks you know like i
would give it an f um in self defense it

2964
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:58,240
would give it an f um in self defense it
 

2965
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,430
would give it an f um in self defense it
comes up fairly often because we're

2966
00:49:59,430 --> 00:49:59,440
comes up fairly often because we're
 

2967
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,950
comes up fairly often because we're
struggling over the weapon and it's got

2968
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:00,960
struggling over the weapon and it's got
 

2969
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,470
struggling over the weapon and it's got
that little tiny area that we're

2970
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:02,480
that little tiny area that we're
 

2971
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,470
that little tiny area that we're
focusing on like this and so if i'm

2972
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:04,480
focusing on like this and so if i'm
 

2973
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,309
focusing on like this and so if i'm
turning to wrench the weapon free and

2974
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:06,319
turning to wrench the weapon free and
 

2975
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:07,829
turning to wrench the weapon free and
they're just trying to stay with me they

2976
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:07,839
they're just trying to stay with me they
 

2977
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,670
they're just trying to stay with me they
might give that to me and then i would

2978
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:09,680
might give that to me and then i would
 

2979
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,910
might give that to me and then i would
get the [\h__\h] so um it's not it's it's a

2980
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:13,920
get the [\h__\h] so um it's not it's it's a
 

2981
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,750
get the [\h__\h] so um it's not it's it's a
nice technique in the aikido syllabus i

2982
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:15,760
nice technique in the aikido syllabus i
 

2983
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,510
nice technique in the aikido syllabus i
see naturally why it arises and if you

2984
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:17,520
see naturally why it arises and if you
 

2985
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,870
see naturally why it arises and if you
look at it as a clearing technique and

2986
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:18,880
look at it as a clearing technique and
 

2987
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,710
look at it as a clearing technique and
not as a throwing technique which you

2988
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:20,720
not as a throwing technique which you
 

2989
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,950
not as a throwing technique which you
shouldn't because it's called nage um

2990
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:22,960
shouldn't because it's called nage um
 

2991
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,309
shouldn't because it's called nage um
but but if you look at it as a clearing

2992
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
but but if you look at it as a clearing
 

2993
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,910
but but if you look at it as a clearing
technique it's much more useful most of

2994
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:25,920
technique it's much more useful most of
 

2995
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,829
technique it's much more useful most of
the time when i go into a shionage

2996
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:27,839
the time when i go into a shionage
 

2997
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,910
the time when i go into a shionage
people just let go of me and that's how

2998
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:29,920
people just let go of me and that's how
 

2999
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,750
people just let go of me and that's how
it's useful to me not that they go for

3000
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:31,760
it's useful to me not that they go for
 

3001
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,510
it's useful to me not that they go for
the full ride and take a big fall or

3002
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:33,520
the full ride and take a big fall or
 

3003
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,349
the full ride and take a big fall or
anything um so

3004
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:35,359
anything um so
 

3005
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,030
anything um so
it's it's functional i would probably

3006
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:37,040
it's it's functional i would probably
 

3007
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,309
it's it's functional i would probably
put it c or d um i don't think c is bad

3008
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:40,319
put it c or d um i don't think c is bad
 

3009
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,470
put it c or d um i don't think c is bad
but um you know i would say for myself

3010
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:42,480
but um you know i would say for myself
 

3011
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,630
but um you know i would say for myself
how often it comes off is more in the d

3012
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:44,640
how often it comes off is more in the d
 

3013
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,750
how often it comes off is more in the d
category not super often okay so i guess

3014
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:47,760
category not super often okay so i guess
 

3015
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,230
category not super often okay so i guess
a d would be like more or less the final

3016
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:50,240
a d would be like more or less the final
 

3017
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,190
a d would be like more or less the final
one

3018
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:51,200
one
 

3019
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,829
one
looking at the whole

3020
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:52,839
looking at the whole
 

3021
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,910
looking at the whole
table uh okay now this one is i'm i'm

3022
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:55,920
table uh okay now this one is i'm i'm
 

3023
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,910
table uh okay now this one is i'm i'm
really curious uh what you're going to

3024
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:57,920
really curious uh what you're going to
 

3025
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,670
really curious uh what you're going to
say tenchnage

3026
00:50:59,670 --> 00:50:59,680
say tenchnage
 

3027
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,109
say tenchnage
and

3028
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:01,119
and
 

3029
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,870
and
you know there's some similarities

3030
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:02,880
you know there's some similarities
 

3031
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,829
you know there's some similarities
between it and irimina i guess the whole

3032
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:05,839
between it and irimina i guess the whole
 

3033
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,670
between it and irimina i guess the whole
entering it's just you're not entering

3034
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:07,680
entering it's just you're not entering
 

3035
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,950
entering it's just you're not entering
on the outside i guess you're entering

3036
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:08,960
on the outside i guess you're entering
 

3037
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,030
on the outside i guess you're entering
more in the inside as far as i remember

3038
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,040
more in the inside as far as i remember
 

3039
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,670
more in the inside as far as i remember
it's been a little while since i tried

3040
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:13,680
it's been a little while since i tried
 

3041
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,790
it's been a little while since i tried
it uh but there's also if i'm looking at

3042
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:16,800
it uh but there's also if i'm looking at
 

3043
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,990
it uh but there's also if i'm looking at
the essential setup for tension i get

3044
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:20,000
the essential setup for tension i get
 

3045
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,710
the essential setup for tension i get
there's the holding of the arm

3046
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:22,720
there's the holding of the arm
 

3047
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,230
there's the holding of the arm
you know the person is holding you and

3048
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:24,240
you know the person is holding you and
 

3049
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,510
you know the person is holding you and
you're doing the cut down to unbalance

3050
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:27,520
you're doing the cut down to unbalance
 

3051
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,549
you're doing the cut down to unbalance
no

3052
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:28,559
no
 

3053
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,230

questions asked why the person is still

3054
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:30,240
questions asked why the person is still
 

3055
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,750
questions asked why the person is still
holding on to you

3056
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:31,760
holding on to you
 

3057
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,829
holding on to you
uh so that part is

3058
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:33,839
uh so that part is
 

3059
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,750
uh so that part is
puzzling and if i make it into an

3060
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:35,760
puzzling and if i make it into an
 

3061
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,390
puzzling and if i make it into an
integral part of tension again that

3062
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:38,400
integral part of tension again that
 

3063
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,390
integral part of tension again that
first that there is that cut

3064
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:40,400
first that there is that cut
 

3065
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,630
first that there is that cut
i mean that's the earth element

3066
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:42,640
i mean that's the earth element
 

3067
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,069
i mean that's the earth element
and then the top

3068
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:44,079
and then the top
 

3069
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,069
and then the top
that makes me very skeptical i don't

3070
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:46,079
that makes me very skeptical i don't
 

3071
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,630
that makes me very skeptical i don't
know how to make it functional if we're

3072
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:48,640
know how to make it functional if we're
 

3073
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,270
know how to make it functional if we're
just looking at the top part

3074
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:51,280
just looking at the top part
 

3075
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,589
just looking at the top part
or maybe holding i'm again i'm just

3076
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:53,599
or maybe holding i'm again i'm just
 

3077
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,510
or maybe holding i'm again i'm just

maybe but i have a lot of doubts so

3084
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:02,400
maybe but i have a lot of doubts so
 

3085
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,109
maybe but i have a lot of doubts so
i'll guess i'll i'll go for an e just to

00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:05,119
i'll guess i'll i'll go for an e just to
 

3087
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,790
i'll guess i'll i'll go for an e just to
justify my doubts

3088
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:06,800
justify my doubts
 

3089
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,390
justify my doubts

switch and they grab the other hand so

3110
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:28,960
switch and they grab the other hand so
 

3111
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,710
switch and they grab the other hand so
you get real thing and then in that

3112

hand grappling over something happens

3142
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:01,280
hand grappling over something happens
 

3143
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,750
hand grappling over something happens
fairly often right because any time uh

3144
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:03,760
fairly often right because any time uh
 

3145
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,109
fairly often right because any time uh
you know if you do any training with

3146
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:05,119
you know if you do any training with
 

3147
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,030
you know if you do any training with
with weapons you'll see that the second

3148
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:07,040
with weapons you'll see that the second
 

3149
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,390
with weapons you'll see that the second
you grab someone's hand the first thing

3150
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:08,400
you grab someone's hand the first thing
 

3151
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,589
you grab someone's hand the first thing
they want to do is put it in their other

3152
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:09,599
they want to do is put it in their other
 

3153
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,670
they want to do is put it in their other
hand and so that leads to a lot of

3154
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:11,680
hand and so that leads to a lot of
 

3155
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,829
hand and so that leads to a lot of
realtory situations right so you're

3156
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:13,839
realtory situations right so you're
 

3157
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,750
realtory situations right so you're
either going to go switch topic or

3158
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:15,760
either going to go switch topic or
 

3159
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,190
either going to go switch topic or
they're going to go

3160
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,200
they're going to go
 

3161
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,270
they're going to go
and so you see it all the time

3162
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:19,280
and so you see it all the time
 

3163
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,829
and so you see it all the time
and and so the principle of tinchinage

3164
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:21,839
and and so the principle of tinchinage
 

3165
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,030
and and so the principle of tinchinage
which is the high-low principle you're

3166
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,040
which is the high-low principle you're
 

3167
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,710
which is the high-low principle you're
talking about it works really well

3168
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:24,720
talking about it works really well
 

3169
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,950
talking about it works really well
because it splits their body and people

3170
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:26,960
because it splits their body and people
 

3171
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,309
because it splits their body and people
don't like that so they want to let go

3172
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:28,319
don't like that so they want to let go
 

3173
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,670
don't like that so they want to let go
of one and that puts you in a more

3174
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:29,680
of one and that puts you in a more
 

3175
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,109
of one and that puts you in a more
autonomous position so it's good for

3176
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:31,119
autonomous position so it's good for
 

3177
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,870
autonomous position so it's good for
that so the principle's great and

3178
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:32,880
that so the principle's great and
 

3179
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,630
that so the principle's great and
talking about it that way is is fine and

3180
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:34,640
talking about it that way is is fine and
 

3181
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,750
talking about it that way is is fine and
if you're talking about arm grappling

3182
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:35,760
if you're talking about arm grappling
 

3183
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,349
if you're talking about arm grappling
it's a good thing to talk about but for

3184
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:37,359
it's a good thing to talk about but for
 

3185
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,030
it's a good thing to talk about but for
sport martial arts it's an f and i would

3186
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:39,040
sport martial arts it's an f and i would
 

3187
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,870
sport martial arts it's an f and i would
say in the aikido

3188
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:40,880
say in the aikido
 

3189
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,109
say in the aikido
how often do i get it very very seldomly

3190
00:53:43,109 --> 00:53:43,119
how often do i get it very very seldomly
 

3191
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,109
how often do i get it very very seldomly
so it's in the in the cd category you

3192
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:45,119
so it's in the in the cd category you
 

3193
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,510
so it's in the in the cd category you
know so um where did you put it at c

3194
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:47,520
know so um where did you put it at c
 

3195
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,430
know so um where did you put it at c
i i was an f because i sorry i wasn't an

3196
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:49,440
i i was an f because i sorry i wasn't an
 

3197
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,510
i i was an f because i sorry i wasn't an
e because i was very skeptical uh oh

3198
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:51,520
e because i was very skeptical uh oh
 

3199
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,589
e because i was very skeptical uh oh
yeah yeah i mean it's it's not that

3200
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:53,599
yeah yeah i mean it's it's not that
 

3201
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,750
yeah yeah i mean it's it's not that
functional you could leave it at e okay

3202
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:55,760
functional you could leave it at e okay
 

3203
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,710
functional you could leave it at e okay
no not nice that'll make it more uh

3204
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:58,720
no not nice that'll make it more uh
 

3205
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,470
no not nice that'll make it more uh
uniform your chart looks happier for you

3206
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:00,480
uniform your chart looks happier for you
 

3207
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,030
uniform your chart looks happier for you
right yeah exactly it looks better now

3208
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,040
right yeah exactly it looks better now
 

3209
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,190
right yeah exactly it looks better now
okay cool that's interesting

3210
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:05,200
okay cool that's interesting
 

3211
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,230
okay cool that's interesting
so

3212
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:06,240
so
 

3213
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,069
so
quick reflections it's every time it's

3214
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:08,079
quick reflections it's every time it's
 

3215
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,990
quick reflections it's every time it's
interesting how you do find those

3216
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,000
interesting how you do find those
 

3217
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,589
interesting how you do find those
principles because you know a lot of

3218
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:11,599
principles because you know a lot of
 

3219
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,349
principles because you know a lot of
people that's what they talk about

3220
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:13,359
people that's what they talk about
 

3221
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,270
people that's what they talk about
especially like people who want

3222
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:15,280
especially like people who want
 

3223

to
to to kind of

3226

to to kind of
 

3227
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,069
to to kind of
shed good light on aikido

3228
00:54:20,069 --> 00:54:20,079
shed good light on aikido

a lot of times the talk goes to aikido

3230
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,240
a lot of times the talk goes to aikido
 

3231
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,910
a lot of times the talk goes to aikido
is about principle it's it's not about

3232
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:23,920
is about principle it's it's not about
 

3233
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,990
is about principle it's it's not about
the techniques and i was kind of looking

3234
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:26,000
the techniques and i was kind of looking
 

3235
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,230
the techniques and i was kind of looking
into it and i have some of my ideas what

3236
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:28,240
into it and i have some of my ideas what
 

3237
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,790
into it and i have some of my ideas what
that could be but it seems you really uh

3238
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:30,800
that could be but it seems you really uh
 

3239
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,030
that could be but it seems you really uh
dove deep into that and you really like

3240
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:33,040
dove deep into that and you really like
 

3241
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,069
dove deep into that and you really like
uh clarified and kind of discovered

3242
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:36,079
uh clarified and kind of discovered
 

3243
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,589
uh clarified and kind of discovered
those principles

3244
00:54:37,589 --> 00:54:37,599
those principles
 

3245
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,470
those principles
beyond the techniques uh so so that

3246
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:40,480
beyond the techniques uh so so that
 

3247
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,829
beyond the techniques uh so so that
that's really cool

3248
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:43,839

 

3249
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,670

okay so uh

3250
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:45,680
okay so uh
 

3251
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,190
okay so uh
next one is

3252
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:47,200
next one is
 

3253
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,750
next one is
i believe this is sumi otoshi

3254
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:49,760
i believe this is sumi otoshi
 

3255
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,270
i believe this is sumi otoshi
uh okay which

3256
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:51,280
uh okay which
 

3257
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,549
uh okay which
i i kind of deliberately put it in there

3258
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:54,559
i i kind of deliberately put it in there
 

3259
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:55,589
i i kind of deliberately put it in there
because

3260
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:55,599
because
 

3261
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,309
because
it also exists in judo

3262
00:54:58,309 --> 00:54:58,319
it also exists in judo
 

3263
00:54:58,319 --> 00:54:59,270
it also exists in judo
yeah

3264
00:54:59,270 --> 00:54:59,280
yeah
 

3265
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,309
yeah
and

3266
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:00,319
and
 

3267
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,870
and
i guess again combat sports

3268
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:02,880
i guess again combat sports
 

3269
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,109
i guess again combat sports
if a person has a good base

judo they have to make it work because

3286
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:21,440
judo they have to make it work because
 

3287
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,030
judo they have to make it work because
they're so competitive and and there's

3288
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:23,040
they're so competitive and and there's
 

3289
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,870
they're so competitive and and there's
so much resistance there

3290
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:24,880
so much resistance there
 

3291
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,069
so much resistance there
so

3292
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:26,079
so
 

3293

know for some people that works out
 

3309
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,150
know for some people that works out
really well my game if you look at sport

3310
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:44,160
really well my game if you look at sport
 

3311
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,750
really well my game if you look at sport
martial arts never was about that my

3312
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:45,760
martial arts never was about that my
 

3313
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,670
martial arts never was about that my
game was always about core control so

3314
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:47,680
game was always about core control so
 

3315
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,670
game was always about core control so

with the exception of maybe like a

3324
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:57,599
with the exception of maybe like a
 

3325
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,990
with the exception of maybe like a
shionage or sorry a sayonagi or

3326
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:00,000
shionage or sorry a sayonagi or
 

3327
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,670
shionage or sorry a sayonagi or
something um and that's just because i'm

3328
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:01,680
something um and that's just because i'm
 

3329
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,670
something um and that's just because i'm
going from an arm to get the body behind

3330
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:03,680
going from an arm to get the body behind
 

3331
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,789
going from an arm to get the body behind
me um so so for me i really never got it

3332
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:06,799
me um so so for me i really never got it
 

3333
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,390
me um so so for me i really never got it
a whole lot i get it sometimes when

3334
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:08,400
a whole lot i get it sometimes when
 

3335
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,870
a whole lot i get it sometimes when
we're messing around um uh and i see the

3336
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:10,880
we're messing around um uh and i see the
 

3337
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,030
we're messing around um uh and i see the
functionality of why it can come up

3338
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:13,040
functionality of why it can come up
 

3339
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,349
functionality of why it can come up
especially in an arm situation in an um

3340
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:15,359
especially in an arm situation in an um
 

3341
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,630
especially in an arm situation in an um
situation not as much but like you said

3342
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:16,640
situation not as much but like you said
 

3343
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,710
situation not as much but like you said
it's in judo um i would like to see what

3344
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:18,720
it's in judo um i would like to see what
 

3345
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,870
it's in judo um i would like to see what
the um you know the competition results

3346
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:20,880
the um you know the competition results
 

3347
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,870
the um you know the competition results
are of it i bet it's fairly low

3348
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:22,880
are of it i bet it's fairly low
 

3349
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,630
are of it i bet it's fairly low
percentage compared to something like

3350
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:24,640
percentage compared to something like
 

3351
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,950
percentage compared to something like
you know sayonage or or ogos or

3352
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:26,960
you know sayonage or or ogos or
 

3353
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,549
you know sayonage or or ogos or
something you know uchimata is probably

3354
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:28,559
something you know uchimata is probably
 

3355
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,109
something you know uchimata is probably
like way up there but but you know it is

3356
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:31,119
like way up there but but you know it is
 

3357
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,109
like way up there but but you know it is
possible you can do it in its old core

3358
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:33,119
possible you can do it in its old core
 

3359
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,710
possible you can do it in its old core
old-school stuff and i think why it's

3360
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:34,720
old-school stuff and i think why it's
 

3361
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,470
old-school stuff and i think why it's
still in judo is because it comes from

3362
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:36,480
still in judo is because it comes from
 

3363
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,990
still in judo is because it comes from
armed stuff and it's more likely to come

3364
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:38,000
armed stuff and it's more likely to come
 

3365
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,589
armed stuff and it's more likely to come
out in an armed situation in my

3366
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:39,599
out in an armed situation in my
 

3367
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:40,950
out in an armed situation in my
experience it looks a lot more muddled

3368
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:40,960
experience it looks a lot more muddled
 

3369
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,230
experience it looks a lot more muddled
than it usually looks in aikido it's

3370
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,240
than it usually looks in aikido it's
 

3371
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,069
than it usually looks in aikido it's
it's much more ugly technique and it

3372
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,079
it's much more ugly technique and it
 

3373
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,430
it's much more ugly technique and it
looks much more like some kind of rear

3374
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:45,440
looks much more like some kind of rear
 

3375
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,270
looks much more like some kind of rear
tripping technique or something you know

3376
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:47,280
tripping technique or something you know
 

3377
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,670
tripping technique or something you know
um so what about your score how would

3378
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:49,680
um so what about your score how would
 

3379
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,910
um so what about your score how would
you uh i don't know i'd put it in the

3380
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:51,920
you uh i don't know i'd put it in the
 

3381
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,589
you uh i don't know i'd put it in the
maybe c it's a c

3382
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:53,599
maybe c it's a c
 

3383
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:55,430
maybe c it's a c
okay see

3384
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:55,440
okay see
 

3385
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,349
okay see
nice two similar pictures next to each

3386
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:57,359
nice two similar pictures next to each
 

3387
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,870
nice two similar pictures next to each
other

3388
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:58,880
other
 

3389
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,109
other
uh and with the kimi nagi uh so that one

3390
00:57:03,109 --> 00:57:03,119
uh and with the kimi nagi uh so that one
 

3391
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,349
uh and with the kimi nagi uh so that one
for me

3392
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:05,359
for me
 

3393
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,589
for me
uh you see the the picture there

3394
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:07,599
uh you see the the picture there
 

3395
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,430
uh you see the the picture there
yeah i don't think i i can't see what it

3396
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:09,440
yeah i don't think i i can't see what it
 

3397
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:16,870
yeah i don't think i i can't see what it
is what you call it

3398
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:16,880

 

3399
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,670

i guess so so essentially

3400
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:19,680
i guess so so essentially
 

3401
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,829
i guess so so essentially
imagine somebody is giving if we're

3402
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:21,839
imagine somebody is giving if we're
 

3403
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,230
imagine somebody is giving if we're
thinking in in back in our aikido days

3404
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:24,240
thinking in in back in our aikido days
 

3405
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,470
thinking in in back in our aikido days

and i
 

3417
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,990
and i
lower the extended arm put pressure on

3418
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:40,000
lower the extended arm put pressure on
 

3419
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,349
lower the extended arm put pressure on
the elbow and turn my arm to throw that

3420
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:43,359
the elbow and turn my arm to throw that
 

3421
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,589
the elbow and turn my arm to throw that
person um

3422
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:45,599
person um
 

3423
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,470
person um
yeah okay got it okay good i'm happy the

3424
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:48,480
yeah okay got it okay good i'm happy the
 

3425
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,910
yeah okay got it okay good i'm happy the
the my

3426
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:49,920
the my
 

3427
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,750
the my
explanation

3428
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:51,760
explanation
 

3429
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,270
explanation
worked out and

3430
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:53,280
worked out and
 

3431
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,430
worked out and
made the connections so so yeah i was

3432
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:55,440
made the connections so so yeah i was
 

3433
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,750
made the connections so so yeah i was
introduced to it as in the kimi nagi

3434
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:57,760
introduced to it as in the kimi nagi
 

3435
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,670
introduced to it as in the kimi nagi
uh and

3436
00:57:59,670 --> 00:57:59,680
uh and
 

3437
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,309
uh and
yeah again i can see some ideas how that

3438
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:02,319
yeah again i can see some ideas how that
 

3439
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,150
yeah again i can see some ideas how that
could work as always the question is how

3440
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:04,160
could work as always the question is how
 

3441
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,309
could work as always the question is how
you get there maybe

3442
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:06,319
you get there maybe
 

3443
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:08,549
you get there maybe
uh two on one

3444
00:58:08,549 --> 00:58:08,559
uh two on one
 

3445
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,470
uh two on one
arm drag

3446
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:10,480
arm drag
 

3447
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,870
arm drag
get in there maybe extending the arm

3448
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:12,880
get in there maybe extending the arm
 

3449
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,750
get in there maybe extending the arm
could be hard but yeah i think i can see

3450
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:15,760
could be hard but yeah i think i can see
 

3451
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,990
could be hard but yeah i think i can see
the the potential behind it in my mind

3452
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,000
the the potential behind it in my mind
 

3453
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,710
the the potential behind it in my mind
so i almost want to go like a ba

3454
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:20,720
so i almost want to go like a ba
 

3455
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,870
so i almost want to go like a ba
but but that's all guessing land for me

3456
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:22,880
but but that's all guessing land for me
 

3457
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,109
but but that's all guessing land for me
so so now for the truth

3458
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:25,119
so so now for the truth
 

3459
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,870
so so now for the truth
for for sport martial arts you know it's

3460
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:26,880
for for sport martial arts you know it's
 

3461
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,309
for for sport martial arts you know it's
it's high up there i mean it's it's like

3462
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:28,319
it's high up there i mean it's it's like
 

3463
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,870
it's high up there i mean it's it's like
a russian two-on-one um so i mean

3464
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
a russian two-on-one um so i mean
 

3465
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,150
a russian two-on-one um so i mean
there's there's a ton of stuff you can

3466
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:32,160
there's there's a ton of stuff you can
 

3467
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,510
there's there's a ton of stuff you can
do from that you can go into fireman's

3468
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:33,520
do from that you can go into fireman's
 

3469
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,870
do from that you can go into fireman's
from that you can go to so if you're

3470
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:34,880
from that you can go to so if you're
 

3471
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,470
from that you can go to so if you're
looking at unarmed stuff it's totally

3472
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:36,480
looking at unarmed stuff it's totally
 

3473
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,470
looking at unarmed stuff it's totally
way up there it's just two arms on one

3474
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:38,480
way up there it's just two arms on one
 

3475
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,390
way up there it's just two arms on one
held holding it tight um the way we

3476
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:40,400
held holding it tight um the way we
 

3477
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,710
held holding it tight um the way we
specifically do it is functional but you

3478
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:42,720
specifically do it is functional but you
 

3479
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,789
specifically do it is functional but you
probably won't see it resting much

3480
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:44,799
probably won't see it resting much
 

3481

3639
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,309
arts i would put it pretty low um it's d
maybe because it's functional but it's

3640
01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:36,319
maybe because it's functional but it's
 

3641
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:37,589
maybe because it's functional but it's
dangerous

3642
01:01:37,589 --> 01:01:37,599
dangerous
 

3643
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,990
dangerous
very good point yeah

3644
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:40,000
very good point yeah
 

3645
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,230
very good point yeah
and uh actually so this is the last one

3646
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:42,240
and uh actually so this is the last one
 

3647
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,789
and uh actually so this is the last one
because the next one is it just again

3648
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:44,799
because the next one is it just again
 

3649
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:46,150
because the next one is it just again
yeah i just stick here again it's like

3650
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:46,160
yeah i just stick here again it's like
 

3651
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,230
yeah i just stick here again it's like
oh he killed it just put it then

3652
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,240
oh he killed it just put it then
 

3653
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,710
oh he killed it just put it then
yeah there we go

3654
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:50,720
yeah there we go
 

3655
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,109
yeah there we go
so the cokin this is a picture of

3656
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:53,119
so the cokin this is a picture of
 

3657
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,069
so the cokin this is a picture of
kokinage and i was kind of thinking

3658
01:01:56,069 --> 01:01:56,079
kokinage and i was kind of thinking
 

3659
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,750
kokinage and i was kind of thinking
about whether to put it there or not at

3660
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:57,760
about whether to put it there or not at
 

3661
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,990
about whether to put it there or not at
all because kokinagi is

3662
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:00,000
all because kokinagi is
 

3663
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,990
all because kokinagi is
it's kind of a general term i guess

3664
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:02,000
it's kind of a general term i guess
 

3665
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,589
it's kind of a general term i guess
there's so many different variations of

3666
01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:03,599
there's so many different variations of
 

3667
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,950
there's so many different variations of
kokinage

3668
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:04,960
kokinage
 

3669
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,589
kokinage
but but all those

3670
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:07,599
but but all those
 

3671
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,549
but but all those
nice big throws from aikido

3672
01:02:10,549 --> 01:02:10,559
nice big throws from aikido
 

3673
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:11,510
nice big throws from aikido
uh

3674
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:11,520
uh
 

3675
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,349
uh
i don't know dude would would you have

3676
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:13,359
i don't know dude would would you have
 

3677
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,510
i don't know dude would would you have
like a specific place here on the tier

3678
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:15,520
like a specific place here on the tier
 

3679
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,470
like a specific place here on the tier
list

3680
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:16,480
list
 

3681
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,630
list
for kokunage or you think it's just too

3682
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:18,640
for kokunage or you think it's just too
 

3683
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,510
for kokunage or you think it's just too
obscure of what it is specifically

3684
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:21,520
obscure of what it is specifically
 

3685
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,750
obscure of what it is specifically
when we're talking about principles like

3686
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:23,760
when we're talking about principles like
 

3687
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,870
when we're talking about principles like
you know uh it is as principle as esque

3688
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:26,880
you know uh it is as principle as esque
 

3689
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,549
you know uh it is as principle as esque
as they come if you look at psychosense

3690
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:28,559
as they come if you look at psychosense
 

3691
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:29,990
as they come if you look at psychosense
he calls probably about 12 different

3692
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:30,000
he calls probably about 12 different
 

3693
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,270
he calls probably about 12 different
throws kokinagi's right um so it's it's

3694
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:33,280
throws kokinagi's right um so it's it's
 

3695
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,789
throws kokinagi's right um so it's it's
really hard to say no it's a principle

3696
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:34,799
really hard to say no it's a principle
 

3697
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:36,950
really hard to say no it's a principle
and so like like tinchinage as a

3698
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:36,960
and so like like tinchinage as a
 

3699
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,109
and so like like tinchinage as a
principle of splitting the body into

3700
01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:39,119
principle of splitting the body into
 

3701
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,829
principle of splitting the body into
tinchinagi's good as it comes off it's

3702
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:41,839
tinchinagi's good as it comes off it's
 

3703
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:44,390
tinchinagi's good as it comes off it's
not good and kokenagi is real hard to to

3704
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:44,400
not good and kokenagi is real hard to to
 

3705
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,789
not good and kokenagi is real hard to to
come into because what does it mean now

3706
01:02:46,789 --> 01:02:46,799
come into because what does it mean now
 

3707
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,870
come into because what does it mean now
i in my school have one specific thing

3708
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:48,880
i in my school have one specific thing
 

3709
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,549
i in my school have one specific thing
that i call a cookie nugget but that

3710
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:50,559
that i call a cookie nugget but that
 

3711
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,150
that i call a cookie nugget but that
doesn't match up because all aikido

3712
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:52,160
doesn't match up because all aikido
 

3713
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,230
doesn't match up because all aikido
schools use it in different ways so you

3714
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:54,240
schools use it in different ways so you
 

3715
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,750
schools use it in different ways so you
know a kokinagi is a throw that should

3716
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:55,760
know a kokinagi is a throw that should
 

3717
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,150
know a kokinagi is a throw that should
come off with natural ease and so i

3718
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:58,160
come off with natural ease and so i
 

3719
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,670
come off with natural ease and so i
think that's a great way to think about

3720
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680
think that's a great way to think about
 

3721
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,829
think that's a great way to think about
doing throws but technically what does

3722
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:01,839
doing throws but technically what does
 

3723
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:03,430
doing throws but technically what does
that mean i don't know so i don't i

3724
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:03,440
that mean i don't know so i don't i
 

3725
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,470
that mean i don't know so i don't i
don't even know where i'd put it on the

3726
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:04,480
don't even know where i'd put it on the
 

3727
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,470
don't even know where i'd put it on the
list i mean you know

3728
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:06,480
list i mean you know
 

3729
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,270
list i mean you know
a well done throw is it isn't is a s up

3730
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:09,280
a well done throw is it isn't is a s up
 

3731
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,750
a well done throw is it isn't is a s up
there for super but also like you know a

3732
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:11,760
there for super but also like you know a
 

3733
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,190
there for super but also like you know a
principle that you don't really can't

3734
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:13,200
principle that you don't really can't
 

3735
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,710
principle that you don't really can't
get your hands on especially for a new

3736
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:14,720
get your hands on especially for a new
 

3737
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,390
get your hands on especially for a new
person it's an f so

3738
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
person it's an f so
 

3739
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,309
person it's an f so
so yeah it's a hard it's a hard one to

3740
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:18,319
so yeah it's a hard it's a hard one to
 

3741
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,789
so yeah it's a hard it's a hard one to
get in true so it's a good point whether

3742
01:03:20,789 --> 01:03:20,799
get in true so it's a good point whether
 

3743
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:22,470
get in true so it's a good point whether
i was i was wondering whether i should

3744
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:22,480
i was i was wondering whether i should
 

3745
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,309
i was i was wondering whether i should
put it there as well but i i just was

3746
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:24,319
put it there as well but i i just was
 

3747
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:26,309
put it there as well but i i just was
interested about the discussion of it so

3748
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:26,319
interested about the discussion of it so
 

3749
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,950
interested about the discussion of it so
and i think you just answered my my

3750
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:28,960
and i think you just answered my my
 

3751
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,430
and i think you just answered my my
question so uh

3752
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:31,440
question so uh
 

3753
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,150
question so uh
before i start summarizing what what we

3754
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:34,160
before i start summarizing what what we
 

3755
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,109
before i start summarizing what what we
see

3756
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:35,119
see
 

3757
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,150
see
um

3758
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:36,160
um
 

3759
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,390
um
is there any technique and you know

3760
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
is there any technique and you know
 

3761
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,630
is there any technique and you know
there are those

3762
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:40,640
there are those
 

3763
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,789
there are those
various variations of aikido techniques

3764
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:42,799
various variations of aikido techniques
 

3765
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,789
various variations of aikido techniques
but in regards to those popular

3766
01:03:44,789 --> 01:03:44,799
but in regards to those popular
 

3767
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:45,829
but in regards to those popular
techniques

3768
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:45,839
techniques
 

3769
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:47,750
techniques
which most aikido schools practice is

3770
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:47,760
which most aikido schools practice is
 

3771
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,829
which most aikido schools practice is
there anything that uh you would have

3772
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:49,839
there anything that uh you would have
 

3773
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:50,870
there anything that uh you would have
put

3774
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:50,880
put
 

3775
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,430
put
that i missed out on

3776
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:53,440
that i missed out on
 

3777
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,549
that i missed out on
um probably not i mean so you know i i

3778
01:03:56,549 --> 01:03:56,559
um probably not i mean so you know i i
 

3779
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:59,190
um probably not i mean so you know i i
have a set of um uh hinko nage which

3780
01:03:59,190 --> 01:03:59,200
have a set of um uh hinko nage which
 

3781
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,349
have a set of um uh hinko nage which
means variation throws um so like

3782
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:01,359
means variation throws um so like
 

3783
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:03,910
means variation throws um so like
sayonage i teach a sayonage and i think

3784
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:03,920
sayonage i teach a sayonage and i think
 

3785
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,309
sayonage i teach a sayonage and i think
it has a place in regular aikido um and

3786
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:06,319
it has a place in regular aikido um and
 

3787
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:08,390
it has a place in regular aikido um and
i think cyanide is fantastic but it's

3788
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:08,400
i think cyanide is fantastic but it's
 

3789
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,549
i think cyanide is fantastic but it's
not seen in all aikido style so

3790
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:10,559
not seen in all aikido style so
 

3791
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:13,190
not seen in all aikido style so
i could see not putting it in there um

3792
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:13,200
i could see not putting it in there um
 

3793
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,029
i could see not putting it in there um
uh yeah i mean this is pretty

3794
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:15,039
uh yeah i mean this is pretty
 

3795
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:16,710
uh yeah i mean this is pretty
representative of i think a lot of

3796

i would only see it online
 

3827
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,430
i would only see it online
that looks pretty functional but again i

3828
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:53,440
that looks pretty functional but again i
 

3829
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,870
that looks pretty functional but again i
guess just because

3830
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:54,880
guess just because
 

3831
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,910
guess just because
i never

3832
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:55,920

um right i i don't see it in a lot of
 

3847
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,750
um right i i don't see it in a lot of
other other schools um yeah sure it's

3848
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:11,760
other other schools um yeah sure it's

functional putting your hand in

3850
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:12,640
functional putting your hand in
 

3851
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,910
functional putting your hand in
someone's face and pushing their head up

3852
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:13,920
someone's face and pushing their head up
 

3853
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,190
someone's face and pushing their head up
that's that's a functional thing you can

3854
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:15,200
that's that's a functional thing you can
 

3855
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,589
that's that's a functional thing you can
use that but but you agree that it's not

3856
01:05:17,589 --> 01:05:17,599
use that but but you agree that it's not
 

3857
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,470
use that but but you agree that it's not
like the the usual no it you know it's

3858
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:20,480
like the the usual no it you know it's
 

3859
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,990
like the the usual no it you know it's
not um you're not going to see it in a

3860
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:22,000
not um you're not going to see it in a
 

3861
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,910
not um you're not going to see it in a
whole bunch of aikido styles right and i

3862
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:23,920
whole bunch of aikido styles right and i
 

3863
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,510
whole bunch of aikido styles right and i
guess it also kind of goes a little bit

3864
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:25,520
guess it also kind of goes a little bit
 

3865
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,470
guess it also kind of goes a little bit
against

3866
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:26,480
against
 

3867
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,270
against
the

3868
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:27,280
the
 

3869
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,470
the
spirit of osensei who's who's all about

3870
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:30,480
spirit of osensei who's who's all about
 

3871
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,990

how do we make these techniques more

3872
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:32,000
how do we make these techniques more
 

3873
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,470
how do we make these techniques more
aesthetic more more peaceful more

3874
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:34,480
aesthetic more more peaceful more
 

3875
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,510
aesthetic more more peaceful more
more kind of less less violent and that

3876
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:37,520
more kind of less less violent and that
 

3877
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,670
more kind of less less violent and that
direct

3878
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:39,680
direct
 

3879
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,470
direct
i guess

3880
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:40,480
i guess
 

3881
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,710
i guess
i mean i would argue that that is way

3882
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:42,720
i mean i would argue that that is way
 

3883
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,309
i mean i would argue that that is way
less violent than cutting a guy with a

3884
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:44,319
less violent than cutting a guy with a
 

3885
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,069
less violent than cutting a guy with a
sword and yet we can find tons of videos

3886
01:05:46,069 --> 01:05:46,079
sword and yet we can find tons of videos
 

3887
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,510
sword and yet we can find tons of videos
of him practicing cutting people with

3888
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:47,520
of him practicing cutting people with
 

3889
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,950
of him practicing cutting people with
swords so right uh you know it all

3890
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:50,960
swords so right uh you know it all
 

3891
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,430
swords so right uh you know it all
depends on it's all situational you know

3892
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:53,440
depends on it's all situational you know
 

3893
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,029
depends on it's all situational you know
and so so i do believe aikido is a

3894
01:05:55,029 --> 01:05:55,039
and so so i do believe aikido is a
 

3895
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,470
and so so i do believe aikido is a
peaceful martial art in that it's

3896
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:56,480
peaceful martial art in that it's
 

3897
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,789
peaceful martial art in that it's
looking for the best resolution possible

3898
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:58,799
looking for the best resolution possible
 

3899
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,710
looking for the best resolution possible
but the best reasons possible might be

3900
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:00,720
but the best reasons possible might be
 

3901
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,549
but the best reasons possible might be
pushing someone's chin so i can get out

3902
01:06:02,549 --> 01:06:02,559
pushing someone's chin so i can get out
 

3903
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,789
pushing someone's chin so i can get out
of there you know so so it all depends

3904
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:04,799
of there you know so so it all depends
 

3905
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:06,950
of there you know so so it all depends
on on where you're at yeah yeah the

3906
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:06,960
on on where you're at yeah yeah the
 

3907
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,630
on on where you're at yeah yeah the
total question i don't want to

3908
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:08,640
total question i don't want to
 

3909
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,309
total question i don't want to
expand too far into this because this

3910
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:10,319
expand too far into this because this
 

3911
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:11,750
expand too far into this because this
could be a whole different subject but

3912
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:11,760
could be a whole different subject but
 

3913
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,430
could be a whole different subject but
but that question was always puzzling

3914
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:13,440
but that question was always puzzling
 

3915
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,589
but that question was always puzzling
for me like okay aikido is all about the

3916
01:06:15,589 --> 01:06:15,599
for me like okay aikido is all about the
 

3917
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:17,349
for me like okay aikido is all about the
art of peace but why the hell are we

3918
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:17,359
art of peace but why the hell are we
 

3919
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:18,870
art of peace but why the hell are we
cutting each other with sword and

3920
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:18,880
cutting each other with sword and
 

3921
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,630
cutting each other with sword and
stabbing each other in

3922
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:20,640
stabbing each other in
 

3923
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,589
stabbing each other in
like the ribs and etc it's like that and

3924
01:06:23,589 --> 01:06:23,599
like the ribs and etc it's like that and
 

3925
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,349
like the ribs and etc it's like that and
also to like throwing somebody with a

3926
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:25,359
also to like throwing somebody with a
 

3927
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:27,670
also to like throwing somebody with a
shihanagian concrete where's the piece

3928
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:27,680
shihanagian concrete where's the piece
 

3929
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,029
shihanagian concrete where's the piece
in that so

3930
01:06:29,029 --> 01:06:29,039
in that so
 

3931
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,470
in that so
that's a bit of a

3932
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:30,480
that's a bit of a
 

3933
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,789
that's a bit of a
complicated question i think

3934
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:32,799
complicated question i think
 

3935
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:33,589
complicated question i think
right

3936
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:33,599
right
 

3937
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,990
right
yeah i mean i think uh i think just real

3938
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:36,000
yeah i mean i think uh i think just real
 

3939
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,910
yeah i mean i think uh i think just real
quick on it i mean i think if we just

3940
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:37,920
quick on it i mean i think if we just
 

3941
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,910
quick on it i mean i think if we just
have a shift in what i'm thinking about

3942
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:39,920
have a shift in what i'm thinking about
 

3943
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,309
have a shift in what i'm thinking about
doing am i thinking about dominating the

3944
01:06:42,309 --> 01:06:42,319
doing am i thinking about dominating the
 

3945
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:43,910
doing am i thinking about dominating the
other person or am i thinking about

3946
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:43,920
other person or am i thinking about
 

3947
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,710
other person or am i thinking about
making a peaceful environment in the end

3948
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:46,720
making a peaceful environment in the end
 

3949
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,470
making a peaceful environment in the end
right now how we get there

3950
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:48,480
right now how we get there
 

3951
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,470
right now how we get there
could involve all kinds of things but if

3952
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:50,480
could involve all kinds of things but if
 

3953
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,069
could involve all kinds of things but if
my goal is just to beat someone up you

3954
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:52,079
my goal is just to beat someone up you
 

3955
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,829
my goal is just to beat someone up you

so looking at

3974
01:07:11,029 --> 01:07:11,039
so looking at
 

3975
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,109
so looking at
what we see here uh what comes up to

3976
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:13,119
what we see here uh what comes up to
 

3977

realized and wanna
 

3983
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,390
realized and wanna
uh say that on record that that you know

3984
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:20,400
uh say that on record that that you know
 

3985
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,230
uh say that on record that that you know
there's these as you said like these

3986
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:22,240
there's these as you said like these
 

3987
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,670
there's these as you said like these
could be two different lists self

3988
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:23,680
could be two different lists self
 

3989
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,430
could be two different lists self
defense combat sports but if we're

3990
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:25,440
defense combat sports but if we're
 

3991
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,950
defense combat sports but if we're
looking at the average

3992
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:26,960
looking at the average
 

3993
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,029
looking at the average
potential of keto techniques to be

3994
01:07:29,029 --> 01:07:29,039
potential of keto techniques to be
 

3995
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,029
potential of keto techniques to be
functional or keto principles behind the

3996
01:07:31,029 --> 01:07:31,039
functional or keto principles behind the
 

3997
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:32,789
functional or keto principles behind the
techniques uh is this first of all is

3998
01:07:32,789 --> 01:07:32,799
techniques uh is this first of all is
 

3999
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:33,990
techniques uh is this first of all is
this what you were more or less

4000
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,000
this what you were more or less
 

4001
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,870
this what you were more or less
expecting to see

4002
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:36,880

 

4003
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,670

yeah i mean i i don't know i mean

4004
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:39,680
yeah i mean i i don't know i mean
 

4005
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,150
yeah i mean i i don't know i mean
i i'm not trying to be a bummer here but

4006
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:42,160
i i'm not trying to be a bummer here but
 

4007
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,870
i i'm not trying to be a bummer here but
like it's really hard for me to see past

4008
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:44,880
like it's really hard for me to see past
 

4009
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,789
like it's really hard for me to see past
the contextual arguments right and so

4010
01:07:46,789 --> 01:07:46,799
the contextual arguments right and so
 

4011
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:49,270
the contextual arguments right and so
like you know if if we were looking just

4012
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:49,280
like you know if if we were looking just
 

4013
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,029
like you know if if we were looking just
at sport martial arts this should

4014
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:51,039
at sport martial arts this should
 

4015
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,589
at sport martial arts this should
probably all be significantly lower um

4016
01:07:53,589 --> 01:07:53,599
probably all be significantly lower um
 

4017
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:55,190
probably all be significantly lower um
but when you you asked me about it it

4018
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:55,200
but when you you asked me about it it
 

4019
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,230
but when you you asked me about it it
was like oh let's talk about it for

4020
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:56,240
was like oh let's talk about it for
 

4021
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,910
was like oh let's talk about it for
self-defense and different things so and

4022
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:57,920
self-defense and different things so and
 

4023
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,230
self-defense and different things so and
it's like for self-defense a fair amount

4024
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:00,240
it's like for self-defense a fair amount
 

4025
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,069
it's like for self-defense a fair amount
of these might need to be higher for

4026
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:02,079
of these might need to be higher for
 

4027
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:03,910
of these might need to be higher for
armed grappling which is somewhere kind

4028
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:03,920
armed grappling which is somewhere kind
 

4029
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,990
armed grappling which is somewhere kind
of in between those ideas a lot of these

4030
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:06,000
of in between those ideas a lot of these
 

4031
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,910
of in between those ideas a lot of these
ideas would be higher you know so it

4032
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:07,920
ideas would be higher you know so it
 

4033
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,309
ideas would be higher you know so it
really kind of depends on on the context

4034
01:08:10,309 --> 01:08:10,319
really kind of depends on on the context
 

4035
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,150
really kind of depends on on the context
that you're looking at it um you know

4036
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:12,160
that you're looking at it um you know
 

4037
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,910
that you're looking at it um you know
for sport martial arts i gave a bunch of

4038
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:13,920
for sport martial arts i gave a bunch of
 

4039
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,670
for sport martial arts i gave a bunch of
these things f's i was like well i just

4040
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:15,680
these things f's i was like well i just
 

4041
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,510
these things f's i was like well i just
i just don't think that's useful at all

4042
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:17,520
i just don't think that's useful at all
 

4043
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,870
i just don't think that's useful at all
and that was my experience doing sport

4044
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:18,880
and that was my experience doing sport
 

4045
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,910
and that was my experience doing sport
martial arts and that's why the first

4046
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:19,920
martial arts and that's why the first
 

4047
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,349
martial arts and that's why the first
two years of doing sport martial arts i

4048
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:21,359
two years of doing sport martial arts i
 

4049
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,189
two years of doing sport martial arts i
was like aikido doesn't work most these

4050
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:23,199
was like aikido doesn't work most these
 

4051
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,829
was like aikido doesn't work most these
techniques are apps but when i start to

4052
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839
techniques are apps but when i start to
 

4053
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:26,789
techniques are apps but when i start to
understand

4054
01:08:26,789 --> 01:08:26,799
understand
 

4055
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:28,630
understand
different contexts then it's like oh

4056
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:28,640
different contexts then it's like oh
 

4057
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,309
different contexts then it's like oh
well with another context this actually

4058
01:08:30,309 --> 01:08:30,319
well with another context this actually
 

4059
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:31,829
well with another context this actually
makes a lot of sense whereas something

4060
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:31,839
makes a lot of sense whereas something
 

4061
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,510
makes a lot of sense whereas something
like you know a double leg takedown and

4062
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:33,520
like you know a double leg takedown and
 

4063
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,510
like you know a double leg takedown and
a self-defense situation in my opinion

4064
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:35,520
a self-defense situation in my opinion
 

4065
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,189
a self-defense situation in my opinion
is an f and you might say well you're

4066
01:08:37,189 --> 01:08:37,199
is an f and you might say well you're
 

4067
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:38,390
is an f and you might say well you're
going to be successful in taking them

4068
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:38,400
going to be successful in taking them
 

4069
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,149
going to be successful in taking them
down yeah but getting stabbed and

4070
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:40,159
down yeah but getting stabbed and
 

4071
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:41,430
down yeah but getting stabbed and
getting hurt and putting yourself in a

4072
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:41,440
getting hurt and putting yourself in a
 

4073
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,910
getting hurt and putting yourself in a
bad position that's all highly likely to

4074
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:43,920
bad position that's all highly likely to
 

4075
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,349
bad position that's all highly likely to
so you know it really depends on the

4076
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:45,359
so you know it really depends on the
 

4077
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,149
so you know it really depends on the
context you're looking at things right

4078
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:48,159
context you're looking at things right
 

4079
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:49,430
context you're looking at things right
since you mentioned that would you be

4080
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:49,440
since you mentioned that would you be
 

4081
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,390
since you mentioned that would you be
okay with playing this quick let's call

4082
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:52,400
okay with playing this quick let's call
 

4083
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,789
okay with playing this quick let's call
game and uh just

4084
01:08:54,789 --> 01:08:54,799
game and uh just
 

4085
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:55,910
game and uh just
naming

4086
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:55,920
naming
 

4087
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,829
naming
if we do what exactly what you said like

4088
01:08:57,829 --> 01:08:57,839
if we do what exactly what you said like
 

4089
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,309
if we do what exactly what you said like
we'd go for combat sports

4090
01:09:00,309 --> 01:09:00,319
we'd go for combat sports
 

4091
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:02,630
we'd go for combat sports
and then self defense and you just name

4092
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:02,640
and then self defense and you just name
 

4093
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,470
and then self defense and you just name
letters like i tell you names and you

4094
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:04,480
letters like i tell you names and you
 

4095

letters like i tell you names and you
just name letters with

4096
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:06,560
just name letters with
 

4097
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,149
just name letters with
would you be up for it

01:09:10,709 --> 01:09:10,719
what what exactly are the rules of this
 

4103
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:13,030
what what exactly are the rules of this
game yeah okay so so let's say we start

4104
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:13,040
game yeah okay so so let's say we start
 

4105
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,950
game yeah okay so so let's say we start
with combat sports

4106
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:14,960
with combat sports
 

4107
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,990
with combat sports

4109
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,070
and i say without too much elaborating
just i'm curious to see how it will lay

4110
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:20,080
just i'm curious to see how it will lay
 

4111
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,669
just i'm curious to see how it will lay
out okay okay gotcha you're going to

4112
01:09:21,669 --> 01:09:21,679
out okay okay gotcha you're going to
 

4113
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,510
out okay okay gotcha you're going to

i like that
uh

4196
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:06,480
uh
 

4197
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,830
uh
uh

4198
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:07,840

4199
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,590
uh
e

4200
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:09,600
e
 

4201
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:20,550
e
hmm

4202
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:20,560

 

4203
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,990

i think that's it

4204
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:22,000
i think that's it
 

4205
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,550
i think that's it
right we went yeah i think that's uh

4206
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:24,560
right we went yeah i think that's uh
 

4207
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,149
right we went yeah i think that's uh
yeah i think we got them all yeah okay

4208
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:26,159
yeah i think we got them all yeah okay
 

4209
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:27,990
yeah i think we got them all yeah okay
um so that's what i would that's exactly

4210
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:28,000
um so that's what i would that's exactly
 

4211
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,430
um so that's what i would that's exactly
what i would expect in sport martial

4212
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:29,440
what i would expect in sport martial
 

4213
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,350
what i would expect in sport martial
arts you know like it's just those

4214
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:31,360
arts you know like it's just those
 

4215
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,189
arts you know like it's just those
techniques are not very useful for it so

4216
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:33,199
techniques are not very useful for it so
 

4217
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:34,310
techniques are not very useful for it so
okay so

4218
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:34,320
okay so
 

4219
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,310
okay so
combat sports and and that's where a

4220
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:36,320
combat sports and and that's where a
 

4221
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,229
combat sports and and that's where a
reflection suddenly comes to me

4222
01:11:38,229 --> 01:11:38,239
reflection suddenly comes to me
 

4223
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,350
reflection suddenly comes to me
is

4224
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:39,360
is
 

4225
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,870
is
maybe that's that's how i kind of saw

4226
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:42,880
maybe that's that's how i kind of saw
 

4227
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,110
maybe that's that's how i kind of saw
i i have to admit like i do investigate

4228
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:45,120
i i have to admit like i do investigate
 

4229
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,470
i i have to admit like i do investigate
and put a lot of thought into like what

4230
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:46,480
and put a lot of thought into like what
 

4231
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,950
and put a lot of thought into like what
cell defense is but usually when i

4232
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:48,960
cell defense is but usually when i
 

4233
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,470
cell defense is but usually when i
really care about self defense i go into

4234
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:52,480
really care about self defense i go into
 

4235
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,270
really care about self defense i go into
avoidance you know just deterrence the

4236
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:55,280
avoidance you know just deterrence the
 

4237
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,229
avoidance you know just deterrence the
the whole aspect of noticing conflict

4238
01:11:58,229 --> 01:11:58,239
the whole aspect of noticing conflict
 

4239
01:11:58,239 --> 01:11:59,910
the whole aspect of noticing conflict
before it happens avoiding the wrong

4240
01:11:59,910 --> 01:11:59,920
before it happens avoiding the wrong
 

4241
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,470
before it happens avoiding the wrong
places and then obviously having some

4242
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:02,480
places and then obviously having some
 

4243
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,310
places and then obviously having some
skills with where combat sports would

4244
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:04,320
skills with where combat sports would
 

4245
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,910
skills with where combat sports would
likely be useful

4246
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:05,920
likely be useful
 

4247
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,790
likely be useful
but i don't think about techniques as

4248
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:08,800
but i don't think about techniques as
 

4249
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,709
but i don't think about techniques as
much when i think about cell defense and

4250
01:12:10,709 --> 01:12:10,719
much when i think about cell defense and
 

4251
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:12,950
much when i think about cell defense and
so when i think about aikido i think my

4252
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:12,960
so when i think about aikido i think my
 

4253
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,790
so when i think about aikido i think my
mind was probably always more like okay

4254
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:14,800
mind was probably always more like okay
 

4255
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,229
mind was probably always more like okay
so how does this work in jiu jitsu how

4256
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:16,239
so how does this work in jiu jitsu how
 

4257
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:17,910
so how does this work in jiu jitsu how
does this work in boxing and et cetera

4258
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:17,920
does this work in boxing and et cetera
 

4259
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,910
does this work in boxing and et cetera
and and you had you said this great

4260
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:19,920
and and you had you said this great
 

4261
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,870
and and you had you said this great
thought

4262
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:20,880
thought
 

4263
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,350
thought
that it is to some degree a valid

4264
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:23,360
that it is to some degree a valid
 

4265
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,870
that it is to some degree a valid
uh viable

4266
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:24,880
uh viable
 

4267
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,870
uh viable
thought process because if i can use

4268
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:26,880
thought process because if i can use
 

4269
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,709
thought process because if i can use
this on a high level guy

4270
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:28,719
this on a high level guy
 

4271
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,110
this on a high level guy
then it means it's legit

4272
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:31,120
then it means it's legit
 

4273
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,030
then it means it's legit
but but that's also flawed because i

4274
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,040
but but that's also flawed because i
 

4275
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,550
but but that's also flawed because i
wasn't considering

4276
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:34,560
wasn't considering
 

4277
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,510
wasn't considering
random untrained people uh and i wasn't

4278
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:37,520
random untrained people uh and i wasn't
 

4279
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,110
random untrained people uh and i wasn't
considering so much about

4280
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:39,120
considering so much about
 

4281
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,350
considering so much about
aikido in relationship to

4282
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:41,360
aikido in relationship to

and
street occurrences so so that's probably

4288
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:46,800
street occurrences so so that's probably
 

4289

street occurrences so so that's probably
how

4290
01:12:47,669 --> 01:12:47,679

01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:24,480
people without even understanding it
 

4329
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,550
people without even understanding it
they're asking about one context which

4330
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:26,560
they're asking about one context which
 

4331
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,229
they're asking about one context which
is basically the context that's answered

4332
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:28,239
is basically the context that's answered
 

4333
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,070

guy like joe rogan's like you know joe
rogan had made some comment not too long

4338
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:34,080
rogan had made some comment not too long
 

4339
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,910
rogan had made some comment not too long
ago that was like you know oh we've made

more advances in martial arts in the

4342
01:13:38,229 --> 01:13:38,239
more advances in martial arts in the
 

4343
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:39,990
more advances in martial arts in the
last 20 years than we had in the last

4344
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:40,000
last 20 years than we had in the last
 

4345
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,470
last 20 years than we had in the last
2000 and i was like joe do you realize

4346
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:42,480
2000 and i was like joe do you realize
 

4347
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,790
2000 and i was like joe do you realize
we invented the chariot in that time we

4348
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:44,800
we invented the chariot in that time we
 

4349
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,790
we invented the chariot in that time we
invented ballista in that time when you

4350
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:46,800
invented ballista in that time when you
 

4351
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,630
invented ballista in that time when you
know like he's not thinking contextually

4352
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:48,640
know like he's not thinking contextually
 

4353
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,830
know like he's not thinking contextually
and i think most people are doing that

4354
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:49,840
and i think most people are doing that
 

4355
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,510
and i think most people are doing that
where they're thinking oh martial arts

4356
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:51,520
where they're thinking oh martial arts
 

4357
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,189
where they're thinking oh martial arts
are about a one-on-one fight where i

4358
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:53,199
are about a one-on-one fight where i
 

4359
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,189
are about a one-on-one fight where i
prove to someone that i'm a tough guy

4360
01:13:55,189 --> 01:13:55,199
prove to someone that i'm a tough guy
 

4361
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,110
prove to someone that i'm a tough guy
and for some people that is all that

4362
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:57,120
and for some people that is all that
 

4363
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,149
and for some people that is all that
martial arts is and there's nothing

4364
01:13:58,149 --> 01:13:58,159
martial arts is and there's nothing
 

4365
01:13:58,159 --> 01:13:58,870
martial arts is and there's nothing
wrong with it because that was

4366
01:13:58,870 --> 01:13:58,880
wrong with it because that was
 

4367
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,709
wrong with it because that was
definitely me at one point in my life um

4368
01:14:00,709 --> 01:14:00,719
definitely me at one point in my life um
 

4369
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:01,990
definitely me at one point in my life um
but then there's other contexts to

4370
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:02,000
but then there's other contexts to
 

4371
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,070
but then there's other contexts to
consider as well right so you know if if

4372
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,080
consider as well right so you know if if
 

4373
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,669
consider as well right so you know if if
we were going to go fight in a

4374
01:14:05,669 --> 01:14:05,679
we were going to go fight in a
 

4375
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:07,350
we were going to go fight in a
battlefield somewhere um we're not going

4376
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,360
battlefield somewhere um we're not going
 

4377
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,350
battlefield somewhere um we're not going
to run out there and do jiu jitsu like

4378
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:09,360
to run out there and do jiu jitsu like
 

4379
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,910
to run out there and do jiu jitsu like
it's almost useless to us you know um

4380
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:11,920
it's almost useless to us you know um
 

4381
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,990
it's almost useless to us you know um
and so like it depends on the context

4382
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:14,000
and so like it depends on the context
 

4383
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,830
and so like it depends on the context
you're in and so for for sport martial

4384
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:15,840
you're in and so for for sport martial
 

4385
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,590
you're in and so for for sport martial
arts aikido is not very good and so when

4386
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:17,600
arts aikido is not very good and so when
 

4387
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,270
arts aikido is not very good and so when
people say aikido sucks it's like well

4388
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:19,280
people say aikido sucks it's like well
 

4389
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,790
people say aikido sucks it's like well
it's because you're talking about sports

4390
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:20,800
it's because you're talking about sports
 

4391
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,790
it's because you're talking about sports
stuff and and that

4392
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:22,800
stuff and and that
 

4393
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,470
stuff and and that
there there are all kinds of other

4394
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:24,480
there there are all kinds of other
 

4395
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,910
there there are all kinds of other
problems that come into that but like

4396
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:25,920
problems that come into that but like
 

4397
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,590
problems that come into that but like
the techniques are not built for sport

4398
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:27,600
the techniques are not built for sport
 

4399
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,630
the techniques are not built for sport
and so they don't work for that and

4400
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:28,640
and so they don't work for that and
 

4401
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,750
and so they don't work for that and
they're not particularly great for that

4402
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:29,760
they're not particularly great for that
 

4403
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,950
they're not particularly great for that
but i think a lot of sport techniques

4404
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:30,960
but i think a lot of sport techniques
 

4405
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,709
but i think a lot of sport techniques
aren't very great for self-defense so

4406
01:14:32,709 --> 01:14:32,719
aren't very great for self-defense so
 

4407
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,110
aren't very great for self-defense so
true yeah it's a great point that

4408
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,120
true yeah it's a great point that
 

4409
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:39,270
true yeah it's a great point that
i noticed that happening early on in my

4410
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:39,280
i noticed that happening early on in my
 

4411
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,630
i noticed that happening early on in my
beginning journey of questioning martial

4412
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:40,640
beginning journey of questioning martial
 

4413
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,070
beginning journey of questioning martial
arts and i think that's even evident in

4414
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,080
arts and i think that's even evident in
 

4415
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,390
arts and i think that's even evident in
some of the first videos i made

4416
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:44,400
some of the first videos i made
 

4417
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,390
some of the first videos i made
exploring martial arts like one of them

4418
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:46,400
exploring martial arts like one of them
 

4419
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,470
exploring martial arts like one of them

looking at we we're not exactly setting
up

4432
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:02,960
up
 

4433
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,390
up
the conversation like what are we

4434
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:04,400
the conversation like what are we
 

4435
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,870
the conversation like what are we
talking about exactly it's it's very

4437
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,430
talking about exactly it's it's very
often it's vague it's like does it work

4438
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:09,440
often it's vague it's like does it work
 

4439
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,189
often it's vague it's like does it work
and and you're very good at catching

4440
01:15:11,189 --> 01:15:11,199
and and you're very good at catching
 

4441
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:13,990
and and you're very good at catching
that it's like does it work for what

4442
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:14,000
that it's like does it work for what
 

4443
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,990
that it's like does it work for what
uh but most people are like yeah they

4444
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:16,000
uh but most people are like yeah they
 

4445
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,669
uh but most people are like yeah they
have some idea but maybe we have

4446
01:15:17,669 --> 01:15:17,679
have some idea but maybe we have
 

4447
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,669
have some idea but maybe we have
completely two ideas of what means to

4448
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,679
completely two ideas of what means to
 

4449
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,070
completely two ideas of what means to
work and we're having a discussion

4450
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:22,080
work and we're having a discussion
 

4451
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,430
work and we're having a discussion
imagining we're talking about the same

4452
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:23,440
imagining we're talking about the same
 

4453
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,870
imagining we're talking about the same
thing but we're not and

4454
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:24,880
thing but we're not and
 

4455
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,910
thing but we're not and
it's really confusing

4456
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:27,920

 

4457
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,910

so regarding

4458
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:29,920
so regarding
 

4459
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,350
so regarding
self-defense uh sorry just turn off the

4460
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:33,360
self-defense uh sorry just turn off the
 

4461
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,229
self-defense uh sorry just turn off the
sound that does not disturb okay so if

4462
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:36,239
sound that does not disturb okay so if
 

4463
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:37,669
sound that does not disturb okay so if
we good if we go through the same

4464
01:15:37,669 --> 01:15:37,679
we good if we go through the same
 

4465
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:38,950
we good if we go through the same
quantum code game

4466
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:38,960
quantum code game
 

4467
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,550
quantum code game
for self defense

4468
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:40,560
for self defense
 

4469
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,790
for self defense
i'll start from the

4470
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:42,800
i'll start from the
 

4471
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,750
i'll start from the
top

4472
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:43,760
top
 

4473
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,790
top
so

4474
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:44,800
so
 

4475
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,709
so
i keep forgetting the name you used so

4476
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:46,719
i keep forgetting the name you used so
 

4477
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,350
i keep forgetting the name you used so
i'll say it with the kingdom

4478
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:49,360
i'll say it with the kingdom
 

4479
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,550
i'll say it with the kingdom
[\h__\h]

[\h__\h]
 

4481
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,830

um so

4482
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:51,840
um so
 

4483
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,990
um so
it's probably solid at a b it it's it's

4484
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:54,000
it's probably solid at a b it it's it's
 

4485
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,669
it's probably solid at a b it it's it's
pretty pretty functional okay uh aikidos

4557
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:28,149

it's funny so yeah like you can do

4558
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:28,159
it's funny so yeah like you can do
 

4559
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,430
it's funny so yeah like you can do
another one of these i don't want to do

4560
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:29,440
another one of these i don't want to do
 

4561
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,189
another one of these i don't want to do
a million but like we could definitely

4562
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:31,199
a million but like we could definitely
 

4563
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:32,470
a million but like we could definitely
do another one we talked about

4564
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:32,480
do another one we talked about
 

4565
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,870
do another one we talked about
conceptually whether that's a good idea

4566
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:34,880
conceptually whether that's a good idea
 

4567
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,189
conceptually whether that's a good idea
or not um versus like how pragmatic is

4568
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:37,199
or not um versus like how pragmatic is
 

4569
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,630
or not um versus like how pragmatic is
it to get to there because i think

4570
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:38,640
it to get to there because i think
 

4571
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,709
it to get to there because i think
eating me nuggets probably an s as far

4572
01:17:40,709 --> 01:17:40,719
eating me nuggets probably an s as far
 

4573
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,350
eating me nuggets probably an s as far
as conceptually goes but it's not easy

4574
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:43,360
as conceptually goes but it's not easy
 

4575
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,750
as conceptually goes but it's not easy
to do on the regular so um so yeah

4576
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:45,760
to do on the regular so um so yeah
 

4577
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,189
to do on the regular so um so yeah
probably a d

4578
01:17:47,189 --> 01:17:47,199
probably a d
 

4579
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:49,110
probably a d
i guess also

4580
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:49,120
i guess also
 

4581
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,870
i guess also
i imagine this would be different if we

4582
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:50,880
i imagine this would be different if we
 

4583
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:51,990
i imagine this would be different if we
would be

4584
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:52,000
would be
 

4585
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,510
would be
weapon defense hand to hand

4586
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:55,520
weapon defense hand to hand
 

4587
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,510
weapon defense hand to hand
when i'm when i'm thinking of uh

4588
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:57,520
when i'm when i'm thinking of uh
 

4589
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,030
when i'm when i'm thinking of uh
self-defense i'm thinking of situations

4590
01:17:59,030 --> 01:17:59,040
self-defense i'm thinking of situations
 

4591
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,470
self-defense i'm thinking of situations
that always include weapons and multiple

4592
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:00,480
that always include weapons and multiple
 

4593
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,470
that always include weapons and multiple
attackers and so it's like that's how

4594
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:02,480
attackers and so it's like that's how
 

4595
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,550
attackers and so it's like that's how
i'm looking at all these right now okay

4596
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:04,560
i'm looking at all these right now okay
 

4597
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,390
i'm looking at all these right now okay
so that's included in your mind got it

4598
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:06,400
so that's included in your mind got it
 

4599
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,510
so that's included in your mind got it

01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,990
jiu-ji naga already i don't think uh no
we didn't i'd put it probably at a d or

4608
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:16,000
we didn't i'd put it probably at a d or
 

4609
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,030
we didn't i'd put it probably at a d or
c

4610
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:17,040
c
 

4611
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,310
c
hm

4612
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:18,320
hm
 

4613
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:23,189
hm
let's say final call uh c or d

4614
01:18:23,189 --> 01:18:23,199

 

4615
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,070

c

4616
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:24,080
c
 

4617
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:36,310
c
okay

4618
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:36,320

 

4619
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,390

a d probably i don't get it as often as

4620
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:38,400
a d probably i don't get it as often as
 

4621
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,350
a d probably i don't get it as often as
i'd like

4622
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:39,360
i'd like
 

4623
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,390
i'd like
okay

4624
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:40,400
okay
 

4625
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,830
okay
there we go

4626
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:41,840
there we go
 

4627
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,310
there we go
so uh what comes to your mind hey we got

4628
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:44,320
so uh what comes to your mind hey we got
 

4629
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,229
so uh what comes to your mind hey we got
a bell curve there yeah nice it looks

4630
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:46,239
a bell curve there yeah nice it looks
 

4631
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:48,630
a bell curve there yeah nice it looks
very nice it's like that's how aikido

4632
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:48,640
very nice it's like that's how aikido
 

4633
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,590
very nice it's like that's how aikido
was supposed to look like

4634
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:51,600
was supposed to look like
 

4635
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,510
was supposed to look like
so what comes to your mind when you look

4636
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,520
so what comes to your mind when you look
 

4637
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,950
so what comes to your mind when you look
at this picture

4638
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:54,960
at this picture
 

4639
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,590
at this picture
yeah this is this seems about right um

4640
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:57,600
yeah this is this seems about right um
 

4641
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,990
yeah this is this seems about right um
because you know like uh uh ekyo is

4642
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:00,000
because you know like uh uh ekyo is
 

4643
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,990
because you know like uh uh ekyo is
first principle for a reason and it's

4644
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:02,000
first principle for a reason and it's
 

4645
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,430
first principle for a reason and it's
because i think it has a ton of

4646
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:03,440
because i think it has a ton of
 

4647
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,430
because i think it has a ton of
functionality to it you can use it in

4648
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:05,440
functionality to it you can use it in
 

4649
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,350
functionality to it you can use it in
lots and lots of ways and conceptually

4650
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:07,360
lots and lots of ways and conceptually
 

4651
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,709
lots and lots of ways and conceptually
so it's one of the techniques that the

4652
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:08,719
so it's one of the techniques that the
 

4653
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,270
so it's one of the techniques that the
technique itself is good and the concept

4654
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:11,280
technique itself is good and the concept
 

4655
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,189
technique itself is good and the concept
is good and so it's like it all kinds

4656
01:19:13,189 --> 01:19:13,199
is good and so it's like it all kinds
 

4657
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,550
is good and so it's like it all kinds
comes together in the in the just right

4658
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:14,560
comes together in the in the just right
 

4659
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,149
comes together in the in the just right
thing um and to me nico and koregash are

4660
01:19:18,149 --> 01:19:18,159
thing um and to me nico and koregash are
 

4661
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,590
thing um and to me nico and koregash are
indispensable if you're talking about

4662
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:19,600
indispensable if you're talking about
 

4663
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,189
indispensable if you're talking about
any kind of weapon taking if you're

4664
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:21,199
any kind of weapon taking if you're
 

4665
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:22,870
any kind of weapon taking if you're
talking about self-defense situations

4666
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:22,880
talking about self-defense situations
 

4667
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,149
talking about self-defense situations
you're either going to be keeping

4668
01:19:24,149 --> 01:19:24,159
you're either going to be keeping
 

4669
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,510
you're either going to be keeping
someone from taking your weapon or

4670
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:25,520
someone from taking your weapon or
 

4671
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,350
someone from taking your weapon or
taking someone else's weapon and so

4672
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:27,360
taking someone else's weapon and so
 

4673
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,990
taking someone else's weapon and so
pretty pretty highly functional stuff um

4674
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:30,000
pretty pretty highly functional stuff um
 

4675
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,470
pretty pretty highly functional stuff um
and uh yeah it seems to fall out and

4676
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:32,480
and uh yeah it seems to fall out and
 

4677
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,470
and uh yeah it seems to fall out and
about the way it should you know nice

4678
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:34,480
about the way it should you know nice
 

4679
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,709
about the way it should you know nice
and i i think it's it's almost important

4680
01:19:36,709 --> 01:19:36,719
and i i think it's it's almost important
 

4681
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:38,709
and i i think it's it's almost important
at least when i think about my audience

4682
01:19:38,709 --> 01:19:38,719
at least when i think about my audience
 

4683
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:40,550
at least when i think about my audience
i think it's important to mention that

4684
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:40,560
i think it's important to mention that
 

4685
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,550
i think it's important to mention that
and and do correct me if i'm wrong

4686
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:42,560
and and do correct me if i'm wrong
 

4687
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,350
and and do correct me if i'm wrong
that

4688
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:43,360
that
 

4689
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,870
that
this applies to training aikido in the

4690
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:46,880
this applies to training aikido in the
 

4691
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,550
this applies to training aikido in the
right way because i think that that's

4692
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:48,560
right way because i think that that's
 

4693
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,229
right way because i think that that's
one of the troubles with aikido is the

4694
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:50,239
one of the troubles with aikido is the
 

4695
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:53,030
one of the troubles with aikido is the
methodology the way it's trained

4696
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:53,040
methodology the way it's trained
 

4697
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:53,990
methodology the way it's trained
is

4698
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:54,000
is
 

4699
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,189
is
usually not

4700
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:55,199
usually not
 

4701
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,470
usually not
great and i'm obviously not talking

4702
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:56,480
great and i'm obviously not talking
 

4703
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,950
great and i'm obviously not talking
about your school uh but i think when we

4704
01:19:58,950 --> 01:19:58,960
about your school uh but i think when we
 

4705
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,430
about your school uh but i think when we
speak if somebody would jump in here in

4706
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:01,440
speak if somebody would jump in here in
 

4707
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,709
speak if somebody would jump in here in
in this conversation right here right

4708
01:20:02,709 --> 01:20:02,719
in this conversation right here right
 

4709
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:03,430
in this conversation right here right
now

4710
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:03,440
now
 

4711
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,950
now
and they would think about the aikido

4712
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:04,960
and they would think about the aikido
 

4713
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,870
and they would think about the aikido
they did

4714
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:06,880
they did
 

4715
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,950
they did
and they would look at this list and and

4716
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:08,960
and they would look at this list and and
 

4717
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,709
and they would look at this list and and
let's say they became conscious of the

4718
01:20:10,709 --> 01:20:10,719
let's say they became conscious of the
 

4719
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:12,470
let's say they became conscious of the
flaws behind it and they would think

4720
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:12,480
flaws behind it and they would think
 

4721
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,390
flaws behind it and they would think
about their training methodology they'd

4722
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:14,400
about their training methodology they'd
 

4723
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,270
about their training methodology they'd
be like

4724
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:15,280
be like
 

4725
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,430
be like
no everything is an f you know like i

4726
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:17,440
no everything is an f you know like i
 

4727
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,430
no everything is an f you know like i
was and maybe you were as well one day i

4728
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:19,440
was and maybe you were as well one day i
 

4729
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,350
was and maybe you were as well one day i
don't know

4730
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:21,360
don't know
 

4731
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,070
don't know
right but i guess but so so would you

4732
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:24,080
right but i guess but so so would you
 

4733
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,990
right but i guess but so so would you
agree that this is this applies

4734
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:26,000
agree that this is this applies
 

4735
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,030
agree that this is this applies
to

4736
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:27,040
to
 

4737
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,350
to
aikido which is trained with pressure

4738
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:29,360
aikido which is trained with pressure
 

4739
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,030
aikido which is trained with pressure
testing and

4740
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:31,040
testing and
 

4741
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,629
testing and
at least as i understand it yeah i think

4742
01:20:32,629 --> 01:20:32,639
at least as i understand it yeah i think
 

4743
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:34,229
at least as i understand it yeah i think
that's right and i mean i think you know

4744
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:34,239
that's right and i mean i think you know
 

4745
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:36,229
that's right and i mean i think you know
so i could probably do a

4746
01:20:36,229 --> 01:20:36,239
so i could probably do a
 

4747
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:38,470
so i could probably do a
a rating on these two as to like

4748
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:38,480
a rating on these two as to like
 

4749
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,110
a rating on these two as to like
what self reflectively aikido thinks you

4750
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:41,120
what self reflectively aikido thinks you
 

4751
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,189
what self reflectively aikido thinks you
know so for example self reflectively

4752
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:43,199
know so for example self reflectively
 

4753
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,990
know so for example self reflectively
aikido thinks we would put um idi minage

4754
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:46,000
aikido thinks we would put um idi minage
 

4755
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,990
aikido thinks we would put um idi minage
right up there at s we'd put kokukunage

4756
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:48,000
right up there at s we'd put kokukunage
 

4757
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,550
right up there at s we'd put kokukunage
on the board and we'd put that at s also

4758
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:50,560
on the board and we'd put that at s also
 

4759
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,990
on the board and we'd put that at s also
because like those are such core

4760
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:52,000
because like those are such core
 

4761
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,310
because like those are such core
techniques to the learning of aikido and

4762
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:54,320
techniques to the learning of aikido and
 

4763
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,070
techniques to the learning of aikido and
i think a lot of principles are learned

4764
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:56,080
i think a lot of principles are learned
 

4765
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,270
i think a lot of principles are learned
through that but that doesn't

4766
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:57,280
through that but that doesn't
 

4767
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,709
through that but that doesn't
necessarily mean the technique is

4768
01:20:58,709 --> 01:20:58,719
