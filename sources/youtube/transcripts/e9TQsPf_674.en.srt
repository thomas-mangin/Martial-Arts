this in a technique I'm not going to do
it um anywhere in real life where people

so these pointers that you're given is a

96
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:17,720
so these pointers that you're given is a
 

97
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,830
so these pointers that you're given is a
way of zeroing you in you know in the

98
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
way of zeroing you in you know in the
 

99
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,670
way of zeroing you in you know in the
same way like um I'll come by somebody

100
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:26,680
same way like um I'll come by somebody
 

101
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,949
same way like um I'll come by somebody
who's uh keeps regripping their grip so

102
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:31,959
who's uh keeps regripping their grip so
 

103
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,910

they'll get something and then I'll come
 

109
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,070
they'll get something and then I'll come
and I'll fix them put just like I go put

110
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
and I'll fix them put just like I go put

see so they'll do some weird grip and I
 

117
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,030
see so they'll do some weird grip and I
go no no no let's get that hand up there

118
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,040
go no no no let's get that hand up there
 

119
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,670

all right are you good yep and then I'll

120
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:52,680
all right are you good yep and then I'll
 

121
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,270
all right are you good yep and then I'll
come draw a

122
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,280
come draw a
 

123
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,309
come draw a
line across their hands their two

124
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
line across their hands their two
 

125
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,910
line across their hands their two
hands don't change that line see you get

126
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:02,920
hands don't change that line see you get
 

127
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,949
hands don't change that line see you get
it okay whatever you do you have to make

128
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:07,959
it okay whatever you do you have to make
 

129
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,229
it okay whatever you do you have to make
your shots stop using the full three in

130
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:11,239
your shots stop using the full three in
 

131
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,830
your shots stop using the full three in
use the one inch in the

132
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
use the one inch in the
 

133
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,390
use the one inch in the
middle and you cannot take that line

134
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,400
middle and you cannot take that line
 

135
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,789
middle and you cannot take that line
apart does that make sense okay so that

136
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:20,799
apart does that make sense okay so that
 

137
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,789
apart does that make sense okay so that
line is like the pointers that you're

138
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:22,799
line is like the pointers that you're
 

139
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:25,910
line is like the pointers that you're
giving if you if she in this case it was

140
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
giving if you if she in this case it was
 

141
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,910
giving if you if she in this case it was
a woman if she doesn't break that grip

a woman if she doesn't break that grip
 

143
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,149
a woman if she doesn't break that grip
see she gets to keep her trigger finger

144
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:33,159
see she gets to keep her trigger finger
 

145
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,429
see she gets to keep her trigger finger
in the same place on the trigger she now

146

in the same place on the trigger she now
 

147
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,750
in the same place on the trigger she now
gets consistency on the trigger

148
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:40,760
gets consistency on the trigger
 

149
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,429
gets consistency on the trigger
press she also then doesn't move her

jump in her hands it starts to fix a
 

161
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,830
jump in her hands it starts to fix a
whole bunch of things um without them

00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840
whole bunch of things um without them
 

163
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,229
whole bunch of things um without them
actually realizing

164
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:01,239
actually realizing
 

165
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,470
actually realizing
all that they're fixing with the single

00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,480
all that they're fixing with the single
 

167
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,509
all that they're fixing with the single

it what most instructors want to

170
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
it what most instructors want to
 

171
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,069
it what most instructors want to
do

00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:12,079
do
 

173
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,990
do
is they'll tell them to slow

174
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,000
is they'll tell them to slow
 

175
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,349
is they'll tell them to slow
down no no we can't slow down okay

176
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
down no no we can't slow down okay
 

177
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,550
down no no we can't slow down okay
that's not the drill so hence I don't

178
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
that's not the drill so hence I don't
 

179
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,670
that's not the drill so hence I don't
like to

180
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
like to
 

181
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,270
like to
do

182
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
do
 

183
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,710
do
long long sessions of release because

184
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
long long sessions of release because
 

185
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,670
long long sessions of release because
it's almost

186
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:30,680
it's almost
 

187
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,390
it's almost
okay but it is a

188
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:33,400
okay but it is a
 

189
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,870
okay but it is a
technique um but I think it has to be

190
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:37,880
technique um but I think it has to be
 

191
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,310
technique um but I think it has to be
appropriately applied to the Venna so

192
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,320
appropriately applied to the Venna so
 

193
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,070
appropriately applied to the Venna so
for example if I have a

194
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
for example if I have a
 

195
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,990
for example if I have a
shooter who is so scared of the bang

196
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
shooter who is so scared of the bang
 

197
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,950
shooter who is so scared of the bang
which is very common that they can't use

198
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
which is very common that they can't use
 

199
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,390
which is very common that they can't use
the mechanics you see they just there's

200
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
the mechanics you see they just there's
 

201
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,270
the mechanics you see they just there's
no way the the explosion of the round

202
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
no way the the explosion of the round
 

203
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,390
no way the the explosion of the round

207
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,270

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,510
enough awareness in order to be

00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:14,520
trained so that person I'll say slow
 

215
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,790
trained so that person I'll say slow
down but my goal is I just want them to

216
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
down but my goal is I just want them to
 

217
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,309
down but my goal is I just want them to
get used to the explosion I really don't

218
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:21,319
get used to the explosion I really don't
 

219
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,590
get used to the explosion I really don't
even care sometimes I've taken those

220
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
even care sometimes I've taken those

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,110
even care sometimes I've taken those
shoters when I'm driving the bus and

shoters when I'm driving the bus and
 

223
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,469
shoters when I'm driving the bus and
take away all the targets and shoot into

224

take away all the targets and shoot into
 

225
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,189
take away all the targets and shoot into
the backdrop you get it cuz the real

00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
the backdrop you get it cuz the real

problem is the explosion until we can

228
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
problem is the explosion until we can
 

229
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,350
problem is the explosion until we can
fix the fear stter response we there's

230
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
fix the fear stter response we there's
 

231
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,990
fix the fear stter response we there's
no point in going past that so when you

232
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
no point in going past that so when you
 

233
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,350
no point in going past that so when you
take

234
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
take
 

235
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,550
take
somebody and you give them a solo

236
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:47,560
somebody and you give them a solo
 

237
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,510
somebody and you give them a solo
drill sometimes it's just to get them in

238
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:52,520
drill sometimes it's just to get them in
 

239
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,670
drill sometimes it's just to get them in
the

240
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
the
 

241
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,870
the
ballpark but solo drills have a problem

242
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
ballpark but solo drills have a problem
 

243
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,270
ballpark but solo drills have a problem
and the problem

244
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:58,280
and the problem
 

245
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,469
and the problem
is I I don't know what I'm working

246
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:03,479

 

247
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,909

on they don't understand that they're

248
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
on they don't understand that they're
 

249
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,629
on they don't understand that they're
getting acclimated to the explosion you

250
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
getting acclimated to the explosion you
 

251
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,870
getting acclimated to the explosion you
see and they might even feel bothered by

252
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
see and they might even feel bothered by
 

253
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,189
see and they might even feel bothered by
the fact I'm not giving you a tet do you

254
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:14,199
the fact I'm not giving you a tet do you
 

255
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,550
the fact I'm not giving you a tet do you
get that just shoot I don't don't even

256
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:17,560
get that just shoot I don't don't even
 

257
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,110
get that just shoot I don't don't even
aim sometimes I tell them don't even aim

258
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,120
aim sometimes I tell them don't even aim
 

259
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,710
aim sometimes I tell them don't even aim
just make the gun go off right but it

260
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:23,720
just make the gun go off right but it
 

261
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,189
just make the gun go off right but it
gets you there in the end in the long

262
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:26,199
gets you there in the end in the long
 

263
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,309
gets you there in the end in the long
run so the takeaways here is are

264
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
run so the takeaways here is are
 

265
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,390
run so the takeaways here is are

end and we have to be very careful about

270
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,080
end and we have to be very careful about
 

271
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,909
end and we have to be very careful about
the drills that we

272
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:42,919
the drills that we
 

273
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,110
the drills that we
use

274
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
use
 

275
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,309
use
um and a lot of drills in modern iika

276
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
um and a lot of drills in modern iika
 

277
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,309
um and a lot of drills in modern iika
did just pass down with no understanding

278
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
did just pass down with no understanding
 

279
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,150
did just pass down with no understanding
of what is the end what is the Practical

280
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
of what is the end what is the Practical
 

281
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,350
of what is the end what is the Practical
utilitarian thing I'm not supposed to

282
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,360
utilitarian thing I'm not supposed to
 

283
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,189
utilitarian thing I'm not supposed to
lose and this is Complicated by the fact

284
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:02,199
lose and this is Complicated by the fact
 

285
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,070
lose and this is Complicated by the fact
that modern ioka don't know that anymore

286
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
that modern ioka don't know that anymore
 

287
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,710
that modern ioka don't know that anymore
they don't they're not fighting with it

they don't they're not fighting with it
 

289
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,390
they don't they're not fighting with it
nor are they living with it either so

290
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:13,400
nor are they living with it either so
 

291
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,150
nor are they living with it either so
they practice one thing inside the dojo

292
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,160
they practice one thing inside the dojo
 

293
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,550
they practice one thing inside the dojo
and outside the dojo they practice

294
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:19,560
and outside the dojo they practice
 

295
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,309
and outside the dojo they practice
contestation all day long as we had

296
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
contestation all day long as we had

several talks on that

298
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:24,879
several talks on that
 

299
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,909
several talks on that
okay

300
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919

 

301
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,270

um so in my

302
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
um so in my
 

303
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,790
um so in my
opinion solo drills are are often touted

304
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:35,800
opinion solo drills are are often touted
 

305
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,469
opinion solo drills are are often touted
like you got to do your solo work you

306
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:37,479
like you got to do your solo work you
 

307
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,909
like you got to do your solo work you

got to do your solo
work I like to save solo drills to the

310
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
work I like to save solo drills to the
 

311
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,430
work I like to save solo drills to the
to the we're going to do them but

312
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:46,440
to the we're going to do them but
 

313
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,790
to the we're going to do them but
they're not the emphasis of the training

314
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
they're not the emphasis of the training
 

315
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,230
they're not the emphasis of the training
you're going to do them um like we did

316
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
you're going to do them um like we did
 

317
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,350
you're going to do them um like we did
Zen but Mo it's only like a half hour

318

Zen but Mo it's only like a half hour
 

319
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,909
Zen but Mo it's only like a half hour
and then the rest we're doing partner

320
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
and then the rest we're doing partner
 

321
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,110
and then the rest we're doing partner
drills okay and the partner

322
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
drills okay and the partner

324
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:04,039
drills make more gross what we're trying
 

325
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:05,309
drills make more gross what we're trying
to work

326
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:05,319
to work
 

327
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,270
to work
on there's still pointers in

328
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,280
on there's still pointers in
 

329
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,469
on there's still pointers in
there um and then we can work on those

330
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:11,479
there um and then we can work on those
 

331
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:14,869
there um and then we can work on those
things and this is why we don't do we

332
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
things and this is why we don't do we
 

333
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,710
things and this is why we don't do we

this is this is pointless this is

360
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
this is this is pointless this is
 

361
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,030
this is this is pointless this is
absolutely pointless right now so I have

362
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,040
absolutely pointless right now so I have
 

363
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,110

of the C cultivation drill set and then
 

369
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,870
of the C cultivation drill set and then
we move past it to see what can you do

370
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
we move past it to see what can you do
 

371
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,550
we move past it to see what can you do
with it okay and then from there you can

372
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
with it okay and then from there you can
 

373
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,030
with it okay and then from there you can
take it into the techniques okay

374
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
take it into the techniques okay
 

375
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,750
take it into the techniques okay
so we

376
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:20,760

 

377
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,670

Kon MAA as I said at the beginning we
 

401
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,230
Kon MAA as I said at the beginning we
use the back midfoot for k

402

the time the back and foot so we want to
 

413
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,350
the time the back and foot so we want to
know that okay so we do our releasing

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:04,760
and so they're here like that and they
 

483
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,829
and so they're here like that and they
kind of

in the Techni everywhere okay so we go
 

493
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,189
in the Techni everywhere okay so we go
to drill

494
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:22,199
to drill

conjoin that to the back mid

502
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
conjoin that to the back mid
 

503
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,750
conjoin that to the back mid
foot and the metric that we're using

foot and the metric that we're using
 

505
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,509
foot and the metric that we're using
here is if you're rounding on the back

here is if you're rounding on the back
 

507
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,670
here is if you're rounding on the back
mid foot the front foot is irrelevant

mid foot the front foot is irrelevant
therefore it can be on the ground off

Young aspect on the back foot and it is

518
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
Young aspect on the back foot and it is
 

519
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,310
Young aspect on the back foot and it is
coincidental with her not being able to

coincidental with her not being able to
 

521
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,470
coincidental with her not being able to
move me I don't want to test myself with

not the true goal okay I should be able

526
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
not the true goal okay I should be able
 

527
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,310
not the true goal okay I should be able
to do that but that's not the true goal

528
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
to do that but that's not the true goal
 

529
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,550
to do that but that's not the true goal
so the goal here is not to stop myself

530
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560
so the goal here is not to stop myself
 

531
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,750
so the goal here is not to stop myself
from being moved the goal is to combine

532
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:22,760
from being moved the goal is to combine
 

533
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,829
from being moved the goal is to combine
and conjoin her young aspect with my

534
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
and conjoin her young aspect with my
 

535
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,269
and conjoin her young aspect with my

aspect on the midfoot and to do this
 

537
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:33,670
aspect on the midfoot and to do this
I can be very relaxed she can push and

00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
I can be very relaxed she can push and
 

539
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,870
I can be very relaxed she can push and
it it doesn't

540
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
it it doesn't
 

541
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,150
it it doesn't
matter I'm doing the drills hence I tell

you guys that when you feel muscle

544
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:42,279
you guys that when you feel muscle
 

545
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,670
you guys that when you feel muscle
tension and you can so here I am in that

546
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680
tension and you can so here I am in that
 

547
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,790
tension and you can so here I am in that
muscle

548

muscle
 

549
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,310
muscle
tension and then I'll release that

550
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
tension and then I'll release that
 

551
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,310
tension and then I'll release that
without losing positional

552
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
without losing positional
 

553
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,629
without losing positional
Integrity it'll

554
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:55,639
Integrity it'll
 

555
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,150
Integrity it'll
drop and I should be able to just drop

556
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
drop and I should be able to just drop
 

557
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,870
drop and I should be able to just drop
it like I'm hold something and I let

558
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
it like I'm hold something and I let
 

559
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,790
it like I'm hold something and I let
go that is more you're working on the

560
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:03,800
go that is more you're working on the
 

561
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,360
go that is more you're working on the
drill than you doing this okay so

562
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,370
drill than you doing this okay so
 

563
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,710
drill than you doing this okay so

maybe I feel the tension I release and I

566
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:14,759
maybe I feel the tension I release and I
 

567
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,470
maybe I feel the tension I release and I
get push I say you're closer to getting

568
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:17,480
get push I say you're closer to getting
 

569
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,829
get push I say you're closer to getting
it and if you don't get pushed and you

570
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
it and if you don't get pushed and you
 

571
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,069
it and if you don't get pushed and you
keep muscle tension

572
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,079
keep muscle tension
 

573
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,430
keep muscle tension
okay does that make sense okay so here

574
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:26,440
okay does that make sense okay so here
 

575
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,230
okay does that make sense okay so here
is fipi

576
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
is fipi
 

577
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,150
is fipi
that's that part right there and here's

578
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
that's that part right there and here's
 

579
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,749
that's that part right there and here's
the partner drill so you're not

580
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:34,759
the partner drill so you're not
 

581
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,790
the partner drill so you're not
bullshitting yourself on whether you're

582
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
bullshitting yourself on whether you're
 

583
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,069
bullshitting yourself on whether you're
taking y aspect and able to conjoin it

584
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
taking y aspect and able to conjoin it
 

585
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,230
taking y aspect and able to conjoin it
with your y aspect and send it down to

586
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:43,240
with your y aspect and send it down to
 

587
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,389
with your y aspect and send it down to
the okay so

588
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:46,399
the okay so
 

589
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,350
the okay so
that's this part in drill two all right

590
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:50,360
that's this part in drill two all right
 

591
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,030
that's this part in drill two all right
so let's try that and then I'll show you

592
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,040
so let's try that and then I'll show you
 

593
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:58,030
so let's try that and then I'll show you
the moving forward part okay try that

594
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,040

 

595
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:32,710

again for

597
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,749

and if you want more sensation of what's

598
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:34,759
and if you want more sensation of what's
 

599
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,189
and if you want more sensation of what's
Happening you just increase your part's

600
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
Happening you just increase your part's
 

601
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,430
Happening you just increase your part's
young aspect you can tell them more more

602
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:40,440
young aspect you can tell them more more
 

603
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,990
young aspect you can tell them more more
more push more and see does tension

604
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
more push more and see does tension
 

605
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,509
more push more and see does tension
rise does positional Integrity be is it

606
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
rise does positional Integrity be is it
 

607
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,710
rise does positional Integrity be is it
maintained is it maintained through

608
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:49,720
maintained is it maintained through
 

609
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,949
maintained is it maintained through
tension or through young aspect

610
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
tension or through young aspect
 

611
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,749
tension or through young aspect
conjoining and going down to the back

612
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759

647
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,470
requests you're making because we also
know ultimately the shape is

648
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
know ultimately the shape is
 

649
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,070
know ultimately the shape is
irrelevant okay so your requests are

650
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,080
irrelevant okay so your requests are
 

651
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,590
irrelevant okay so your requests are
probably shape relevant

652
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
probably shape relevant
 

653
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,669
probably shape relevant
which will eventually have to be taken

654
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
which will eventually have to be taken
 

655

okay it's in all of us but the
 

705

remember did you have
sides you don't have sides okay if we

752
00:21:59,470 --> 00:21:59,480
sides you don't have sides okay if we
 

753
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,430
sides you don't have sides okay if we
have size we're not doing we're not

754
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,440
have size we're not doing we're not
 

755
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,830
have size we're not doing we're not
doing it okay um same thing I'm going to

756
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
doing it okay um same thing I'm going to
 

757
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,230
doing it okay um same thing I'm going to
let you get in there and I will work to

758
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,240
let you get in there and I will work to
 

759
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,669

reconcile your sides but that's
 

761
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,149
reconcile your sides but that's
indicative that I'm not yet doing it

762
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:15,159
indicative that I'm not yet doing it
 

763
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:20,190
indicative that I'm not yet doing it
okay um just like the muscle tension is

764
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,200
okay um just like the muscle tension is
 

765
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,990
okay um just like the muscle tension is
indicative as I said when I say shape

766
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,000
indicative as I said when I say shape
 

767
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,350
indicative as I said when I say shape
doesn't matter if shape doesn't matter

768
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,360
doesn't matter if shape doesn't matter
 

769
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,630
doesn't matter if shape doesn't matter
then I don't have size do you see that

770
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
then I don't have size do you see that
 

771
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,750
then I don't have size do you see that
in the Practical end of this if I want

772
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:31,760
in the Practical end of this if I want
 

773
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,950
in the Practical end of this if I want
to do

774
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:32,960
to do
 

775
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,990
to do
this um let's say

776
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,000
this um let's say
 

777
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,029
this um let's say
martially if I have the shape I'm at a

778
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:40,039
martially if I have the shape I'm at a
 

779
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:43,669
martially if I have the shape I'm at a
great disadvantage if I can find the

780
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
great disadvantage if I can find the
 

781
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,430
great disadvantage if I can find the
release and the ground Vector from any

782
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:46,440
release and the ground Vector from any
 

783
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,430
release and the ground Vector from any
position in any Vector I'm more Marsh

784
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,440
position in any Vector I'm more Marsh
 

785
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,510
position in any Vector I'm more Marsh
viable than if I have to be one way to

786
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:52,520
viable than if I have to be one way to
 

787
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,909
viable than if I have to be one way to
get it to whatever is going on if I'm

788
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:54,919
get it to whatever is going on if I'm
 

789
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,350
get it to whatever is going on if I'm
going to do this socially or spiritually

790
00:22:59,350 --> 00:22:59,360
going to do this socially or spiritually
 

791
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,029
going to do this socially or spiritually
the same thing if I can't find the

792
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:03,039
the same thing if I can't find the
 

793
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,710
the same thing if I can't find the
release no matter what the environment

794
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:05,720
release no matter what the environment
 

795
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,990
release no matter what the environment
and the situation is then I can't really

796
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,000
and the situation is then I can't really
 

797
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,190
and the situation is then I can't really
do the drill you get that so keep in

798
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,200
do the drill you get that so keep in
 

799
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,350
do the drill you get that so keep in
mind I remember the teacher said shape

800
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
mind I remember the teacher said shape
 

801
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,110
mind I remember the teacher said shape
doesn't matter okay um and then you're

802
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,120
doesn't matter okay um and then you're
 

803
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,269
doesn't matter okay um and then you're
just training as you're going along work

804
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:19,279
just training as you're going along work
 

805
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:21,590
just training as you're going along work

could go any leg she can't push me
 

831
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,149
could go any leg she can't push me
over Okay so let's try the one leg and

832
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:06,159
over Okay so let's try the one leg and
 

833
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,630
over Okay so let's try the one leg and
it's going to get more gross and you're

834
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
it's going to get more gross and you're
 

835

feel whoa I I had tension any somewhere
 

839
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,029
feel whoa I I had tension any somewhere

pushing is whether my foot is down or my
 

873
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,990

foot is not down and in some way that's
 

875
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,230
foot is not down and in some way that's
a little weird okay so we'll try try

876
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,240
a little weird okay so we'll try try
 

877
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,430
a little weird okay so we'll try try
this and you'll see usually what you're

878
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:17,440
this and you'll see usually what you're
 

879
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,029
this and you'll see usually what you're
going to see is that um along with not

880
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039
going to see is that um along with not
 

881
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,510
going to see is that um along with not
ground vory you have weak weak corners

882
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:26,520
ground vory you have weak weak corners
 

883
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,310
ground vory you have weak weak corners
and those give first

884
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:29,320
and those give first
 

885
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,950
and those give first
okay let's get some Awareness on these

886
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:31,960
okay let's get some Awareness on these
 

887
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,350
okay let's get some Awareness on these
weak what I'm calling Corners okay so

888
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:34,360
weak what I'm calling Corners okay so
 

889
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,389
weak what I'm calling Corners okay so
let's try

890
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:35,399
let's try
 

891
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:39,269
let's try
it do the first drill and then simply

892
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279
it do the first drill and then simply
 

893
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,549
it do the first drill and then simply
pick the leg up

894
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:42,559
pick the leg up
 

895
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,950
pick the leg up
okay and again this is the reward part

896
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:45,960
okay and again this is the reward part
 

897
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,470
okay and again this is the reward part
the most important part of the boat

898
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,480
the most important part of the boat
 

899
00:25:48,480 --> 00:26:05,430
the most important part of the boat
rowing exercise

900
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440

 

901
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:28,950

let's move your team this way Virginia

902
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:28,960

 

903
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,510

and when you go on one leg there should

904
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
and when you go on one leg there should
 

905
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,510
and when you go on one leg there should
not be an increase in young at the grip

906
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:34,520
not be an increase in young at the grip
 

907
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,630
not be an increase in young at the grip
that's you leaning on them okay right

908
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:37,640
that's you leaning on them okay right
 

909
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,710
that's you leaning on them okay right
right Virginia you didn't feel an

910
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:39,720
right Virginia you didn't feel an
 

911
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,830
right Virginia you didn't feel an
increase when I went on one it felt

912
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:41,840
increase when I went on one it felt
 

913
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:58,870
increase when I went on one it felt
exactly the same as the first one

914
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880

 

915
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,909

if you if you uh just to skip more if

916
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:03,919
if you if you uh just to skip more if
 

917
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,870
if you if you uh just to skip more if
you feel the increase in the Yong when

918
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:05,880
you feel the increase in the Yong when
 

919
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,909
you feel the increase in the Yong when
they go on one leg let go and you'll

920
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:08,919
they go on one leg let go and you'll
 

921
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,909
they go on one leg let go and you'll
they'll be able to see that ah yeah I

922
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:10,919
they'll be able to see that ah yeah I
 

923
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,149
they'll be able to see that ah yeah I
was leaning on them okay if they don't

924
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,159
was leaning on them okay if they don't
 

925
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,310
was leaning on them okay if they don't
fall forward they were doing it but you

926
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,320
fall forward they were doing it but you
 

927
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,470
fall forward they were doing it but you
shouldn't have felt an increase in y

928
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
shouldn't have felt an increase in y
 

929
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,310
shouldn't have felt an increase in y
keep the drove up

930
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,320

 

931
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,789

okay start in the first drill you're

932
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:27,799
okay start in the first drill you're
 

933
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:58,310
okay start in the first drill you're
pressing think

934
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,320

 

935
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:06,990

let's switch RS

936
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,000

 

937
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,070

and notice the

938
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:09,080
and notice the
 

939
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,269
and notice the
turn that comes

940
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,279
turn that comes
 

941
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,430
turn that comes
first okay and on day one remember it

942
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,440
first okay and on day one remember it
 

943
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,029
first okay and on day one remember it
was that rotation that we were talking

944
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:18,039
was that rotation that we were talking
 

945
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,990
was that rotation that we were talking
about do you remember that when your

946
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:20,000
about do you remember that when your
 

947
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,750
about do you remember that when your
elbow was out and it would turn you and

948
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:22,760
elbow was out and it would turn you and
 

949
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,269
elbow was out and it would turn you and
that that's that that's what I would

950
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:24,279
that that's that that's what I would
 

951
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:26,950
that that's that that's what I would
call a Rec corn so what this drill is

952
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:26,960
call a Rec corn so what this drill is
 

953
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,950
call a Rec corn so what this drill is
telling me is this part is not in my

954
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:32,960
telling me is this part is not in my
 

955
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,389
telling me is this part is not in my
downward descending of my own young

956
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:35,399
downward descending of my own young
 

957
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:39,149
downward descending of my own young
aspect and now if we look

958
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:39,159
aspect and now if we look
 

959
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:42,389
aspect and now if we look
why we're going to use your know Theory

960
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:42,399
why we're going to use your know Theory
 

961
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,190
why we're going to use your know Theory
here it's turning you right that means

it's
turnable what's making it turnable is

966
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:50,159
turnable what's making it turnable is
 

967

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,990
you're pushing on her but she has
greater young mechanics and so this

970
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,000
greater young mechanics and so this
 

971
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,470
greater young mechanics and so this
yields to it you guys understand that

972
00:28:59,470 --> 00:28:59,480
yields to it you guys understand that
 

973
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,909
yields to it you guys understand that
okay so

974
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:01,919
okay so
 

975
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,029
okay so
by us not

976
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:06,039
by us not
 

977
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:09,389
by us not
turning it's indicative that we're not

978
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:09,399
turning it's indicative that we're not
 

979
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:12,669
turning it's indicative that we're not
turnable and by us not being turnable

980
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:12,679
turnable and by us not being turnable
 

981
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:15,350
turnable and by us not being turnable
it's indicative that I'm not contesting

982
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
it's indicative that I'm not contesting
 

983
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,070
it's indicative that I'm not contesting
the

984
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,080
the
 

985
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,509
the
grip you get it and now I'm doing the

986
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:18,519
grip you get it and now I'm doing the
 

987
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:22,389
grip you get it and now I'm doing the
drill which is Young aspect is coming

988
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:22,399
drill which is Young aspect is coming
 

989
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,149
drill which is Young aspect is coming
into me and being converted down okay so

990
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:27,159
into me and being converted down okay so
 

991
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:28,750
into me and being converted down okay so
every time we

992
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:28,760
every time we
 

993
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,190
every time we
lose what we're trying to accomplish

994
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,200
lose what we're trying to accomplish
 

995
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,669
lose what we're trying to accomplish
here it's giving light to the fact here

996
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:34,679
here it's giving light to the fact here
 

997
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,350
here it's giving light to the fact here
I am contesting they have greater young

998
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,360
I am contesting they have greater young
 

999
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,350
I am contesting they have greater young

working its way out and go you're Yin

1002
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:42,440
working its way out and go you're Yin
 

1003
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,070
working its way out and go you're Yin
should okay so that's what you're

1004
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,080
should okay so that's what you're
 

1005
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,310
should okay so that's what you're
working on and none of that comes out in

1006
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:48,320
working on and none of that comes out in
 

1007
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,909
working on and none of that comes out in
this none of that comes out until you

1008
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:50,919
this none of that comes out until you
 

1009
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:54,950
this none of that comes out until you
you can feel that you know I am grounded

1010
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:54,960
you can feel that you know I am grounded
 

1011
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,830
you can feel that you know I am grounded
I I can feel that everything is

1012
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:56,840
I I can feel that everything is
 

1013
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,669
I I can feel that everything is
organized then then you can do this

1014
00:29:58,669 --> 00:29:58,679
organized then then you can do this
 

1015
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,509
organized then then you can do this
drill but you know what you don't have

1016
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:00,519
drill but you know what you don't have
 

1017
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:03,029
drill but you know what you don't have
to do that drill everything is doing

1018
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,039
to do that drill everything is doing
 

1019
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,630
to do that drill everything is doing
whatever it is you don't need the boat

1020
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:04,640
whatever it is you don't need the boat
 

1021
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,350
whatever it is you don't need the boat
rolling exercise for that kind of

1022
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:06,360
rolling exercise for that kind of
 

1023
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,350
rolling exercise for that kind of
exercise okay um another one you can

1024
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
exercise okay um another one you can
 

1025
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,230
exercise okay um another one you can
do sometimes this one is is more

1026
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,240
do sometimes this one is is more
 

1027
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,750
do sometimes this one is is more
difficult but another one you can do

1028
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
difficult but another one you can do
 

1029
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,190
difficult but another one you can do
she's driving driving driving and she

1030
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,200
she's driving driving driving and she
 

1031
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,830
she's driving driving driving and she
lets go and I don't go fly forward you

1032
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:20,840
lets go and I don't go fly forward you
 

1033
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,710
lets go and I don't go fly forward you
can do that one too okay so let's try

1034
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:22,720
can do that one too okay so let's try
 

1035
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,990
can do that one too okay so let's try
that one it's a little less difficult

1036
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,000
that one it's a little less difficult
 

1037
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,950
that one it's a little less difficult
than the other one but you really have

1038
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:26,960
than the other one but you really have
 

1039
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,990
than the other one but you really have
to push push push

1040
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,000
to push push push
 

1041
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,590
to push push push
okay let

1042
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:31,600
okay let
 

1043
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,669
okay let
go and all we're trying to do is make

1044
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:34,679
go and all we're trying to do is make
 

1045
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:37,310
go and all we're trying to do is make
the backward motion of the boat roll

1046
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,320
the backward motion of the boat roll
 

1047
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:54,950
the backward motion of the boat roll
exercise an actual viable

1048
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960

 

1049
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,310

drill yes

1050
00:30:59,310 --> 00:30:59,320

 

1051
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,710

so again if we look at that in

1052
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:02,720
so again if we look at that in
 

1053
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,549
so again if we look at that in
the why did I come

1054
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:05,559
the why did I come
 

1055
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:09,669
the why did I come
forward right because I am contesting at

1056
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:09,679
forward right because I am contesting at
 

1057
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,149
forward right because I am contesting at
the grip right and when the grip goes

1058
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:14,159
the grip right and when the grip goes
 

1059
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,870
the grip right and when the grip goes
in I came forward rather than

1060
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:16,880
in I came forward rather than
 

1061
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,710
in I came forward rather than
internalizing his y I was pushing on his

1062
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:20,720
internalizing his y I was pushing on his
 

1063
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,310
internalizing his y I was pushing on his
Y and when that goes away you'll come

1064
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,320
Y and when that goes away you'll come
 

1065
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,430
Y and when that goes away you'll come
forward okay that's what we're trying to

1066
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:26,440
forward okay that's what we're trying to
 

1067
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:50,269
forward okay that's what we're trying to
look at here okay

1068
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:50,279

 

1069
00:31:50,279 --> 00:32:56,830

try you're on the back foot

1070
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:56,840

 

1071
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:26,750

for

1072
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:26,760

 

1073
00:33:26,760 --> 00:34:16,030

for for

1074
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,040

 

1075
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,589

okay

1076
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:19,599

 

1077
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,349

um so again we we taking the booing

1078
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:24,359
um so again we we taking the booing
 

1079
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:25,909
um so again we we taking the booing
exercises

1080
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:25,919
exercises
 

1081
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,270
exercises
making the as more growth so I can

1082
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:29,280
making the as more growth so I can
 

1083
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,310
making the as more growth so I can
observe

1084
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:30,320
observe
 

1085
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,750
observe
myself so that I'm actually doing what

1086
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:32,760
myself so that I'm actually doing what
 

1087
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,149
myself so that I'm actually doing what
I'm supposed to be doing so that I

1088
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:35,159
I'm supposed to be doing so that I
 

1089
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,950
I'm supposed to be doing so that I
actually achieve a Bible practice at the

1090
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:37,960
actually achieve a Bible practice at the
 

1091
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,430
actually achieve a Bible practice at the
end okay um so what should I be doing in

1092
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:42,440
end okay um so what should I be doing in
 

1093
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,149
end okay um so what should I be doing in
this drill I should be doing the same

1094
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:45,159
this drill I should be doing the same
 

1095
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,190
this drill I should be doing the same
thing in the standing drill but I

1096
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,200
thing in the standing drill but I
 

1097
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,950
thing in the standing drill but I
probably wasn't see and if I'm doing uh

1098
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:51,960
probably wasn't see and if I'm doing uh
 

1099

room just like there was so much wiggle
 

1105
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,150
room just like there was so much wiggle
room in this that people change what it

1106
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:03,160
room in this that people change what it
 

1107
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,430
room in this that people change what it
is okay there's some little room here

1108

everything it's in the boat
roll but we going to go

1296
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,200
roll but we going to go
 

1297
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,030
roll but we going to go
slow

1298
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:10,040
slow
 

1299

1305
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:25,710
transfer
transfer okay let's try drill

1306
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:25,720

 

1307
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,349

fre this is going to amplify our

1308
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:29,359
fre this is going to amplify our
 

1309
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,230
fre this is going to amplify our
gooiness and our turning our

1310
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:33,240
gooiness and our turning our
 

1311
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,390
gooiness and our turning our
contestation okay because the Y value is

1312
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:36,400
contestation okay because the Y value is
 

1313
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,790
contestation okay because the Y value is
going to increase as we go forward and

1314
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:38,800
going to increase as we go forward and
 

1315
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,910
going to increase as we go forward and
if I'm not reconciling it you'll see the

1316
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:41,920
if I'm not reconciling it you'll see the
 

1317
00:40:41,920 --> 00:41:01,390
if I'm not reconciling it you'll see the
effects of the Amplified y TR

1318
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:01,400

 

1319
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,109

don't don't don't add to

1320
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:04,119
don't don't don't add to
 

1321
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:10,670
don't don't don't add to
it just shift shift

1322
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:10,680

 

1323
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:16,230

forward so do that again

1324
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:16,240

 

1325
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,829

Chris this turn

1326
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:18,839
Chris this turn
 

1327
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,030
Chris this turn
here is where go back go back okay and

1328
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,040
here is where go back go back okay and
 

1329
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,550
here is where go back go back okay and
you go and you turn you see so your your

1330
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:27,560
you go and you turn you see so your your
 

1331
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,589
you go and you turn you see so your your
catch is on a turn but your catch needs

1332
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:30,599
catch is on a turn but your catch needs
 

1333
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,950
catch is on a turn but your catch needs
to be just on a

1334
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:32,960
to be just on a
 

1335
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,550
to be just on a
shift okay

1336
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:38,560

 

1337
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,870

so that's it so you can feel you see

1338
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:41,880
so that's it so you can feel you see
 

1339
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,829
so that's it so you can feel you see
that it it it got compromised there

1340
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:44,839
that it it it got compromised there
 

1341
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:47,309
that it it it got compromised there
right because a y value is

1342
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:47,319
right because a y value is
 

1343
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:49,550
right because a y value is
there and this is on the very

1344
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:49,560
there and this is on the very
 

1345
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,470
there and this is on the very
lightweight we put you with

1346
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:54,480

 

1347
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,030

ad only cuz you're external right now if

1348
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,040
ad only cuz you're external right now if
 

1349
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,750
ad only cuz you're external right now if
you were internally it doesn't matter

1350
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:00,760
you were internally it doesn't matter
 

1351
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,430
you were internally it doesn't matter
you feel like her she feels like Ronin

1352
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:03,440
you feel like her she feels like Ronin
 

1353
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,470
you feel like her she feels like Ronin
it doesn't matter but externally it does

1354
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:06,480
it doesn't matter but externally it does
 

1355
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,790
it doesn't matter but externally it does
matter okay and we want to amplify the

1356
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:10,800
matter okay and we want to amplify the
 

1357
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,390
matter okay and we want to amplify the
gross

1358
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:17,400

 

1359
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,470

cues don't push just

1360
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
cues don't push just
 

1361
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,030
cues don't push just
shift they're they're not the metric you

1362
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:24,040
shift they're they're not the metric you
 

1363
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,670
shift they're they're not the metric you
just go to the back foot you come to the

1364
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:26,680
just go to the back foot you come to the
 

1365
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,349
just go to the back foot you come to the
front foot

00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:28,359
front foot
 

1367
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:30,750
front foot
don't turn do you feel feel that turn

1368
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:30,760
don't turn do you feel feel that turn
 

1369
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,309
don't turn do you feel feel that turn
Adam that he did back

1370
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:34,319

there you got yourself all organized and
 

1391
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,750
there you got yourself all organized and
then you can hold that but now we're

1392
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:13,760
then you can hold that but now we're
 

1393
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,230
then you can hold that but now we're
going take him and move him and then

1394
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:17,240
going take him and move him and then
 

1395
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,549
going take him and move him and then
move him okay and this though is the

1396
00:43:21,549 --> 00:43:21,559
move him okay and this though is the
 

1397
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:24,510
move him okay and this though is the
boat rowing exercise closer to it

1403
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,630
okay got it so it's a little harder okay
but you have to get to the back foot and

1404
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:33,640
but you have to get to the back foot and
 

1405
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,910
but you have to get to the back foot and
you have to get forward if you're doing

1406
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:35,920
you have to get forward if you're doing
 

1407
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,829
you have to get forward if you're doing
your AR you coming in with whatever and

press yes okay

1414
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:50,079

 

1415
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,230

go you got to go all the way back to the

1416
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:53,240
go you got to go all the way back to the
 

1417
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,870
go you got to go all the way back to the
back foot just like in drill two not

1418
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:55,880
back foot just like in drill two not
 

1419
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:04,630
back foot just like in drill two not
halfway there

1420
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:04,640

 

1421
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,390

without turning turning you're trying

1422
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:06,400
without turning turning you're trying
 

1423
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,589
without turning turning you're trying
not to go not to go backwards

1424
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:11,599

 

1425
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,430

right and then just sh forward ignore

1426
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:14,440
right and then just sh forward ignore
 

1427
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:26,030
right and then just sh forward ignore
what happens to

1428
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:26,040

 

1429
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:56,030

him

1430
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:56,040

 

1431
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:39,069

for for

1432
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:39,079

 

1433
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:55,910

your G for

1434
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:55,920

 

1435
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:53,390

tension for

1436
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:53,400

 

1437
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,990

all right so let's do that your left arm

1438
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:56,000
all right so let's do that your left arm
 

1439
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:05,790
all right so let's do that your left arm
and we'll watch

1440
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:05,800

 

1441
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,990

here okay so at the end is your little

1442
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:11,000
here okay so at the end is your little
 

1443
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,109
here okay so at the end is your little
bracing angle and it's it she's be

1444
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:15,119
bracing angle and it's it she's be
 

1445
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,030
bracing angle and it's it she's be
moved it'll give you the sense like that

1446
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:18,040
moved it'll give you the sense like that
 

1447
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,390
moved it'll give you the sense like that
like those beginner Shooters when you

1448
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,400
like those beginner Shooters when you
 

1449
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,990
like those beginner Shooters when you
finish the drill and you go oh yeah yeah

1450
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:23,000
finish the drill and you go oh yeah yeah
 

1451
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,270
finish the drill and you go oh yeah yeah
everything's in the 3in circle you get

1452
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:25,280
everything's in the 3in circle you get
 

1453
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,109
everything's in the 3in circle you get
it but

1454
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:27,119
it but
 

1455
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,950
it but
take you to get it why did you use the

1456
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:28,960
take you to get it why did you use the
 

1457
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,430
take you to get it why did you use the
full 3 in it's not practical you get it

1458
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:32,440
full 3 in it's not practical you get it
 

1459
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,710
full 3 in it's not practical you get it
or your gooiness is now coming into play

1460
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:36,720
or your gooiness is now coming into play
 

1461
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,190
or your gooiness is now coming into play
here the gooiness that you had won't let

1462
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:40,200
here the gooiness that you had won't let
 

1463
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,470
here the gooiness that you had won't let
you actually do this this part and we'll

1464
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:43,480
you actually do this this part and we'll
 

1465
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,470
you actually do this this part and we'll
see

1466
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:44,480
see
 

1467
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,510
see
later that external pushing on her is

1468
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:48,520
later that external pushing on her is
 

1469
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,589
later that external pushing on her is
going to not serve you in the we can

1470
00:47:52,589 --> 00:47:52,599
going to not serve you in the we can
 

1471
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:56,870
going to not serve you in the we can
again modify this one right so we catch

1472
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:56,880
again modify this one right so we catch
 

1473
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,990
again modify this one right so we catch
one leg and then in okay and that way I

1474
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:01,000
one leg and then in okay and that way I
 

1475
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,829
one leg and then in okay and that way I
got to be all the way back okay and I'll

1476
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:04,839
got to be all the way back okay and I'll
 

1477
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,150
got to be all the way back okay and I'll
amplify that one you'll probably feel

1478
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:07,160
amplify that one you'll probably feel
 

1479
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,349
amplify that one you'll probably feel
better for it because you're going to

1480
00:48:08,349 --> 00:48:08,359
better for it because you're going to
 

1481
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:11,109
better for it because you're going to
bring your weight to that part you see

1482
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:11,119
bring your weight to that part you see
 

1483
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,630
bring your weight to that part you see
so you here you'll catch and then you'll

1484
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:13,640
so you here you'll catch and then you'll
 

1485
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,349
so you here you'll catch and then you'll
go down you see that but that's not what

1486
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:17,359
go down you see that but that's not what
 

1487
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,950
go down you see that but that's not what
what I did so I catch and I'm

1488
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:20,960
what I did so I catch and I'm
 

1489
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,030
what I did so I catch and I'm
here okay see if you can do that and see

1490
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:24,040
here okay see if you can do that and see
 

1491
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,950
here okay see if you can do that and see
where we get here try that one

1492
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:26,960
where we get here try that one
 

1493
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,870
where we get here try that one

1497
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:31,870

m for

1498

1499
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,030

and then what do you think that UK can

1500
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:35,040
and then what do you think that UK can
 

1501
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,789
and then what do you think that UK can
do let go you're going back cuz you're

1502
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:38,799
do let go you're going back cuz you're
 

1503
00:49:38,799 --> 00:49:40,870
do let go you're going back cuz you're
clearly not still on the back foot and

1504
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:40,880
clearly not still on the back foot and
 

1505
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:49,670
clearly not still on the back foot and
leaning on him

1506
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:49,680

 

1507
00:49:49,680 --> 00:50:12,150

okay there's that turn again

1508
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:12,160

 

1509
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,870

when to let go is when they're on the

1510
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:13,880
when to let go is when they're on the
 

1511
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:43,789
when to let go is when they're on the
back foot

1512
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:43,799

 

1513
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:45,430

let go when he's on the when he goes to

1514
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:45,440
let go when he's on the when he goes to
 

1515
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,390
let go when he's on the when he goes to
the back

1516
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:46,400
the back
 

1517
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:53,789
the back
F yeah just let go oh

back there okay but that that moment a
 

1523
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,390
back there okay but that that moment a
couple of things martially cuz we have a

1524
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:03,400
couple of things martially cuz we have a
 

1525
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,789
couple of things martially cuz we have a
an end right just like the new shooter

1526
00:51:06,789 --> 00:51:06,799
an end right just like the new shooter
 

1527
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:11,190
an end right just like the new shooter
I'll use that 3in Circle and to you know

1528
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:11,200
I'll use that 3in Circle and to you know
 

1529
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,349
I'll use that 3in Circle and to you know
allow you to work on your shooting

1530
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:13,359
allow you to work on your shooting
 

1531
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:16,309
allow you to work on your shooting
mechanics but you can't milk the drill

1532
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:16,319
mechanics but you can't milk the drill
 

1533
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,630
mechanics but you can't milk the drill
okay because there's a practical end

1534
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:18,640
okay because there's a practical end
 

1535
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:23,670
okay because there's a practical end
here well this is your push drrive that

1536
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:23,680
here well this is your push drrive that
 

1537
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,349
here well this is your push drrive that
we were working with the whole time

1538
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:25,359
we were working with the whole time
 

1539
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:28,109
we were working with the whole time
versus your step Drive okay you're doing

1540
00:51:28,109 --> 00:51:28,119
versus your step Drive okay you're doing
 

1541
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:31,309
versus your step Drive okay you're doing
she's doing her you see as opposed to

1542
00:51:31,309 --> 00:51:31,319
she's doing her you see as opposed to
 

1543
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:34,190
she's doing her you see as opposed to
I'm pushing into that so the

1544
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:34,200
I'm pushing into that so the
 

1545
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,390
I'm pushing into that so the
Jo all the uh attacks we doing is all

1546
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:38,400
Jo all the uh attacks we doing is all
 

1547
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,349
Jo all the uh attacks we doing is all
off the push drag not

1548
00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:40,359
off the push drag not
 

1549
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:43,470
off the push drag not
the uh the ability to come on one leg

1550
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:43,480
the uh the ability to come on one leg
 

1551
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,430
the uh the ability to come on one leg
means that I can move and I don't have

1552
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:46,440
means that I can move and I don't have
 

1553
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,109
means that I can move and I don't have
to wait for your weight to go off of me

1554
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:49,119
to wait for your weight to go off of me
 

1555
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,270
to wait for your weight to go off of me
for me to move again which came up in

1556
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:52,280
for me to move again which came up in
 

1557
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,910
for me to move again which came up in
the to the Backle I keep moving okay um

1558
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:56,920
the to the Backle I keep moving okay um
 

1559
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,870
the to the Backle I keep moving okay um
so it's that part's all in

1560
00:51:59,870 --> 00:51:59,880
so it's that part's all in
 

1561
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,789
so it's that part's all in
there but you can see the instructor is

1562
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:03,799
there but you can see the instructor is
 

1563
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:06,510
there but you can see the instructor is
constantly monitoring for what your

1564
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:06,520
constantly monitoring for what your
 

1565
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,510
constantly monitoring for what your
body's doing nobody's trying to be an

1566
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:09,520
body's doing nobody's trying to be an
 

1567
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,670
body's doing nobody's trying to be an
 nobody is trying to

1568
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:12,680
nobody is trying to
 

1569
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,470
nobody is trying to
say I think this is the way to go but we

1570
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:15,480
say I think this is the way to go but we
 

1571
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,510
say I think this is the way to go but we
do things we deviate from what we're

1572
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:17,520
do things we deviate from what we're
 

1573
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,150
do things we deviate from what we're
doing and the instructor has to bring

1574
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:19,160
doing and the instructor has to bring
 

1575
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,630
doing and the instructor has to bring
you back in like that shooter isn't

1576
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:21,640
you back in like that shooter isn't
 

1577
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,190
you back in like that shooter isn't
going you know what I actually think

1578
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:23,200
going you know what I actually think
 

1579
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,390
going you know what I actually think
it's better if I change my grip all the

1580
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:25,400
it's better if I change my grip all the
 

1581
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,470
it's better if I change my grip all the
time they just can't keep it together

1582
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:28,480
time they just can't keep it together
 

1583
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,390
time they just can't keep it together
okay so hence the other drills so this

1584
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:33,400
okay so hence the other drills so this
 

1585
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,470
okay so hence the other drills so this
one it catches more

1586
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:36,480
one it catches more
 

1587
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,030
one it catches more
immediate and the reason for this is

1588
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:39,040
immediate and the reason for this is
 

1589
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:44,109
immediate and the reason for this is
this is yes an exter external catch but

1590
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:44,119
this is yes an exter external catch but
 

1591
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,270
this is yes an exter external catch but
in order for it to function correctly

1592
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:47,280
in order for it to function correctly
 

1593
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,589
in order for it to function correctly
it's an internal catch cuz if you just

1594
00:52:49,589 --> 00:52:49,599
it's an internal catch cuz if you just
 

1595
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,430
it's an internal catch cuz if you just
do this you see you you did yield but

1596
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:54,440
do this you see you you did yield but
 

1597
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,870
do this you see you you did yield but
you didn't Yi all the way because

1598
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:56,880
you didn't Yi all the way because
 

1599
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,670
you didn't Yi all the way because
internally you weren't uh receiving the

1600
00:52:59,670 --> 00:52:59,680
internally you weren't uh receiving the
 

1601
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,829
internally you weren't uh receiving the
young so the drill four is more

1602
00:53:03,829 --> 00:53:03,839
young so the drill four is more
 

1603
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,870
young so the drill four is more
immediate and what will happen is if you

1604
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:06,880
immediate and what will happen is if you
 

1605
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,230
immediate and what will happen is if you
are doing it

1606
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:10,240
are doing it
 

1607
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,270
are doing it
externally externally there's not much

1608
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:13,280
externally externally there's not much
 

1609
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,750
externally externally there's not much
in her because there wasn't much y build

1610
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:17,760
in her because there wasn't much y build
 

1611
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,829
in her because there wasn't much y build
up and so there's not much projection

1612
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:21,839
up and so there's not much projection
 

1613
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,030
up and so there's not much projection
but internally you'll get more out of it

1614
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:25,040
but internally you'll get more out of it
 

1615
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,430
but internally you'll get more out of it
so it is the boat

1616
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:27,440
so it is the boat
 

1617
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:42,430
so it is the boat
exercise but shrunk okay all right try

1618

00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,670
more you stop you feel a stop and you
could see even your step drag where you

1782
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:37,680
could see even your step drag where you
 

1783
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,309
could see even your step drag where you
tried to put your weight onto that

1784
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:40,319
tried to put your weight onto that
 

1785
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:49,390
tried to put your weight onto that
foot there's the

1786
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:49,400

 

1787
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:53,230

turn okay so we'll go come back to

1788
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:53,240
turn okay so we'll go come back to
 

1789
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,670
turn okay so we'll go come back to
Maya and you're pushing

1790
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:56,680
Maya and you're pushing
 

1791
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,109
Maya and you're pushing
keep walking stopping keep going there's

1792
01:00:00,109 --> 01:00:00,119
keep walking stopping keep going there's
 

1793
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:08,029
keep walking stopping keep going there's
that step did you see she did that okay

1794
01:00:08,029 --> 01:00:08,039

 

1795
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:12,190

so's going to and again that that's this

1796
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:12,200
so's going to and again that that's this
 

1797
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:17,309
so's going to and again that that's this
that's this this okay the Desy is going

1798
01:00:17,309 --> 01:00:17,319
that's this this okay the Desy is going
 

1799
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:22,069
that's this this okay the Desy is going
to use their their mouth and their

1800
01:00:22,069 --> 01:00:22,079
to use their their mouth and their
 

1801
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,349
to use their their mouth and their
homolateral bracing structure that's

1802
01:00:24,349 --> 01:00:24,359
homolateral bracing structure that's
 

1803
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:26,349
homolateral bracing structure that's
what you're trying to do when you fall

1804
01:00:26,349 --> 01:00:26,359
what you're trying to do when you fall
 

1805
01:00:26,359 --> 01:00:29,670
what you're trying to do when you fall
okay so we take that

1806
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:29,680
okay so we take that
 

1807
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,270
okay so we take that
away we're in this sheing you

1808
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:34,280
away we're in this sheing you
 

1809
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,309
away we're in this sheing you
do she's squishing and I'm not going for

1810
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:37,319
do she's squishing and I'm not going for
 

1811
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:39,670
do she's squishing and I'm not going for
up I don't have that bracing angle

1812
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:39,680
up I don't have that bracing angle
 

1813
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,829
up I don't have that bracing angle
anymore and I'm just

1814
01:00:42,829 --> 01:00:42,839
anymore and I'm just
 

1815
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:46,190
anymore and I'm just
heree she can let go again let go when

1816
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:46,200
heree she can let go again let go when
 

1817
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,309
heree she can let go again let go when
you want and nothing happens okay the

1818
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:49,319
you want and nothing happens okay the
 

1819
01:00:49,319 --> 01:00:52,549
you want and nothing happens okay the
next Dr I'm M her and I'm not going

1820
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:52,559
next Dr I'm M her and I'm not going
 

1821
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:56,789
next Dr I'm M her and I'm not going
backward this is the last two so um I

1822
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:56,799
backward this is the last two so um I
 

1823
01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:02,430
backward this is the last two so um I
think you can do it one just hold two

1824
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:02,440
think you can do it one just hold two
 

1825
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,710
think you can do it one just hold two
okay because there's no movement you're

1826
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:04,720
okay because there's no movement you're
 

1827
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,910
okay because there's no movement you're
going to have to catch with your arm

1828
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:06,920
going to have to catch with your arm
 

1829
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,309
going to have to catch with your arm
catch with your arm bring your arm out

1830
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:09,319
catch with your arm bring your arm out
 

1831
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:12,190
catch with your arm bring your arm out
which I think helps amplify more that

1832
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:12,200
which I think helps amplify more that
 

1833
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:19,390
which I think helps amplify more that
you were bracing okay so hold in back

1834
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:19,400
you were bracing okay so hold in back
 

1835
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,630
you were bracing okay so hold in back
out okay

1836
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:22,640
out okay
 

1837
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,910
out okay
go and this concludes the standing set

1838
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:25,920
go and this concludes the standing set
 

1839
01:01:25,920 --> 01:02:20,069
go and this concludes the standing set
for

1840
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:20,079

 

1841
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:37,069

and move to the center
 

1845
01:02:39,039 --> 01:03:16,269
and move to the center
please try it again two more

1846
01:03:16,269 --> 01:03:16,279

 

1847
01:03:16,279 --> 01:03:18,309

okay so do you feel the muscle tension

1848
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:18,319
okay so do you feel the muscle tension
 

1849
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:21,109
okay so do you feel the muscle tension
yes okay so it comes from you going

1850
01:03:21,109 --> 01:03:21,119
yes okay so it comes from you going
 

1851
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,109

gooey to bring his hand back don't go

1852
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:25,119
gooey to bring his hand back don't go
 

1853
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,710
gooey to bring his hand back don't go
your hand comes back but it's not gooey

your hand comes back but it's not gooey
 

1855
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,870
your hand comes back but it's not gooey
do you understand it just comes

1856
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:31,880
do you understand it just comes
 

1857
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:35,710
do you understand it just comes
back he he's not falling into the space

1858
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:35,720
back he he's not falling into the space
 

1859
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,910
back he he's not falling into the space
you're bringing him into the

1860
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:38,920
you're bringing him into the
 

1861
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:42,710
you're bringing him into the
space so slow down how much how he

1862
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:42,720
space so slow down how much how he
 

1863
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,269
space so slow down how much how he
comes just bring it

1864
01:03:45,269 --> 01:03:45,279
comes just bring it
 

1865
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:49,510
comes just bring it
back then you bring it out now you're

1866
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:49,520
back then you bring it out now you're
 

1867
01:03:49,520 --> 01:04:12,910
back then you bring it out now you're
closer slow him down don't lean at him

1868
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:12,920

 

1869
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:38,269

that's better m

1871
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:39,910

that's fine this is better that you're

1872
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:39,920
that's fine this is better that you're
 

1873
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,109
that's fine this is better that you're
not turning

1874
01:04:42,109 --> 01:04:42,119
not turning
 

1875
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:45,630
not turning
now you're not turning because you can't

1876
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:45,640
now you're not turning because you can't
 

1877
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,549
now you're not turning because you can't
okay that's what the drill is meant to

1878
01:04:47,549 --> 01:04:47,559
okay that's what the drill is meant to
 

1879
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:49,470
okay that's what the drill is meant to
do just like I put that line on that

1880
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:49,480
do just like I put that line on that
 

1881
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,069
do just like I put that line on that
Shooter's grip it won't let her take her

1882
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:52,079
Shooter's grip it won't let her take her
 

1883
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,589
Shooter's grip it won't let her take her
hand apart you see say you can't turn

1884
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:54,599
hand apart you see say you can't turn
 

1885
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,589
hand apart you see say you can't turn
now and have it you turn now you're

1886
01:04:56,589 --> 01:04:56,599
now and have it you turn now you're
 

1887
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:16,630
now and have it you turn now you're
going to go backwards

1888
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:16,640

 

1889
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:20,150

immediately and the tension is way gross

1890
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:20,160
immediately and the tension is way gross
 

1891
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,309
immediately and the tension is way gross
and the distinction between gooey and

1892
01:05:22,309 --> 01:05:22,319
and the distinction between gooey and
 

1893
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,990
and the distinction between gooey and
tense is way gross you can tell so you

1894
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:25,000
tense is way gross you can tell so you
 

1895
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,789
tense is way gross you can tell so you
have toy you got to try to not go

1896
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:28,799
have toy you got to try to not go
 

1897
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,390
have toy you got to try to not go
gooey and not be tense you're just

1898
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:31,400
gooey and not be tense you're just
 

1899
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,430
gooey and not be tense you're just
moving

1900
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:32,440
moving
 

1901
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,829
moving
freely he's not the

1902
01:05:34,829 --> 01:05:34,839
freely he's not the
 

1903
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:37,589
freely he's not the
metric he's not the metric what you're

1904
01:05:37,589 --> 01:05:37,599
metric he's not the metric what you're
 

1905
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,750
metric he's not the metric what you're
doing inside you is the

1906
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:39,760
doing inside you is the
 

1907
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,029
doing inside you is the
metric so I'll show you when we're here

1908
01:05:42,029 --> 01:05:42,039
metric so I'll show you when we're here
 

1909
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:46,269
metric so I'll show you when we're here
so we're going and we took away all her

1910
01:05:46,269 --> 01:05:46,279
so we're going and we took away all her
 

1911
01:05:46,279 --> 01:05:49,510
so we're going and we took away all her
mechanics okay we

1912
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:49,520
mechanics okay we
 

1913
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,910
mechanics okay we
go there's a little lean

1914
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:52,920
go there's a little lean
 

1915
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:57,870
go there's a little lean
there you're doing great

1916
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:57,880

 

1917
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:01,150

okay she's organizing all this to get it

1918
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:01,160
okay she's organizing all this to get it
 

1919
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,510
okay she's organizing all this to get it
back out and this is

1920
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,520
back out and this is
 

1921
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,390
back out and this is
closer regardless that she was projected

1922
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:06,400
closer regardless that she was projected
 

1923
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,150
closer regardless that she was projected
or not this is much closer than you were

1924
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:09,160
or not this is much closer than you were
 

1925
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,990
or not this is much closer than you were
moving her before with your just your

1926
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:11,000
moving her before with your just your
 

1927
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,910
moving her before with your just your
stiff arm okay the fact that you're not

1928
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:13,920
stiff arm okay the fact that you're not
 

1929
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,589
stiff arm okay the fact that you're not
going backwards as you're moving your

1930
01:06:15,589 --> 01:06:15,599
going backwards as you're moving your
 

1931
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,549
going backwards as you're moving your
hand out is required you have to let go

1932
01:06:18,549 --> 01:06:18,559
hand out is required you have to let go
 

1933
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,430
hand out is required you have to let go
of all that okay try it again we'll

1934
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:21,440
of all that okay try it again we'll
 

1935
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:29,390
of all that okay try it again we'll
watch you guys watch for this

1936
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:29,400

 

1937
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,750

there's a little

she's pushing out okay CU she has to um

1942
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:40,240
she's pushing out okay CU she has to um
 

1943
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,470
she's pushing out okay CU she has to um
if we had uh even a bigger dude you're

1944
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:44,480
if we had uh even a bigger dude you're
 

1945
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,750
if we had uh even a bigger dude you're
not it's not going to work

1946
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:46,760
not it's not going to work
 

1947
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:50,829
not it's not going to work
okay

1948
01:06:50,829 --> 01:06:50,839

 

1949
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:53,510

um all right any uh let's stop there

1950
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:53,520
um all right any uh let's stop there
 

1951
01:06:53,520 --> 01:07:11,670
um all right any uh let's stop there
again for talking point question

1952
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:11,680

 

1953
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:16,910

tooing yes I don't know I even when we

1954
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:16,920
tooing yes I don't know I even when we
 

1955
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,150
tooing yes I don't know I even when we
seem to be kind of listing in the right

1956
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:19,160
seem to be kind of listing in the right
 

1957
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,069
seem to be kind of listing in the right
direction the other day and I was I was

1958
01:07:21,069 --> 01:07:21,079
direction the other day and I was I was
 

1959
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:26,670
direction the other day and I was I was
able to maintain someity I was feeling

1960
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:26,680

 

1961
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,470

uh you know not hardcore muscle

1962
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:29,480
uh you know not hardcore muscle
 

1963
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,990
uh you know not hardcore muscle
engagement but some pretty

1964
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:32,000
engagement but some pretty
 

1965
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,069
engagement but some pretty
palpable uh tension or pressure in the

1966
01:07:36,069 --> 01:07:36,079
palpable uh tension or pressure in the
 

1967
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,390
palpable uh tension or pressure in the
shoulder area yes I don't know if that

1968
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:39,400
shoulder area yes I don't know if that
 

1969
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,190
shoulder area yes I don't know if that
meant to go away or not yeah um and yeah

1970
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:43,200
meant to go away or not yeah um and yeah
 

1971
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,190
meant to go away or not yeah um and yeah
I don't know I just I just find yes okay

1972
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:46,200
I don't know I just I just find yes okay
 

1973
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:51,190
I don't know I just I just find yes okay
so that was in drill two yeah and we had

1974
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:51,200
so that was in drill two yeah and we had
 

1975
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:56,630
so that was in drill two yeah and we had
a tendency to turn on drill to so let's

1976
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:56,640
a tendency to turn on drill to so let's
 

1977
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,470
a tendency to turn on drill to so let's
ourselves where we're not turning that's

1978
01:07:59,470 --> 01:07:59,480
ourselves where we're not turning that's
 

1979
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,390
ourselves where we're not turning that's
what that's about and then the other as

1980
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:02,400
what that's about and then the other as
 

1981
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,269
what that's about and then the other as
we keep working we know okay I'm not

1982
01:08:05,269 --> 01:08:05,279
we keep working we know okay I'm not
 

1983
01:08:05,279 --> 01:08:07,910
we keep working we know okay I'm not
supposed to turn but it's possible to

1984
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:07,920
supposed to turn but it's possible to
 

1985
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,390
supposed to turn but it's possible to
maintain position in drill two without

1986
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:11,400
maintain position in drill two without
 

1987
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,549
maintain position in drill two without
actually fully doing drill two that's

1988
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:14,559
actually fully doing drill two that's
 

1989
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,229
actually fully doing drill two that's
why you need drill three and drill four

1990
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:16,239
why you need drill three and drill four
 

1991
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:19,950
why you need drill three and drill four
and you need to go on okay all of these

1992
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:19,960
and you need to go on okay all of these
 

1993
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:23,030
and you need to go on okay all of these
to to put it another way every single

1994
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,040
to to put it another way every single
 

1995
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,910
to to put it another way every single
drill can be done or

1996
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:26,920
drill can be done or
 

1997
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,749
drill can be done or
replicated under the untrained eye as if

1998
01:08:30,749 --> 01:08:30,759
replicated under the untrained eye as if
 

1999
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:33,430
replicated under the untrained eye as if
you were doing it correctly that's why

2000
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:33,440
you were doing it correctly that's why
 

2001
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,309
you were doing it correctly that's why
you need the following through but if

2002
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:36,319
you need the following through but if
 

2003
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:39,390
you need the following through but if
you can't maintain positional Integrity

2004
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:39,400
you can't maintain positional Integrity
 

2005
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:43,550
you can't maintain positional Integrity
of at all with out this

2006
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:43,560
of at all with out this
 

2007
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,110
of at all with out this
stance we are further

2008
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:46,120
stance we are further
 

2009
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,149
stance we are further
behind than

2010
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:48,159
behind than
 

2011
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:51,030
behind than
somebody uh than where we need to be so

2012
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:51,040
somebody uh than where we need to be so
 

2013
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:56,309
somebody uh than where we need to be so
let me put that better

2014
01:08:56,309 --> 01:08:56,319

 

2015
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:59,349

this is maintaining positional Integrity

2016
01:08:59,349 --> 01:08:59,359
this is maintaining positional Integrity
 

2017
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:02,030
this is maintaining positional Integrity
you see I have this a frame okay and

2018
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:02,040
you see I have this a frame okay and
 

2019
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,430
you see I have this a frame okay and
this little skeletal alignment that I'm

2020
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:05,440
this little skeletal alignment that I'm
 

2021
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,870
this little skeletal alignment that I'm
using this looks like I'm doing the

2022
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:07,880
using this looks like I'm doing the
 

2023
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:11,110
using this looks like I'm doing the
drill but I took this away from you and

2024
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:11,120
drill but I took this away from you and
 

2025
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,229
drill but I took this away from you and
I said maintain structural Integrity

2026
01:09:13,229 --> 01:09:13,239
I said maintain structural Integrity
 

2027
01:09:13,239 --> 01:09:16,149
I said maintain structural Integrity
here positional Integrity here I need to

2028
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:16,159
here positional Integrity here I need to
 

2029
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,829
here positional Integrity here I need to
be able to do

2030
01:09:17,829 --> 01:09:17,839
be able to do
 

2031
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:22,829
be able to do
this if I can't do it if I can only do

2032
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:22,839
this if I can't do it if I can only do
 

2033
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:26,390
this if I can't do it if I can only do
this if I can't do it here

2034
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:26,400
this if I can't do it here
 

2035
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,229
this if I can't do it here
then I am nowhere near being where I

2036
01:09:29,229 --> 01:09:29,239
then I am nowhere near being where I
 

2037
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:32,950
then I am nowhere near being where I
need to be so I as a teacher just wanted

2038
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:32,960
need to be so I as a teacher just wanted
 

2039
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,149
need to be so I as a teacher just wanted
you to be able to maintain structural

2040
01:09:35,149 --> 01:09:35,159
you to be able to maintain structural
 

2041
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:37,550
you to be able to maintain structural
Integrity cuz it's not so easy right cuz

2042
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:37,560
Integrity cuz it's not so easy right cuz
 

2043
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:40,030
Integrity cuz it's not so easy right cuz
you're you don't really have a base you

2044
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:40,040
you're you don't really have a base you
 

2045
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,349
you're you don't really have a base you
know what I mean and you don't really

2046
01:09:41,349 --> 01:09:41,359
know what I mean and you don't really
 

2047
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,030
know what I mean and you don't really
have skeletal alignment because we're

2048
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:43,040
have skeletal alignment because we're
 

2049
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:47,110
have skeletal alignment because we're
not we're not I saw one ioka that he's

2050
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:47,120
not we're not I saw one ioka that he's
 

2051
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,829
not we're not I saw one ioka that he's
he's standing like this and the and you

2052
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:49,839
he's standing like this and the and you
 

2053
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:52,189
he's standing like this and the and you
know saying this is internals and this

2054
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:52,199
know saying this is internals and this
 

2055
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:55,630
know saying this is internals and this
just skeletal alignment you know

2056
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:55,640
just skeletal alignment you know
 

2057
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,310
just skeletal alignment you know
so it's still accomplishing a lot that

2058
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:58,320
so it's still accomplishing a lot that
 

2059
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,790
so it's still accomplishing a lot that
you're not

2060
01:09:59,790 --> 01:09:59,800
you're not
 

2061
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,750
you're not
turning and I'll take it as a teacher

2062
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:02,760
turning and I'll take it as a teacher
 

2063
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:06,270
turning and I'll take it as a teacher
and then you know though

2064
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:06,280
and then you know though
 

2065
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,750
and then you know though
that I'm supposed to get rid of the

2066
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:08,760
that I'm supposed to get rid of the
 

2067
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,709
that I'm supposed to get rid of the
tension and then we keep working on that

2068
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:10,719
tension and then we keep working on that
 

2069
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:13,149
tension and then we keep working on that
tension and then you also know that the

2070
01:10:13,149 --> 01:10:13,159
tension and then you also know that the
 

2071
01:10:13,159 --> 01:10:15,510
tension and then you also know that the
shape doesn't matter so even on this

2072
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:15,520
shape doesn't matter so even on this
 

2073
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,590
shape doesn't matter so even on this
last drill

2074
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:17,600
last drill
 

2075
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,830
last drill
where you you can't turn yeah you

2076
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:21,840
where you you can't turn yeah you
 

2077
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,550
where you you can't turn yeah you
can you can turn you understand

2078
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:26,560
can you can turn you understand
 

2079
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,990
can you can turn you understand
just when I give you that pointer it's

2080
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:30,000
just when I give you that pointer it's
 

2081
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,110
just when I give you that pointer it's
like you're going to have to hold that

2082
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:32,120
like you're going to have to hold that
 

2083
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,950
like you're going to have to hold that
structal Integrity that I want you to be

2084
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:33,960
structal Integrity that I want you to be
 

2085
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,189
structal Integrity that I want you to be
able to hold without a

2086
01:10:36,189 --> 01:10:36,199
able to hold without a
 

2087
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:38,550
able to hold without a
bracing we're going to go on the teacher

2088
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:38,560
bracing we're going to go on the teacher
 

2089
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,270
bracing we're going to go on the teacher
is going to go on and

2090
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:40,280

2091
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,669
is going to go on and
go shape doesn't

go shape doesn't
matter you have to do it in any shape

2094
01:10:47,229 --> 01:10:47,239
matter you have to do it in any shape
 

2095
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,590
matter you have to do it in any shape
and you have to do it moving it has to

2096
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:50,600
and you have to do it moving it has to
 

2097
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,630
and you have to do it moving it has to
function at the speed like or it's

2098
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:52,640

um and then we just work there's more

2116
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,120
um and then we just work there's more
 

2117
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,310
um and then we just work there's more
drills there's more training to do keep

2118
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:22,320
drills there's more training to do keep
 

2119
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:28,030
drills there's more training to do keep
doing it um

2121
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,149

just like everything's in the standing

2122
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:30,159
just like everything's in the standing
 

2123
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,910

here everything is in the positional

2126
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:34,080
here everything is in the positional
 

2127
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,870
here everything is in the positional
drill if you can truly do the positional

2128
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:36,880
drill if you can truly do the positional
 

2129
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,470
drill if you can truly do the positional
drill without any tension you can do all

2130
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:40,480
drill without any tension you can do all

the other drills I only need the other
drills to make more gross my deviation

2134
01:11:46,149 --> 01:11:46,159
drills to make more gross my deviation
 

2135
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:50,270
drills to make more gross my deviation
from the standing drill okay um and so

2136
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:50,280
from the standing drill okay um and so
 

2137
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,070
from the standing drill okay um and so
you just that means then I'm going to

course there's tension there but better

2194
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:09,600
course there's tension there but better
 

2195
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,910
course there's tension there but better
than better than this and then we can

2196
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:11,920
than better than this and then we can
 

2197
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,430
than better than this and then we can
build on

2198
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:15,440

2267
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,189

gooey then we'll deal with the shoulder

2268
01:16:47,189 --> 01:16:47,199
gooey then we'll deal with the shoulder
 

2269
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:51,990
gooey then we'll deal with the shoulder
tension so what happens is you come

2270
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:52,000
tension so what happens is you come
 

2271
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,990
tension so what happens is you come
here and then you tense

2272
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:57,000

 

2273
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,830

release just like in the in the drill

the arm coming back forward that's where
 

2279
01:17:06,639 --> 01:17:10,629
the arm coming back forward that's where
that happens so we

2280
01:17:10,629 --> 01:17:10,639
that happens so we
 

2281
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:15,430
that happens so we
go even in what might be incorrect mind

2282
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:15,440
go even in what might be incorrect mind
 

2283

01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:51,040

 

2317
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,110

stall so you see now so now the teacher

2318
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:54,120
stall so you see now so now the teacher
 

2319
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,390
stall so you see now so now the teacher
presented Dilemma to you and it's how

2320
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:56,400
presented Dilemma to you and it's how
 

2321
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,550
presented Dilemma to you and it's how
serious you take it he did

2322
01:18:59,550 --> 01:18:59,560
serious you take it he did
 

2323
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:03,310
serious you take it he did
that there was one R where he did that

2324
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:03,320
that there was one R where he did that
 

2325
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,070
that there was one R where he did that
so then why is this so

2326
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:06,080
so then why is this so
 

2327
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:10,229
so then why is this so
necessary do you get it yes so I maybe I

2328
01:19:10,229 --> 01:19:10,239
necessary do you get it yes so I maybe I
 

2329
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:14,990
necessary do you get it yes so I maybe I
can't maybe I can't do it but

2330
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:15,000
can't maybe I can't do it but
 

2331
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,430
can't maybe I can't do it but
explain how that

2332
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:17,440
explain how that
 

2333
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:21,510
explain how that
worked you should be able to explain it

2334
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:21,520
worked you should be able to explain it
 

2335
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,030
worked you should be able to explain it
right so how did that work uh because

2336
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:25,040
right so how did that work uh because
 

2337
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,430
right so how did that work uh because
there

2338
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:26,440
there
 

2339
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,709
there
wasn't tension through the where where

2340
01:19:28,709 --> 01:19:28,719
wasn't tension through the where where
 

2341
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:31,790
wasn't tension through the where where
did the repelling energy come from

2342
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:31,800
did the repelling energy come from
 

2343
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,629
did the repelling energy come from
because it's not coming from that

2344
01:19:35,629 --> 01:19:35,639
because it's not coming from that
 

2345
01:19:35,639 --> 01:19:37,629
because it's not coming from that
contestation on his GP and trying to

2346
01:19:37,629 --> 01:19:37,639
contestation on his GP and trying to
 

2347
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:40,310
contestation on his GP and trying to
shove back because it's clearly not

2348
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:40,320
shove back because it's clearly not
 

2349
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:44,110
shove back because it's clearly not
there do you see that so where did the

2350
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:44,120
there do you see that so where did the
 

2351
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,950
there do you see that so where did the
displacing energy come from the rebound

2352
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:46,960
displacing energy come from the rebound
 

2353
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,510
displacing energy come from the rebound
from you letting in his initial aspect

2354
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:49,520
from you letting in his initial aspect
 

2355
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,390
from you letting in his initial aspect
got it and that's what's happening even

2356
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:52,400
got it and that's what's happening even
 

2357
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:57,030
got it and that's what's happening even
if I'm doing gross movements as AO which

2358
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:57,040
if I'm doing gross movements as AO which
 

2359
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,030
if I'm doing gross movements as AO which
I want you to do okay this is just a

2360
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:00,040
I want you to do okay this is just a
 

2361
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:04,110
I want you to do okay this is just a
demonstration like if you think you have

2362
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:04,120
demonstration like if you think you have
 

2363
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:09,350
demonstration like if you think you have
to do that struggle with this okay so

2364
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:09,360
to do that struggle with this okay so
 

2365
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,910
to do that struggle with this okay so
careful cuz right now on you we're

2366
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:12,920
careful cuz right now on you we're
 

2367
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:16,189
careful cuz right now on you we're
seeing the last

2368
01:20:16,189 --> 01:20:16,199

 

2369
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:19,550

Str and it's got to be relaxed okay and

2370
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:19,560
Str and it's got to be relaxed okay and
 

2371
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:22,750
Str and it's got to be relaxed okay and
the more relaxed you are the more y

2372
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:22,760
the more relaxed you are the more y
 

2373
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:26,070
the more relaxed you are the more y
comes in the more y goes out the more it

2374
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:26,080
comes in the more y goes out the more it
 

2375
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,390
comes in the more y goes out the more it
displaces the mass and that rebounding

2376
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:28,400
displaces the mass and that rebounding
 

2377
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,550
displaces the mass and that rebounding
energy okay so you got to you got to try

2378
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:31,560
energy okay so you got to you got to try
 

2379
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,990
energy okay so you got to you got to try
harder I he's going to be there of

2380
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:34,000
harder I he's going to be there of
 

2381
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,910
harder I he's going to be there of
course he's there how are you going to

2382
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:35,920
course he's there how are you going to
 

2383
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,189
course he's there how are you going to
project him out if he's not there but

2384
01:20:38,189 --> 01:20:38,199
project him out if he's not there but
 

2385
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:40,910
project him out if he's not there but
it's how do you move your hand in space

2386
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:40,920
it's how do you move your hand in space
 

2387
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:44,270
it's how do you move your hand in space
are you moving it all locked up or are

2388
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:44,280
are you moving it all locked up or are
 

2389
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:48,390
are you moving it all locked up or are
you just moving it okay so try it

2390
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:48,400
you just moving it okay so try it
 

2391
01:20:48,400 --> 01:21:02,030
you just moving it okay so try it
again two more

2392
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:02,040

 

2393
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,990

part of it is your

2394
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:04,000
part of it is your
 

2395
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,470
part of it is your
immobility your immobility is uh is

2396
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:07,480
immobility your immobility is uh is
 

2397
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:10,270
immobility your immobility is uh is
triggering your ego tripartite mind you

2398
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:10,280
triggering your ego tripartite mind you
 

2399
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,229
triggering your ego tripartite mind you
go right into that what's going on with

2400
01:21:12,229 --> 01:21:12,239
go right into that what's going on with
 

2401
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:15,669
go right into that what's going on with
your is it your knees or

2402
01:21:15,669 --> 01:21:15,679
your is it your knees or
 

2403
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:18,310
your is it your knees or
what probably just some my hips more

2404
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:18,320
what probably just some my hips more
 

2405
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:26,270
what probably just some my hips more
than knees all right

2406
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:26,280

 

2407
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:33,110

that's better just keep it

2408
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:33,120

 

2409
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,870

relaxed you got to yield so there's that

2410
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:35,880
relaxed you got to yield so there's that
 

2411
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:41,430
relaxed you got to yield so there's that
I only know

2412
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:41,440

 

2413
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,430

gooey and then you got to find the

2414
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:43,440
gooey and then you got to find the
 

2415
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,709
gooey and then you got to find the
center not the arm not the shoulder cuz

2416
01:21:45,709 --> 01:21:45,719
center not the arm not the shoulder cuz
 

2417
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:47,709
center not the arm not the shoulder cuz
the technique's in the center not in the

2418
01:21:47,709 --> 01:21:47,719
the technique's in the center not in the
 

2419
01:21:47,719 --> 01:21:49,669
the technique's in the center not in the
arm are you doing the mechanics if you

2420
01:21:49,669 --> 01:21:49,679
arm are you doing the mechanics if you
 

2421
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:52,430
arm are you doing the mechanics if you
stay in the arm yes but the Kon is in

2422
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:52,440
stay in the arm yes but the Kon is in
 

2423
01:21:52,440 --> 01:22:14,830
stay in the arm yes but the Kon is in
the center okay

2424
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:14,840

 

2425
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,790

and that that that that is the key hon

2426
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:17,800
