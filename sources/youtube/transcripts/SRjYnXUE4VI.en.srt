00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920

 

3
00:01:43,920 --> 00:02:02,630

that

4
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640

 

5
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,789

Gravity initial gravity just your own

6
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
Gravity initial gravity just your own
 

7
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,830
Gravity initial gravity just your own
mass dropping without changing the

8
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
mass dropping without changing the
 

9
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:29,910
mass dropping without changing the
shape.

10
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920

 

11
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:43,830

without changing the shape.

12
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840

 

13
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,790

Watch that.

14
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
Watch that.
 

15
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,070
Watch that.
Not too far up.

16
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080

 

17
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:59,030

Draws just like

18
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040

 

19
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,789

Let the weight go on the front.

20
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799

 

21
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,830

Let it go on the front.

22
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
Let it go on the front.
 

23
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:18,310
Let it go on the front.
Hang on.

24
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320

 

25
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,909

Okay.

26
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
Okay.
 

27
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,030
Okay.
All right.

28
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040

 

29
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,390

Let me

30
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400

 

31
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,070

You're going to have to reflect, but

32
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
You're going to have to reflect, but
 

33
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,510
You're going to have to reflect, but
I'll demonstrate it now. Okay.

34
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
I'll demonstrate it now. Okay.
 

35
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,030
I'll demonstrate it now. Okay.
You could feel me pulling you,

36
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
You could feel me pulling you,
 

37
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,030
You could feel me pulling you,
but how much grip was I did I have? Can

38
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
but how much grip was I did I have? Can
 

39
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,590
but how much grip was I did I have? Can
you recolctly?

40
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
you recolctly?
 

41
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,749
you recolctly?
Okay, let's watch. You're going to watch

42
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
Okay, let's watch. You're going to watch
 

43
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,430
Okay, let's watch. You're going to watch
my grip. You're going to do exactly the

44
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
my grip. You're going to do exactly the
 

45
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,590
my grip. You're going to do exactly the
same thing, but you guys are focusing on

46
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
same thing, but you guys are focusing on
 

47
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,189
same thing, but you guys are focusing on
me. Okay.

48
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199

 

49
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,590

Beautiful. Okay. How much?

50
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
Beautiful. Okay. How much?
 

51
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,590
Beautiful. Okay. How much?
Isn't that

52
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
Isn't that
 

53
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,710
Isn't that
getting stronger? Right.

54
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
getting stronger? Right.
 

55
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,790
getting stronger? Right.
Getting stronger.

56
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
Getting stronger.
 

57
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,870
Getting stronger.
Stronger.

58
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
Stronger.
 

59
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,350
Stronger.
You feel it? It feels almost like that,

60
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
You feel it? It feels almost like that,
 

61
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,710
You feel it? It feels almost like that,
but it's not. It's not there. Okay. So,

62
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720

 

63
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,870

there's no grip at all right now. You

64
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
there's no grip at all right now. You
 

65
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,350
there's no grip at all right now. You
can feel it's not that he's pushing out.

66
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
can feel it's not that he's pushing out.
 

67
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,830
can feel it's not that he's pushing out.
You've seen people go, "Uh, oh, he's

68
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
You've seen people go, "Uh, oh, he's
 

69
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,830
You've seen people go, "Uh, oh, he's
he's pushing."

70
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
he's pushing."
 

71
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,670
he's pushing."
I can't remember who did that. I think

72
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
I can't remember who did that. I think
 

73
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,909
I can't remember who did that. I think
it was Ramsey Dwey.

74
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
it was Ramsey Dwey.
 

75
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,230
it was Ramsey Dwey.
Ramsey Dwey did something. So they were

76
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
Ramsey Dwey did something. So they were
 

77
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,070
Ramsey Dwey did something. So they were
like, "Well, he's pushing out and that's

78
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
like, "Well, he's pushing out and that's
 

79
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:50,710
like, "Well, he's pushing out and that's
why." But he's not pushing out

80
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720

 

81
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,110

back against it. And you got strong. Put

82
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
back against it. And you got strong. Put
 

83
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,310
back against it. And you got strong. Put
it on your front foot.

84
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,320

 

85
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,629

You feel it? You feel that?

86
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639

 

87
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,749

They so sticky.

88
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
They so sticky.
 

89
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,790
They so sticky.
Okay. So, we'll have you come up and you

90
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
Okay. So, we'll have you come up and you
 

91
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,350
Okay. So, we'll have you come up and you
can feel what I'm talking about

92
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360

 

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,830

and you you could watch your reaction

94
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
and you you could watch your reaction
 

95
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,790
and you you could watch your reaction
too. Okay. So, when you felt it pull you

96
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
too. Okay. So, when you felt it pull you
 

97
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,870
too. Okay. So, when you felt it pull you
you went like that and then what was the

98
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
you went like that and then what was the
 

99
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,110
you went like that and then what was the
effect? You increase the adhesion

100
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
effect? You increase the adhesion
 

101
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,189
effect? You increase the adhesion
because the yong value is going up.

102
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
because the yong value is going up.
 

103
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,390
because the yong value is going up.
Okay.

104
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400

 

105
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,150

I'm not hooking. I'm not doing this.

106
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160

 

107
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:47,909

You saw his head move forward. You see?

108
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:47,919

 

109
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,629

And what you can see is the uh let's

110
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
And what you can see is the uh let's
 

111
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,950
And what you can see is the uh let's
let's do this. Which way is he leaning?

112
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
let's do this. Which way is he leaning?
 

113
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,670
let's do this. Which way is he leaning?
Do you think? Yes, cuz 4:00.

114
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
Do you think? Yes, cuz 4:00.
 

115
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,790
Do you think? Yes, cuz 4:00.
You're like going that way. Okay. Uh, so

116
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
You're like going that way. Okay. Uh, so
 

117
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,670
You're like going that way. Okay. Uh, so
which way do you think I'm taking you?

118
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
which way do you think I'm taking you?
 

119
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,029
which way do you think I'm taking you?
10:00. Do you understand? But you can

120
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
10:00. Do you understand? But you can
 

121
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,150
10:00. Do you understand? But you can
feel the adhesion.

122
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160

 

123
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:23,430

You see? Okay. So yesterday

124
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440

 

125
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,390

we were doing

126
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
we were doing
 

127
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,430
we were doing
this. Okay.

128
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
this. Okay.
 

129
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,070
this. Okay.
And we using spinal displacement

130
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080

 

131
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,430

to look like you're pushing into me and

132
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
to look like you're pushing into me and
 

133
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,670
to look like you're pushing into me and
that's what made it stick. Do do you

134
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
that's what made it stick. Do do you
 

135
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,110
that's what made it stick. Do do you
understand? But I told you it's not

136
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,120
understand? But I told you it's not
 

137
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,189
understand? But I told you it's not
that. It's that I'm matching that yaw

138
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
that. It's that I'm matching that yaw
 

139
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,309
that. It's that I'm matching that yaw
value is what I'm doing. Okay. And then

140
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
value is what I'm doing. Okay. And then
 

141
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,270
value is what I'm doing. Okay. And then
it sticks.

142
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
it sticks.
 

143
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,749
it sticks.
I don't know why. I have the theory. I

144
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
I don't know why. I have the theory. I
 

145
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,670
I don't know why. I have the theory. I
know it works. I can feel it and I can

146
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
know it works. I can feel it and I can
 

147
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,790
know it works. I can feel it and I can
feel what it does to my mind. Okay?

148
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
feel what it does to my mind. Okay?
 

149
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,350
feel what it does to my mind. Okay?
And I can feel his mind as I'm doing it.

150
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
And I can feel his mind as I'm doing it.
 

151
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,110
And I can feel his mind as I'm doing it.
Like what's he what's he feeling that's

152
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
Like what's he what's he feeling that's
 

153
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,029
Like what's he what's he feeling that's
making him you know like Adam always

154
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
making him you know like Adam always
 

155
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,629
making him you know like Adam always
says makes him uncomfortable. I can feel

156
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
says makes him uncomfortable. I can feel
 

157
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,469
says makes him uncomfortable. I can feel
the tension. I can feel the reactionary

158
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
the tension. I can feel the reactionary
 

159
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,070
the tension. I can feel the reactionary
force to the experience. Okay. Um

160
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080

 

161
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,309

but if I press harder into him, I go

162
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
but if I press harder into him, I go
 

163
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,909
but if I press harder into him, I go
over the yong value. I won't adhere and

164
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
over the yong value. I won't adhere and
 

165
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,990
over the yong value. I won't adhere and
I end up now losing the gravitational

166
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
I end up now losing the gravitational
 

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,430
I end up now losing the gravitational
force and I start using anatomical

168
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
force and I start using anatomical
 

169
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,389
force and I start using anatomical
things to manipulate the body. Okay.

170
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
things to manipulate the body. Okay.
 

171
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,829
things to manipulate the body. Okay.
What we're doing here in this drill

172
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
What we're doing here in this drill
 

173
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,589
What we're doing here in this drill
is

174
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
is
 

175
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,029
is
that force already exists in him. It

176
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
that force already exists in him. It
 

177
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,070
that force already exists in him. It
exists all the time. It's just so subtle

178
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
exists all the time. It's just so subtle
 

179
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,110
exists all the time. It's just so subtle
right now. You see? But if I match the

180
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
right now. You see? But if I match the
 

181
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,350
right now. You see? But if I match the
the yong aspect that this gravity this

182
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
the yong aspect that this gravity this
 

183
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,750
the yong aspect that this gravity this
descending force of his matter if I go

184
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
descending force of his matter if I go
 

185
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,150
descending force of his matter if I go
too much no too little no I just have to

186
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
too much no too little no I just have to
 

187
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,829
too much no too little no I just have to
match it.

188
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839

 

189
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,509

There's the stick right here. Okay. I'm

190
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
There's the stick right here. Okay. I'm
 

191
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,230
There's the stick right here. Okay. I'm
just matching that.

192
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
just matching that.
 

193
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:21,190
just matching that.
There it says pull back on me.

194
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200

 

195
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,590

And I'm going to fluctuate beyond value

196
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600
And I'm going to fluctuate beyond value
 

197
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,990
And I'm going to fluctuate beyond value
and you'll feel

198
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
and you'll feel
 

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,190
and you'll feel
slippery

200
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200

 

201
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,430

under it now. There's a sliding

202
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440

 

203
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,070

stick

204
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
stick
 

205
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,910
stick
can go the other way too. So if I go

206
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
can go the other way too. So if I go
 

207
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,710
can go the other way too. So if I go
live but you can't go

208
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720

 

209
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,030

you can't move.

210
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040

 

211
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,550

Okay.

212
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
Okay.
 

213
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,790
Okay.
Understand? Okay.

214
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
Understand? Okay.
 

215
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,670
Understand? Okay.
So

216
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
So
 

217
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,389
So
what we want to do in this drill you can

218
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
what we want to do in this drill you can
 

219
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:14,069
what we want to do in this drill you can
use your grab. Okay. is not go pull

220
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
use your grab. Okay. is not go pull
 

221
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,670
use your grab. Okay. is not go pull
don't go like that you see what I'm

222
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
don't go like that you see what I'm
 

223
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,790
don't go like that you see what I'm
doing okay

224
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
doing okay
 

225
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,870
doing okay
as I feel him doing that from inside

226
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
as I feel him doing that from inside
 

227
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,910
as I feel him doing that from inside
my I'm vectoring this force onto my foot

228
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
my I'm vectoring this force onto my foot
 

229
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,710
my I'm vectoring this force onto my foot
under this foot okay not like this

230
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720

 

231
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,870

he's pulling you'll see there's No

232
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
he's pulling you'll see there's No
 

233
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,509
he's pulling you'll see there's No
movement in my body. Meaning I'm not

234
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
movement in my body. Meaning I'm not
 

235
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,949
movement in my body. Meaning I'm not
doing this. Okay. And you you will be

236
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
doing this. Okay. And you you will be
 

237
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,430
doing this. Okay. And you you will be
able to feel that front. that front

238
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
able to feel that front. that front
 

239
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,590
able to feel that front. that front
foot. Okay. It probably feel like that.

240
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
foot. Okay. It probably feel like that.
 

241
00:10:49,600 --> 00:11:02,710
foot. Okay. It probably feel like that.
Okay.

242
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720

 

243
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,430

Okay.

244
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
Okay.
 

245
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,790
Okay.
And I'll come around and guide you

246
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
And I'll come around and guide you
 

247
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:15,590
And I'll come around and guide you
there.

248
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600

 

249
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,150

We're going to take their pulling force

250
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
We're going to take their pulling force
 

251
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,190
We're going to take their pulling force
and go down onto the front foot

252
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200

 

253
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,710

by releasing.

254
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720

 

255
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,350

If you go tense, your shoulders are

256
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
If you go tense, your shoulders are
 

257
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,590
If you go tense, your shoulders are
going to leverage over that fulcrum. The

258
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
going to leverage over that fulcrum. The
 

259
00:11:33,600 --> 00:12:18,069
going to leverage over that fulcrum. The
foot becomes a fulcrum.

260
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:18,079

 

261
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,310

feel this is all it is just a force

262
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
feel this is all it is just a force
 

263
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,190
feel this is all it is just a force
exercise

264
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200

 

265
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,710

revectoring the force to the front foot

266
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
revectoring the force to the front foot
 

267
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,910
revectoring the force to the front foot
making sure I don't tense so that the

268
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
making sure I don't tense so that the
 

269
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,949
making sure I don't tense so that the
gravity passes through me

270
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
gravity passes through me
 

271
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:42,949
gravity passes through me
there inertia passes through.

272
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959

 

273
00:12:42,959 --> 00:13:10,310

Virginia, you're going to grab

274
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320

 

275
00:13:10,320 --> 00:14:09,990

Yeah,

276
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000

 

277
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,430

How much

278
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440

 

279
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,870

again? How I stand?

280
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
again? How I stand?
 

281
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:44,389
again? How I stand?
She goes,

282
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399

 

283
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,790

how are you now?

284
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
how are you now?
 

285
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,030
how are you now?
Okay,

286
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
Okay,
 

287
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,389
Okay,
so

288
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
so
 

289
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,269
so
No, none of that.

290
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279
No, none of that.
 

291
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,509
No, none of that.
What I'm experiencing

292
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519
What I'm experiencing
 

293
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,790
What I'm experiencing
as she pulls harder like she she makes

294
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
as she pulls harder like she she makes
 

295
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,629
as she pulls harder like she she makes
little jumps. Okay. And the jump

296
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
little jumps. Okay. And the jump
 

297
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,990
little jumps. Okay. And the jump
the line goes and the flexion comes then

298
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
the line goes and the flexion comes then
 

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,389
the line goes and the flexion comes then
the skill comes and release just like in

300
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
the skill comes and release just like in
 

301
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,509
the skill comes and release just like in
Zen. And then I but it's

302
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
Zen. And then I but it's
 

303
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,069
Zen. And then I but it's
instantaneously. Do you see? So the the

304
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
instantaneously. Do you see? So the the
 

305
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,189
instantaneously. Do you see? So the the
effect is the egoic mind. She pulls. I I

306
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
effect is the egoic mind. She pulls. I I
 

307
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,509
effect is the egoic mind. She pulls. I I
contest. But then the skill comes in.

308
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
contest. But then the skill comes in.
 

309
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,470
contest. But then the skill comes in.
Immediately it lets go. Okay. And so she

310
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
Immediately it lets go. Okay. And so she
 

311
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,069
Immediately it lets go. Okay. And so she
can't feel the pulsing. I can feel the

312
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
can't feel the pulsing. I can feel the
 

313
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,710
can't feel the pulsing. I can feel the
pulsing of the release. You got You

314
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
pulsing of the release. You got You
 

315
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,310
pulsing of the release. You got You
reacted. You release. You reacted. You

316
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
reacted. You release. You reacted. You
 

317
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,389
reacted. You release. You reacted. You
release. But she can't feel it. It's

318
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
release. But she can't feel it. It's
 

319
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,389
release. But she can't feel it. It's
just that it's that quick. Okay. Um but

320
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
just that it's that quick. Okay. Um but
 

321
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,069
just that it's that quick. Okay. Um but
she's now at the end like

322
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
she's now at the end like
 

323
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,990
she's now at the end like
she can go to 10, whatever. She can go

324
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
she can go to 10, whatever. She can go
 

325
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,189
she can go to 10, whatever. She can go
to 11. It's not going to move me. Okay.

326
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
to 11. It's not going to move me. Okay.
 

327
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,870
to 11. It's not going to move me. Okay.
But it's not going to I'm never going to

328
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
But it's not going to I'm never going to
 

329
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,509
But it's not going to I'm never going to
go like that. So what I'm going to do

330
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
go like that. So what I'm going to do
 

331
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,110
go like that. So what I'm going to do
what I want you to do is

332
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
what I want you to do is
 

333
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,269
what I want you to do is
don't brace.

334
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
don't brace.
 

335
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,150
don't brace.
You're just standing.

336
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
You're just standing.
 

337
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,189
You're just standing.
And you will she will operate slower,

338
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:03,199
And you will she will operate slower,
 

339
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,749
And you will she will operate slower,
even slower. Okay? So that when you feel

340
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759
even slower. Okay? So that when you feel
 

341
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,910
even slower. Okay? So that when you feel
the triggering, oh, there it was. You're

342
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
the triggering, oh, there it was. You're
 

343
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,990
the triggering, oh, there it was. You're
going to drop that.

344
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
going to drop that.
 

345
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,749
going to drop that.
Okay? You got it? And you're going to

346
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
Okay? You got it? And you're going to
 

347
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,629
Okay? You got it? And you're going to
give them time to release. Okay? Because

348
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
give them time to release. Okay? Because
 

349
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,829
give them time to release. Okay? Because
that's the skill. The skill is the egoic

350
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
that's the skill. The skill is the egoic
 

351
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,629
that's the skill. The skill is the egoic
mind function in the dichotomy. She's

352
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
mind function in the dichotomy. She's
 

353
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,590
mind function in the dichotomy. She's
pulling me. Don't get pulled. And then

354
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
pulling me. Don't get pulled. And then
 

355
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,990
pulling me. Don't get pulled. And then
surrender to it. Release to it. Unself

356
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
surrender to it. Release to it. Unself
 

357
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,590
surrender to it. Release to it. Unself
to it. How how let the gravity if you

358
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
to it. How how let the gravity if you
 

359
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,230
to it. How how let the gravity if you
feel the gravity flowing through you and

360
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
feel the gravity flowing through you and
 

361
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,189
feel the gravity flowing through you and
you will get heavier. You see your mind

362
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
you will get heavier. You see your mind
 

363
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,509
you will get heavier. You see your mind
will drop too. Your body will drop.

364
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
will drop too. Your body will drop.
 

365
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,990
will drop too. Your body will drop.
You'll get heavier. Okay? That's just

366
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
You'll get heavier. Okay? That's just
 

367
00:16:40,000 --> 00:17:01,509
You'll get heavier. Okay? That's just
the skill. All right? Let's try

368
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519

 

369
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:11,669

to stop and train.

370
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:11,679

 

371
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,630

We want to feel the vertical gravity

372
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
We want to feel the vertical gravity
 

373
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,590
We want to feel the vertical gravity
working through us despite the lateral

374
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:17,600
working through us despite the lateral
 

375
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,470
working through us despite the lateral
gravity

376
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
gravity
 

377
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,350
gravity
working on us.

378
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
working on us.
 

379
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,390
working on us.
We have to feel the tissue drop just

380
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
We have to feel the tissue drop just
 

381
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,870
We have to feel the tissue drop just
like in zazen just like that last

382
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
like in zazen just like that last
 

383
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:43,990
like in zazen just like that last
exercise.

384
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,000

 

385
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,150

Watch your chin. Set yourself up for

386
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
Watch your chin. Set yourself up for
 

387
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:53,430
Watch your chin. Set yourself up for
success.

388
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440

 

389
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:05,669

Once tension comes, release it.

390
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679

 

391
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,070

Do it like twice in a row and then

392
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
Do it like twice in a row and then
 

393
00:18:08,080 --> 00:19:36,310
Do it like twice in a row and then
switch rolls.

394
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320

 

395
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:43,430

Okay. Any uh observations?

396
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440

 

397
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,549

Yes. Yeah. So, and I always say this

398
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
Yes. Yeah. So, and I always say this
 

399
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,870
Yes. Yeah. So, and I always say this
like when when you come down to it, it's

400
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
like when when you come down to it, it's
 

401
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,710
like when when you come down to it, it's
really in a a skill at a sensibility.

402
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
really in a a skill at a sensibility.
 

403
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,110
really in a a skill at a sensibility.
Do you see? So, I'm just not I'm not

404
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
Do you see? So, I'm just not I'm not
 

405
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,669
Do you see? So, I'm just not I'm not
aware of the gravitational effect on me,

406
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
aware of the gravitational effect on me,
 

407
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,230
aware of the gravitational effect on me,
nor am I aware of my contesting of it.

408
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,240
nor am I aware of my contesting of it.
 

409
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,390
nor am I aware of my contesting of it.
Just like I'm not aware that I'm shoving

410
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400
Just like I'm not aware that I'm shoving
 

411
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,710
Just like I'm not aware that I'm shoving
trying to shove down that elbow. I'm not

412
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
trying to shove down that elbow. I'm not
 

413
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,470
trying to shove down that elbow. I'm not
aware that there I should just let him

414
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,480
aware that there I should just let him
 

415
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,350
aware that there I should just let him
get up. You know what I mean? Um, so

416
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360
get up. You know what I mean? Um, so
 

417
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,590
get up. You know what I mean? Um, so
yeah, there's a sensibility in it like

418
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
yeah, there's a sensibility in it like
 

419
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,070
yeah, there's a sensibility in it like
you can feel their pulse, you can feel

420
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
you can feel their pulse, you can feel
 

421
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,470
you can feel their pulse, you can feel
them get uncomfortable, right? You can

422
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
them get uncomfortable, right? You can
 

423
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,150
them get uncomfortable, right? You can
feel all that kind of stuff. Um, and so

424
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:22,160
feel all that kind of stuff. Um, and so
 

425
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,270
feel all that kind of stuff. Um, and so
concentrically the communion keeps

426
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
concentrically the communion keeps
 

427
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,190
concentrically the communion keeps
happening. Do you see the communion

428
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,200
happening. Do you see the communion
 

429
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,510
happening. Do you see the communion
keeps happening? I we become one. We're

430
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
keeps happening? I we become one. We're
 

431
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,270
keeps happening? I we become one. We're
not dichomous anymore. Okay? By how I

432
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,280
not dichomous anymore. Okay? By how I
 

433
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,630
not dichomous anymore. Okay? By how I
respond to it. All right? So

434
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:36,640
respond to it. All right? So
 

435
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,950
respond to it. All right? So
if you we do this again,

436
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
if you we do this again,
 

437
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,590
if you we do this again,
okay, and I this is what you're doing.

438
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600
okay, and I this is what you're doing.
 

439
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,110
okay, and I this is what you're doing.
Everything looked a lot better. No one

440
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
Everything looked a lot better. No one
 

441
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,390
Everything looked a lot better. No one
was doing that kind of stuff. Okay. And

442
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,400
was doing that kind of stuff. Okay. And
 

443
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,870
was doing that kind of stuff. Okay. And
everyone was pulling harder. Would you

444
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:52,880
everyone was pulling harder. Would you
 

445
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,830
everyone was pulling harder. Would you
agree? Okay. So somehow it's it's

446
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:55,840
agree? Okay. So somehow it's it's
 

447
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,669
agree? Okay. So somehow it's it's
working. We have to address how don't go

448
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
working. We have to address how don't go
 

449
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,789
working. We have to address how don't go
back into the old institutional ways of

450
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:02,799
back into the old institutional ways of
 

451
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,110
back into the old institutional ways of
trying to understand this. Okay. But if

452
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,120
trying to understand this. Okay. But if
 

453
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,750
trying to understand this. Okay. But if
we pay attention

454
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
we pay attention
 

455
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,510
we pay attention
in this demonstration which seemed like

456
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
in this demonstration which seemed like
 

457
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,909
in this demonstration which seemed like
to come out of nowhere uh I am

458
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
to come out of nowhere uh I am
 

459
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,750
to come out of nowhere uh I am
generating that adhesion. There it is

460
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
generating that adhesion. There it is
 

461
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,870
generating that adhesion. There it is
right there. Right. Okay. And you can

462
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
right there. Right. Okay. And you can
 

463
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,110
right there. Right. Okay. And you can
see that when I move her, the whole

464
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
see that when I move her, the whole
 

465
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,750
see that when I move her, the whole
thing moves

466
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:29,760
thing moves
 

467
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,750
thing moves
versus when I pull her shoulder like

468
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
versus when I pull her shoulder like
 

469
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,750
versus when I pull her shoulder like
that. Do you see that? Okay. So, same

470
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:37,760
that. Do you see that? Okay. So, same
 

471
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,149
that. Do you see that? Okay. So, same
thing happens when she

472
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
thing happens when she
 

473
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,430
thing happens when she
is pulling when she's increasing the

474
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,440
is pulling when she's increasing the
 

475
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,070
is pulling when she's increasing the
force by what I'm doing.

476
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,080
force by what I'm doing.
 

477
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,909
force by what I'm doing.
There you go. Okay.

478
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
There you go. Okay.
 

479
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,669
There you go. Okay.
She has unified her mass in in what

480
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
She has unified her mass in in what
 

481
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,830
She has unified her mass in in what
we're doing.

482
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:57,840
we're doing.
 

483
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,710
we're doing.
Do you understand that? Okay. As long as

484
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
Do you understand that? Okay. As long as
 

485
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,990
Do you understand that? Okay. As long as
I accept what's happening to her body

486
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,000
I accept what's happening to her body
 

487
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,590
I accept what's happening to her body
and not try to pull it or anything like

488
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
and not try to pull it or anything like
 

489
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,549
and not try to pull it or anything like
that. Okay? Does that make sense? So,

490
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:12,559
that. Okay? Does that make sense? So,
 

491
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,149
that. Okay? Does that make sense? So,
the way I'm going to have you do this

492
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:14,159
the way I'm going to have you do this
 

493
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,870
the way I'm going to have you do this
one is you'll get to where you were

494
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:16,880
one is you'll get to where you were
 

495
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,710
one is you'll get to where you were
getting. Okay? Until you go, you can

496
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
getting. Okay? Until you go, you can
 

497
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,350
getting. Okay? Until you go, you can
Start to feel her center of gravity.

498
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
Start to feel her center of gravity.
 

499
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,230
Start to feel her center of gravity.
Okay, it's going. So, you can feel it.

500
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,240
Okay, it's going. So, you can feel it.
 

501
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,909
Okay, it's going. So, you can feel it.
And what I want you to do now is just

502
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:31,919
And what I want you to do now is just
 

503
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,430
And what I want you to do now is just
slowly move the center of gravity. I

504
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:35,440
slowly move the center of gravity. I
 

505
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,830
slowly move the center of gravity. I
moved it. Okay. From here, just pulling.

506
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:39,840
moved it. Okay. From here, just pulling.
 

507
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,549
moved it. Okay. From here, just pulling.
I do everything I was doing before. Only

508
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
I do everything I was doing before. Only
 

509
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,029
I do everything I was doing before. Only
thing I'm going to do is move that

510
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,039
thing I'm going to do is move that
 

511
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,630
thing I'm going to do is move that
center of gravity very slowly

512
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
center of gravity very slowly
 

513
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,870
center of gravity very slowly
toward the front.

514
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
toward the front.
 

515
00:22:50,880 --> 00:23:47,590
toward the front.
Does that make sense? Okay, try

516
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,600

 

517
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,789

You can't come off of what you're doing.

518
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:50,799
You can't come off of what you're doing.
 

519
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,190
You can't come off of what you're doing.
If I

520
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,200
If I
 

521
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,110
If I
You can't come off of what you're doing.

522
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
You can't come off of what you're doing.
 

523
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,549
You can't come off of what you're doing.
So, let's say uh we generate the energy.

524
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:58,559
So, let's say uh we generate the energy.
 

525
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,669
So, let's say uh we generate the energy.
Okay, there there's that. I feel his

526
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:01,679
Okay, there there's that. I feel his
 

527
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,149
Okay, there there's that. I feel his
unification and then I try I come out of

528
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:04,159
unification and then I try I come out of
 

529
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,750
unification and then I try I come out of
what I'm doing. Do you see what I'm

530
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
what I'm doing. Do you see what I'm
 

531
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,990
what I'm doing. Do you see what I'm
doing? You get what I'm saying here?

532
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
doing? You get what I'm saying here?
 

533
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,510
doing? You get what I'm saying here?
Okay. So, we we're here.

534
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
Okay. So, we we're here.
 

535
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,390
Okay. So, we we're here.
We generate.

536
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
We generate.
 

537
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,230
We generate.
And what I would recommend is that you

538
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,240
And what I would recommend is that you
 

539
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,630
And what I would recommend is that you
barely move this thing.

540
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640

 

541
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,230

I'm barely moving it. That to me train

542
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
I'm barely moving it. That to me train
 

543
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,149
I'm barely moving it. That to me train
to to me actually trained. I I feel his

544
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:28,159
to to me actually trained. I I feel his
 

545
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,310
to to me actually trained. I I feel his
center already. Okay. I'm just

546
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,320
center already. Okay. I'm just
 

547
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,909
center already. Okay. I'm just
confirming it with the tiny bit of

548
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:33,919
confirming it with the tiny bit of
 

549
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,430
confirming it with the tiny bit of
movement. So tiny right there. Okay, you

550
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
movement. So tiny right there. Okay, you
 

551
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,070
movement. So tiny right there. Okay, you
understand? So don't you're not trying

552
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
understand? So don't you're not trying
 

553
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,909
understand? So don't you're not trying
to throw him like that. You saw how he

554
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
to throw him like that. You saw how he
 

555
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,230
to throw him like that. You saw how he
leaned. Okay, I'm just trying to that

556
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,240
leaned. Okay, I'm just trying to that
 

557
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,549
leaned. Okay, I'm just trying to that
force is on us.

558
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:48,559
force is on us.
 

559
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,430
force is on us.
We have communes and I'm just moving

560
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,440
We have communes and I'm just moving
 

561
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,710
We have communes and I'm just moving
that thing ever so tiny. See his head?

562
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:56,720
that thing ever so tiny. See his head?
 

563
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,230
that thing ever so tiny. See his head?
Okay.

564
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,240

 

565
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,350

Okay. Now let for for you

566
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,360
Okay. Now let for for you
 

567
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,310
Okay. Now let for for you
What will happen is

568
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:08,320
What will happen is
 

569
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,549
What will happen is
that when they feel that they they will

570
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559
that when they feel that they they will
 

571
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,630
that when they feel that they they will
react again. That's what people do.

572
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,640
react again. That's what people do.
 

573
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,950
react again. That's what people do.
Okay? And if I keep what I'm doing, the

574
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:16,960
Okay? And if I keep what I'm doing, the
 

575
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,350
Okay? And if I keep what I'm doing, the
adhesion gets tighter. So watch the

576
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
adhesion gets tighter. So watch the
 

577
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,230
adhesion gets tighter. So watch the
watch that the the the

578
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
watch that the the the
 

579
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,510
watch that the the the
yong value got like higher as we go.

580
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,520
yong value got like higher as we go.
 

581
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,590
yong value got like higher as we go.
Okay? So

582
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
Okay? So
 

583
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,029
Okay? So
you might experience that. So meaning

584
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
you might experience that. So meaning
 

585
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,070
you might experience that. So meaning
that if I go and there's his yong value

586
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,080
that if I go and there's his yong value
 

587
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,830
that if I go and there's his yong value
and it triggers me, I'm going to lose

588
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
and it triggers me, I'm going to lose
 

589
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,190
and it triggers me, I'm going to lose
it. I'm going to link. Do you

590
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
it. I'm going to link. Do you
 

591
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,470
it. I'm going to link. Do you
understand? So his his increase as I

592
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,480
understand? So his his increase as I
 

593
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,269
understand? So his his increase as I
start to manipulate his center

594
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:45,279

 

595
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,350

should make feel that value getting

596
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,360
should make feel that value getting
 

597
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,870
should make feel that value getting
higher here. And that gives you the

598
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:48,880
higher here. And that gives you the
 

599
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,470
higher here. And that gives you the
center much easier as long as you don't

600
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,480
center much easier as long as you don't
 

601
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,470
center much easier as long as you don't
go into the reactionary cycle. Okay. So,

602
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:56,480
go into the reactionary cycle. Okay. So,
 

603
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,110
go into the reactionary cycle. Okay. So,
a couple things. I'm not going to stop

604
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,120
a couple things. I'm not going to stop
 

605
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,549
a couple things. I'm not going to stop
doing what I'm doing. And I won't try to

606
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
doing what I'm doing. And I won't try to
 

607
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,590
doing what I'm doing. And I won't try to
throw him. I'm just trying to feel it to

608
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:05,600
throw him. I'm just trying to feel it to
 

609
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,549
throw him. I'm just trying to feel it to
the point where I say training would be

610
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
the point where I say training would be
 

611
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,149
the point where I say training would be
just when you touch the center. You

612
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:10,159
just when you touch the center. You
 

613
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,990
just when you touch the center. You
don't even have to move him. We're only

614
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,000
don't even have to move him. We're only
 

615
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,710
don't even have to move him. We're only
moving to confirm that I was touching

616
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:14,720
moving to confirm that I was touching
 

617
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,830
moving to confirm that I was touching
his center. Okay? And in doing that

618
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:17,840
his center. Okay? And in doing that
 

619
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,470
his center. Okay? And in doing that
though, don't desire to throw him

620
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:20,480
though, don't desire to throw him
 

621
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,070
though, don't desire to throw him
because you're going to stop doing what

622
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,080
because you're going to stop doing what
 

623
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,750
because you're going to stop doing what
you were doing. You want to maintain the

624
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:23,760
you were doing. You want to maintain the
 

625
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,390
you were doing. You want to maintain the
feeling that you have

626
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:26,400
feeling that you have
 

627
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,630
feeling that you have
likely they'll feel like oh you're and

628
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:30,640
likely they'll feel like oh you're and
 

629
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,470
likely they'll feel like oh you're and
they'll tense.

630
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:32,480
they'll tense.
 

631
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,669
they'll tense.
Do not go and contest that ground that

632
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:35,679
Do not go and contest that ground that
 

633
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,710
Do not go and contest that ground that
the same way it'll actually increase the

634
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:38,720
the same way it'll actually increase the
 

635
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,070
the same way it'll actually increase the
adhesion and increase the effect on the

636
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
adhesion and increase the effect on the
 

637
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,190
adhesion and increase the effect on the
center. As long as you continue to do

638
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,200
center. As long as you continue to do
 

639
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,430
center. As long as you continue to do
what you were doing as if they went from

640
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:47,440
what you were doing as if they went from
 

641
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,390
what you were doing as if they went from
three to eight or whatever. Okay. All

642
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,400
three to eight or whatever. Okay. All
 

643
00:26:50,400 --> 00:27:14,549
three to eight or whatever. Okay. All
right. Try Remember

644
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:14,559

 

645
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,630

the beginning is everything is dropping.

646
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:16,640
the beginning is everything is dropping.
 

647
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,029
the beginning is everything is dropping.
The original gravity is already working

648
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:19,039
The original gravity is already working
 

649
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:42,630
The original gravity is already working
through you.

650
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640

 

651
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,789

Do not pull or you'll make a lever out

652
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:44,799
Do not pull or you'll make a lever out
 

653
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,430
Do not pull or you'll make a lever out
of your body. Do not tense. You'll have

654
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:47,440
of your body. Do not tense. You'll have
 

655
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,390
of your body. Do not tense. You'll have
to tense to pull.

656
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:50,400
to tense to pull.
 

657
00:27:50,400 --> 00:28:52,070
to tense to pull.
That'll make a lever make you light.

658
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,080

 

659
00:28:52,080 --> 00:29:02,630

Keep

660
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640

 

661
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:21,590

releasing tension.

662
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:21,600

 

663
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,630

So, even though my the force is going

664
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:24,640
So, even though my the force is going
 

665
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,909
So, even though my the force is going
here, it's not that I get pulled off my

666
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:27,919
here, it's not that I get pulled off my
 

667
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,750
here, it's not that I get pulled off my
foot. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay.

668
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:31,760
foot. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay.
 

669
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,950
foot. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay.
All right. Let's do this now.

670
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:34,960
All right. Let's do this now.
 

671
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,870
All right. Let's do this now.
Okay.

672
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:36,880
Okay.
 

673
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,830
Okay.
So,

674
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:39,840
So,
 

675
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,190
So,
I'm I'm feeling the same thing as what

676
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
I'm I'm feeling the same thing as what
 

677
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,590
I'm I'm feeling the same thing as what
we would call the UK, but there's no

678
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,600
we would call the UK, but there's no
 

679
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,669
we would call the UK, but there's no
that's a dichotomy. Okay. So, I'm going

680
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:47,679
that's a dichotomy. Okay. So, I'm going
 

681
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,110
that's a dichotomy. Okay. So, I'm going
to feel the same thing on the pull.

682
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,120
to feel the same thing on the pull.
 

683
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,269
to feel the same thing on the pull.
Okay. So, as I'm pulling, I take his

684
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,279
Okay. So, as I'm pulling, I take his
 

685
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,549
Okay. So, as I'm pulling, I take his
mass, his gravity, his inertia, and I'm

686
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
mass, his gravity, his inertia, and I'm
 

687
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,789
mass, his gravity, his inertia, and I'm
putting it on the front foot. I'm

688
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:00,799
putting it on the front foot. I'm
 

689
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,590
putting it on the front foot. I'm
putting it on the front foot. I'll feel

690
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:03,600
putting it on the front foot. I'll feel
 

691
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,590
putting it on the front foot. I'll feel
his center,

692
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:05,600
his center,
 

693
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:12,789
his center,
and I'll move his center.

694
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:12,799

 

695
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,029

And I'm going to let you do a loose

696
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:15,039
And I'm going to let you do a loose
 

697
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,070
And I'm going to let you do a loose
grab, but you can tell ask tell him how

698
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,080
grab, but you can tell ask tell him how
 

699
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,549
grab, but you can tell ask tell him how
light I'm actually squeezing my fingers.

700
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:20,559
light I'm actually squeezing my fingers.
 

701
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,950
light I'm actually squeezing my fingers.
But I'll let you get some

702
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:22,960
But I'll let you get some
 

703
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,789
But I'll let you get some
material leverage here. Okay. So, I take

704
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:26,799
material leverage here. Okay. So, I take
 

705
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,830
material leverage here. Okay. So, I take
his mass

706
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:29,840
his mass
 

707
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,870
his mass
and I let that sink too.

708
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:32,880
and I let that sink too.
 

709
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,830
and I let that sink too.
Then I move that mass.

710
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:35,840
Then I move that mass.
 

711
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,750
Then I move that mass.
Okay. Got it. Okay. Try that trick. You

712
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:39,760
Okay. Got it. Okay. Try that trick. You
 

713
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,830
Okay. Got it. Okay. Try that trick. You
can have some finger grip. Just don't

714
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:41,840
can have some finger grip. Just don't
 

715
00:30:41,840 --> 00:31:35,350
can have some finger grip. Just don't
death grip his forearm.

716
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:35,360

 

717
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,029

Keep your heel down.

718
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
Keep your heel down.
 

719
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,870
Keep your heel down.
So, here's my thing. Uh, Rio,

720
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:42,880
So, here's my thing. Uh, Rio,
 

721
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,470
So, here's my thing. Uh, Rio,
remember the drill started with my own

722
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:46,480
remember the drill started with my own
 

723
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,990
remember the drill started with my own
mass

724
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,000
mass
 

725
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,549
mass
dropping. Okay? So, when I go like this

726
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:52,559
dropping. Okay? So, when I go like this
 

727
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,350
dropping. Okay? So, when I go like this
and not doing the first the first part.

728
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,360
and not doing the first the first part.
 

729
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,549
and not doing the first the first part.
Okay. So, I'm over my base of support

730
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:58,559
Okay. So, I'm over my base of support
 

731
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,990
Okay. So, I'm over my base of support
and my own mass drops and I'm adding

732
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,000
and my own mass drops and I'm adding
 

733
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,310
and my own mass drops and I'm adding
their inertia to that mass dropping. So,

734
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,320
their inertia to that mass dropping. So,
 

735
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,470
their inertia to that mass dropping. So,
I know that I'm going to weight the

736
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:08,480
I know that I'm going to weight the
 

737
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,389
I know that I'm going to weight the
front foot, but I'm not going to

738
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:12,399
front foot, but I'm not going to
 

739
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,029
front foot, but I'm not going to
position myself off the back foot. Does

740
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:15,039
position myself off the back foot. Does
 

741
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,470
position myself off the back foot. Does
that make sense? Okay. Ground vectoring

742
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
that make sense? Okay. Ground vectoring
 

743
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,630
that make sense? Okay. Ground vectoring
is taking the gravity of the inertia and

744
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:22,640
is taking the gravity of the inertia and
 

745
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,350
is taking the gravity of the inertia and
moving it through my body to the

746
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,360
moving it through my body to the
 

747
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,870
moving it through my body to the
midfoot. It's not me

748
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:28,880
midfoot. It's not me
 

749
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,110
midfoot. It's not me
actually, you know, doing something like

750
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,120
actually, you know, doing something like
 

751
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,190
actually, you know, doing something like
I'm on the midfoot. Okay, does that make

752
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,200
I'm on the midfoot. Okay, does that make
 

753
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,990
I'm on the midfoot. Okay, does that make
sense? Okay. Uh let's do the next one.

754
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,000

 

755
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,110

Yeah, I'm the Okay, but I'm doing the

756
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,120
Yeah, I'm the Okay, but I'm doing the
 

757
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,830
Yeah, I'm the Okay, but I'm doing the
technique. Okay, so we go back to my

758
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:45,840
technique. Okay, so we go back to my
 

759
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,549
technique. Okay, so we go back to my
demonstration. I'm not going to grab

760
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
demonstration. I'm not going to grab
 

761
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,190
demonstration. I'm not going to grab
him. I'm going to get that energy.

762
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,200
him. I'm going to get that energy.
 

763
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,789
him. I'm going to get that energy.
It's going to be very light. You're not

764
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:54,799
It's going to be very light. You're not
 

765
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,950
It's going to be very light. You're not
going to be used to it. It's very light,

766
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:56,960
going to be used to it. It's very light,
 

767
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,590
going to be used to it. It's very light,
but it still won't move your center. You

768
00:32:59,590 --> 00:32:59,600
but it still won't move your center. You
 

769
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,509
but it still won't move your center. You
see? Okay. So, I'm like normally, right?

770
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:03,519
see? Okay. So, I'm like normally, right?
 

771
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,990
see? Okay. So, I'm like normally, right?
We're like over here.

772
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,000
We're like over here.
 

773
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,990
We're like over here.
Move your center. Okay. So, likewise,

774
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
Move your center. Okay. So, likewise,
 

775
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,750
Move your center. Okay. So, likewise,
when we're over here, we're like move to

776
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:09,760
when we're over here, we're like move to
 

777
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,750
when we're over here, we're like move to
center. It's going to go into his

778
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:11,760
center. It's going to go into his
 

779
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,549
center. It's going to go into his
shoulders. So, it's very light. I'm not

780
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:14,559
shoulders. So, it's very light. I'm not
 

781
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,029
shoulders. So, it's very light. I'm not
I'm not allowed to use my grips at all.

782
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:17,039
I'm not allowed to use my grips at all.
 

783
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,190
I'm not allowed to use my grips at all.
Okay. But I'm pulling grounding his

784
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
Okay. But I'm pulling grounding his
 

785
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,549
Okay. But I'm pulling grounding his
inertia and then there's the center and

786
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:24,559
inertia and then there's the center and
 

787
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,149
inertia and then there's the center and
then I'm just moving.

788
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:28,159
then I'm just moving.
 

789
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:46,630
then I'm just moving.
Okay. All right. Try it.

790
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:46,640

 

791
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,630

Watch the thumb hooks.

792
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:50,640

 

793
00:33:50,640 --> 00:34:23,270

Try to get rid of all hooking.

794
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:23,280

 

795
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,950

Get rid of the thumb hooks.

796
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:26,960
Get rid of the thumb hooks.
 

797
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,550
Get rid of the thumb hooks.
So, put your thumb with your other

798
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:28,560
So, put your thumb with your other
 

799
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,389
So, put your thumb with your other
fingers if you if you're not disciplined

800
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:30,399
fingers if you if you're not disciplined
 

801
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,109
fingers if you if you're not disciplined
enough.

802
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,119
enough.
 

803
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,990
enough.
Remember,

804
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,000

 

805
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,149

I can't be too light. I can't be too

806
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:42,159
I can't be too light. I can't be too
 

807
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,909
I can't be too light. I can't be too
heavy. So, follow the initial friction

808
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:45,919
heavy. So, follow the initial friction
 

809
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,389
heavy. So, follow the initial friction
and keep that friction. That's your

810
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:48,399
and keep that friction. That's your
 

811
00:34:48,399 --> 00:35:00,470
and keep that friction. That's your
metric. Okay.

812
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,480

 

813
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,550

I want you to continue training, but as

814
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:02,560
I want you to continue training, but as
 

815
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,630
I want you to continue training, but as
you're the one being manipulated, I want

816
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
you're the one being manipulated, I want
 

817
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,910
you're the one being manipulated, I want
you to to notice that for some weird

818
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:07,920
you to to notice that for some weird
 

819
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,550
you to to notice that for some weird
reason, my elbows and shoulders

820
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:10,560
reason, my elbows and shoulders
 

821
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,430
reason, my elbows and shoulders
solidify. I'm not I'm not really

822
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:13,440
solidify. I'm not I'm not really
 

823
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,910
solidify. I'm not I'm not really
linking. Okay? Do you understand that?

824
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:15,920
linking. Okay? Do you understand that?
 

825
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,390
linking. Okay? Do you understand that?
Just observe it. Don't do anything to

826
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:18,400
Just observe it. Don't do anything to
 

827
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,390
Just observe it. Don't do anything to
it. Just observe it as they're doing

828
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:20,400
it. Just observe it as they're doing
 

829
00:35:20,400 --> 00:36:07,670
it. Just observe it as they're doing
this.

830
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:07,680

 

831
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,589

as the person doing the drill. Try to

832
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:09,599
as the person doing the drill. Try to
 

833
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:26,870
as the person doing the drill. Try to
move less and less through space.

834
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:26,880

 

835
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,870

Remember the preface. Everything is

836
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:28,880
Remember the preface. Everything is
 

837
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:43,190
Remember the preface. Everything is
sinking. Everything is relaxing.

838
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200

 

839
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:50,870

Okay.

840
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880

 

841
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,790

So because it's force just so they can

842
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:54,800
So because it's force just so they can
 

843
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,430
So because it's force just so they can
see

844
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:57,440
see
 

845
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,190
see
I don't need the anat the anatomical

846
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,200
I don't need the anat the anatomical
 

847
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,950
I don't need the anat the anatomical
hooks you think. Okay you I can still

848
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:04,960
hooks you think. Okay you I can still
 

849
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,710
hooks you think. Okay you I can still
match the force with my fingertips. You

850
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:08,720
match the force with my fingertips. You
 

851
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,589
match the force with my fingertips. You
feel the pull the pull. It's not me

852
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:11,599
feel the pull the pull. It's not me
 

853
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,150
feel the pull the pull. It's not me
going like this and him going out. I

854
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,160
going like this and him going out. I
 

855
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,349
going like this and him going out. I
just that energy that's there. match it

856
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:17,359
just that energy that's there. match it
 

857
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,750
just that energy that's there. match it
and it'll generate the friction. Here's

858
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:19,760
and it'll generate the friction. Here's
 

859
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,790
and it'll generate the friction. Here's
the friction. And then we're going like

860
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
the friction. And then we're going like
 

861
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,510
the friction. And then we're going like
that. You get it? Okay. So, we're trying

862
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:25,520
that. You get it? Okay. So, we're trying
 

863
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,349
that. You get it? Okay. So, we're trying
to

864
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:27,359
to
 

865
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,710
to
confirm what we're doing, but we're also

866
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:30,720
confirm what we're doing, but we're also
 

867
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,910
confirm what we're doing, but we're also
making sure that we're not using

868
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:33,920
making sure that we're not using
 

869
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,990
making sure that we're not using
institutional explanations for what is

870
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,000
institutional explanations for what is
 

871
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,670
institutional explanations for what is
going on. The explanation I'm giving

872
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:37,680
going on. The explanation I'm giving
 

873
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,910
going on. The explanation I'm giving
you, this is the best one I can come up

874
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:39,920
you, this is the best one I can come up
 

875
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,670
you, this is the best one I can come up
with. Again, our end goal is not this.

876
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:43,680
with. Again, our end goal is not this.
 

877
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,750
with. Again, our end goal is not this.
Our end goal is what this does to our

878
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:45,760
Our end goal is what this does to our
 

879
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,950
Our end goal is what this does to our
consciousness. Okay. But

880
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:48,960
consciousness. Okay. But
 

881
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,230
consciousness. Okay. But
the explanation I use is the when the

882
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,240
the explanation I use is the when the
 

883
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,030
the explanation I use is the when the
yang value matches

884
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,040
yang value matches
 

885
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,870
yang value matches
because of the nature of the universe,

886
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:56,880
because of the nature of the universe,
 

887
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,430
because of the nature of the universe,
it treats it as one. Like you you have

888
00:37:59,430 --> 00:37:59,440
it treats it as one. Like you you have
 

889
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,750
it treats it as one. Like you you have
the same yong value but you're one

890
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:01,760
the same yong value but you're one
 

891
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,510
the same yong value but you're one
thing. You see uh and to me that is what

892
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:05,520
thing. You see uh and to me that is what
 

893
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,150
thing. You see uh and to me that is what
it means. It's the the union the

894
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,160
it means. It's the the union the
 

895
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,430
it means. It's the the union the
communion. Okay. Doesn't mean harmony.

896
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:11,440
communion. Okay. Doesn't mean harmony.
 

897
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,150
communion. Okay. Doesn't mean harmony.
Harmony is still multiple things all

898
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,160
Harmony is still multiple things all
 

899
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,310
Harmony is still multiple things all
just blending together. It means

900
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:16,320
just blending together. It means
 

901
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,230
just blending together. It means
non-tuness is what I means. Okay. So hit

902
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,240
non-tuness is what I means. Okay. So hit
 

903
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,230
non-tuness is what I means. Okay. So hit
hit once. I don't I'm not doing

904
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,240
hit once. I don't I'm not doing
 

905
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,109
hit once. I don't I'm not doing
anything. I just do what I'm what I told

906
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:25,119
anything. I just do what I'm what I told
 

907
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,750
anything. I just do what I'm what I told
you to do. And then the universe goes I

908
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:27,760
you to do. And then the universe goes I
 

909
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,430
you to do. And then the universe goes I
think you guys are one. So when one of

910
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,440
think you guys are one. So when one of
 

911
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,230
think you guys are one. So when one of
you moves the the all of you moves.

912
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,240
you moves the the all of you moves.
 

913
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,069
you moves the the all of you moves.
Okay. That's what we're doing. And I'm

914
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
Okay. That's what we're doing. And I'm
 

915
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,150
Okay. That's what we're doing. And I'm
just doing my fingertips. Okay. Try it

916
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,160
just doing my fingertips. Okay. Try it
 

917
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,150
just doing my fingertips. Okay. Try it
again. As long as you match that yong

918
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,160
again. As long as you match that yong
 

919
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,670
again. As long as you match that yong
value between those two things, it will

920
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:41,680
value between those two things, it will
 

921
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,150
value between those two things, it will
solidify and commune. Just your

922
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,160
solidify and commune. Just your
 

923
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,109
solidify and commune. Just your
fingertips just like this. Look. Look.

924
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:47,119
fingertips just like this. Look. Look.
 

925
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,910
fingertips just like this. Look. Look.
That's what I was like,

926
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:49,920
That's what I was like,
 

927
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,750
That's what I was like,
right?

928
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:53,760

 

929
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,910

Your mass, their mass goes through the

930
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:55,920
Your mass, their mass goes through the
 

931
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,950
Your mass, their mass goes through the
ground, through you.

932
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:58,960
ground, through you.
 

933
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:09,190
ground, through you.
Don't be above or below that yong value.

934
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,200

 

935
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,190

The person with the fingertips is moving

936
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,200
The person with the fingertips is moving
 

937
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,470
The person with the fingertips is moving
the other person.

938
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:14,480
the other person.
 

939
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,790
the other person.
You're already off your back foot there,

940
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:16,800
You're already off your back foot there,
 

941
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,470
You're already off your back foot there,
Rio. Get your weight down.

942
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:20,480
Rio. Get your weight down.
 

943
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,069
Rio. Get your weight down.
Straighten your back. Your chest is

944
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:22,079
Straighten your back. Your chest is
 

945
00:39:22,079 --> 00:40:12,390
Straighten your back. Your chest is
kicked. Fix your head.

946
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:12,400

 

947
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,829

Okay, we'll do one more which is easier

948
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:17,839
Okay, we'll do one more which is easier
 

949
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,030
Okay, we'll do one more which is easier
because the yong value will go up. Okay,

950
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,040
because the yong value will go up. Okay,
 

951
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,310
because the yong value will go up. Okay,
so we were doing this shiaku and then

952
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:24,320
so we were doing this shiaku and then
 

953
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,349
so we were doing this shiaku and then
the other shiaku is over here. Does

954
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:27,359
the other shiaku is over here. Does
 

955
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,069
the other shiaku is over here. Does
everyone understand that concept? Okay,

956
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:30,079
everyone understand that concept? Okay,
 

957
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,589
everyone understand that concept? Okay,
so you you'll feel yeah still fingertips

958
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:33,599
so you you'll feel yeah still fingertips
 

959
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,750
so you you'll feel yeah still fingertips
but you'll feel a higher value. So this

960
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:35,760
but you'll feel a higher value. So this
 

961
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,990
but you'll feel a higher value. So this
this value is pretty light but as I

962
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,000
this value is pretty light but as I
 

963
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,349
this value is pretty light but as I
start to go in that way it everything is

964
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:41,359
start to go in that way it everything is
 

965
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,109
start to go in that way it everything is
the same. You might find it easier that

966
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:45,119
the same. You might find it easier that
 

967
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,190
the same. You might find it easier that
see I went higher and that it's easier.

968
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,200
see I went higher and that it's easier.
 

969
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,630
see I went higher and that it's easier.
Again, it's not that I'm trying to shove

970
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:52,640
Again, it's not that I'm trying to shove
 

971
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,430
Again, it's not that I'm trying to shove
him. You can make a circle. You can make

972
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,440
him. You can make a circle. You can make
 

973
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,109
him. You can make a circle. You can make
a circle out of him.

974
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:01,119

 

975
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,750

I can go one way and pull him back the

976
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:03,760
I can go one way and pull him back the
 

977
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,910
I can go one way and pull him back the
other way. You see? Okay. So, just do

978
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:07,920
other way. You see? Okay. So, just do
 

979
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,390
other way. You see? Okay. So, just do
what I'm saying.

980
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,400
what I'm saying.
 

981
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,230
what I'm saying.
There's his mass. Match that and just

982
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:16,240
There's his mass. Match that and just
 

983
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,630
There's his mass. Match that and just
orient it outside his face of support.

984
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:18,640
orient it outside his face of support.
 

985
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,829
orient it outside his face of support.
Okay? And so what I want you to do is as

986
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:21,839
Okay? And so what I want you to do is as
 

987
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,670
Okay? And so what I want you to do is as
light as possible cuz the matching is

988
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,680
light as possible cuz the matching is
 

989
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,750
light as possible cuz the matching is
also me and him, right? So I I could be

990
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:29,760
also me and him, right? So I I could be
 

991
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:42,470
also me and him, right? So I I could be
this light.

992
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:42,480

 

993
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,349

Okay. So start playing with how light

994
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:45,359
Okay. So start playing with how light
 

995
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,270
Okay. So start playing with how light
you could do it, how small you could do

996
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,280
you could do it, how small you could do
 

997
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,150
you could do it, how small you could do
it, because that's going to tell you how

998
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,160
it, because that's going to tell you how
 

999
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,990
it, because that's going to tell you how
aware you are that I now have his tongen

1000
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,000
aware you are that I now have his tongen
 

1001
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,630
aware you are that I now have his tongen
and my tongen and his tongen is the same

1002
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:56,640
and my tongen and his tongen is the same
 

1003
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,230
and my tongen and his tongen is the same
tom. Okay. All right. Fine.

1004
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,240

 

1005
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,230

And again, what do you think you do as

00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:06,240
And again, what do you think you do as
 

1007
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,790
And again, what do you think you do as
what do you do as

00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,040
neither assist nor resist? Don't do
 

1011
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:52,470
neither assist nor resist? Don't do
anything. Just stay there. Okay.

1012
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:52,480

 

1013
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,550

Constantly go back just like in Zazen.

1059
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,790

Sean? Why are we going to the fingertips
 

1065
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,550
Sean? Why are we going to the fingertips
and not the palms? The palms were too

00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:23,119
amount of material contact. Okay, just
 

1071
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,950

I want the lightest pressure as
possible. I want subtle subtle forces.

1076
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:34,800

 

1077
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:52,710

Do it with one fingertips.

1079
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,870

Watch for all your crutches that you're

00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:54,880
Watch for all your crutches that you're
 

1081
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,589
Watch for all your crutches that you're
trying to do. Am I trying to push in

1085
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,430

Looks like a lot of pressure on the

That's no different than this.

1100
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:49,359
That's no different than this.
 

1101
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:56,150
That's no different than this.
My palm more. I got more friction.

1103
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,470

How light. I'm going to I'm going to try

00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,200
to improve myself. I see how like
 

1107
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,950
to improve myself. I see how like
there's the P. There's your reaction to

there's the P. There's your reaction to
it.

1110
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:05,440
it.
 

1111
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,349
it.
Okay. All right. So, that's what we're

1112
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:07,359
Okay. All right. So, that's what we're
 

1113
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,349
Okay. All right. So, that's what we're
doing now. We're going to play with it.

1114
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:09,359
doing now. We're going to play with it.

And to play with it, we have we're going
 

1117
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,510
And to play with it, we have we're going
to risk failing. Okay. And we're going

1118
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:13,520
to risk failing. Okay. And we're going
 

1119
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,030
to risk failing. Okay. And we're going
to observe ourselves for all the

1120
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,040
to observe ourselves for all the
 

1121
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,109
to observe ourselves for all the
crutches that we're doing because we

00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:17,119
crutches that we're doing because we
 

1123
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,790
crutches that we're doing because we
can't

can't
 

1125
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,390

1133
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:30,870

something new. We'll try

00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,349
normally spin the display. So there's
not in any of this. We're not finally

1302
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:07,359
not in any of this. We're not finally
 

1303
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,789
not in any of this. We're not finally
displacing any of this. Okay.

1304
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:10,799
displacing any of this. Okay.
 

1305
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,309
displacing any of this. Okay.

1313
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:55,990

You're just bringing them straight in.

1314
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:56,000

 

1315
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,589

So make sure you're at

1316
00:57:59,589 --> 00:57:59,599
So make sure you're at
 

1317
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:04,230
So make sure you're at
okay both of you. So partially if your

1318
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:04,240
okay both of you. So partially if your
 

1319
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,430

if your arm is bent so let's bend your

1320
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:07,440
if your arm is bent so let's bend your
 

1321
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,190
if your arm is bent so let's bend your
elbows like the T- reps people. Okay.

1322
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:11,200
elbows like the T- reps people. Okay.
 

1323
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,309
elbows like the T- reps people. Okay.
And I bend my elbows. Look at the chest

1324
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:14,319
And I bend my elbows. Look at the chest
 

1325
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,870
And I bend my elbows. Look at the chest
range. That should have never happened.

1326
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:16,880
range. That should have never happened.
 

1327
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,630
range. That should have never happened.
Okay. So, kata is not only

1328
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:20,640
Okay. So, kata is not only
 

1329
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,230
Okay. So, kata is not only
energetically, anatomically correct, but

1330
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:24,240
energetically, anatomically correct, but
 

1331
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,150
energetically, anatomically correct, but
kat is giving you Yeah. That is where

1332
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:28,160
kat is giving you Yeah. That is where
 

1333
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,870
kat is giving you Yeah. That is where
 better start happening.

1334
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
better start happening.
 

1335
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,589
better start happening.
Do the T-Rex

1336
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:33,599
Do the T-Rex
 

1337
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,470
Do the T-Rex
like that. And then I do the T-Rex.

1338
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:36,480
like that. And then I do the T-Rex.
 

1339
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,589
like that. And then I do the T-Rex.
That's giving you a bad habit. That

1340
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:39,599
That's giving you a bad habit. That
 

1341
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,309
That's giving you a bad habit. That
should freak you out. Okay. So, the

1342
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:42,319
should freak you out. Okay. So, the
 

1343
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,750
should freak you out. Okay. So, the
other is happening when she's doing

1344
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:45,760
other is happening when she's doing
 

1345
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:51,270
other is happening when she's doing
T-Rex. I do T-Rex go. Then I can just do

1346
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:51,280
T-Rex. I do T-Rex go. Then I can just do
 

1347
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,670
T-Rex. I do T-Rex go. Then I can just do
that. You see that? And it's

1348
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:53,680
that. You see that? And it's
 

1349
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,230
that. You see that? And it's
complicating things. It's when when you

1350
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:56,240
complicating things. It's when when you
 

1351
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,150
complicating things. It's when when you
have the skill, that doesn't matter. But

1352
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:58,160
have the skill, that doesn't matter. But
 

1353
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,069
have the skill, that doesn't matter. But
right now, it's complicating things. And

1354
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:00,079
right now, it's complicating things. And
 

1355
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:04,230
right now, it's complicating things. And
we're learning a bad habit. So she's in

1356
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:04,240
we're learning a bad habit. So she's in
 

1357
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,750
we're learning a bad habit. So she's in
I'm in. See the chest range? I don't do

1358
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:07,760
I'm in. See the chest range? I don't do
 

1359
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,670
I'm in. See the chest range? I don't do
anything. So she's now going. Don't use

1360
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:11,680
anything. So she's now going. Don't use
 

1361
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,789
anything. So she's now going. Don't use
the ledge. You feel that ledge? Just use

1362
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:14,799
the ledge. You feel that ledge? Just use
 

1363
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,710
the ledge. You feel that ledge? Just use
the friction on the side. Don't go out.

1364
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:18,720
the friction on the side. Don't go out.
 

1365
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:25,589
the friction on the side. Don't go out.
Don't go out.

1366
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:25,599

 

1367

You want that front. You want that. You
want my grounding foot. That's going to

1370
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:29,359
want my grounding foot. That's going to
 

1371
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:37,190
want my grounding foot. That's going to
increase the value. You have to want it.

1372
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:37,200

 

1373
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:48,789

Okay. All right.

1374
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:48,799

 

1375
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,870

You guys don't hit each other enough in

1376
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:50,880
You guys don't hit each other enough in
 

1377
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,549
You guys don't hit each other enough in
your dojo. That's why you have those

1378
00:59:52,549 --> 00:59:52,559
your dojo. That's why you have those
 

1379
00:59:52,559 --> 01:00:36,870
your dojo. That's why you have those
little T-Rex arms.

1380
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:36,880

 

1381
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,910

Okay.

1385
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:50,710

Now we have to do

1386
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:50,720
Now we have to do
 

1387
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,789
Now we have to do
actual.

You will feel her ledge because she's

1404
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:18,559
You will feel her ledge because she's
 

1405
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,470
You will feel her ledge because she's
reacting to the pull. She'll ledge on

me. I still don't start manipulating the
 

1409
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,549

Again, you try. I want you to do
 

1421
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,390
Again, you try. I want you to do
nothing. This is all I want. This is the

01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:42,400
nothing. This is all I want. This is the
 

1423
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,630

1425
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:51,990
feeling I have right now. Okay, that's
what I do. You go. I keep that feeling.

1426
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:52,000

 

1427
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,230

You don't ever feel my thumb. Okay. All

1428
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:54,240
You don't ever feel my thumb. Okay. All
 

1429
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,230
You don't ever feel my thumb. Okay. All
right. Try it. But if they do that, you

1430
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:58,240
right. Try it. But if they do that, you
 

1431
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,789
right. Try it. But if they do that, you
don't contest on it and try to leverage

1432
01:02:00,789 --> 01:02:00,799
don't contest on it and try to leverage
 

1433
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,750
don't contest on it and try to leverage
on it. Okay. You stay with the adhesion

1434
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:03,760
on it. Okay. You stay with the adhesion
 

1435
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,470
on it. Okay. You stay with the adhesion
in the palm. Why would I say that

1436
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:06,480
in the palm. Why would I say that
 

1437
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,670
in the palm. Why would I say that
partially?

1438
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:09,680

 

1439
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,470

What do you think's going to happen if

What do you think's going to happen if
 

1441
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,630
What do you think's going to happen if
you go and

1442
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:14,640
you go and
 

1443
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,390
you go and
trying to out leverage the le their

01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:16,400
trying to out leverage the le their
 

1445
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,510
trying to out leverage the le their
lever the stronger opponent will just

1446
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:19,520
lever the stronger opponent will just
 

1447
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,069
lever the stronger opponent will just
not let you what about their shoulder

1448
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:22,079
not let you what about their shoulder
 

1449
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,510
not let you what about their shoulder
their shoulder and elbow adhesion

1450
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:25,520
their shoulder and elbow adhesion
 

1451
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,390
their shoulder and elbow adhesion
their solidification do you it's going

1452
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:28,400
their solidification do you it's going
 

1453
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,030
their solidification do you it's going
to go away so you start linking them

1454
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:31,040
to go away so you start linking them
 

1455
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,190
to go away so you start linking them
that's what's going to happen you were

1456
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:33,200
that's what's going to happen you were
 

1457

elbow's going to move, but I don't want

1510
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:24,480
elbow's going to move, but I don't want
 

1511
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,750
elbow's going to move, but I don't want
to just move his length, his shoulder

1512
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:27,760
to just move his length, his shoulder
 

1513
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,150
to just move his length, his shoulder
joints, and all that. Okay, I'm moving

1514
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:30,160
joints, and all that. Okay, I'm moving
 

1515
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:38,069
joints, and all that. Okay, I'm moving
the the center.

1516

1517
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,870

That means leave it open. Okay, that's

1518
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:40,880
That means leave it open. Okay, that's
 

1519
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,829
That means leave it open. Okay, that's
the same thing.

1520
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:43,839
the same thing.
 

1521
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,390
the same thing.
close. You should feel exactly the same.

1522
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:46,400
close. You should feel exactly the same.
 

1523
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,710
close. You should feel exactly the same.
In other words, I should feel the same.

1524
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:48,720
In other words, I should feel the same.
 

1525

In other words, I should feel the same.
He might like he is reacting to it by

1526
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:52,559
He might like he is reacting to it by
 

1527
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,829
He might like he is reacting to it by
grabbing harder. Okay, I might do that.

1528
01:05:55,829 --> 01:05:55,839
grabbing harder. Okay, I might do that.
 

1529
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:58,470
grabbing harder. Okay, I might do that.
I don't start pulling on it. I stay with

1530
01:05:58,470 --> 01:05:58,480
I don't start pulling on it. I stay with
 

1531
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,270
I don't start pulling on it. I stay with
that and capitalize upon the fact that

1532
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:01,280
that and capitalize upon the fact that
 

1533
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,029
that and capitalize upon the fact that
Thank you. That made it easier to move

1534
01:06:03,029 --> 01:06:03,039
Thank you. That made it easier to move
 

1535
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:06,470
Thank you. That made it easier to move
you on. Okay. So, let's try the first

1536
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:06,480
you on. Okay. So, let's try the first
 

1537
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:15,109
you on. Okay. So, let's try the first
hand.

1538
01:06:15,109 --> 01:06:15,119

 

1539
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:22,069

They're still not pushing.

1540
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:22,079

 

1541
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,710

Wrist to palm.

1542
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:26,720

 

1543
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:32,950

Keep your posture.

1544
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:32,960

 

1545
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,990

Move the center.

Move the center.
You're peeling off his palm.

1548
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:41,200

 

1549
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,109

You're peeling off his palm. So you must

1550
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:43,119
You're peeling off his palm. So you must
 

1551
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:47,670
You're peeling off his palm. So you must
be prying against his fingers. So if he

1552
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:47,680
be prying against his fingers. So if he
 

1553
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,470
be prying against his fingers. So if he
opens his hand, that feeling should be

1554
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:50,480
opens his hand, that feeling should be
 

1555
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,270
opens his hand, that feeling should be
the same.

1556
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:53,280
the same.
 

1557
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,349
the same.
You connect to his center. That's it.

1558
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:55,359
You connect to his center. That's it.
 

1559
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,230
You connect to his center. That's it.
Now he closes his fingers. Same side,

1560
01:06:58,230 --> 01:06:58,240
Now he closes his fingers. Same side,
 

1561
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,510
Now he closes his fingers. Same side,

1562
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:01,520
please. And it doesn't change you.
 

1563
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,309
please. And it doesn't change you.
You're still in the palm.

1564
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:04,319
You're still in the palm.
 

1565
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,549
You're still in the palm.
Moving that center, feeling the center.

1566
01:07:06,549 --> 01:07:06,559
Moving that center, feeling the center.
 

1567
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:15,430
Moving that center, feeling the center.
Moving the center.

1568
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:15,440

 

1569
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:34,870

very hard. You get pulled by it.

1570
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:34,880

 

1571
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:40,390

Again,

1572
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:40,400

 

1573
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,270

don't do your tension. Just do what

1574
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:43,280
don't do your tension. Just do what
 

1575
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:54,610
don't do your tension. Just do what
we're doing here.

1576
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:54,620

 

1577
01:07:54,620 --> 01:09:08,149

[Music]

1578
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:08,159

 

1579
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:12,550

Okay.

1580
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:12,560

 

1581
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:17,189

So, careful of all the ways that we've

1582
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:17,199
So, careful of all the ways that we've
 

1583
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:19,189
So, careful of all the ways that we've
been taught to get a mechanical

1584
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:19,199
been taught to get a mechanical
 

1585
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:22,789
been taught to get a mechanical
advantage. So, right, bring your elbows

1586
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:22,799
advantage. So, right, bring your elbows
 

1587
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,910
advantage. So, right, bring your elbows
close,

1588
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:25,920

 

1589
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,510

get over the top.

1590
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:29,520
get over the top.
 

1591
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,149
get over the top.
that

1592
01:09:32,149 --> 01:09:32,159
that
 

1593
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:34,390
that
we were doing things with fingertips.

1594
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,400
we were doing things with fingertips.
 

1595
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,829
we were doing things with fingertips.
Okay? So, don't don't try to get

1596
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:37,839
Okay? So, don't don't try to get
 

1597
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,430
Okay? So, don't don't try to get
leverage on this. Don't seek a

1598
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:39,440
leverage on this. Don't seek a
 

1599
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,430
leverage on this. Don't seek a
mechanical advantage. You're just here

1600
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:43,440
mechanical advantage. You're just here
 

1601
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,189
mechanical advantage. You're just here
and I'm moving in that center. That's

1602
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:45,199
and I'm moving in that center. That's
 

1603
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:47,749
and I'm moving in that center. That's
all I'm doing. Now, I'm moving it with

1604
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:47,759
all I'm doing. Now, I'm moving it with
 

1605
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:49,749
all I'm doing. Now, I'm moving it with
this shape. I'm still moving in the

1606
01:09:49,749 --> 01:09:49,759
this shape. I'm still moving in the
 

1607
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:52,630
this shape. I'm still moving in the
center.

1608
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:52,640
center.
 

1609
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,270
center.
Okay? So, that's why I'm saying like

1610
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,280
Okay? So, that's why I'm saying like
 

1611
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,070
Okay? So, that's why I'm saying like
don't do your tension because you

1612
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:58,080
don't do your tension because you
 

1613
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,950
don't do your tension because you
probably were taught seek mechanical den

1614
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:00,960
probably were taught seek mechanical den
 

1615
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,270
probably were taught seek mechanical den
and we don't want a mechanical den

1616
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:03,280
and we don't want a mechanical den
 

1617
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,590
and we don't want a mechanical den
because that's a material anatomical

1618
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:05,600
because that's a material anatomical
 

1619
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,590
because that's a material anatomical
leveraging we're going to use the forces

1620
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:07,600
leveraging we're going to use the forces
 

1621
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,910
leveraging we're going to use the forces
so we're using the gra the gravity to

1622
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:09,920
so we're using the gra the gravity to
 

1623
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,950
so we're using the gra the gravity to
move him okay does that make sense okay

1624
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:12,960
move him okay does that make sense okay
 

1625
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,990
move him okay does that make sense okay
so try same drill we're just in familiar

1626
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:16,000
so try same drill we're just in familiar
 

1627
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,590
so try same drill we're just in familiar
territory but we have to make it

1628
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:17,600
territory but we have to make it
 

1629
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:28,310
territory but we have to make it
unfamiliar go

1630
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:28,320

 

1631
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,470

All inertia, gravity goes down.

1632
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:32,480
All inertia, gravity goes down.
 

1633
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:41,350
All inertia, gravity goes down.
You match the yong value.

1634
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:41,360

 

1635
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,590

Don't peel that fingers anymore, Andrew,

1636
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:43,600
Don't peel that fingers anymore, Andrew,
 

1637
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:56,550
Don't peel that fingers anymore, Andrew,
because you're peeling off of the palm.

1638
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:56,560

 

1639
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:01,110

Just move the palm.

1640
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:01,120

 

1641
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,030

Don't peel. Don't peel. Do you

1642
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:03,040
Don't peel. Don't peel. Do you
 

1643
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,030
Don't peel. Don't peel. Do you
understand what I'm saying? Can you feel

1644
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:05,040
understand what I'm saying? Can you feel
 

1645
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,709
understand what I'm saying? Can you feel
that? When you Okay. So, this is what

1646
01:11:08,709 --> 01:11:08,719
that? When you Okay. So, this is what
 

1647
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:11,189
that? When you Okay. So, this is what
Virginia was doing. We'll have you come

1648
01:11:11,189 --> 01:11:11,199
Virginia was doing. We'll have you come
 

1649
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,910
Virginia was doing. We'll have you come
closer so you can see this. Okay. He he

1650
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:13,920
closer so you can see this. Okay. He he
 

1651
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,350
closer so you can see this. Okay. He he
he is so used to getting on the other

1652
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:17,360
he is so used to getting on the other
 

1653
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,870
he is so used to getting on the other
side of the axis of rotation. You see

1654
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:20,880
side of the axis of rotation. You see
 

1655
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,350
side of the axis of rotation. You see
that he starts to curl that and when he

1656
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:23,360
that he starts to curl that and when he
 

1657
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,550
that he starts to curl that and when he
does that he's he's making space here

1658
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:26,560
does that he's he's making space here
 

1659
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,669
does that he's he's making space here
but he has to match the value. Okay. And

1660
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:29,679
but he has to match the value. Okay. And
 

1661
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:31,910
but he has to match the value. Okay. And
so it's a different way. Does my hand

1662
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:31,920
so it's a different way. Does my hand
 

1663
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,709
so it's a different way. Does my hand
curl? Yes. But if you pay attention it

1664
01:11:34,709 --> 01:11:34,719
curl? Yes. But if you pay attention it
 

1665
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:37,590
curl? Yes. But if you pay attention it
never curls first. It moves his center

1666
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:37,600
never curls first. It moves his center
 

1667
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,270
never curls first. It moves his center
first.

1668
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:39,280
first.
 

1669
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,430
first.
Do you understand? is that palm is

1670
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:41,440
Do you understand? is that palm is
 

1671
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,229
Do you understand? is that palm is
moving and as he moves in order now that

1672
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:44,239
moving and as he moves in order now that
 

1673
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:48,149
moving and as he moves in order now that
he is uh deeper into this there's that

1674
01:11:48,149 --> 01:11:48,159
he is uh deeper into this there's that
 

1675
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:50,709
he is uh deeper into this there's that
little space again and you could push

1676
01:11:50,709 --> 01:11:50,719
little space again and you could push
 

1677
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:53,910
little space again and you could push
push into that palm with that curl now.

1678
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:53,920
push into that palm with that curl now.
 

1679
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,709
push into that palm with that curl now.
So you're here.

1680
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:56,719
So you're here.
 

1681
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:00,149
So you're here.
Okay.

1682
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:00,159

 

1683
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,070

Isn't what we usually do. You're going

1684
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,080
Isn't what we usually do. You're going
 

1685
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,510
Isn't what we usually do. You're going
to grab my friend

1686
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:05,520
to grab my friend
 

1687
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,990
to grab my friend
and you go like that. Okay. Does does my

1688
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:10,000
and you go like that. Okay. Does does my
 

1689
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,270
and you go like that. Okay. Does does my
hand do that shape? Yes.

1690
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:13,280
hand do that shape? Yes.
 

1691
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,750
hand do that shape? Yes.
But it's not what's getting me there.

1692
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:15,760
But it's not what's getting me there.
 

1693
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,910
But it's not what's getting me there.
There's the space.

1694
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:17,920
There's the space.
 

1695
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:23,189
There's the space.
Instead, I stay on the palm.

1696
01:12:23,189 --> 01:12:23,199

 

1697
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:26,070

You see? Now, if I stay here, I can't

1698
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:26,080
You see? Now, if I stay here, I can't
 

1699
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,070
You see? Now, if I stay here, I can't
move him anymore.

1700
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:28,080
move him anymore.
 

1701
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,110
move him anymore.
But if I now turn,

1702
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:31,120
But if I now turn,
 

1703
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,709
But if I now turn,
you see how I'm doing that? And that's

1704
01:12:32,709 --> 01:12:32,719
you see how I'm doing that? And that's
 

1705
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:35,510
you see how I'm doing that? And that's
what's making my hand turn. as as he

1706
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:35,520
what's making my hand turn. as as he
 

1707
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,310
what's making my hand turn. as as he
moves and his hand gets over. It's go

1708
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:38,320
moves and his hand gets over. It's go
 

1709
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,590
moves and his hand gets over. It's go
his hand is turning and I'm staying with

1710
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:41,600
his hand is turning and I'm staying with
 

1711
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,990
his hand is turning and I'm staying with
it. It's not me turning his hand

1712
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:46,000
it. It's not me turning his hand
 

1713
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,070
it. It's not me turning his hand
as he's as he's moving

1714
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:50,080
as he's as he's moving
 

1715
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,709
as he's as he's moving
I will eventually

1716
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:52,719
I will eventually
 

1717
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,070
I will eventually
this angle here where is in order to

1718
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:56,080
this angle here where is in order to
 

1719
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,189
this angle here where is in order to
keep the adhesion I had to turn my hand

1720
01:12:59,189 --> 01:12:59,199
keep the adhesion I had to turn my hand
 

1721
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,709
keep the adhesion I had to turn my hand
he turned his hand. Do you understand

1722
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:00,719
he turned his hand. Do you understand
 

1723
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:03,350
he turned his hand. Do you understand
that? So again it says say it's the it's

1724
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:03,360
that? So again it says say it's the it's
 

1725
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:07,750
that? So again it says say it's the it's
the problem of do I move him? No. Move

1726
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:07,760
the problem of do I move him? No. Move
 

1727
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,550
the problem of do I move him? No. Move
yourself. Am I making something happen

1728
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:10,560
yourself. Am I making something happen
 

1729
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,790
yourself. Am I making something happen
to him? No, I'm not making something

1730
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:12,800
to him? No, I'm not making something
 

1731
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,630
to him? No, I'm not making something
happen to him. Okay, I'm staying with

1732
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:14,640
happen to him. Okay, I'm staying with
 

1733
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,510
happen to him. Okay, I'm staying with
him. Am I throwing him with that hand?

1734
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:17,520
him. Am I throwing him with that hand?
 

1735
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,910
him. Am I throwing him with that hand?
No, that hand is staying with him. Same

1736
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:19,920
No, that hand is staying with him. Same
 

1737
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:33,590
No, that hand is staying with him. Same
exact thing here. Okay, try it.

1738
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:33,600

 

1739
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:46,550

Prioritize the adhesion.

1740
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:46,560

 

1741
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:57,669

So don't prematurely curl your hand.

1742
01:13:57,669 --> 01:13:57,679

 

1743
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:20,390

Don't prematurely curl your hand, Rio.

1744
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:20,400

 

1745
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,950

Keep that wrist to palm pressure and

1746
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:22,960
Keep that wrist to palm pressure and
 

1747
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:30,870
Keep that wrist to palm pressure and
keep it even as he's moving.

1748
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:30,880

 

1749
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,189

Need to move him more to your to your

1750
01:14:33,189 --> 01:14:33,199
Need to move him more to your to your
 

1751
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,950
Need to move him more to your to your
left before you get that much curl. See

1752
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:34,960
left before you get that much curl. See
 

1753
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:47,669
left before you get that much curl. See
how it's coming out?

1754
01:14:47,669 --> 01:14:47,679

 

1755
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,310

Send everything down. You're prying

1756
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:50,320
Send everything down. You're prying
 

1757
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:59,270
Send everything down. You're prying
through his fingers.

1758
01:14:59,270 --> 01:14:59,280

 

1759
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:02,950

Just like I just like I do here. That

1760
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:02,960
Just like I just like I do here. That
 

1761
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,149
Just like I just like I do here. That
That's There's the center. Okay. In this

1762
01:15:06,149 --> 01:15:06,159
That's There's the center. Okay. In this
 

1763
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:09,910
That's There's the center. Okay. In this
case, I'm moving it. this way. Okay.

1764
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:09,920
case, I'm moving it. this way. Okay.
 

1765
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,470
case, I'm moving it. this way. Okay.
So, I move that and I keep this

1766
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:12,480
So, I move that and I keep this
 

1767
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:16,070
So, I move that and I keep this
pressure.

1768
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:16,080

 

1769
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,590

And as you start to move

1770
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:19,600
And as you start to move
 

1771
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,709
And as you start to move
that way, you see how it is angled up

1772
01:15:22,709 --> 01:15:22,719
that way, you see how it is angled up
 

1773
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:25,030
that way, you see how it is angled up
like that?

1774
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:25,040
like that?
 

1775
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,430
like that?
That is when you would have to curl it

1776
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:27,440
That is when you would have to curl it
 

1777
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,310
That is when you would have to curl it
in order to keep that same relationship

1778
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:30,320
in order to keep that same relationship
 

1779
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,830
in order to keep that same relationship
because when his elbow goes in the the

1780
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:33,840
because when his elbow goes in the the
 

1781
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,750
because when his elbow goes in the the
wrist turn. So you you can't leave your

1782
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:35,760
wrist turn. So you you can't leave your
 

1783
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,350
wrist turn. So you you can't leave your
wrist here and turn your elbow in. You

1784
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:37,360
wrist here and turn your elbow in. You
 

1785
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,430
wrist here and turn your elbow in. You
see that? You turn your elbow in the

1786
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:39,440
see that? You turn your elbow in the
 

1787
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,750
see that? You turn your elbow in the
wrist turns. That's where my hand turns.

1788
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:41,760
wrist turns. That's where my hand turns.
 

1789
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:48,149
wrist turns. That's where my hand turns.
Okay. So go over here.

1790
01:15:48,149 --> 01:15:48,159

 

1791
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:50,709

This is where my hand turns. And only to

1792
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:50,719
This is where my hand turns. And only to
 

1793
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,910
This is where my hand turns. And only to
that degree. I didn't do a form. You see

1794
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:53,920
that degree. I didn't do a form. You see
 

1795
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,830
that degree. I didn't do a form. You see
that? This is where it always goes.

1796
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:55,840
that? This is where it always goes.
 

1797
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,470
that? This is where it always goes.
Okay. I'm prioritizing the adhesion

1798
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:58,480
Okay. I'm prioritizing the adhesion
 

1799
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,229
Okay. I'm prioritizing the adhesion
inside the palm. Okay. Again, why?

1800
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:02,239
inside the palm. Okay. Again, why?
 

1801
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:04,229
inside the palm. Okay. Again, why?
Because he moves as a unit. I'm not

1802
01:16:04,229 --> 01:16:04,239
Because he moves as a unit. I'm not
 

1803
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:17,350
Because he moves as a unit. I'm not
linking him. Okay. Try it again.

1804
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:17,360

 

1805
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:33,430

Don't do a form, do a feeling.

1806
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:33,440

 

1807
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,669

Don't curl for no reason. You're

1808
01:16:35,669 --> 01:16:35,679
Don't curl for no reason. You're
 

1809
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:40,229
Don't curl for no reason. You're
following their palm.

1810
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:40,239

 

1811
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:45,189

Watch the T-Rex.

1812
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:45,199

 

1813
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:51,430

Don't curl for no reason.

1814
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:51,440

 

1815
01:16:51,440 --> 01:17:00,149

Watch your posture.

1816
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:00,159

 

1817
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,149

All right. I think we reach that ceiling

1818
01:17:02,149 --> 01:17:02,159
All right. I think we reach that ceiling
 

1819
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,110
All right. I think we reach that ceiling
there for a lot of people. But again, we

1820
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:05,120
there for a lot of people. But again, we
 

1821
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,310
there for a lot of people. But again, we
were doing it. Now we just have a form.

1822
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:08,320
were doing it. Now we just have a form.
 

1823
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,430
were doing it. Now we just have a form.
I can't let go of the form. Okay. So

1824
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:11,440
I can't let go of the form. Okay. So
 

1825
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,390
I can't let go of the form. Okay. So
we'll work on it. We'll work on other

1826
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:14,400
we'll work on it. We'll work on other
 

1827
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,709
we'll work on it. We'll work on other
stuff here. Okay. So we're here going

1828
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:18,719
stuff here. Okay. So we're here going
 

1829
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,830
stuff here. Okay. So we're here going
and there's a end to this. There's no

1830
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:21,840
and there's a end to this. There's no
 

1831
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,350
and there's a end to this. There's no
more effect on it. You see

1832
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:25,360
more effect on it. You see
 

1833
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,470
more effect on it. You see
this movement.

1834
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,480
this movement.
 

1835
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,709
this movement.
You're you're not doing anything. I

1836
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:30,719
You're you're not doing anything. I
 

1837
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:35,590
You're you're not doing anything. I
pull. Will you pull? Pull. Okay. So I am

1838
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:35,600
pull. Will you pull? Pull. Okay. So I am
 

1839
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,310

moving

1840
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:38,320
moving
 

1841
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,830
moving
and now in order to do something here. I

1842
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:41,840
and now in order to do something here. I
 

1843
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,990
and now in order to do something here. I
have to do something weird. Do you get

1844
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:44,000
have to do something weird. Do you get
 

1845
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,310
have to do something weird. Do you get
it? I can't do my shapes.

1846
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:48,320
it? I can't do my shapes.
 

1847
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,350
it? I can't do my shapes.
That means that from here it's a yong

1848
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:51,360
That means that from here it's a yong
 

1849
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,669
That means that from here it's a yong
phase and it's starting to go into the

1850
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:53,679
phase and it's starting to go into the
 

1851
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:57,030
phase and it's starting to go into the
yin phase. Got that? As it goes into the

1852
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:57,040
yin phase. Got that? As it goes into the
 

1853
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,590
yin phase. Got that? As it goes into the
yin phase, I don't try to extend the

1854
01:17:59,590 --> 01:17:59,600
yin phase, I don't try to extend the
 

1855
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,550
yin phase, I don't try to extend the
yong phase. I go to the next movement.

1856
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:02,560
yong phase. I go to the next movement.
 

1857
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,790
yong phase. I go to the next movement.
So, as I'm going here, that's where it

1858
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:06,800
So, as I'm going here, that's where it
 

1859
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:12,310
So, as I'm going here, that's where it
drops. Okay.

1860
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:12,320

 

1861
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,149

I'm having Andrew pull because he's

1862
01:18:14,149 --> 01:18:14,159
I'm having Andrew pull because he's
 

1863
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:18,229
I'm having Andrew pull because he's
doing weird stuff. Okay, on here I feel

1864
01:18:18,229 --> 01:18:18,239
doing weird stuff. Okay, on here I feel
 

1865
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:21,030
doing weird stuff. Okay, on here I feel
I got got light adhesion is lightening

1866
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:21,040
I got got light adhesion is lightening
 

1867
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,149
I got got light adhesion is lightening
up. Okay, as it's lightening up I to

1868
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:24,159
up. Okay, as it's lightening up I to
 

1869
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:27,990

1872
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:41,280

 

1873
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,470

I am not trying to leverage. Not trying

1877
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,750
to leverage. Do you understand? I keep
that feeling.

1878
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:49,760
that feeling.
 

1879
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,669
that feeling.
It's getting light. There's that

1880
01:18:51,669 --> 01:18:51,679
It's getting light. There's that
 

1881
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:53,990
It's getting light. There's that
feeling.

1882
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:54,000
feeling.
 

1883
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,390
feeling.
Understand? Okay. Let's take the fingers

1884
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:56,400
Understand? Okay. Let's take the fingers
 

1885
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,510
Understand? Okay. Let's take the fingers
away and give a little pulling pressure

1886
01:18:59,510 --> 01:18:59,520
away and give a little pulling pressure
 

1887
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,990
away and give a little pulling pressure
cuz you're culturally so trained to walk

1888
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:02,000
cuz you're culturally so trained to walk
 

1889
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,070
cuz you're culturally so trained to walk
in

1890
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:04,080
in
 

1891
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,070
in
No matter how many hours we're doing

1892
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:06,080
No matter how many hours we're doing
 

1893
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:11,270
No matter how many hours we're doing
where we're just standing still.

1894
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:11,280

 

1895
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,910

Slight pull. Just a slight pull. Not a

1896
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:13,920
Slight pull. Just a slight pull. Not a
 

1897
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,470
Slight pull. Just a slight pull. Not a
huge pull.

1898
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:18,480

 

1899
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,910

You got to bring him forward. We have to

1900
01:19:21,910 --> 01:19:21,920
You got to bring him forward. We have to
 

1901
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,390
You got to bring him forward. We have to
go to the full

1902
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:24,400
go to the full
 

1903
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:33,510
go to the full
yin part.

1904
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:33,520

 

1905
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:47,110

without pulling

1906
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:47,120

 

1907
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:52,470

because you lean, you don't move. So,

1908
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:52,480
because you lean, you don't move. So,
 

1909
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,550
because you lean, you don't move. So,
okay,

1910
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:54,560
okay,
 

1911
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,630
okay,
if you're going like this and you move

1912
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:56,640
if you're going like this and you move
 

1913
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,510
if you're going like this and you move
towards him, The energy is not going

1914
01:19:59,510 --> 01:19:59,520
towards him, The energy is not going
 

1915
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,910
towards him, The energy is not going
that way. You you're going like that. So

1916
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:01,920
that way. You you're going like that. So
 

1917
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,229
that way. You you're going like that. So
you're over here. I'm going to move his

1918
01:20:04,229 --> 01:20:04,239
you're over here. I'm going to move his
 

1919
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:06,470
you're over here. I'm going to move his
center.

1920
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:06,480
center.
 

1921
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,709
center.
Now feel feel that that way. Okay. But

01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:12,400
look what happens when I go like that.
 

1925
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,149
look what happens when I go like that.
It comes off. That's what you're doing.

1926
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:14,159
It comes off. That's what you're doing.
 

1927
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:17,430
It comes off. That's what you're doing.
Okay. So again, I have videos of Chiba

1928
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:17,440
Okay. So again, I have videos of Chiba
 

1929
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:22,390
Okay. So again, I have videos of Chiba

Move him. It's still working. You see
 

1933
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,270
Move him. It's still working. You see
it's not yin yet. Keep moving him. Then

1934
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:29,280

2272
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:26,320
And don't do anything you can. Don't do
 

2273

2275
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:34,149
anything. Don't take any you can. Don't
turn your center. Don't do anything.

2276
01:33:34,149 --> 01:33:34,159

 

2277
01:33:34,159 --> 01:34:28,870

No one's throwing you.

2278
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:28,880

 

2279
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:34,390

It's nice at the beginning,

2280
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:34,400

 

2281
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,229

but

2282
01:34:36,229 --> 01:34:36,239
but
 

2283
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:37,830
but
It

2284
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:37,840
It
 

2285
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:52,229
It
see

2286
01:34:52,229 --> 01:34:52,239

 

2287
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:54,790

2288
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:54,800
pressure
 

2289
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,430
pressure
I let your momentum do it. This I don't

2290
01:34:57,430 --> 01:34:57,440
I let your momentum do it. This I don't
 

2291
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,669
I let your momentum do it. This I don't
want to ever let your momentum do it. I

2292
01:34:59,669 --> 01:34:59,679
want to ever let your momentum do it. I
 

2293
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:01,430
want to ever let your momentum do it. I
don't contest the momentum, but

2294
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:01,440
don't contest the momentum, but
 

2295
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,910
don't contest the momentum, but
especially in this drill, I keep the

2296
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:03,920
especially in this drill, I keep the
 

2297
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,790
especially in this drill, I keep the
pressure. The pressure

2298
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:06,800
pressure. The pressure
 

2299
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,270
pressure. The pressure
is the same.

2300
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:09,280
is the same.
 

2301
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:12,070
is the same.
Same way though, I don't want to go over

2302
01:35:12,070 --> 01:35:12,080
Same way though, I don't want to go over
 

2303
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,669
Same way though, I don't want to go over
pressure. Pressure increase. Okay, try

2304
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:15,679
pressure. Pressure increase. Okay, try
 

2305
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:42,149
pressure. Pressure increase. Okay, try
it again.

2306
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:42,159

 

2307
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:45,350

Don't do tension.

2308
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:45,360
Don't do tension.
 

2309
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:54,550
Don't do tension.
My arm did not come forward.

2310
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:54,560

 

2311
01:35:54,560 --> 01:36:01,189

Don't come forward.

2313
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,590

Don't turn. Don't do anything. Don't

2314
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:03,600
Don't turn. Don't do anything. Don't
 

2315
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,270
Don't turn. Don't do anything. Don't
bring tension into you. You're just a

2316
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:05,280
bring tension into you. You're just a
 

2317
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:10,990
bring tension into you. You're just a
barbell right now.

2318
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:11,000

 

2319
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:19,189

[Music]

2320
01:36:19,189 --> 01:36:19,199

 

2321
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,189

Come up. Come up. Don't come back. We're

2322
01:36:21,189 --> 01:36:21,199
Come up. Come up. Don't come back. We're
 

2323
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:22,790
Come up. Come up. Don't come back. We're
not coming back. I'll demonstrate it

2324
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:22,800
not coming back. I'll demonstrate it
 

2325
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,550
not coming back. I'll demonstrate it
again. So, okay, I'll give you my

2326
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:26,560
again. So, okay, I'll give you my
 

2327
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,030
again. So, okay, I'll give you my
perception of what's going on. I can

2328
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:29,040
perception of what's going on. I can
 

2329
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:33,510
perception of what's going on. I can
barely get you into the drill.

2330
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:33,520
barely get you into the drill.
 

2331
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,270
barely get you into the drill.
If you pay attention, there's a lot of

If you pay attention, there's a lot of
 

2333
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:36,870
If you pay attention, there's a lot of
repetition.

2334
01:36:36,870 --> 01:36:36,880
repetition.
 

2335
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,189
repetition.
There's some insults. There's Jesus

2336
01:36:39,189 --> 01:36:39,199
There's some insults. There's Jesus
 

2337
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:43,830
There's some insults. There's Jesus
fought. We can't do the drill.

2338
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:43,840
fought. We can't do the drill.
 

2339
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,310
fought. We can't do the drill.
When did that start?

2340
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:46,320
When did that start?
 

2341
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:49,430
When did that start?
When we got to Tension.

2342
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:49,440
When we got to Tension.
 

2343
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,590
When we got to Tension.
You won't let go. That was last night's

2344
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:51,600
You won't let go. That was last night's
 

2345
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:55,430
You won't let go. That was last night's
talk. Okay? And the a lot of the

2346
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:55,440
talk. Okay? And the a lot of the
 

2347
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:58,229
talk. Okay? And the a lot of the
repetitions are just do the feeling.

2348
01:36:58,229 --> 01:36:58,239
repetitions are just do the feeling.
 

2349
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:01,750
repetitions are just do the feeling.
Just do the feeling. Don't do tension.

01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:01,760
Just do the feeling. Don't do tension.
 

2351

Just do the feeling. Don't do tension.
So something as obvious as just note

2352
01:37:05,189 --> 01:37:05,199
So something as obvious as just note
 

2353
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:11,669
So something as obvious as just note
what my hand is doing in space.

2354
01:37:11,669 --> 01:37:11,679

 

2355
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:13,990

You see

2356
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:14,000
You see
 

2357
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,310
You see
all of a sudden?

2358
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:18,320

 

2359
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,790

Wait a minute. That freaking went

2360
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:20,800
Wait a minute. That freaking went
 

2361
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:27,990
Wait a minute. That freaking went
forward. You see that?

2362
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:28,000

 

2363
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,149

What? Why is that happening? I'm stuck

2364
01:37:30,149 --> 01:37:30,159
What? Why is that happening? I'm stuck
 

2365
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:32,790
What? Why is that happening? I'm stuck
in the habitual way of being. I don't

2366
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:32,800
in the habitual way of being. I don't
 

2367
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,430
in the habitual way of being. I don't
have enough discipline, control of my

2368
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:35,440
have enough discipline, control of my
 

2369
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:38,470
have enough discipline, control of my
mind to see purely and then to do what

2370
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:38,480
mind to see purely and then to do what
 

2371
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,390
mind to see purely and then to do what
I've seen. I just go right into

2372
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:40,400
I've seen. I just go right into
 

2373
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:45,669
I've seen. I just go right into
autopilot. Okay, got it? So, you have to

2374
01:37:45,669 --> 01:37:45,679
autopilot. Okay, got it? So, you have to
 

2375
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:49,109
autopilot. Okay, got it? So, you have to
step up, dig deeper,

2376
01:37:49,109 --> 01:37:49,119
step up, dig deeper,
 

2377
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:51,590
step up, dig deeper,
do some mind tricks if you need to. I'm

2378
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:51,600
do some mind tricks if you need to. I'm
 

2379
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:55,109
do some mind tricks if you need to. I'm
not doing tension. I'm just doing

2380
01:37:55,109 --> 01:37:55,119
not doing tension. I'm just doing
 

2381
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,510
not doing tension. I'm just doing
this. That's all.

01:37:57,510 --> 01:37:57,520
this. That's all.
 

2383
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,590
this. That's all.
That's all I'm

01:37:59,590 --> 01:37:59,600
That's all I'm
 

2385
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,070
That's all I'm
okay. I'm not going to throw him. I'm

2386
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:02,080
okay. I'm not going to throw him. I'm
 

2387
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,950
okay. I'm not going to throw him. I'm
not trying to throw him. Same thing as

2388
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:04,960
not trying to throw him. Same thing as
 

2389
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:08,310
not trying to throw him. Same thing as
I'm not getting ready for

01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:08,320
I'm not getting ready for
 

2391
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,790
I'm not getting ready for
I'm not doing anything. Okay. Have a

I'm not doing anything. Okay. Have a
 

2393
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:31,030
I'm not doing anything. Okay. Have a
pure experience. Okay. Try it again.

2394
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:31,040

 

2395
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,350

need to come up more. You need to move

2396
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:33,360
need to come up more. You need to move
 

2397
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,750
need to come up more. You need to move
the center more. No, that's your tension

2398
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:35,760
the center more. No, that's your tension
 

2399
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,550
the center more. No, that's your tension
on him. Move his center past yours.

2400
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:38,560
on him. Move his center past yours.
 

2401
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,590
on him. Move his center past yours.
There you go.

2402
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:41,600
There you go.
 

2403
01:38:41,600 --> 01:39:00,229
There you go.
You came. You got uh the palm came off.

2404
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:00,239

 

2405
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:11,590

Bring it center passing mark center.

2406
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:11,600

 

2407
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:15,350

Don't come back forward.

2408
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:15,360

 

2409
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,149

More even more passing. Don't come back.

2410
01:39:18,149 --> 01:39:18,159
More even more passing. Don't come back.
 

2411
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:21,030
More even more passing. Don't come back.
If your hands going west, then there's

2412
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:21,040
If your hands going west, then there's
 

2413
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:33,750
If your hands going west, then there's
no way he's coming forward

2414
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:33,760

 

2415
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,830

more pass. You want to do the full.

2416
01:39:37,830 --> 01:39:37,840
more pass. You want to do the full.
 

2417
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,109
more pass. You want to do the full.
You understand? Yes. If you would not

2418
01:39:41,109 --> 01:39:41,119
You understand? Yes. If you would not
 

2419
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:45,030
You understand? Yes. If you would not
have moved him by going more past,

2420
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:45,040
have moved him by going more past,
 

2421
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,270
have moved him by going more past,
right, you would have been in yin phase,

2422
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:47,280
right, you would have been in yin phase,
 

2423
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,750
right, you would have been in yin phase,
but yet he moved, which means you were

2424
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:49,760
but yet he moved, which means you were
 

2425
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:53,350
but yet he moved, which means you were
still in y face and you just stopped.

2426
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:53,360
still in y face and you just stopped.
 

2427
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:56,550
still in y face and you just stopped.
What made that a stopping point? Your

2428
01:39:56,550 --> 01:39:56,560
What made that a stopping point? Your
 

2429
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:01,109
What made that a stopping point? Your
ten. Okay. I want you to feel when it

2430
01:40:01,109 --> 01:40:01,119
ten. Okay. I want you to feel when it
 

2431
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:04,550
ten. Okay. I want you to feel when it
goes into yin phase. Don't want you to

2432

do
I stop. There's a lot of pressure there.

2436
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:10,080
I stop. There's a lot of pressure there.
 

2437
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,470
I stop. There's a lot of pressure there.
Do you understand? I go here. You'll

2438
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:12,480
Do you understand? I go here. You'll
 

2439
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:13,830
Do you understand? I go here. You'll
feel it come off. You'll feel it come

01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,830
feel it come off. You'll feel it come
off. You feel the pressure. Feel the

off. You feel the pressure. Feel the
pressure. It got lighter.

2444
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:19,440
pressure. It got lighter.
 

2445
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:24,070
pressure. It got lighter.
Don't do your freaking thing.

2446
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:24,080
Don't do your freaking thing.
 

2447
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:29,590
Don't do your freaking thing.
Why would you bend backwards? Why?

2448
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:29,600

 

2449
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,229

Does everyone understand that? Why would

2450
01:40:32,229 --> 01:40:32,239
Does everyone understand that? Why would
 

2451
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:34,950
Does everyone understand that? Why would
Why would you lean? What in what I am

2452
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:34,960
Why would you lean? What in what I am
 

2453
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:40,070
Why would you lean? What in what I am
doing would make you lean backwards.

2454
01:40:40,070 --> 01:40:40,080
doing would make you lean backwards.
 

2455
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,070
doing would make you lean backwards.
I'm not coming forward, so you can't say

2456
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:42,080
I'm not coming forward, so you can't say
 

2457
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,430
I'm not coming forward, so you can't say
you're getting out of the way of the

2458
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:43,440
you're getting out of the way of the
 

2459
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,109
you're getting out of the way of the
strike.

2460
01:40:45,109 --> 01:40:45,119
strike.
 

2461
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:47,830
strike.
I didn't push on your head, so you you

2462
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:47,840
I didn't push on your head, so you you
 

2463
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,070
I didn't push on your head, so you you
can't say I made you go backwards, but

2464
01:40:50,070 --> 01:40:50,080
can't say I made you go backwards, but
 

2465
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:53,990
can't say I made you go backwards, but
he went right into that stuff. Okay?

2466
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,000
he went right into that stuff. Okay?
 

2467
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:06,229
he went right into that stuff. Okay?
You just are a tool.

2468
01:41:06,229 --> 01:41:06,239

 

2469
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:08,310

Okay, even that is too much for me.

2470
01:41:08,310 --> 01:41:08,320
Okay, even that is too much for me.
 

2471
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:11,350
Okay, even that is too much for me.
Like, what are you afraid of? The little

2472
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:11,360
Like, what are you afraid of? The little
 

2473
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:16,870
Like, what are you afraid of? The little
tap on your face.

2474
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:16,880

 

2475
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:24,950

Go.

2476
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:24,960

 

2477
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:27,109

Is there a poo on my elbow or something?

2478
01:41:27,109 --> 01:41:27,119
Is there a poo on my elbow or something?
 

2479
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:33,189
Is there a poo on my elbow or something?
You don't want me to touch your face?

2480
01:41:33,189 --> 01:41:33,199

 

2481
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:37,590

You're going up to come in doing tension

2482
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:37,600
You're going up to come in doing tension
 

2483
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:47,030
You're going up to come in doing tension
on it.

2484
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:47,040

 

2485
01:41:47,040 --> 01:42:03,669

There's still more

2486
01:42:03,669 --> 01:42:03,679

 

2487
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:21,430

Hi.

2488
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:21,440

 

2489
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:33,270

Okay, start.

2490
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:33,280

 

2491
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:37,830

Don't come up right. You'll be going 90°

2492
01:42:37,830 --> 01:42:37,840
Don't come up right. You'll be going 90°
 

2493
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,709
Don't come up right. You'll be going 90°
to your own movement.

2494
01:42:40,709 --> 01:42:40,719
to your own movement.
 

2495
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:50,390
to your own movement.
Are you going to make the edge?

2496
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:50,400

 

2497
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:59,350

He needs to come in way more.

2498
01:42:59,350 --> 01:42:59,360

 

2499
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:03,030

Don't go up.

2500
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:03,040

 

2501
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:05,510

Don't go up. Don't go forward. The

2502
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:05,520
Don't go up. Don't go forward. The
 

2503
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:12,070
Don't go up. Don't go forward. The
movement's coming back.

2504
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:12,080

 

2505
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,750

It doesn't go with your shoulder.

2506
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:15,760
It doesn't go with your shoulder.
 

2507
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:25,109
It doesn't go with your shoulder.
Not your outer deltoid that's moving.

2508
01:43:25,109 --> 01:43:25,119

 

2509
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:49,750

Not my way.

2510
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:49,760

 

2511
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,750

There's this.

2512
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:53,760

 

2513
01:43:53,760 --> 01:44:13,030

That's not where I go.

2514
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:13,040

 

2515
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:30,790

Okay.

2516
01:44:30,790 --> 01:44:30,800

 

2517
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:38,470

You're going up the energy for yourself.

2518
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:38,480

 

2519
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:41,030

Use the energy. It will go off on its

2520
01:44:41,030 --> 01:44:41,040
Use the energy. It will go off on its
 

2521
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:50,550
Use the energy. It will go off on its
own.

2522
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:50,560

 

2523
01:44:50,560 --> 01:45:04,709

Hey, Parker.

2524
01:45:04,709 --> 01:45:04,719

 

2525
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:09,030

Don't come forward.

2526
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:09,040

 

2527
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:10,950

You could you could let your stance be

2528
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:10,960
You could you could let your stance be
 

2529
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:13,750
You could you could let your stance be
moved like I did on you so that I'm not

2530
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:13,760
moved like I did on you so that I'm not
 

2531
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,470
moved like I did on you so that I'm not
smashing him in the face. Okay. But

2532
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:16,480
smashing him in the face. Okay. But
 

2533
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,629
smashing him in the face. Okay. But
don't come forward. Yes. We don't have

2534
01:45:18,629 --> 01:45:18,639
don't come forward. Yes. We don't have
 

2535
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:22,229
don't come forward. Yes. We don't have
to kill him. Yes.

2536
01:45:22,229 --> 01:45:22,239
to kill him. Yes.
 

2537
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:26,149
to kill him. Yes.
Now you're using the outer deltoid.

2538
01:45:26,149 --> 01:45:26,159
Now you're using the outer deltoid.
 

2539
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:29,350
Now you're using the outer deltoid.
Use the ground.

2540
01:45:29,350 --> 01:45:29,360
Use the ground.
 

2541
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,750
Use the ground.
Outer deltoid. Do you understand what

2542
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:31,760
Outer deltoid. Do you understand what
 

2543
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,550
Outer deltoid. Do you understand what
I'm saying? Yes. Yes. Okay. Can you feel

2544
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:34,560
I'm saying? Yes. Yes. Okay. Can you feel

I'm saying? Yes. Yes. Okay. Can you feel
it? Yes. All right.

2546
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:36,880
it? Yes. All right.
 

2547
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,990
it? Yes. All right.
Smooth the center

2548
01:45:39,990 --> 01:45:40,000
Smooth the center
 

2549
01:45:40,000 --> 01:46:11,990
Smooth the center
with the ground.

2550
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:12,000

 

2551
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,470

Nope. I know they tell you go up. I know

2552
01:46:14,470 --> 01:46:14,480
Nope. I know they tell you go up. I know
 

2553
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:17,910
Nope. I know they tell you go up. I know
they're like go up, right?

2554
01:46:17,910 --> 01:46:17,920
they're like go up, right?
 

2555
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:20,629
they're like go up, right?
See people do see people do that stuff,

2556
01:46:20,629 --> 01:46:20,639
See people do see people do that stuff,
 

2557
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:24,229
See people do see people do that stuff,
right? I know that. Okay.

2558
01:46:24,229 --> 01:46:24,239
right? I know that. Okay.
 

2559
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:27,510
right? I know that. Okay.
But you're not in the center. Okay. And

2560
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:27,520
But you're not in the center. Okay. And
 

2561
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,669
But you're not in the center. Okay. And
he just is trying to go backwards as

2562
01:46:29,669 --> 01:46:29,679
he just is trying to go backwards as
 

2563
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:33,189
he just is trying to go backwards as
soon as he smells that or turn. Okay.

2564
01:46:33,189 --> 01:46:33,199
soon as he smells that or turn. Okay.
 

2565
01:46:33,199 --> 01:46:35,830
soon as he smells that or turn. Okay.
So, we're not doing that

2566
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:35,840
So, we're not doing that
 

2567
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,709
So, we're not doing that
again. And here.

2568
01:46:38,709 --> 01:46:38,719
again. And here.
 

2569
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:40,709
again. And here.
There's the pull. That's That's how we

2570
01:46:40,709 --> 01:46:40,719
There's the pull. That's That's how we
 

2571
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:43,590
There's the pull. That's That's how we
started the drill. There it is. And I

2572
01:46:43,590 --> 01:46:43,600
started the drill. There it is. And I
 

2573
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,669
started the drill. There it is. And I
move that.

2574
01:46:45,669 --> 01:46:45,679
move that.
 

2575
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:48,950
move that.
That's now going off because I stopped

2576
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:48,960
That's now going off because I stopped
 

2577
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:52,470
That's now going off because I stopped
bouching. Okay. I keep the pressure all

2578
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:52,480
bouching. Okay. I keep the pressure all
 

2579
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:56,629
bouching. Okay. I keep the pressure all
the way and I'm here.

2580
01:46:56,629 --> 01:46:56,639
the way and I'm here.
 

2581
01:46:56,639 --> 01:47:00,790
the way and I'm here.
That's not that I'm lifting my arm.

2582
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:00,800
That's not that I'm lifting my arm.
 

2583
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,310
That's not that I'm lifting my arm.
I keep the pressure

2584
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:04,320
I keep the pressure
 

2585
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,390
I keep the pressure
there.

2586
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:06,400
there.
 

2587
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:09,750
there.
If I stop lifting my arm, just like

2588
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:09,760
If I stop lifting my arm, just like
 

2589
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,990
If I stop lifting my arm, just like
stopping, you'll feel the pressure will

2590
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:12,000
stopping, you'll feel the pressure will
 

2591
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,470
stopping, you'll feel the pressure will
go off.

2592
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:14,480
go off.
 

2593
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,310
go off.
You see?

2594
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:16,320
You see?
 

2595
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,950
You see?
But I'm not just

2596
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:18,960

this is coming off because we're pulling

2716
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:24,480
this is coming off because we're pulling
 

2717
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:27,990
this is coming off because we're pulling
on it. So when you're here like this

2718
01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:28,000
on it. So when you're here like this
 

2719
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,990
on it. So when you're here like this
pulling on it and then I

2720
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:32,000
pulling on it and then I
 

2721
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,430
pulling on it and then I
stay on it. There's this is that I Stay

2722
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:35,440
stay on it. There's this is that I Stay
 

2723

When you feel that pull,

2728
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:44,880
When you feel that pull,
 

2729
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:48,310
When you feel that pull,
you would feel the the pressure on the

2730
01:52:48,310 --> 01:52:48,320
you would feel the the pressure on the
 

2731
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:51,270
you would feel the the pressure on the
joints, but you would also feel the loss

2732
01:52:51,270 --> 01:52:51,280
joints, but you would also feel the loss
 

2733
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:53,189
joints, but you would also feel the loss
of his center when you're when that

2734
01:52:53,189 --> 01:52:53,199
of his center when you're when that
 

2735
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:55,270
of his center when you're when that
happens. Okay.

2736
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:55,280
happens. Okay.
 

2737
01:52:55,280 --> 01:53:05,669
happens. Okay.
So, I just doing this

01:53:05,669 --> 01:53:05,679

 

2739
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:09,669

feeling this.

01:53:09,669 --> 01:53:09,679
feeling this.
 

2741
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:11,669
feeling this.
I know it's there. You're like, "Got

this. I feel this. This looks nothing

2746
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:18,880
this. I feel this. This looks nothing
 

2747
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:23,030
this. I feel this. This looks nothing
like tension right now. Except for I'm

2748
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:23,040
like tension right now. Except for I'm
 

2749
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:26,629

on the inside of his palm and moving
 

2751
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:29,109
on the inside of his palm and moving
this thing.

01:53:29,109 --> 01:53:29,119
this thing.
 

2753
01:53:29,119 --> 01:53:41,910
this thing.
Okay, try again.

2754
01:53:41,910 --> 01:53:41,920

 

2755

Don't walk through.

2764
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:14,480

 

2765
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:18,629

Okay.

2766
01:54:18,629 --> 01:54:18,639

 

2767
01:54:18,639 --> 01:54:21,830

The two hands work

2768
01:54:21,830 --> 01:54:21,840
The two hands work
 

2769
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:24,950
The two hands work
when when I go like this,

2770
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:24,960
when when I go like this,
 

2771
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:29,669
when when I go like this,
the two hands work to inhibit the turn.

2772
01:54:29,669 --> 01:54:29,679
the two hands work to inhibit the turn.
 

2773
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:31,189
the two hands work to inhibit the turn.
So

2774
01:54:31,189 --> 01:54:31,199
So
 

2775
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:36,629
So
when this hand is going this way,

2776
01:54:36,629 --> 01:54:36,639

 

2777
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:39,589

it's hard for him to turn. Do you

2778
01:54:39,589 --> 01:54:39,599
it's hard for him to turn. Do you
 

2779
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:43,189
it's hard for him to turn. Do you
understand? Just like the spinal

2780
01:54:43,189 --> 01:54:43,199
understand? Just like the spinal
 

2781
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:45,510
understand? Just like the spinal
displacement and the occupation, the

2782
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:45,520
displacement and the occupation, the
 

2783
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:48,470
displacement and the occupation, the
occupying of his center of gravity on

2784
01:54:48,470 --> 01:54:48,480
occupying of his center of gravity on
 

2785
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:51,669
occupying of his center of gravity on
the initial assault is hard to turn.

2786
01:54:51,669 --> 01:54:51,679
the initial assault is hard to turn.
 

2787
01:54:51,679 --> 01:54:54,550
the initial assault is hard to turn.
Which is why the only person who can

2788
01:54:54,550 --> 01:54:54,560
Which is why the only person who can
 

2789
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,790
Which is why the only person who can
turn is the person who's not actually

2790
01:54:56,790 --> 01:54:56,800
turn is the person who's not actually
 

2791
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:00,070
turn is the person who's not actually
doing the assault. Okay. But this hand

2792
01:55:00,070 --> 01:55:00,080
doing the assault. Okay. But this hand
 

2793
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:04,310
doing the assault. Okay. But this hand
is in there. So again, don't do tenag

2794
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:04,320
is in there. So again, don't do tenag
 

2795
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,070
is in there. So again, don't do tenag
can open your grips and make it even

2796
01:55:06,070 --> 01:55:06,080
can open your grips and make it even
 

2797
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:09,990
can open your grips and make it even
more foreign. But I am now doing the two

2798
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:10,000
more foreign. But I am now doing the two
 

2799
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,669
more foreign. But I am now doing the two
of them together. Eventually you'll feel

2800
01:55:13,669 --> 01:55:13,679
of them together. Eventually you'll feel
 

2801
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:16,790
of them together. Eventually you'll feel
this one is now lot lighter than that

2802
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:16,800
this one is now lot lighter than that
 

2803
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,870
this one is now lot lighter than that
one. And that is where this goes into

2804
01:55:20,870 --> 01:55:20,880
one. And that is where this goes into
 

2805
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:23,669
one. And that is where this goes into
the movement. All I'm not I'm still not

2806
01:55:23,669 --> 01:55:23,679
the movement. All I'm not I'm still not
 

2807
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:27,109
the movement. All I'm not I'm still not
doing tension on it. I'm just

2808
01:55:27,109 --> 01:55:27,119
doing tension on it. I'm just
 

2809
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:29,669
doing tension on it. I'm just
working on this skin phase. Okay. On the

2810
01:55:29,669 --> 01:55:29,679
working on this skin phase. Okay. On the
 

2811
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:33,510
working on this skin phase. Okay. On the
earth hand. So I'm moving him. Got

2812
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:33,520
earth hand. So I'm moving him. Got
 

2813
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:36,470
earth hand. So I'm moving him. Got
light. And that's when I move. When I

2814
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:36,480
light. And that's when I move. When I
 

2815
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:40,149
light. And that's when I move. When I
move, I move around it. It does not move

2816
01:55:40,149 --> 01:55:40,159
move, I move around it. It does not move
 

2817
01:55:40,159 --> 01:55:44,390
move, I move around it. It does not move
around me. So as I'm moving,

2818
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:44,400
around me. So as I'm moving,
 

2819
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:47,189
around me. So as I'm moving,
I'm moving around it.

2820
01:55:47,189 --> 01:55:47,199
I'm moving around it.
 

2821
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:50,310
I'm moving around it.
Okay. So a difference would be my hands

2822
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:50,320
Okay. So a difference would be my hands
 

2823
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:53,270
Okay. So a difference would be my hands
moving around me.

2824
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:53,280
moving around me.
 

2825
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:57,350
moving around me.
I move around my hand.

2826
01:55:57,350 --> 01:55:57,360
I move around my hand.
 

2827
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:00,550
I move around my hand.
All my hand is doing is that. Okay. Make

01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:09,109
two, and it keeps rotating as if you
were going to come back around like

2836
01:56:09,109 --> 01:56:09,119
were going to come back around like
 

2837

02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:04,400
moves around.
 

2931
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:10,629
moves around.
You see? So, One, two, three.

2932
02:01:10,629 --> 02:01:10,639
You see? So, One, two, three.
 

2933
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:15,430
You see? So, One, two, three.
Not it goes out and stays out there.

2934
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:15,440
Not it goes out and stays out there.
 

2935
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:18,229
Not it goes out and stays out there.
I want to disappear.

2936
02:01:18,229 --> 02:01:18,239
I want to disappear.
 

2937
02:01:18,239 --> 02:01:32,070
I want to disappear.
Okay, try it again.

2938
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:32,080

 

2939
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:43,510

Better timing.

2940
02:01:43,510 --> 02:01:43,520

 

2941
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:45,109

Go around it. Don't pull it. Keep it

2942
02:01:45,109 --> 02:01:45,119
Go around it. Don't pull it. Keep it
 

2943
02:01:45,119 --> 02:01:46,709
Go around it. Don't pull it. Keep it
under your center. Just like the show

2944
02:01:46,709 --> 02:01:46,719
under your center. Just like the show
 

2945
02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:48,870
under your center. Just like the show
work. Where's your power? Underneath

2946
02:01:48,870 --> 02:01:48,880
work. Where's your power? Underneath
 

2947
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:51,669
work. Where's your power? Underneath
your center.

2948
02:01:51,669 --> 02:01:51,679
your center.
 

2949
02:01:51,679 --> 02:01:54,310
your center.
Don't pull it across your body. Don't

2950
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:54,320
Don't pull it across your body. Don't
 

2951
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:56,950
Don't pull it across your body. Don't
push it away from your body.

2952
02:01:56,950 --> 02:01:56,960
push it away from your body.
 

2953
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:01,589
push it away from your body.
You're pulling it away.

2954
02:02:01,589 --> 02:02:01,599

 

2955
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:07,589

Don't pull it away.

2956
02:02:07,589 --> 02:02:07,599

 

2957
02:02:07,599 --> 02:02:09,669

Go around it. Go make a circle around

2958
02:02:09,669 --> 02:02:09,679
Go around it. Go make a circle around
 

2959
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:18,629
Go around it. Go make a circle around
it.

2960
02:02:18,629 --> 02:02:18,639

 

2961
02:02:18,639 --> 02:02:34,149

Why is it here? Why can't it be here?

2962
02:02:34,149 --> 02:02:34,159

 

2963
02:02:34,159 --> 02:02:35,750

Better.

2964
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:35,760
Better.
 

2965
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:42,149
Better.
Don't pull it across your body.

2966
02:02:42,149 --> 02:02:42,159

 

2967
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:43,910

Don't pull. See how he pull See how he

2968
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:43,920
Don't pull. See how he pull See how he
 

2969
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:52,070
Don't pull. See how he pull See how he
pulls it. Pulling it.

2970
02:02:52,070 --> 02:02:52,080

 

2971
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:53,669

Go around it. Don't pull it. Don't pull

2972
02:02:53,669 --> 02:02:53,679
Go around it. Don't pull it. Don't pull
 

2973
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:57,830
Go around it. Don't pull it. Don't pull
it to your right.

2974
02:02:57,830 --> 02:02:57,840

 

2975
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:02,310

So again like um

2976
02:03:02,310 --> 02:03:02,320

 

2977
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:05,990

right the uh

2978
02:03:05,990 --> 02:03:06,000
right the uh
 

2979
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,870
right the uh
the institutional understanding is that

2980
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:08,880
the institutional understanding is that
 

2981
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:11,510
the institutional understanding is that
you pull you pull the arm and then

2982
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:11,520
you pull you pull the arm and then
 

2983
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:13,669
you pull you pull the arm and then
eventually he loses his balance. You

2984
02:03:13,669 --> 02:03:13,679
eventually he loses his balance. You
 

2985
02:03:13,679 --> 02:03:15,350
eventually he loses his balance. You
know what I'm talking about? So when

2986
02:03:15,350 --> 02:03:15,360
know what I'm talking about? So when
 

2987
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:19,669
know what I'm talking about? So when
when I was first showing this technique,

2988
02:03:19,669 --> 02:03:19,679
when I was first showing this technique,
 

2989
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:21,750
when I was first showing this technique,
right, it would and I've still seen it

2990
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:21,760
right, it would and I've still seen it
 

2991
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:23,830
right, it would and I've still seen it
done this way, right? This move goes

2992
02:03:23,830 --> 02:03:23,840
done this way, right? This move goes
 

2993
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:27,589
done this way, right? This move goes
here. They're way freaking back there.

2994
02:03:27,589 --> 02:03:27,599
here. They're way freaking back there.
 

2995
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:32,390
here. They're way freaking back there.
Okay. Um, Sumio To has the same idea.

2996
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:32,400
Okay. Um, Sumio To has the same idea.
 

2997
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:34,550
Okay. Um, Sumio To has the same idea.
Like you pull this thing backwards.

2998
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:34,560
Like you pull this thing backwards.
 

2999
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:38,950
Like you pull this thing backwards.
Okay. Um,

3000
02:03:38,950 --> 02:03:38,960

 

3001
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:40,870

and you go, it worked. It pulled me off

3002
02:03:40,870 --> 02:03:40,880
and you go, it worked. It pulled me off
 

3003
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:45,030
and you go, it worked. It pulled me off
balance. I did fall. Okay. Why does it

3004
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:45,040
balance. I did fall. Okay. Why does it
 

3005
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:47,270
balance. I did fall. Okay. Why does it
work? Because your feet, you didn't move

3006
02:03:47,270 --> 02:03:47,280
work? Because your feet, you didn't move
 

3007
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:50,310
work? Because your feet, you didn't move
your feet. If you keep your feet still

3008
02:03:50,310 --> 02:03:50,320
your feet. If you keep your feet still
 

3009
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:51,990
your feet. If you keep your feet still
then eventually I'll pull that line of

3010
02:03:51,990 --> 02:03:52,000
then eventually I'll pull that line of
 

3011
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,550
then eventually I'll pull that line of
gravity outside your base support. Got

3012
02:03:54,550 --> 02:03:54,560
gravity outside your base support. Got
 

3013
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:56,470
gravity outside your base support. Got
it? Okay. So now the assumption you

3014
02:03:56,470 --> 02:03:56,480
it? Okay. So now the assumption you
 

3015
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:58,229
it? Okay. So now the assumption you
question be what what keeps my feet

3016
02:03:58,229 --> 02:03:58,239
question be what what keeps my feet
 

3017
02:03:58,239 --> 02:04:00,870
question be what what keeps my feet
still

3018
02:04:00,870 --> 02:04:00,880
still
 

3019
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:03,589
still
what's keeping my feet still? No one

3020
02:04:03,589 --> 02:04:03,599
what's keeping my feet still? No one
 

3021
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:06,629
what's keeping my feet still? No one
ever asks that question. They just feel

3022
02:04:06,629 --> 02:04:06,639
ever asks that question. They just feel
 

3023
02:04:06,639 --> 02:04:11,750
ever asks that question. They just feel
yes the the go to the dead

3024
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:11,760
yes the the go to the dead
 

3025
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:13,270
yes the the go to the dead
Marshall.

3026
02:04:13,270 --> 02:04:13,280
Marshall.
 

3027
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:15,510
Marshall.
No one goes but why did I keep my feet

3028
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:15,520
No one goes but why did I keep my feet
 

3029
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:16,950
No one goes but why did I keep my feet
still? But you know what the wrestler

3030
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:16,960
still? But you know what the wrestler
 

3031
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:19,990

does? you.
 

3033
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,709
does? you.
Okay. And then we have the rope attack.

3034
02:04:22,709 --> 02:04:22,719
Okay. And then we have the rope attack.
 

3035

3037
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:32,790

that's why we don't pull.

3038
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:32,800
that's why we don't pull.
 

3039
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:36,070
that's why we don't pull.
Okay. We don't want to

Okay.

3096
02:06:43,910 --> 02:06:43,920

 

3097
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:46,950

Some of you were able to uh you know you

3098
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:46,960
Some of you were able to uh you know you
 

3099
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:49,669
Some of you were able to uh you know you
I'm pro then and you started doing

3100
02:06:49,669 --> 02:06:49,679
I'm pro then and you started doing
 

3101
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:51,350
I'm pro then and you started doing
something. I'm not sure it's conscious

3102
02:06:51,350 --> 02:06:51,360
something. I'm not sure it's conscious
 

3103
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:53,109
something. I'm not sure it's conscious
though.

3104
02:06:53,109 --> 02:06:53,119
though.
 

3105
02:06:53,119 --> 02:06:55,669
though.
You started bringing them in. Do you

3106
02:06:55,669 --> 02:06:55,679
You started bringing them in. Do you
 

3107
02:06:55,679 --> 02:06:58,790
You started bringing them in. Do you
notice that? So, what are you doing?

3108
02:06:58,790 --> 02:06:58,800
notice that? So, what are you doing?
 

3109
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:01,750
notice that? So, what are you doing?
What does bringing them in do?

3110
02:07:01,750 --> 02:07:01,760
What does bringing them in do?
 

3111
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:03,350
What does bringing them in do?
Try to prevent them from going back by

3112
02:07:03,350 --> 02:07:03,360
Try to prevent them from going back by
 

3113
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:05,030
Try to prevent them from going back by
generating more forward momentum. Got

3114
02:07:05,030 --> 02:07:05,040
generating more forward momentum. Got
 

3115
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:07,350
generating more forward momentum. Got
it. I'm occupying their footwork with

3116
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:07,360
it. I'm occupying their footwork with
 

3117
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:11,030
it. I'm occupying their footwork with
the inertia of going forward. Okay. So,

3118
02:07:11,030 --> 02:07:11,040
the inertia of going forward. Okay. So,
 

3119
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:14,870
the inertia of going forward. Okay. So,
let's try um these two experiments

3120
02:07:14,870 --> 02:07:14,880
let's try um these two experiments
 

3121
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:19,189
let's try um these two experiments
because not all of you did it. Okay.

3122
02:07:19,189 --> 02:07:19,199
because not all of you did it. Okay.
 

3123
02:07:19,199 --> 02:07:21,350
because not all of you did it. Okay.
do it the way that I demonstrated which

3124
02:07:21,350 --> 02:07:21,360
do it the way that I demonstrated which
 

3125
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,350
do it the way that I demonstrated which
I said this is very common now you do

3126
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:23,360
I said this is very common now you do
 

3127
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:26,229
I said this is very common now you do
this so the person enters they don't

3128
02:07:26,229 --> 02:07:26,239
this so the person enters they don't
 

3129
02:07:26,239 --> 02:07:29,109
this so the person enters they don't
bring the person forward the person grab

3130
02:07:29,109 --> 02:07:29,119
bring the person forward the person grab
 

3131
02:07:29,119 --> 02:07:31,990
bring the person forward the person grab
is not pushing you enter right you go to

3132
02:07:31,990 --> 02:07:32,000
is not pushing you enter right you go to
 

3133
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,910
is not pushing you enter right you go to
the shaku you you me Marshall you

3134
02:07:35,910 --> 02:07:35,920
the shaku you you me Marshall you
 

3135
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:38,950
the shaku you you me Marshall you
understand

3136
02:07:38,950 --> 02:07:38,960

 

3137
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:42,790

you're here like this this way that's

3138
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:42,800
you're here like this this way that's
 

3139
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:48,470
you're here like this this way that's
what you're doing okay try it

3140
02:07:48,470 --> 02:07:48,480

 

3141
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:51,270

and Move your feet again.

3142
02:07:51,270 --> 02:07:51,280
and Move your feet again.
 

3143
02:07:51,280 --> 02:08:14,870
and Move your feet again.
Don't go down.

3144
02:08:14,870 --> 02:08:14,880

 

3145
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:19,030

Okay, now bring them in. Got it? You're

3146
02:08:19,030 --> 02:08:19,040
Okay, now bring them in. Got it? You're
 

3147
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:21,350
Okay, now bring them in. Got it? You're
going to bring them in

3148
02:08:21,350 --> 02:08:21,360
going to bring them in
 

3149
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:24,629
going to bring them in
and try to hit it. And you'll see if I

3150
02:08:24,629 --> 02:08:24,639
and try to hit it. And you'll see if I
 

3151
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:26,550
and try to hit it. And you'll see if I
got it, it's because I hit it when their

3152
02:08:26,550 --> 02:08:26,560
got it, it's because I hit it when their
 

3153
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:29,109
got it, it's because I hit it when their
inertia was going forward. Okay? They're

3154
02:08:29,109 --> 02:08:29,119
inertia was going forward. Okay? They're
 

3155
02:08:29,119 --> 02:08:30,629
inertia was going forward. Okay? They're
going to still try to get out of it

3156
02:08:30,629 --> 02:08:30,639
going to still try to get out of it
 

3157
02:08:30,639 --> 02:08:33,030
going to still try to get out of it
because the athlete can adapt to that.

3158
02:08:33,030 --> 02:08:33,040
because the athlete can adapt to that.
 

3159
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:35,830
because the athlete can adapt to that.
The more athletic you are, the more you

3160
02:08:35,830 --> 02:08:35,840
The more athletic you are, the more you
 

3161
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:38,069
The more athletic you are, the more you
can do. Okay?

3162
02:08:38,069 --> 02:08:38,079
can do. Okay?
 

3163
02:08:38,079 --> 02:08:40,229
can do. Okay?
So, what are you Noga's bringing them

3164
02:08:40,229 --> 02:08:40,239
So, what are you Noga's bringing them
 

3165
02:08:40,239 --> 02:08:42,470
So, what are you Noga's bringing them
in? They're not you're not pushing.

3166
02:08:42,470 --> 02:08:42,480
in? They're not you're not pushing.
 

3167
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:45,109
in? They're not you're not pushing.
They're bringing you in. And then you're

3168
02:08:45,109 --> 02:08:45,119
They're bringing you in. And then you're
 

3169
02:08:45,119 --> 02:08:46,709
They're bringing you in. And then you're
trying to not get thrown by moving your

3170
02:08:46,709 --> 02:08:46,719
trying to not get thrown by moving your
 

3171
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:48,390
trying to not get thrown by moving your
feet back underneath your line of

3172
02:08:48,390 --> 02:08:48,400
feet back underneath your line of
 

3173
02:08:48,400 --> 02:09:16,660
feet back underneath your line of
gravity. Go.

3174
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:16,670

 

3175
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:27,589

[Music]

3176
02:09:27,589 --> 02:09:27,599

 

3177
02:09:27,599 --> 02:09:31,830

Come on, Andrew.

3178
02:09:31,830 --> 02:09:31,840

 

3179
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:35,030

Okay, so

3180
02:09:35,030 --> 02:09:35,040
Okay, so
 

3181
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:37,109
Okay, so
everyone should have felt man the

3182
02:09:37,109 --> 02:09:37,119
everyone should have felt man the
 

3183
02:09:37,119 --> 02:09:41,189
everyone should have felt man the
pressure freaking increase like crazy

3184
02:09:41,189 --> 02:09:41,199
pressure freaking increase like crazy
 

3185
02:09:41,199 --> 02:09:43,510
pressure freaking increase like crazy
because I'm doing a young young class.

3186
02:09:43,510 --> 02:09:43,520
because I'm doing a young young class.
 

3187
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:47,430
because I'm doing a young young class.
Okay. And again, it'll work if I can

3188
02:09:47,430 --> 02:09:47,440
Okay. And again, it'll work if I can
 

3189
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:50,390
Okay. And again, it'll work if I can
overpower whatever young aspect you

3190
02:09:50,390 --> 02:09:50,400
overpower whatever young aspect you
 

3191
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:56,069
overpower whatever young aspect you
could have. So, we'll have this team go

3192
02:09:56,069 --> 02:09:56,079

 

3193
02:09:56,079 --> 02:09:57,990

and you're going to do the same thing

3194
02:09:57,990 --> 02:09:58,000
and you're going to do the same thing
 

3195
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:01,830
and you're going to do the same thing
and you see you can get it to work.

3196
02:10:01,830 --> 02:10:01,840
and you see you can get it to work.
 

3197
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:04,390
and you see you can get it to work.
See that? But that's not Io first of

3198
02:10:04,390 --> 02:10:04,400
See that? But that's not Io first of
 

3199
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:06,390
See that? But that's not Io first of
all. That has no effect on your

3200
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:06,400
all. That has no effect on your
 

3201
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:10,709
all. That has no effect on your
consciousness. And I don't know any any

3202
02:10:10,709 --> 02:10:10,719
consciousness. And I don't know any any
 

3203
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:12,470
consciousness. And I don't know any any
you know there would be no martial arts

3204
02:10:12,470 --> 02:10:12,480
you know there would be no martial arts
 

3205
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:15,430
you know there would be no martial arts
if the tagline was come learn to beat up

3206
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:15,440
if the tagline was come learn to beat up
 

3207
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:18,629
if the tagline was come learn to beat up
people you're way stronger than

3208
02:10:18,629 --> 02:10:18,639
people you're way stronger than
 

3209
02:10:18,639 --> 02:10:20,229
people you're way stronger than
you know what I mean? like that wouldn't

3210
02:10:20,229 --> 02:10:20,239
you know what I mean? like that wouldn't
 

3211
02:10:20,239 --> 02:10:23,430
you know what I mean? like that wouldn't
have been the selling point. Okay. Um

3212
02:10:23,430 --> 02:10:23,440
have been the selling point. Okay. Um
 

3213
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:29,430
have been the selling point. Okay. Um
but if we reverse the roll,

3214
02:10:29,430 --> 02:10:29,440

 

3215
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:31,910

bring them in.

3216
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:31,920
bring them in.
 

3217
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:34,310
bring them in.
You get this. I can't overcome it. Okay.

3218
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:34,320
You get this. I can't overcome it. Okay.
 

3219
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:37,910
You get this. I can't overcome it. Okay.
Does that make sense? All right. So, my

3220
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:37,920
Does that make sense? All right. So, my
 

3221
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:41,270
Does that make sense? All right. So, my
takeaway here is that

3222
02:10:41,270 --> 02:10:41,280
takeaway here is that
 

3223
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:44,069
takeaway here is that
you have to let go like yesterday's

3224
02:10:44,069 --> 02:10:44,079
you have to let go like yesterday's
 

3225
02:10:44,079 --> 02:10:47,030
you have to let go like yesterday's
talk. We have to let go

3226
02:10:47,030 --> 02:10:47,040
talk. We have to let go
 

3227
02:10:47,040 --> 02:10:50,950
talk. We have to let go
of what we think is functionable.

3228
02:10:50,950 --> 02:10:50,960
of what we think is functionable.
 

3229
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:52,870
of what we think is functionable.
It's not functioning. It doesn't

3230
02:10:52,870 --> 02:10:52,880
It's not functioning. It doesn't
 

3231
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:57,109
It's not functioning. It doesn't
function. It functions because my

3232
02:10:57,109 --> 02:10:57,119
function. It functions because my
 

3233
02:10:57,119 --> 02:11:00,629
function. It functions because my
institutional inertia is fixing my head.

3234
02:11:00,629 --> 02:11:00,639
institutional inertia is fixing my head.
 

3235
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:05,669
institutional inertia is fixing my head.
Okay, that's the marshall question.

3236
02:11:05,669 --> 02:11:05,679
Okay, that's the marshall question.
 

3237
02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:08,629
Okay, that's the marshall question.
The other question, the spiritual

3238
02:11:08,629 --> 02:11:08,639
The other question, the spiritual
 

3239
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:13,750
The other question, the spiritual
question is that's a selfie technique.

3240
02:11:13,750 --> 02:11:13,760
question is that's a selfie technique.
 

3241
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:15,910
question is that's a selfie technique.
This is why

3242
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:15,920
This is why
 

3243
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:18,950
This is why
there's so many in our art.

3244
02:11:18,950 --> 02:11:18,960
there's so many in our art.
 

3245
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:25,430
there's so many in our art.
Okay?

3246
02:11:25,430 --> 02:11:25,440

 

3247
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:27,990

We just talk that it's going to teach

3248
02:11:27,990 --> 02:11:28,000
We just talk that it's going to teach
 

3249
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,550
We just talk that it's going to teach
humility. We just talk that it's going

3250
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:30,560
humility. We just talk that it's going
 

3251
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:34,310
humility. We just talk that it's going
to teach surrendering and sacrifice. But

3252
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:34,320
to teach surrendering and sacrifice. But
 

3253
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:39,109
to teach surrendering and sacrifice. But
all we do is the same will to power in

3254
02:11:39,109 --> 02:11:39,119
all we do is the same will to power in
 

3255
02:11:39,119 --> 02:11:43,189
all we do is the same will to power in
all the other arts we claim

3256
02:11:43,189 --> 02:11:43,199
all the other arts we claim
 

3257
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:47,109
all the other arts we claim
are aggressive. You see,

3258
02:11:47,109 --> 02:11:47,119
are aggressive. You see,
 

3259
02:11:47,119 --> 02:11:50,310
are aggressive. You see,
and as I've shared in my experience,

3260
02:11:50,310 --> 02:11:50,320
and as I've shared in my experience,
 

3261
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:53,750
and as I've shared in my experience,
having done those other arts,

3262
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:53,760
having done those other arts,
 

3263
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:56,950
having done those other arts,
there is way more non-contestation

3264
02:11:56,950 --> 02:11:56,960
there is way more non-contestation
 

3265
02:11:56,960 --> 02:12:00,709
there is way more non-contestation
at the higher levels of boxing,

3266
02:12:00,709 --> 02:12:00,719
at the higher levels of boxing,
 

3267
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:03,990
at the higher levels of boxing,
wrestling, BJJ. At the lower levels,

3268
02:12:03,990 --> 02:12:04,000
wrestling, BJJ. At the lower levels,
 

3269
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:08,310
wrestling, BJJ. At the lower levels,

yes. Okay. But you'll start to see at
 

3271
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:10,790
yes. Okay. But you'll start to see at
the higher levels, people start to look

3272
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:10,800
the higher levels, people start to look
 

3273
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:13,270
the higher levels, people start to look
exactly like we know a keto can look

3274
02:12:13,270 --> 02:12:13,280
exactly like we know a keto can look
 

3275
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:14,870
exactly like we know a keto can look
like or should look like. It's just

3276
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:14,880
like or should look like. It's just
 

3277
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:17,589

effortless. You can't. They're like
 

3279
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:19,669
effortless. You can't. They're like
water. Every time I try to put weight,

3280
02:12:19,669 --> 02:12:19,679
water. Every time I try to put weight,
 

3281
02:12:19,679 --> 02:12:22,069
water. Every time I try to put weight,
they move somewhere else. Every time I

3282
02:12:22,069 --> 02:12:22,079
they move somewhere else. Every time I
 

3283
02:12:22,079 --> 02:12:24,069
they move somewhere else. Every time I
try to hit them in the head, their head

3284
02:12:24,069 --> 02:12:24,079
try to hit them in the head, their head
 

3285
02:12:24,079 --> 02:12:26,550
try to hit them in the head, their head
is not there. And now the fist is

3286
02:12:26,550 --> 02:12:26,560

3287
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:29,750
is not there. And now the fist is
hitting my head. You see that? It's all

hitting my head. You see that? It's all
 

3289
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:34,550
hitting my head. You see that? It's all
non-contestation.

3290
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:34,560

 

3291
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:39,030

What we're battling here is really a UK

3295
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:45,270

but underneath it is the amount of

02:12:45,270 --> 02:12:45,280
but underneath it is the amount of
 

3297
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:48,790
but underneath it is the amount of
control the choreographed UK has.

3298
02:12:48,790 --> 02:12:48,800
control the choreographed UK has.
 

3299
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:52,629
control the choreographed UK has.
You see, there's like a silent deal.

02:12:52,629 --> 02:12:52,639
You see, there's like a silent deal.
 

3301

And you take the other one,

3326
02:13:33,430 --> 02:13:33,440
And you take the other one,
 

3327
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:35,430
And you take the other one,

3333
02:13:41,599 --> 02:13:46,069

This there's no spirituality in this.

3334
02:13:46,069 --> 02:13:46,079
This there's no spirituality in this.
 

3335
02:13:46,079 --> 02:13:50,149
This there's no spirituality in this.
So to undo the culture and the silent

3336
02:13:50,149 --> 02:13:50,159
So to undo the culture and the silent
 

3337
02:13:50,159 --> 02:13:53,350
So to undo the culture and the silent
agreement between those two egoic

3338
02:13:53,350 --> 02:13:53,360
agreement between those two egoic
 

3339
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:55,990
agreement between those two egoic
aspects,

3340
02:13:55,990 --> 02:13:56,000
aspects,
 

3341
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:01,830
aspects,
we have to do these things where

3342
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:01,840

 

3343
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:04,310

we don't generate as much fear because

3344
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:04,320
we don't generate as much fear because
 

3345
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:08,950
we don't generate as much fear because
those are based in fear. Okay?

3346
02:14:08,950 --> 02:14:08,960
those are based in fear. Okay?
 

3347
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:13,510
those are based in fear. Okay?
So hence we use a lot of sui because the

3348
02:14:13,510 --> 02:14:13,520
So hence we use a lot of sui because the
 

3349
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:15,910
So hence we use a lot of sui because the
fall is not that high. or we take the

3350
02:14:15,910 --> 02:14:15,920
fall is not that high. or we take the
 

3351
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:19,510
fall is not that high. or we take the
fall off like we are trying to do today.

3352
02:14:19,510 --> 02:14:19,520
fall off like we are trying to do today.
 

3353
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:21,270
fall off like we are trying to do today.
Okay?

3354
02:14:21,270 --> 02:14:21,280
Okay?
 

3355
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:24,709
Okay?
So that the UK does not try to reconcile

3356
02:14:24,709 --> 02:14:24,719
So that the UK does not try to reconcile
 

3357
02:14:24,719 --> 02:14:31,669
So that the UK does not try to reconcile
anything on their own in any way. Okay?

3358
02:14:31,669 --> 02:14:31,679

 

3359
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:34,310

When we say don't throw them

3360
02:14:34,310 --> 02:14:34,320
When we say don't throw them
 

3361
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:36,950
When we say don't throw them
because we're not trying to fulfill our

3362
02:14:36,950 --> 02:14:36,960
because we're not trying to fulfill our
 

3363
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:38,550
because we're not trying to fulfill our
desires

3364
02:14:38,550 --> 02:14:38,560
desires
 

3365
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:41,350
desires
and we task ourselves only with just go

3366
02:14:41,350 --> 02:14:41,360
and we task ourselves only with just go
 

3367
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:44,709
and we task ourselves only with just go
around that hand

3368
02:14:44,709 --> 02:14:44,719
around that hand
 

3369
02:14:44,719 --> 02:14:54,870
around that hand
around that hand.

3370
02:14:54,870 --> 02:14:54,880

 

3371
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:58,149

Don't feel that hand

3372
02:14:58,149 --> 02:14:58,159
Don't feel that hand
 

3373
02:14:58,159 --> 02:15:00,069
Don't feel that hand
because that

3374
02:15:00,069 --> 02:15:00,079
because that
 

3375
02:15:00,079 --> 02:15:02,390
because that
is not going to work.

3376
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:02,400
is not going to work.
 

3377
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:07,030

It went from the shoulder line to the
 

3421
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:08,950
It went from the shoulder line to the
Wuji line and I just keep it there

3422
02:17:08,950 --> 02:17:08,960

 

3423
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:12,469

and I step around it. In

3424
02:17:12,469 --> 02:17:12,479
and I step around it. In
 

3425
02:17:12,479 --> 02:17:15,190
and I step around it. In
there you go.

3426
02:17:15,190 --> 02:17:15,200
there you go.
 

3427
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:18,389
there you go.
Yep. Yep.

3428
02:17:18,389 --> 02:17:18,399
Yep. Yep.
 

3429
02:17:18,399 --> 02:17:20,870
Yep. Yep.
Start releasing the tension again. Oops.

3430
02:17:20,870 --> 02:17:20,880
Start releasing the tension again. Oops.
 

3431
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:29,589
Start releasing the tension again. Oops.
came across.

3432
02:17:29,589 --> 02:17:29,599

 

3433
02:17:29,599 --> 02:17:31,910

Once it hits the Wuji line, it stays on

3434
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:31,920
Once it hits the Wuji line, it stays on
 

3435
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:33,910
Once it hits the Wuji line, it stays on
the Wuji line, the Earth hand. So once

3436
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:33,920
the Wuji line, the Earth hand. So once
 

3437
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:36,230
the Wuji line, the Earth hand. So once
it hits your spine, stays there. You

3438
02:17:36,230 --> 02:17:36,240
it hits your spine, stays there. You
 

3439
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:38,230
it hits your spine, stays there. You
have to turn your spine if you needed to

3440
02:17:38,230 --> 02:17:38,240
have to turn your spine if you needed to
 

3441
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:42,389
have to turn your spine if you needed to
go further.

3442
02:17:42,389 --> 02:17:42,399

 

3443
02:17:42,399 --> 02:17:49,429

Oh, you pulled it. All right.

3444
02:17:49,429 --> 02:17:49,439

 

3445
02:17:49,439 --> 02:17:51,990

Bring him in care or lean towards him.

3446
02:17:51,990 --> 02:17:52,000
Bring him in care or lean towards him.
 

3447
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,270
Bring him in care or lean towards him.
Bring him towards you. Good. Go around

3448
02:17:55,270 --> 02:17:55,280
Bring him towards you. Good. Go around
 

3449
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:57,750
Bring him towards you. Good. Go around
that.

3450
02:17:57,750 --> 02:17:57,760
that.
 

3451
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:07,110
that.
Good. So at that at the edge.

3452
02:18:07,110 --> 02:18:07,120

 

3453
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:13,270

So I feel the yin and I say the yin.

3454
02:18:13,270 --> 02:18:13,280

 

3455
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:15,990

The step the size of your step does not

3456
02:18:15,990 --> 02:18:16,000
The step the size of your step does not
 

3457
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,830
The step the size of your step does not
matter.

3458
02:18:17,830 --> 02:18:17,840
matter.
 

3459
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:25,270
matter.
You see how you are like uh

3460
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:25,280

 

3461
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:29,509

just do the energy.

3462
02:18:29,509 --> 02:18:29,519
just do the energy.
 

3463
02:18:29,519 --> 02:18:32,389
just do the energy.
That's the yin space. If you feel if you

3464
02:18:32,389 --> 02:18:32,399
That's the yin space. If you feel if you
 

3465
02:18:32,399 --> 02:18:34,870
That's the yin space. If you feel if you
see him doing this that's the yang

3466
02:18:34,870 --> 02:18:34,880
see him doing this that's the yang
 

3467
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:45,990
see him doing this that's the yang
space. Okay.

3468
02:18:45,990 --> 02:18:46,000

 

3469
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:51,270

Take a big entry step.

3470
02:18:51,270 --> 02:18:51,280

 

3471
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:53,669

Yep.

3472
02:18:53,669 --> 02:18:53,679
Yep.
 

3473
02:18:53,679 --> 02:19:13,349
Yep.
You want to disappear. What's happen?

3474
02:19:13,349 --> 02:19:13,359

 

3475
02:19:13,359 --> 02:19:29,910

He has one. All right.

3476
02:19:29,910 --> 02:19:29,920

 

3477
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:36,709

Big step. Big step. There you go.

3478
02:19:36,709 --> 02:19:36,719

 

3479
02:19:36,719 --> 02:20:01,990

Big step.

3480
02:20:01,990 --> 02:20:02,000

 

3481
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:05,190

Okay.

3482
02:20:05,190 --> 02:20:05,200

 

3483
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:09,990

We'll see if we get there. But what what

3484
02:20:09,990 --> 02:20:10,000
We'll see if we get there. But what what
 

3485
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,469
We'll see if we get there. But what what
these techniques do and these techniques

3486
02:20:12,469 --> 02:20:12,479
these techniques do and these techniques
 

3487
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:17,030
these techniques do and these techniques
are I start at the limb. Okay. And I'm

3488
02:20:17,030 --> 02:20:17,040
are I start at the limb. Okay. And I'm
 

3489
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:20,630
are I start at the limb. Okay. And I'm
going to transfer the adhesion to the

3490
02:20:20,630 --> 02:20:20,640
going to transfer the adhesion to the
 

3491
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:23,590
going to transfer the adhesion to the
That's what this is. Okay.

3492
02:20:23,590 --> 02:20:23,600
That's what this is. Okay.
 

3493
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:26,070
That's what this is. Okay.
When you are doing your tension, stop

3494
02:20:26,070 --> 02:20:26,080
When you are doing your tension, stop
 

3495
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:28,630
When you are doing your tension, stop
predicting what I'm doing. Just be.

3496
02:20:28,630 --> 02:20:28,640
predicting what I'm doing. Just be.
 

3497
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:33,510
predicting what I'm doing. Just be.
Okay. Grab. When you are using the arms

3498
02:20:33,510 --> 02:20:33,520
Okay. Grab. When you are using the arms
 

3499
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:37,030
Okay. Grab. When you are using the arms
to do the throw, you're not doing what

3500
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:37,040
to do the throw, you're not doing what
 

3501
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:39,990
to do the throw, you're not doing what
the art is trying to teach you. Transfer

3502
02:20:39,990 --> 02:20:40,000
the art is trying to teach you. Transfer
 

3503
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,790
the art is trying to teach you. Transfer
control points from the limbs up to the

3504
02:20:42,790 --> 02:20:42,800
control points from the limbs up to the
 

3505
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:46,469
control points from the limbs up to the
spinal what we in call the spinal ring.

3506
02:20:46,469 --> 02:20:46,479
spinal what we in call the spinal ring.
 

3507
02:20:46,479 --> 02:20:49,590
spinal what we in call the spinal ring.
Okay. Yeah. We talked about the radius

3508
02:20:49,590 --> 02:20:49,600
Okay. Yeah. We talked about the radius
 

3509
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:52,550
Okay. Yeah. We talked about the radius
of the arm. Okay, that's your arm ring,

3510
02:20:52,550 --> 02:20:52,560
of the arm. Okay, that's your arm ring,
 

3511
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:56,469
of the arm. Okay, that's your arm ring,
but there's a spinal ring, too. And uh

3512
02:20:56,469 --> 02:20:56,479
but there's a spinal ring, too. And uh
 

3513
02:20:56,479 --> 02:20:58,630
but there's a spinal ring, too. And uh
that's what this AR this technique is

3514
02:20:58,630 --> 02:20:58,640
that's what this AR this technique is
 

3515
02:20:58,640 --> 02:21:01,670
that's what this AR this technique is
teaching you. You start out at the arm

3516
02:21:01,670 --> 02:21:01,680
teaching you. You start out at the arm
 

3517
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:04,389
teaching you. You start out at the arm
ring and you're going to transfer

3518
02:21:04,389 --> 02:21:04,399
ring and you're going to transfer
 

3519
02:21:04,399 --> 02:21:07,750
ring and you're going to transfer
control point to here. That's why this

3520
02:21:07,750 --> 02:21:07,760
control point to here. That's why this
 

3521
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:09,910
control point to here. That's why this
arm is not in the technique anymore.

3522
02:21:09,910 --> 02:21:09,920
arm is not in the technique anymore.
 

3523
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:12,550
arm is not in the technique anymore.
This arm just disappears and you're now

3524
02:21:12,550 --> 02:21:12,560
This arm just disappears and you're now
 

3525
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:15,670
This arm just disappears and you're now
controlling over here.

3526
02:21:15,670 --> 02:21:15,680
controlling over here.
 

3527
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:19,910
controlling over here.
You understand? Okay. Um, what we all do

3528
02:21:19,910 --> 02:21:19,920
You understand? Okay. Um, what we all do
 

3529
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:22,389
You understand? Okay. Um, what we all do
instead is that arm is what's pulling

3530
02:21:22,389 --> 02:21:22,399
instead is that arm is what's pulling
 

3531
02:21:22,399 --> 02:21:24,150
instead is that arm is what's pulling
them off balance, but what you're going

3532
02:21:24,150 --> 02:21:24,160
them off balance, but what you're going
 

3533
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:27,830
them off balance, but what you're going
to do is stop them going forward.

3534
02:21:27,830 --> 02:21:27,840
to do is stop them going forward.
 

3535
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:29,429
to do is stop them going forward.
That's where they can turn. That's where

3536
02:21:29,429 --> 02:21:29,439
That's where they can turn. That's where
 

3537
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:31,270
That's where they can turn. That's where
they get their feedback under you. All

3538
02:21:31,270 --> 02:21:31,280
they get their feedback under you. All
 

3539
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:34,150
they get their feedback under you. All
that kind of stuff. Okay. Uh, that's

3540
02:21:34,150 --> 02:21:34,160
that kind of stuff. Okay. Uh, that's
 

3541
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:36,230
that kind of stuff. Okay. Uh, that's
where we're going with it. All right.

3542
02:21:36,230 --> 02:21:36,240
where we're going with it. All right.
 

3543
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:39,270
where we're going with it. All right.
Uh, any questions, comments,

3544
02:21:39,270 --> 02:21:39,280
Uh, any questions, comments,
 

3545
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:41,030
Uh, any questions, comments,
observation? It's it's radically

3546
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:41,040
observation? It's it's radically
 

3547
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:42,870
observation? It's it's radically
different. Do you do you see that? So,

3548
02:21:42,870 --> 02:21:42,880
different. Do you do you see that? So,
 

3549
02:21:42,880 --> 02:21:46,790
different. Do you do you see that? So,
one, I don't hang out at the wrist. Two,

3550
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:46,800
one, I don't hang out at the wrist. Two,
 

3551
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:48,790
one, I don't hang out at the wrist. Two,
I'm not pulling the arms, elbows,

3552
02:21:48,790 --> 02:21:48,800
I'm not pulling the arms, elbows,
 

3553
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:52,150
I'm not pulling the arms, elbows,
shoulders, and then the line of gravity,

3554
02:21:52,150 --> 02:21:52,160
shoulders, and then the line of gravity,
 

3555
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:55,990
shoulders, and then the line of gravity,
right? And three, I'm not throwing with

3556
02:21:55,990 --> 02:21:56,000
right? And three, I'm not throwing with
 

3557
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,990
right? And three, I'm not throwing with
both arms.

3558
02:21:57,990 --> 02:21:58,000
both arms.
 

3559
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:01,270
both arms.
One arm goes yin, one arm goes young.

3560
02:22:01,270 --> 02:22:01,280
One arm goes yin, one arm goes young.
 

3561
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:03,510
One arm goes yin, one arm goes young.
Just like in the first the second day of

3562
02:22:03,510 --> 02:22:03,520
Just like in the first the second day of
 

3563
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:06,790
Just like in the first the second day of
poke and hole. One arm goes yin, one arm

3564
02:22:06,790 --> 02:22:06,800
poke and hole. One arm goes yin, one arm
 

3565
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:10,230
poke and hole. One arm goes yin, one arm
goes yong. You don't do two young arms.

3566
02:22:10,230 --> 02:22:10,240
goes yong. You don't do two young arms.
 

3567
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:13,270
goes yong. You don't do two young arms.
Okay. Um,

3568
02:22:13,270 --> 02:22:13,280
Okay. Um,
 

3569
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:15,349
Okay. Um,
the engine is different. If the engine

3570
02:22:15,349 --> 02:22:15,359
the engine is different. If the engine
 

3571
02:22:15,359 --> 02:22:16,870
the engine is different. If the engine
is just what's the original

3572
02:22:16,870 --> 02:22:16,880
is just what's the original
 

3573
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:19,590
is just what's the original
gravitational force, stay with that.

3574
02:22:19,590 --> 02:22:19,600
gravitational force, stay with that.
 

3575
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:22,230
gravitational force, stay with that.
Okay? Not how do I move my arms and

3576
02:22:22,230 --> 02:22:22,240
Okay? Not how do I move my arms and
 

3577
02:22:22,240 --> 02:22:26,710
Okay? Not how do I move my arms and
muscles to get this going. Um, okay. So,

3578
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:26,720
muscles to get this going. Um, okay. So,
 

3579
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:28,230
muscles to get this going. Um, okay. So,
there's a lot that are questions,

3580
02:22:28,230 --> 02:22:28,240
there's a lot that are questions,
 

3581
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:31,349
there's a lot that are questions,
comments, observations, feelings,

3582
02:22:31,349 --> 02:22:31,359
comments, observations, feelings,
 

3583
02:22:31,359 --> 02:22:37,190
comments, observations, feelings,
anything. Come on, come closer, please.

3584
02:22:37,190 --> 02:22:37,200

 

3585
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:41,190

I hesitate to ask you

3586
02:22:41,190 --> 02:22:41,200
I hesitate to ask you
 

3587
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:43,830
I hesitate to ask you
respect

3588
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:43,840
respect
 

3589
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:46,230
respect
in the exercises that we did with just

3590
02:22:46,230 --> 02:22:46,240
in the exercises that we did with just
 

3591
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:48,389
in the exercises that we did with just
the fingertips and a very very light

3592
02:22:48,389 --> 02:22:48,399
the fingertips and a very very light
 

3593
02:22:48,399 --> 02:22:50,950
the fingertips and a very very light
touch. How come we're not deluding

3594
02:22:50,950 --> 02:22:50,960
touch. How come we're not deluding
 

3595
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:54,389
touch. How come we're not deluding
ourselves? Well, if the UK is not doing

3596
02:22:54,389 --> 02:22:54,399
ourselves? Well, if the UK is not doing
 

3597
02:22:54,399 --> 02:22:56,950
ourselves? Well, if the UK is not doing
anything and I'm moving them, I don't

3598
02:22:56,950 --> 02:22:56,960
anything and I'm moving them, I don't
 

3599
02:22:56,960 --> 02:22:59,510
anything and I'm moving them, I don't
know where the delusion would be. unless

3600
02:22:59,510 --> 02:22:59,520
know where the delusion would be. unless
 

3601
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:02,309
know where the delusion would be. unless
I am making more

3602
02:23:02,309 --> 02:23:02,319
I am making more
 

3603
02:23:02,319 --> 02:23:07,910
I am making more
of that drill. So if when doing that

3604
02:23:07,910 --> 02:23:07,920
of that drill. So if when doing that
 

3605
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:11,190
of that drill. So if when doing that
drill I'm not learning a concept or

3606
02:23:11,190 --> 02:23:11,200
drill I'm not learning a concept or
 

3607
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:13,830
drill I'm not learning a concept or
principle in a cultivation field and

3608
02:23:13,830 --> 02:23:13,840
principle in a cultivation field and
 

3609
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:16,870
principle in a cultivation field and
instead think all I got to do is touch

3610
02:23:16,870 --> 02:23:16,880
instead think all I got to do is touch
 

3611
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:19,270
instead think all I got to do is touch
someone with my fingertips and I will

3612
02:23:19,270 --> 02:23:19,280
someone with my fingertips and I will
 

3613
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:21,990
someone with my fingertips and I will
win the heavyweight title. You see I in

3614
02:23:21,990 --> 02:23:22,000
win the heavyweight title. You see I in
 

3615
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,230
win the heavyweight title. You see I in
my own mind made that a Marshall

3616
02:23:24,230 --> 02:23:24,240
my own mind made that a Marshall
 

3617
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:26,630
my own mind made that a Marshall
situation and it is not a Marshall

3618
02:23:26,630 --> 02:23:26,640
situation and it is not a Marshall
 

3619
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:29,590
situation and it is not a Marshall
situation. It is an energetic situation.

3620
02:23:29,590 --> 02:23:29,600
situation. It is an energetic situation.
 

3621
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:33,670
situation. It is an energetic situation.
Okay. So, um once I understand that that

3622
02:23:33,670 --> 02:23:33,680
Okay. So, um once I understand that that
 

3623
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:35,670
Okay. So, um once I understand that that
this is not how I fight, this is not

3624
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:35,680
this is not how I fight, this is not
 

3625
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:39,030
this is not how I fight, this is not
what I do to fight. Okay. And once I

3626
02:23:39,030 --> 02:23:39,040
what I do to fight. Okay. And once I
 

3627
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:41,429
what I do to fight. Okay. And once I
understand that I can do things with my

3628
02:23:41,429 --> 02:23:41,439
understand that I can do things with my
 

3629
02:23:41,439 --> 02:23:44,070
understand that I can do things with my
energetics

3630
02:23:44,070 --> 02:23:44,080
energetics
 

3631
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:48,150
energetics
for my energetics that I cannot do when

3632
02:23:48,150 --> 02:23:48,160
for my energetics that I cannot do when
 

3633
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:50,710
for my energetics that I cannot do when
I want to fight. So, for example, on day

3634
02:23:50,710 --> 02:23:50,720
I want to fight. So, for example, on day
 

3635
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:53,990
I want to fight. So, for example, on day
one I said form energetically is not

3636
02:23:53,990 --> 02:23:54,000
one I said form energetically is not
 

3637
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,950
one I said form energetically is not
important. Marshall form is very

3638
02:23:56,950 --> 02:23:56,960
important. Marshall form is very
 

3639
02:23:56,960 --> 02:24:00,150
important. Marshall form is very
important. Okay. So already in in the

3640
02:24:00,150 --> 02:24:00,160
important. Okay. So already in in the
 

3641
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:05,110
important. Okay. So already in in the
explanation you realize okay this is not

3642
02:24:05,110 --> 02:24:05,120
explanation you realize okay this is not
 

3643
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:07,349
explanation you realize okay this is not
a application field. This is a

3644
02:24:07,349 --> 02:24:07,359
a application field. This is a
 

3645
02:24:07,359 --> 02:24:10,630
a application field. This is a
cultivation field. Okay. And I would say

3646
02:24:10,630 --> 02:24:10,640
cultivation field. Okay. And I would say
 

3647
02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:12,950
cultivation field. Okay. And I would say
the same thing.

3648
02:24:12,950 --> 02:24:12,960
the same thing.
 

3649
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:15,670
the same thing.
I would just take what you're saying and

3650
02:24:15,670 --> 02:24:15,680
I would just take what you're saying and
 

3651
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:20,070
I would just take what you're saying and
apply it to tension.

3652
02:24:20,070 --> 02:24:20,080

 

3653
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:23,270

If you if I grab your wrist, you're not

3654
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:23,280
If you if I grab your wrist, you're not
 

3655
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,910
If you if I grab your wrist, you're not
going to tense up.

3656
02:24:25,910 --> 02:24:25,920
going to tense up.
 

3657
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:29,349
going to tense up.
It's not going to happen. Okay? But

3658
02:24:29,349 --> 02:24:29,359
It's not going to happen. Okay? But
 

3659
02:24:29,359 --> 02:24:33,349
It's not going to happen. Okay? But
where were all the diluted questions

3660
02:24:33,349 --> 02:24:33,359
where were all the diluted questions
 

3661
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:37,510
where were all the diluted questions
on that? You see, or better yet,

3662
02:24:37,510 --> 02:24:37,520
on that? You see, or better yet,
 

3663
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:39,910
on that? You see, or better yet,
the T-Rex arms that no one had a problem

3664
02:24:39,910 --> 02:24:39,920
the T-Rex arms that no one had a problem
 

3665
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:42,309
the T-Rex arms that no one had a problem
with with two T-Rex arms. Where was the

3666
02:24:42,309 --> 02:24:42,319
with with two T-Rex arms. Where was the
 

3667
02:24:42,319 --> 02:24:44,630
with with two T-Rex arms. Where was the
diluted question there? How did you get

3668
02:24:44,630 --> 02:24:44,640
diluted question there? How did you get
 

3669
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:46,950
diluted question there? How did you get
so close?

3670
02:24:46,950 --> 02:24:46,960
so close?
 

3671
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:49,110
so close?
We seem to be fine with that. You get

3672
02:24:49,110 --> 02:24:49,120
We seem to be fine with that. You get
 

3673
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:52,070
We seem to be fine with that. You get
it? But I say, "No, no, not." And what

3674
02:24:52,070 --> 02:24:52,080
it? But I say, "No, no, not." And what
 

3675
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:53,910
it? But I say, "No, no, not." And what
did I say? You guys just aren't hitting

3676
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:53,920
did I say? You guys just aren't hitting
 

3677
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:57,110
did I say? You guys just aren't hitting
each other enough in your dojo to to not

3678
02:24:57,110 --> 02:24:57,120
each other enough in your dojo to to not
 

3679
02:24:57,120 --> 02:25:00,790
each other enough in your dojo to to not
You should You should see my sons.

3680
02:25:00,790 --> 02:25:00,800
You should You should see my sons.
 

3681
02:25:00,800 --> 02:25:02,950
You should You should see my sons.
This is my sons when they get in that

3682
02:25:02,950 --> 02:25:02,960
This is my sons when they get in that
 

3683
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:06,070
This is my sons when they get in that
range because they remember from little

3684
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:06,080
range because they remember from little
 

3685
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:10,389
range because they remember from little
kids they I would smack them. Okay. Um,

3686
02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:10,399
kids they I would smack them. Okay. Um,
 

3687
02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:15,590
kids they I would smack them. Okay. Um,
go back to the if you pay attention

3688
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:15,600
go back to the if you pay attention
 

3689
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:16,710
go back to the if you pay attention
in the

3690
02:25:16,710 --> 02:25:16,720
in the
 

3691
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:18,550
in the
game.

3692
02:25:18,550 --> 02:25:18,560
game.
 

3693
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:20,230
game.
Some of those kids were harder to get

3694
02:25:20,230 --> 02:25:20,240
Some of those kids were harder to get
 

3695
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:22,870
Some of those kids were harder to get
their back than some of the adults,

3696
02:25:22,870 --> 02:25:22,880
their back than some of the adults,
 

3697
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:28,309
their back than some of the adults,
okay? Cuz they have more

3698
02:25:28,309 --> 02:25:28,319

 

3699
02:25:28,319 --> 02:25:31,510

puditive reps for exposing the back.

3700
02:25:31,510 --> 02:25:31,520
puditive reps for exposing the back.
 

3701
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:33,790
puditive reps for exposing the back.
Okay?

3702
02:25:33,790 --> 02:25:33,800
Okay?
 

3703
02:25:33,800 --> 02:25:40,070
Okay?

3705
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:44,870

I say I you do need to train

3706
02:25:44,870 --> 02:25:44,880
I say I you do need to train
 

3707
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:47,270
I say I you do need to train
and this is why

3708
02:25:47,270 --> 02:25:47,280
and this is why
 

3709
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:49,910
and this is why
I have to make an application field and

3710
02:25:49,910 --> 02:25:49,920
I have to make an application field and
 

3711
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:52,790
I have to make an application field and
I have to make a cultivation field and

3712
02:25:52,790 --> 02:25:52,800
I have to make a cultivation field and
 

3713
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:56,070
I have to make a cultivation field and
that is not problematic as long as I can

3714
02:25:56,070 --> 02:25:56,080
that is not problematic as long as I can
 

3715
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:59,990
that is not problematic as long as I can
identify what's what. Okay. And what I'm

3716
02:25:59,990 --> 02:26:00,000
identify what's what. Okay. And what I'm
 

3717
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:04,790
identify what's what. Okay. And what I'm
pointing out here is that you you I have

3718
02:26:04,790 --> 02:26:04,800
pointing out here is that you you I have
 

3719
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:09,030
pointing out here is that you you I have
way more cultivation fields and what

3720
02:26:09,030 --> 02:26:09,040
way more cultivation fields and what
 

3721
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:11,030
way more cultivation fields and what
you're doing I call that also a

3722
02:26:11,030 --> 02:26:11,040
you're doing I call that also a
 

3723
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:12,710
you're doing I call that also a
cultivation field but you didn't call it

3724
02:26:12,710 --> 02:26:12,720
cultivation field but you didn't call it
 

3725
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:15,830
cultivation field but you didn't call it
a cultivation field. Do you see that? So

3726
02:26:15,830 --> 02:26:15,840
a cultivation field. Do you see that? So
 

3727
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:18,630
a cultivation field. Do you see that? So
for that reason I got no problem just

3728
02:26:18,630 --> 02:26:18,640
for that reason I got no problem just
 

3729
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:20,230
for that reason I got no problem just
can you feel the inertia? Can you feel

3730
02:26:20,230 --> 02:26:20,240
can you feel the inertia? Can you feel
 

3731
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:21,750
can you feel the inertia? Can you feel
the gravity? Can you feel the friction

3732
02:26:21,750 --> 02:26:21,760
the gravity? Can you feel the friction
 

3733
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:24,630
the gravity? Can you feel the friction
now on the arm?

3734
02:26:24,630 --> 02:26:24,640
now on the arm?
 

3735
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:27,750
now on the arm?
Only the person what I this is what I

3736
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:27,760
Only the person what I this is what I
 

3737
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:29,990
Only the person what I this is what I
found every time.

3738

02:30:18,870 --> 02:30:18,880
walk them into the cones. Um, the first
 

3897
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:22,070
walk them into the cones. Um, the first
scenario when we pull the hood off, the

3898
02:30:22,070 --> 02:30:22,080
scenario when we pull the hood off, the
 

3899
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:25,830
scenario when we pull the hood off, the
guy has a gun visible in their holster.

3900
02:30:25,830 --> 02:30:25,840
guy has a gun visible in their holster.
 

3901
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:27,990
guy has a gun visible in their holster.
They're not walking or anything. In

3902
02:30:27,990 --> 02:30:28,000
They're not walking or anything. In
 

3903
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:31,670
They're not walking or anything. In
fact, they'll smile at you. Okay? And

3904
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:31,680
fact, they'll smile at you. Okay? And
 

3905
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:35,190
fact, they'll smile at you. Okay? And
you'll see the recruits will go, "Oh,

3906
02:30:35,190 --> 02:30:35,200
you'll see the recruits will go, "Oh,
 

3907
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:37,110
you'll see the recruits will go, "Oh,
he's smiling. He must not want to kill

3908
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:37,120
he's smiling. He must not want to kill
 

3909
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:40,950
he's smiling. He must not want to kill
me." And so then they go like, "Oh, sir,

3910
02:30:40,950 --> 02:30:40,960
me." And so then they go like, "Oh, sir,
 

3911
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:42,790
me." And so then they go like, "Oh, sir,
was that a gun in your waistband? Is

3912
02:30:42,790 --> 02:30:42,800
was that a gun in your waistband? Is
 

3913
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:45,110
was that a gun in your waistband? Is
there a reason for that gun?" Instead of

3914
02:30:45,110 --> 02:30:45,120
there a reason for that gun?" Instead of
 

3915
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:47,429
there a reason for that gun?" Instead of
looking at, "What's the tactical

3916
02:30:47,429 --> 02:30:47,439
looking at, "What's the tactical
 

3917
02:30:47,439 --> 02:30:51,030
looking at, "What's the tactical
problem?" The tactical problem is he's

3918
02:30:51,030 --> 02:30:51,040
problem?" The tactical problem is he's
 

3919
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:54,389
problem?" The tactical problem is he's
got a gun. You see, it's against the law

3920
02:30:54,389 --> 02:30:54,399
got a gun. You see, it's against the law
 

3921
02:30:54,399 --> 02:30:56,070
got a gun. You see, it's against the law
to carry that gun in the state of

3922
02:30:56,070 --> 02:30:56,080
to carry that gun in the state of
 

3923
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:59,030
to carry that gun in the state of
California and open carry. So, you're

3924
02:30:59,030 --> 02:30:59,040
California and open carry. So, you're
 

3925
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:01,910
California and open carry. So, you're
going to have to detain him. You got to

3926
02:31:01,910 --> 02:31:01,920
going to have to detain him. You got to
 

3927
02:31:01,920 --> 02:31:03,830
going to have to detain him. You got to
detain him at the level of the presence

3928
02:31:03,830 --> 02:31:03,840
detain him at the level of the presence
 

3929
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:06,150
detain him at the level of the presence
of the weapon.

3930
02:31:06,150 --> 02:31:06,160
of the weapon.
 

3931
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:08,790
of the weapon.
They always f it up. There's very few

3932
02:31:08,790 --> 02:31:08,800
They always f it up. There's very few
 

3933
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:10,389
They always f it up. There's very few
people that come in. This is how that

3934
02:31:10,389 --> 02:31:10,399
people that come in. This is how that
 

3935
02:31:10,399 --> 02:31:14,389
people that come in. This is how that
scenario goes. Hey, get on the ground.

3936
02:31:14,389 --> 02:31:14,399
scenario goes. Hey, get on the ground.
 

3937

care of the tactical situation. Then the

3944
02:31:23,030 --> 02:31:23,040
care of the tactical situation. Then the
 

3945
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:25,830
care of the tactical situation. Then the
investigation happens. Then the next

3946
02:31:25,830 --> 02:31:25,840
investigation happens. Then the next
 

3947
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:28,550
investigation happens. Then the next
scenario we do Same thing. We don't

3948
02:31:28,550 --> 02:31:28,560
scenario we do Same thing. We don't
 

3949
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:30,150

brief them on what you should do. We

3950
02:31:30,150 --> 02:31:30,160
brief them on what you should do. We
 

3951
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:33,030
brief them on what you should do. We

many people draw down on that dude?
 

3975
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:02,790
many people draw down on that dude?
Shoot that dude. Okay. And he was about

3979
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:07,190
to say you know where Starbucks is.
Okay.

Okay.
 

3981
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:11,510
Okay.
So anyone that shoots that guy that that

3982
02:32:11,510 --> 02:32:11,520
So anyone that shoots that guy that that
 

3983
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:13,429
So anyone that shoots that guy that that
was on proportional force that's illegal

3984
02:32:13,429 --> 02:32:13,439
was on proportional force that's illegal
 

3985
02:32:13,439 --> 02:32:15,990
was on proportional force that's illegal
force.

3986
02:32:15,990 --> 02:32:16,000
force.
 

3987
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:19,670
force.
Yes, your situation is getting worse as

3988
02:32:19,670 --> 02:32:19,680
Yes, your situation is getting worse as
 

3989
02:32:19,680 --> 02:32:22,230
Yes, your situation is getting worse as
you're going on, right? But you have to

3990
02:32:22,230 --> 02:32:22,240
you're going on, right? But you have to
 

3991
02:32:22,240 --> 02:32:27,349
you're going on, right? But you have to
adapt to what is happening there. Okay.

3992
02:32:27,349 --> 02:32:27,359
adapt to what is happening there. Okay.
 

3993
02:32:27,359 --> 02:32:32,950
adapt to what is happening there. Okay.
And I would say that before you grab me,

3994
02:32:32,950 --> 02:32:32,960
And I would say that before you grab me,
 

3995
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:34,790
And I would say that before you grab me,
for some weird reason, I have my hands

3996
02:32:34,790 --> 02:32:34,800
for some weird reason, I have my hands
 

3997
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:37,030
for some weird reason, I have my hands
in space in the same place as if I was

3998
02:32:37,030 --> 02:32:37,040
in space in the same place as if I was
 

3999
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:38,790
in space in the same place as if I was
handcuffed.

4000
02:32:38,790 --> 02:32:38,800
handcuffed.
 

4001
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:40,870
handcuffed.
I should have done a lot more by the

4002
02:32:40,870 --> 02:32:40,880
I should have done a lot more by the
 

4003
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:43,030
I should have done a lot more by the
time you got there. And I, this is what

4004
02:32:43,030 --> 02:32:43,040
time you got there. And I, this is what
 

4005
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:45,670
time you got there. And I, this is what
I always tell the cops. I train. Well, I

4006
02:32:45,670 --> 02:32:45,680
I always tell the cops. I train. Well, I
 

4007
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:47,429
I always tell the cops. I train. Well, I
I I

4008
02:32:47,429 --> 02:32:47,439
I I
 

4009
02:32:47,439 --> 02:32:50,550
I I
hate to say it, but if you got your self

4010
02:32:50,550 --> 02:32:50,560
hate to say it, but if you got your self
 

4011
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:53,590
hate to say it, but if you got your self
grabbed, take the be. you got to

4012
02:32:53,590 --> 02:32:53,600
grabbed, take the be. you got to
 

4013
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:57,190
grabbed, take the be. you got to
come and work from it because he's

4014
02:32:57,190 --> 02:32:57,200
come and work from it because he's
 

4015
02:32:57,200 --> 02:33:00,710
come and work from it because he's
really effed up. So this cop shoots that

4016
02:33:00,710 --> 02:33:00,720
really effed up. So this cop shoots that
 

4017
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:03,910
really effed up. So this cop shoots that
guy and he's going to prison. There's no

4018
02:33:03,910 --> 02:33:03,920
guy and he's going to prison. There's no
 

4019
02:33:03,920 --> 02:33:06,870
guy and he's going to prison. There's no
way around in his head. He's thinking

4020
02:33:06,870 --> 02:33:06,880
way around in his head. He's thinking
 

4021
02:33:06,880 --> 02:33:08,630
way around in his head. He's thinking
all these things but they're not

4022
02:33:08,630 --> 02:33:08,640
all these things but they're not
 

4023
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:12,230
all these things but they're not
realistic. Not realistic.

4024
02:33:12,230 --> 02:33:12,240
realistic. Not realistic.
 

4025
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:13,990
realistic. Not realistic.
Likewise,

4026
02:33:13,990 --> 02:33:14,000
Likewise,
 

4027
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,630
Likewise,
I should have done a hell of a lot more.

4028
02:33:16,630 --> 02:33:16,640
I should have done a hell of a lot more.
 

4029
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:19,910
I should have done a hell of a lot more.
You would have such a hard time grabbing

4030
02:33:19,910 --> 02:33:19,920
You would have such a hard time grabbing
 

4031
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:22,389
You would have such a hard time grabbing
both wrists,

4032
02:33:22,389 --> 02:33:22,399
both wrists,
 

4033
02:33:22,399 --> 02:33:25,830
both wrists,
but We're totally fine with that,

4034
02:33:25,830 --> 02:33:25,840
but We're totally fine with that,
 

4035
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:30,309
but We're totally fine with that,
right? Or we're totally fine with that

4036
02:33:30,309 --> 02:33:30,319
right? Or we're totally fine with that
 

4037
02:33:30,319 --> 02:33:33,750
right? Or we're totally fine with that
version that's everywhere.

4038
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:33,760
version that's everywhere.
 

4039
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:37,910
version that's everywhere.
It didn't work.

4040
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:37,920

 

4041
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:40,710

So, I would just extend I think you're

4042
02:33:40,710 --> 02:33:40,720
So, I would just extend I think you're
 

4043
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:45,830
So, I would just extend I think you're
on the right track, but recognize

4044
02:33:45,830 --> 02:33:45,840

 

4045
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:48,309

my caveat here would be make a clear

4046
02:33:48,309 --> 02:33:48,319
my caveat here would be make a clear
 

4047
02:33:48,319 --> 02:33:50,070
my caveat here would be make a clear
distinction between what's a cultivation

4048
02:33:50,070 --> 02:33:50,080
distinction between what's a cultivation

4072
02:34:29,270 --> 02:34:29,280
I shared that one video of that guy that
 

4073
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:32,150
I shared that one video of that guy that
was doing iikido. Uh you remember that

4074
02:34:32,150 --> 02:34:32,160
was doing iikido. Uh you remember that
 

4075
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:34,389
was doing iikido. Uh you remember that
it was like a Asian guy and he would

4076
02:34:34,389 --> 02:34:34,399
it was like a Asian guy and he would
 

4077
02:34:34,399 --> 02:34:37,190
it was like a Asian guy and he would
just constantly elude what was going

4078
02:34:37,190 --> 02:34:37,200
just constantly elude what was going
 

4079
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:41,270
just constantly elude what was going
that part is the iikido but

4080
02:34:41,270 --> 02:34:41,280
that part is the iikido but
 

4081
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:43,910
that part is the iikido but
the eo that's not the iikido. That's the

4082
02:34:43,910 --> 02:34:43,920
the eo that's not the iikido. That's the
 

4083
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:46,389
the eo that's not the iikido. That's the
energetic exercise. That's not the

4084
02:34:46,389 --> 02:34:46,399
energetic exercise. That's not the
 

4085
02:34:46,399 --> 02:34:49,349
energetic exercise. That's not the
self-defense thing. Um, and you saw him

4086
02:34:49,349 --> 02:34:49,359
self-defense thing. Um, and you saw him
 

4087
02:34:49,359 --> 02:34:52,070
self-defense thing. Um, and you saw him
do the yin yields and the disengagements

4088
02:34:52,070 --> 02:34:52,080
do the yin yields and the disengagements
 

4089
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:56,630
do the yin yields and the disengagements
and the decoupling and then boom, right?

4090
02:34:56,630 --> 02:34:56,640
and the decoupling and then boom, right?
 

4091
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:59,429
and the decoupling and then boom, right?
And that's how we fight with this art.

4092
02:34:59,429 --> 02:34:59,439
And that's how we fight with this art.
 

4093
02:34:59,439 --> 02:35:01,990
And that's how we fight with this art.
We don't fight with chemo because chemo

4094
02:35:01,990 --> 02:35:02,000
We don't fight with chemo because chemo
 

4095
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,710
We don't fight with chemo because chemo
was our cultivation.

4096
02:35:04,710 --> 02:35:04,720
was our cultivation.
 

4097
02:35:04,720 --> 02:35:08,469
was our cultivation.
So now if we understand that and we go,

4098
02:35:08,469 --> 02:35:08,479
So now if we understand that and we go,
 

4099
02:35:08,479 --> 02:35:11,429
So now if we understand that and we go,
are we diluting ourselves from what I'm

4100
02:35:11,429 --> 02:35:11,439
are we diluting ourselves from what I'm
 

4101
02:35:11,439 --> 02:35:14,389
are we diluting ourselves from what I'm
feeling or pressing? Again, make sure

4102
02:35:14,389 --> 02:35:14,399
feeling or pressing? Again, make sure
 

4103
02:35:14,399 --> 02:35:16,950
feeling or pressing? Again, make sure
you're doing nothing. Don't do anything.

4104
02:35:16,950 --> 02:35:16,960
you're doing nothing. Don't do anything.
 

4105
02:35:16,960 --> 02:35:19,349
you're doing nothing. Don't do anything.

Don't forward.
 

4107
02:35:19,359 --> 02:35:21,910
Don't forward.
Notice what I did at a certain point

4108
02:35:21,910 --> 02:35:21,920
Notice what I did at a certain point
 

4109
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:25,190
Notice what I did at a certain point
with the UK that kept coming forward.

4110
02:35:25,190 --> 02:35:25,200
with the UK that kept coming forward.
 

4111
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:28,469
with the UK that kept coming forward.
You see, I made them do the opposite of

4112
02:35:28,469 --> 02:35:28,479
You see, I made them do the opposite of
 

4113
02:35:28,479 --> 02:35:32,150
You see, I made them do the opposite of
what would led to the technique. Okay?

4114
02:35:32,150 --> 02:35:32,160
what would led to the technique. Okay?
 

4115
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:37,510
what would led to the technique. Okay?
To let them know

4116
02:35:37,510 --> 02:35:37,520

 

4117
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:41,190

you should not be needing their

4118
02:35:41,190 --> 02:35:41,200
you should not be needing their
 

4119
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:43,510
you should not be needing their
cooperation. I'm going to make you do

4120

cooperation. I'm going to make you do
 

4121
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:46,870
cooperation. I'm going to make you do
the counter to the technique. Okay.

4122
02:35:46,870 --> 02:35:46,880
the counter to the technique. Okay.
 

4123
02:35:46,880 --> 02:35:49,670
the counter to the technique. Okay.
Um,

4124
02:35:49,670 --> 02:35:49,680
Um,
 

4125
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:51,990
Um,
I don't know how, you know, I could

4126
02:35:51,990 --> 02:35:52,000
I don't know how, you know, I could
 

4127
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,750
I don't know how, you know, I could
imagine that someone's doing the

4128
02:35:53,750 --> 02:35:53,760
imagine that someone's doing the
 

4129
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:58,150
imagine that someone's doing the
fingertip pressure and then the the UK

4130
02:35:58,150 --> 02:35:58,160
fingertip pressure and then the the UK
 

4131
02:35:58,160 --> 02:36:00,070
fingertip pressure and then the the UK
is like moving forward. You know what I

4132
02:36:00,070 --> 02:36:00,080
is like moving forward. You know what I
 

4133
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:02,630
is like moving forward. You know what I
mean? I guess that could happen, but you

4134
02:36:02,630 --> 02:36:02,640
mean? I guess that could happen, but you
 

4135
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:06,469
mean? I guess that could happen, but you
as the Nugget cannot tell that they

4136
02:36:06,469 --> 02:36:06,479
as the Nugget cannot tell that they
 

4137
02:36:06,479 --> 02:36:10,710
as the Nugget cannot tell that they
moved themselves. That could happen. Um,

4138
02:36:10,710 --> 02:36:10,720
moved themselves. That could happen. Um,
 

4139
02:36:10,720 --> 02:36:12,870
moved themselves. That could happen. Um,
I don't I don't see a way out of that.

4140
02:36:12,870 --> 02:36:12,880
I don't I don't see a way out of that.
 

4141
02:36:12,880 --> 02:36:14,550
I don't I don't see a way out of that.
But I wouldn't call that delusion. I

4142
02:36:14,550 --> 02:36:14,560
But I wouldn't call that delusion. I
 

4143
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:16,870
But I wouldn't call that delusion. I
would call that ignorance. I can't tell

4144
02:36:16,870 --> 02:36:16,880
would call that ignorance. I can't tell
 

4145
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:20,870
would call that ignorance. I can't tell
that you moved yourself. Okay. Okay. My

4146
02:36:20,870 --> 02:36:20,880
that you moved yourself. Okay. Okay. My
 

4147
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:23,429
that you moved yourself. Okay. Okay. My
solution was I can tell I didn't move

4148
02:36:23,429 --> 02:36:23,439
solution was I can tell I didn't move
 

4149
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:25,750
solution was I can tell I didn't move
you. So, I'm going to make you go the

4150
02:36:25,750 --> 02:36:25,760
you. So, I'm going to make you go the
 

4151
02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:27,510
you. So, I'm going to make you go the
opposite way. So, you stop moving

4152
02:36:27,510 --> 02:36:27,520
opposite way. So, you stop moving
 

4153
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:30,230
opposite way. So, you stop moving
yourself to help me. Even on this last

4154
02:36:30,230 --> 02:36:30,240
yourself to help me. Even on this last
 

4155
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:32,389
yourself to help me. Even on this last
one

02:36:32,389 --> 02:36:32,399
one
 

4157
02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:35,110
one
before we even started, I could already

before we even started, I could already
 

4159
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:38,309
before we even started, I could already
tell his body was trying to effing help

4160
02:36:38,309 --> 02:36:38,319
tell his body was trying to effing help
 

4161

02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:58,070
accountable. Um and what I would say
then is if you can't feel it, then don't

4172
02:36:58,070 --> 02:36:58,080
then is if you can't feel it, then don't
 

4173
02:36:58,080 --> 02:37:00,230
then is if you can't feel it, then don't
think you're doing it. It's it's a real

4174
02:37:00,230 --> 02:37:00,240
think you're doing it. It's it's a real
 

4175
02:37:00,240 --> 02:37:03,429
think you're doing it. It's it's a real
feeling and you can feel it. Okay. If

you can't feel it, it's like I can't
 

4179
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:07,190
you can't feel it, it's like I can't
tell. That's where you land instead of

4180
02:37:07,190 --> 02:37:07,200
tell. That's where you land instead of
 

4181
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:10,469
tell. That's where you land instead of
I'm doing it. Okay. Or hey, try to pull

But going to be harder to do that. So,
 

4187
02:37:17,439 --> 02:37:20,309
But going to be harder to do that. So,
all right. But good question.

02:37:36,160 --> 02:37:37,990
Come on. I touch with you with with you
guys. What did What did What did it feel

4204
02:37:37,990 --> 02:37:38,000
guys. What did What did What did it feel
 

4205
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,870
guys. What did What did What did it feel
like? What's happening?

4206
02:37:40,870 --> 02:37:40,880
like? What's happening?
 

4207
02:37:40,880 --> 02:37:44,710
like? What's happening?
Come on. I know. We went We went

4208
02:37:44,710 --> 02:37:44,720
Come on. I know. We went We went
 

4209
02:37:44,720 --> 02:37:48,630
Come on. I know. We went We went
we went. What's it feel like

4210
02:37:48,630 --> 02:37:48,640
we went. What's it feel like
 

4211
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:51,910
we went. What's it feel like
to me? Um, I recognized that my

4212
02:37:51,910 --> 02:37:51,920
to me? Um, I recognized that my
 

4213
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:53,990
to me? Um, I recognized that my
shoulders were getting tired. So, I

4214
02:37:53,990 --> 02:37:54,000
shoulders were getting tired. So, I
 

4215
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,070
shoulders were getting tired. So, I
could feel this seizure within my

4216
02:37:56,070 --> 02:37:56,080
could feel this seizure within my
 

4217
02:37:56,080 --> 02:37:58,870
could feel this seizure within my
shoulders. And then as you were doing

4218
02:37:58,870 --> 02:37:58,880
shoulders. And then as you were doing
 

4219
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:02,389
shoulders. And then as you were doing
it, um, it it comes from underneath. So,

4220
02:38:02,389 --> 02:38:02,399
it, um, it it comes from underneath. So,
 

4221
02:38:02,399 --> 02:38:06,070
it, um, it it comes from underneath. So,
it's it's not a over the top, you know,

4222
02:38:06,070 --> 02:38:06,080
it's it's not a over the top, you know,
 

4223
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:08,870
it's it's not a over the top, you know,
it comes from underneath. And you could

4224
02:38:08,870 --> 02:38:08,880
it comes from underneath. And you could
 

4225
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:11,030
it comes from underneath. And you could
at a certain point it was just

4226
02:38:11,030 --> 02:38:11,040
at a certain point it was just
 

4227
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:16,710
at a certain point it was just
everywhere. Um, Yeah, it's

4228
02:38:16,710 --> 02:38:16,720

 

4229
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:20,309

hard to explain completely, but like it

4230
02:38:20,309 --> 02:38:20,319
hard to explain completely, but like it
 

4231
02:38:20,319 --> 02:38:22,550
hard to explain completely, but like it
does feel like a seizure of the center.

4232
02:38:22,550 --> 02:38:22,560
does feel like a seizure of the center.
 

4233
02:38:22,560 --> 02:38:25,590
does feel like a seizure of the center.
And so again, the seizure is my poetics.

4234
02:38:25,590 --> 02:38:25,600
And so again, the seizure is my poetics.
 

4235
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:27,830
And so again, the seizure is my poetics.
Like I I don't know. I told you if you

4236
02:38:27,830 --> 02:38:27,840
Like I I don't know. I told you if you
 

4237
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:30,230
Like I I don't know. I told you if you
when you push when you push me to

4238
02:38:30,230 --> 02:38:30,240
when you push when you push me to
 

4239
02:38:30,240 --> 02:38:35,110
when you push when you push me to
 explain this, I ended up saying

4240
02:38:35,110 --> 02:38:35,120
explain this, I ended up saying
 

4241
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:37,270
explain this, I ended up saying
y

4242
02:38:37,270 --> 02:38:37,280
y
 

4243
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:40,630
y
the universe goes the same. And bird is

4244
02:38:40,630 --> 02:38:40,640
the universe goes the same. And bird is
 

4245
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:42,389
the universe goes the same. And bird is
saying that I took I don't know why it

4246
02:38:42,389 --> 02:38:42,399
saying that I took I don't know why it
 

4247
02:38:42,399 --> 02:38:45,270
saying that I took I don't know why it
happens. It just happens. Okay. So

4248
02:38:45,270 --> 02:38:45,280
happens. It just happens. Okay. So
 

4249
02:38:45,280 --> 02:38:47,990
happens. It just happens. Okay. So
that's why I use the phrase poetics. And

4250
02:38:47,990 --> 02:38:48,000
that's why I use the phrase poetics. And
 

4251
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:51,190
that's why I use the phrase poetics. And
if I take his poetics like it feels like

4252
02:38:51,190 --> 02:38:51,200
if I take his poetics like it feels like
 

4253
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:54,150
if I take his poetics like it feels like
it's coming from underneath,

4254
02:38:54,150 --> 02:38:54,160
it's coming from underneath,
 

4255
02:38:54,160 --> 02:38:56,550
it's coming from underneath,
I would say it's it's not in the

4256
02:38:56,550 --> 02:38:56,560
I would say it's it's not in the
 

4257
02:38:56,560 --> 02:38:58,950
I would say it's it's not in the
shoulders. It's down in the center.

4258
02:38:58,950 --> 02:38:58,960
shoulders. It's down in the center.
 

4259
02:38:58,960 --> 02:39:01,030
shoulders. It's down in the center.
That's why it feels like it's coming

4260
02:39:01,030 --> 02:39:01,040
That's why it feels like it's coming
 

4261
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:03,429
That's why it feels like it's coming
from underneath because usually they're

4262
02:39:03,429 --> 02:39:03,439
from underneath because usually they're
 

4263
02:39:03,439 --> 02:39:05,750
from underneath because usually they're
in our shoulders because they're in our

4264
02:39:05,750 --> 02:39:05,760
in our shoulders because they're in our
 

4265
02:39:05,760 --> 02:39:07,990
in our shoulders because they're in our
arms trying to move our arms. Do you see

4266
02:39:07,990 --> 02:39:08,000
arms trying to move our arms. Do you see
 

4267
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:11,190
arms trying to move our arms. Do you see
that? Uh, if he never had the arm

4268
02:39:11,190 --> 02:39:11,200
that? Uh, if he never had the arm
 

4269
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:13,349
that? Uh, if he never had the arm
experience, he wouldn't have said from

4270
02:39:13,349 --> 02:39:13,359
experience, he wouldn't have said from
 

4271
02:39:13,359 --> 02:39:15,030
experience, he wouldn't have said from
underneath.

4272
02:39:15,030 --> 02:39:15,040
underneath.
 

4273
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:17,990
underneath.
Maybe he said in the middle. Do you get

4274
02:39:17,990 --> 02:39:18,000
Maybe he said in the middle. Do you get
 

4275
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:21,349
Maybe he said in the middle. Do you get
that? So, I I can hear his poet go,

4276
02:39:21,349 --> 02:39:21,359
that? So, I I can hear his poet go,
 

4277
02:39:21,359 --> 02:39:23,429
that? So, I I can hear his poet go,
"Yeah, that that is making sense, but

4278
02:39:23,429 --> 02:39:23,439
"Yeah, that that is making sense, but
 

4279
02:39:23,439 --> 02:39:25,830
"Yeah, that that is making sense, but
only because I know what it feels like."

4280
02:39:25,830 --> 02:39:25,840
only because I know what it feels like."
 

4281
02:39:25,840 --> 02:39:28,469
only because I know what it feels like."
He knows what it feels like and I can go

4282
02:39:28,469 --> 02:39:28,479
He knows what it feels like and I can go
 

4283
02:39:28,479 --> 02:39:29,910
He knows what it feels like and I can go
that's he's talking about the same

4284
02:39:29,910 --> 02:39:29,920
that's he's talking about the same
 

4285
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:32,710
that's he's talking about the same
thing. So, no different from I've been

4286
02:39:32,710 --> 02:39:32,720
thing. So, no different from I've been
 

4287
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:37,270
thing. So, no different from I've been
in love. I read a poem about love. It's

4288
02:39:37,270 --> 02:39:37,280
in love. I read a poem about love. It's
 

4289
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:39,750
in love. I read a poem about love. It's
not even talking about love, but I know

4290
02:39:39,750 --> 02:39:39,760
not even talking about love, but I know
 

4291
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:41,910
not even talking about love, but I know
exactly what this is talking about

4292
02:39:41,910 --> 02:39:41,920
exactly what this is talking about
 

4293
02:39:41,920 --> 02:39:44,550
exactly what this is talking about
because I had that feeling. I don't have

4294
02:39:44,550 --> 02:39:44,560
because I had that feeling. I don't have
 

4295
02:39:44,560 --> 02:39:46,550
because I had that feeling. I don't have
that. I've never been in love. I have no

4296
02:39:46,550 --> 02:39:46,560
that. I've never been in love. I have no
 

4297
02:39:46,560 --> 02:39:48,790
that. I've never been in love. I have no
idea. Like that joke the joke yesterday

4298
02:39:48,790 --> 02:39:48,800
idea. Like that joke the joke yesterday
 

4299
02:39:48,800 --> 02:39:51,910
idea. Like that joke the joke yesterday
like tell your tell your spouse to calm

4300
02:39:51,910 --> 02:39:51,920
like tell your tell your spouse to calm
 

4301
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:54,630
like tell your tell your spouse to calm
down in a fight. Okay, you're I tell

4302
02:39:54,630 --> 02:39:54,640
down in a fight. Okay, you're I tell
 

4303
02:39:54,640 --> 02:39:58,070
down in a fight. Okay, you're I tell
that to Tristan. He's going to go okay.

4304
02:39:58,070 --> 02:39:58,080
that to Tristan. He's going to go okay.
 

4305
02:39:58,080 --> 02:40:01,830
that to Tristan. He's going to go okay.
But all of us go, "No, don't do

4306
02:40:01,830 --> 02:40:01,840
But all of us go, "No, don't do
 

4307
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:05,190
But all of us go, "No, don't do
that." Right? Because we've been there.

4308
02:40:05,190 --> 02:40:05,200
that." Right? Because we've been there.
 

4309
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:07,270
that." Right? Because we've been there.
So, we have the feeling because we have

4310
02:40:07,270 --> 02:40:07,280
So, we have the feeling because we have
 

4311
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:09,990
So, we have the feeling because we have
the experience of it. If you don't have

4312
02:40:09,990 --> 02:40:10,000
the experience of it. If you don't have
 

4313
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:11,750
the experience of it. If you don't have
the feeling or you don't have the

4314
02:40:11,750 --> 02:40:11,760
the feeling or you don't have the
 

4315
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:13,830
the feeling or you don't have the
experience, then I would say I don't

4316
02:40:13,830 --> 02:40:13,840
experience, then I would say I don't
 

4317
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:17,110
experience, then I would say I don't
know. Okay. I wouldn't go it's

4318
02:40:17,110 --> 02:40:17,120
know. Okay. I wouldn't go it's
 

4319
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:20,150
know. Okay. I wouldn't go it's
or something like that. Okay. Um but

4320
02:40:20,150 --> 02:40:20,160
or something like that. Okay. Um but
 

4321
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:22,550
or something like that. Okay. Um but
okay, that that's a very good way of

4322
02:40:22,550 --> 02:40:22,560
okay, that that's a very good way of
 

4323
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:24,710
okay, that that's a very good way of
explaining it. Someone else, you might

4324
02:40:24,710 --> 02:40:24,720
explaining it. Someone else, you might
 

4325
02:40:24,720 --> 02:40:28,389
explaining it. Someone else, you might
have different poetics. Um it feels like

4326
02:40:28,389 --> 02:40:28,399
have different poetics. Um it feels like
 

4327
02:40:28,399 --> 02:40:32,070
have different poetics. Um it feels like
to me when when the communion happens

4328
02:40:32,070 --> 02:40:32,080
to me when when the communion happens
 

4329
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:35,110
to me when when the communion happens
that you or

4330
02:40:35,110 --> 02:40:35,120
that you or
 

4331
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:37,270
that you or
it becomes like a third balance point

4332
02:40:37,270 --> 02:40:37,280
it becomes like a third balance point
 

4333
02:40:37,280 --> 02:40:40,230
it becomes like a third balance point
for me and so I rely on that and then

4334
02:40:40,230 --> 02:40:40,240
for me and so I rely on that and then
 

4335
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:44,469
for me and so I rely on that and then
when it moves I have to I I can see that

4336
02:40:44,469 --> 02:40:44,479
when it moves I have to I I can see that
 

4337
02:40:44,479 --> 02:40:52,309
when it moves I have to I I can see that
um

4338
02:40:52,309 --> 02:40:52,319

 

4339
02:40:52,319 --> 02:40:55,190

and I hear that one a lot so to me that

4340
02:40:55,190 --> 02:40:55,200
and I hear that one a lot so to me that
 

4341
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:56,389
and I hear that one a lot so to me that
makes sense because I know what's

4342
02:40:56,389 --> 02:40:56,399
makes sense because I know what's
 

4343
02:40:56,399 --> 02:40:58,469
makes sense because I know what's
happening especially when I did it with

4344
02:40:58,469 --> 02:40:58,479
happening especially when I did it with
 

4345
02:40:58,479 --> 02:41:03,190
happening especially when I did it with
you because I wanted you to I wanted it

4346
02:41:03,190 --> 02:41:03,200
you because I wanted you to I wanted it
 

4347
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:06,309
you because I wanted you to I wanted it
to be so subtle on you. Uh if you

4348
02:41:06,309 --> 02:41:06,319
to be so subtle on you. Uh if you
 

4349
02:41:06,319 --> 02:41:08,870
to be so subtle on you. Uh if you
remember when I was going with him, I

4350
02:41:08,870 --> 02:41:08,880
remember when I was going with him, I
 

4351
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:11,429
remember when I was going with him, I
would barely move it and at a certain

4352
02:41:11,429 --> 02:41:11,439
would barely move it and at a certain
 

4353
02:41:11,439 --> 02:41:14,630
would barely move it and at a certain
point I would just it's there and I'm

4354
02:41:14,630 --> 02:41:14,640
point I would just it's there and I'm
 

4355
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:16,790
point I would just it's there and I'm
not even moving it but he could tell

4356
02:41:16,790 --> 02:41:16,800
not even moving it but he could tell
 

4357
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:21,510
not even moving it but he could tell
okay that it was there. Um

4358
02:41:21,510 --> 02:41:21,520
okay that it was there. Um
 

4359
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:25,670
okay that it was there. Um
and to me when that happened though,

4360
02:41:25,670 --> 02:41:25,680
and to me when that happened though,
 

4361
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:29,110
and to me when that happened though,
are you really leaning on me for

4362
02:41:29,110 --> 02:41:29,120
are you really leaning on me for
 

4363
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:31,670
are you really leaning on me for
balance?

4364
02:41:31,670 --> 02:41:31,680
balance?
 

4365
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:34,710
balance?
Not even say no. Can I move you so that

4366
02:41:34,710 --> 02:41:34,720
Not even say no. Can I move you so that
 

4367
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:38,070
Not even say no. Can I move you so that
you do lean on me for balance? Yes, that

4368
02:41:38,070 --> 02:41:38,080
you do lean on me for balance? Yes, that
 

4369
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:41,110
you do lean on me for balance? Yes, that
that can happen. Okay. Uh and the reason

4370
02:41:41,110 --> 02:41:41,120
that can happen. Okay. Uh and the reason
 

4371
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:43,910
that can happen. Okay. Uh and the reason
why I wanted to draw that distinction is

4372
02:41:43,910 --> 02:41:43,920
why I wanted to draw that distinction is
 

4373
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:47,830
why I wanted to draw that distinction is
because a lot of regular iikido is get

4374
02:41:47,830 --> 02:41:47,840
because a lot of regular iikido is get
 

4375
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:52,230
because a lot of regular iikido is get
that guy leaning on you. Okay. But

4376
02:41:52,230 --> 02:41:52,240
that guy leaning on you. Okay. But
 

4377
02:41:52,240 --> 02:41:54,870
that guy leaning on you. Okay. But
that's not the same thing as I I have

4378
02:41:54,870 --> 02:41:54,880
that's not the same thing as I I have
 

4379
02:41:54,880 --> 02:41:57,750
that's not the same thing as I I have
your center. We're not even moving and I

4380
02:41:57,750 --> 02:41:57,760
your center. We're not even moving and I
 

4381
02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:00,870
your center. We're not even moving and I
I have your center. Okay. Yeah. But I

4382
02:42:00,870 --> 02:42:00,880
I have your center. Okay. Yeah. But I
 

4383
02:42:00,880 --> 02:42:03,270
I have your center. Okay. Yeah. But I
would say not so much on a phys

4384
02:42:03,270 --> 02:42:03,280
would say not so much on a phys
 

4385
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:05,830
would say not so much on a phys
Yeah. But more good. When you're

4386
02:42:05,830 --> 02:42:05,840
Yeah. But more good. When you're
 

4387
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:07,830
Yeah. But more good. When you're
standing, you're not leaning on

4388
02:42:07,830 --> 02:42:07,840
standing, you're not leaning on
 

4389
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:10,469
standing, you're not leaning on
anything, but the ground. So, it's more

4390
02:42:10,469 --> 02:42:10,479
anything, but the ground. So, it's more
 

4391
02:42:10,479 --> 02:42:13,830
anything, but the ground. So, it's more
it's like a I I just noticed that for

4392
02:42:13,830 --> 02:42:13,840
it's like a I I just noticed that for
 

4393
02:42:13,840 --> 02:42:17,750
it's like a I I just noticed that for
myself, you always are adjusting your

4394
02:42:17,750 --> 02:42:17,760
myself, you always are adjusting your
 

4395
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:20,790
myself, you always are adjusting your
balance on some level. Yes. To what's

4396
02:42:20,790 --> 02:42:20,800
balance on some level. Yes. To what's
 

4397
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:24,309
balance on some level. Yes. To what's
around you. Y. And so, when we're when

4398
02:42:24,309 --> 02:42:24,319
around you. Y. And so, when we're when
 

4399
02:42:24,319 --> 02:42:26,870
around you. Y. And so, when we're when
we're making that connection, there's

4400
02:42:26,870 --> 02:42:26,880
we're making that connection, there's
 

4401
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:30,230
we're making that connection, there's
there's almost like

4402
02:42:30,230 --> 02:42:30,240
there's almost like
 

4403
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:32,550
there's almost like
you could call it an energetic tether. I

4404
02:42:32,550 --> 02:42:32,560
you could call it an energetic tether. I
 

4405
02:42:32,560 --> 02:42:36,230
you could call it an energetic tether. I
But it's like I'm using you as a means

4406
02:42:36,230 --> 02:42:36,240
But it's like I'm using you as a means
 

4407
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:39,030
But it's like I'm using you as a means
to orient myself. Not on a physical

4408
02:42:39,030 --> 02:42:39,040
to orient myself. Not on a physical
 

4409
02:42:39,040 --> 02:42:41,510
to orient myself. Not on a physical
level so much, although there's physical

4410
02:42:41,510 --> 02:42:41,520
level so much, although there's physical
 

4411
02:42:41,520 --> 02:42:43,670
level so much, although there's physical
touch. It's it's subtle. Like it's if

4412
02:42:43,670 --> 02:42:43,680
touch. It's it's subtle. Like it's if
 

4413
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:45,429
touch. It's it's subtle. Like it's if
it's physical, it's very very subtle.

4414
02:42:45,429 --> 02:42:45,439
it's physical, it's very very subtle.
 

4415
02:42:45,439 --> 02:42:48,630
it's physical, it's very very subtle.
Okay. So now now I go Yeah. Now that

4416
02:42:48,630 --> 02:42:48,640
Okay. So now now I go Yeah. Now that
 

4417
02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:50,550
Okay. So now now I go Yeah. Now that
that is it. So I'll point you to

4418
02:42:50,550 --> 02:42:50,560
that is it. So I'll point you to
 

4419
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:54,309
that is it. So I'll point you to
something. Remember uh the video of

4420
02:42:54,309 --> 02:42:54,319
something. Remember uh the video of
 

4421
02:42:54,319 --> 02:42:57,110
something. Remember uh the video of
Seafo Seafood Nico

4422
02:42:57,110 --> 02:42:57,120
Seafo Seafood Nico
 

4423
02:42:57,120 --> 02:42:59,830
Seafo Seafood Nico
and how he's doing push hands versus how

4424
02:42:59,830 --> 02:42:59,840
and how he's doing push hands versus how
 

4425
02:42:59,840 --> 02:43:02,389
and how he's doing push hands versus how
everyone else does push hands. He just

4426
02:43:02,389 --> 02:43:02,399
everyone else does push hands. He just
 

4427
02:43:02,399 --> 02:43:05,270
everyone else does push hands. He just
catches them at the at the very source,

4428
02:43:05,270 --> 02:43:05,280
catches them at the at the very source,
 

4429
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:07,990
catches them at the at the very source,
right? And then they're moving. So you

4430
02:43:07,990 --> 02:43:08,000
right? And then they're moving. So you
 

4431
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,630
right? And then they're moving. So you
when I watch him, I know he can push,

4432
02:43:10,630 --> 02:43:10,640
when I watch him, I know he can push,
 

4433
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:12,710
when I watch him, I know he can push,
but he won't because that's not what

4434
02:43:12,710 --> 02:43:12,720
but he won't because that's not what
 

4435
02:43:12,720 --> 02:43:14,870
but he won't because that's not what
he's trying to do here. So he he either

4436
02:43:14,870 --> 02:43:14,880
he's trying to do here. So he he either
 

4437
02:43:14,880 --> 02:43:17,349
he's trying to do here. So he he either
gets it he either gets you to fall like

4438
02:43:17,349 --> 02:43:17,359
gets it he either gets you to fall like
 

4439
02:43:17,359 --> 02:43:19,030
gets it he either gets you to fall like
with these kind of little movements,

4440
02:43:19,030 --> 02:43:19,040
with these kind of little movements,
 

4441
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:21,429
with these kind of little movements,
just adjusting up, or he won't try and

4442
02:43:21,429 --> 02:43:21,439
just adjusting up, or he won't try and
 

4443
02:43:21,439 --> 02:43:24,070
just adjusting up, or he won't try and
he'll let you push him out or he starts

4444
02:43:24,070 --> 02:43:24,080
he'll let you push him out or he starts
 

4445
02:43:24,080 --> 02:43:26,309
he'll let you push him out or he starts
all over. He goes totally in and then

4446
02:43:26,309 --> 02:43:26,319
all over. He goes totally in and then
 

4447
02:43:26,319 --> 02:43:29,110
all over. He goes totally in and then
seeks a contact again. Okay. So yeah, I

4448
02:43:29,110 --> 02:43:29,120
seeks a contact again. Okay. So yeah, I
 

4449
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:33,670
seeks a contact again. Okay. So yeah, I
do I do agree. And so I would as as you

4450
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:33,680
do I do agree. And so I would as as you
 

4451
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:36,870
do I do agree. And so I would as as you
and here's why the constant adapting of

4452
02:43:36,870 --> 02:43:36,880
and here's why the constant adapting of
 

4453
02:43:36,880 --> 02:43:40,309
and here's why the constant adapting of
my b balance here but I would say it's

4454
02:43:40,309 --> 02:43:40,319
my b balance here but I would say it's
 

4455
02:43:40,319 --> 02:43:42,150
my b balance here but I would say it's
the constant adapting to the yong

4456
02:43:42,150 --> 02:43:42,160
the constant adapting to the yong
 

4457
02:43:42,160 --> 02:43:44,950
the constant adapting to the yong
aspect. So because as you seize the

4458
02:43:44,950 --> 02:43:44,960
aspect. So because as you seize the
 

4459
02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:47,750
aspect. So because as you seize the
center the person does something and you

4460
02:43:47,750 --> 02:43:47,760
center the person does something and you
 

4461
02:43:47,760 --> 02:43:50,230
center the person does something and you
have to keep the feeling and to keep the

4462
02:43:50,230 --> 02:43:50,240
have to keep the feeling and to keep the
 

4463
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:52,469
have to keep the feeling and to keep the
feeling you can't be be doing the same

4464
02:43:52,469 --> 02:43:52,479
feeling you can't be be doing the same
 

4465
02:43:52,479 --> 02:43:54,950
feeling you can't be be doing the same
thing because the situation change. So

4466
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:54,960
thing because the situation change. So
 

4467
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:57,590
thing because the situation change. So
there is this kind of like uh yeah we're

4468
02:43:57,590 --> 02:43:57,600
there is this kind of like uh yeah we're
 

4469
02:43:57,600 --> 02:44:03,990
there is this kind of like uh yeah we're
in this constant state um where we're

4470
02:44:03,990 --> 02:44:04,000
in this constant state um where we're
 

4471
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,910
in this constant state um where we're
it's kind of like that you know what I

4472
02:44:05,910 --> 02:44:05,920
it's kind of like that you know what I
 

4473
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:08,630
it's kind of like that you know what I
mean um

4474
02:44:08,630 --> 02:44:08,640
mean um
 

4475
02:44:08,640 --> 02:44:12,309
mean um
and again that is just a cultivation

4476
02:44:12,309 --> 02:44:12,319
and again that is just a cultivation
 

4477
02:44:12,319 --> 02:44:17,190
and again that is just a cultivation
field marshially it has to be done right

4478
02:44:17,190 --> 02:44:17,200
field marshially it has to be done right
 

4479
02:44:17,200 --> 02:44:19,670
field marshially it has to be done right
away. So in other words right when I

4480
02:44:19,670 --> 02:44:19,680
away. So in other words right when I
 

4481
02:44:19,680 --> 02:44:23,110
away. So in other words right when I
have the center like we did yesterday

4482
02:44:23,110 --> 02:44:23,120
have the center like we did yesterday
 

4483
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:26,309
have the center like we did yesterday
you're in and The inertia has you and

4484
02:44:26,309 --> 02:44:26,319
you're in and The inertia has you and
 

4485
02:44:26,319 --> 02:44:28,389
you're in and The inertia has you and
now by the time you figure it out

4486
02:44:28,389 --> 02:44:28,399
now by the time you figure it out
 

4487
02:44:28,399 --> 02:44:30,150
now by the time you figure it out
whatever you're already flipping through

4488
02:44:30,150 --> 02:44:30,160
whatever you're already flipping through
 

4489
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:33,670
whatever you're already flipping through
space you see that. So this is why I say

4490
02:44:33,670 --> 02:44:33,680
space you see that. So this is why I say
 

4491
02:44:33,680 --> 02:44:36,230
space you see that. So this is why I say
more the adhesions in a cultivation

4492
02:44:36,230 --> 02:44:36,240
more the adhesions in a cultivation
 

4493
02:44:36,240 --> 02:44:38,230
more the adhesions in a cultivation
field or the energetics in cultivation

4494
02:44:38,230 --> 02:44:38,240
field or the energetics in cultivation
 

4495
02:44:38,240 --> 02:44:40,550
field or the energetics in cultivation
field you want to prolong them and you

4496
02:44:40,550 --> 02:44:40,560
field you want to prolong them and you
 

4497
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:43,429
field you want to prolong them and you
want them to be very subtle because that

4498
02:44:43,429 --> 02:44:43,439
want them to be very subtle because that
 

4499
02:44:43,439 --> 02:44:45,990
want them to be very subtle because that
increases skill. But marshally we're

4500
02:44:45,990 --> 02:44:46,000
increases skill. But marshally we're
 

4501
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,389
increases skill. But marshally we're
talking hundreds of a second and just

4502
02:44:48,389 --> 02:44:48,399
talking hundreds of a second and just
 

4503
02:44:48,399 --> 02:44:53,349
talking hundreds of a second and just
pure freaking force. Okay? And um not

4504
02:44:53,349 --> 02:44:53,359

when it's not on, I feel like my mind
 

4535
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:35,590
when it's not on, I feel like my mind
can kind of find places to release, but

4536
02:45:35,590 --> 02:45:35,600
can kind of find places to release, but
 

4537
02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:37,750
can kind of find places to release, but
then when it goes on,

4538
02:45:37,750 --> 02:45:37,760
then when it goes on,
 

4539
02:45:37,760 --> 02:45:40,150
then when it goes on,
the feeling doesn't really change, but

4540
02:45:40,150 --> 02:45:40,160
the feeling doesn't really change, but
 

4541
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:42,469
the feeling doesn't really change, but
then things just start

4542
02:45:42,469 --> 02:45:42,479
then things just start
 

4543
02:45:42,479 --> 02:45:44,950
then things just start
it almost feels like picture like a

4544
02:45:44,950 --> 02:45:44,960
it almost feels like picture like a
 

4545
02:45:44,960 --> 02:45:48,309
it almost feels like picture like a
cartoon. There's like a laser gun that

4546
02:45:48,309 --> 02:45:48,319
cartoon. There's like a laser gun that
 

4547
02:45:48,319 --> 02:45:49,830
cartoon. There's like a laser gun that
like picks things up and moves them.

4548
02:45:49,830 --> 02:45:49,840
like picks things up and moves them.
 

4549
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:52,630
like picks things up and moves them.
It's a whole thing instead of

4550
02:45:52,630 --> 02:45:52,640
It's a whole thing instead of
 

4551
02:45:52,640 --> 02:45:54,389
It's a whole thing instead of
causing

4552
02:45:54,389 --> 02:45:54,399
causing
 

4553
02:45:54,399 --> 02:45:56,950
causing
yes I I agree the linking that there's

4554
02:45:56,950 --> 02:45:56,960
yes I I agree the linking that there's
 

4555
02:45:56,960 --> 02:46:01,429
yes I I agree the linking that there's
no linking everything just starts moving

4556
02:46:01,429 --> 02:46:01,439
no linking everything just starts moving
 

4557
02:46:01,439 --> 02:46:03,830
no linking everything just starts moving
um

4558
02:46:03,830 --> 02:46:03,840
um
 

4559
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:06,950
um
so I now have some feeling and that's

4560
02:46:06,950 --> 02:46:06,960
so I now have some feeling and that's
 

4561
02:46:06,960 --> 02:46:11,190
so I now have some feeling and that's
what I should feel for if I don't have

4562
02:46:11,190 --> 02:46:11,200
what I should feel for if I don't have
 

4563
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:12,870
what I should feel for if I don't have
this

4564
02:46:12,870 --> 02:46:12,880
this
 

4565
02:46:12,880 --> 02:46:15,030
this
you know tracker beam feeling or this

4566
02:46:15,030 --> 02:46:15,040
you know tracker beam feeling or this
 

4567
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:18,630
you know tracker beam feeling or this
constant I got to stay and and keep

4568
02:46:18,630 --> 02:46:18,640
constant I got to stay and and keep
 

4569
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:21,910
constant I got to stay and and keep
moving and keep the same feeling Right.

4570
02:46:21,910 --> 02:46:21,920
moving and keep the same feeling Right.
 

4571
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:24,070
moving and keep the same feeling Right.
Um

4572
02:46:24,070 --> 02:46:24,080
Um
 

4573
02:46:24,080 --> 02:46:26,469
Um
or I don't I'm up in the shoulders. I

4574
02:46:26,469 --> 02:46:26,479
or I don't I'm up in the shoulders. I
 

4575
02:46:26,479 --> 02:46:28,150
or I don't I'm up in the shoulders. I
feel it in my shoulders. I don't feel it

4576
02:46:28,150 --> 02:46:28,160
feel it in my shoulders. I don't feel it
 

4577
02:46:28,160 --> 02:46:31,830
feel it in my shoulders. I don't feel it
in my center. Then I'm not doing it. And

4578
02:46:31,830 --> 02:46:31,840
in my center. Then I'm not doing it. And
 

4579
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:34,309
in my center. Then I'm not doing it. And
if I say I am even though I feel I'm

4580
02:46:34,309 --> 02:46:34,319
if I say I am even though I feel I'm
 

4581
02:46:34,319 --> 02:46:37,110
if I say I am even though I feel I'm
doing something else, then I am deluding

4582
02:46:37,110 --> 02:46:37,120
doing something else, then I am deluding
 

4583
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:41,960
doing something else, then I am deluding
myself. Does that make sense?
