00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,109

been the most demanding

10
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119
been the most demanding
 

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,830
been the most demanding
but if i had to say

12
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840

 

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,710

what got the most out of in feelings

00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
what got the most out of in feelings
 

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,950
what got the most out of in feelings
internal feelings is tai chi

16
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:34,960

 

17

i found it much more readily available

18
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
i found it much more readily available
 

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,190
i found it much more readily available
the

20
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
the
 

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,030
the
the internal energy understanding

22
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
the internal energy understanding
 

23
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,310
the internal energy understanding
the delicacy of movement

24
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320

 

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,750

the delicacy i suppose of non-movement

26
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760

 

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,950

moving very slow

28
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960
moving very slow
 

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,750
moving very slow

your your senses are more heightened
 

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,709
your your senses are more heightened
because

he's made several but it's a very good
one to start with

46
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:23,840

 

47
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,749

to find the power of now
 

49
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,749
to find the power of now
for most of us is impossible

50
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
for most of us is impossible
 

51
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,069
for most of us is impossible
but we won't keep still enough long

52
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
but we won't keep still enough long
 

53
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,429
but we won't keep still enough long
enough

54
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
enough
 

55
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,990
enough
or we'll think of anything to do rather

56
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
or we'll think of anything to do rather
 

57
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,749
or we'll think of anything to do rather
than

00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
than

than
find that that now moment

60
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
find that that now moment
 

61
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,550
find that that now moment
the the yoga

62
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
the the yoga
 

63
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,069
the the yoga
and meditation

64
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079

 

65
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,590

i found the most difficult

66
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
i found the most difficult
 

67
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,990
i found the most difficult
because yoga the teacher's always

68
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
because yoga the teacher's always
 

69
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,069
because yoga the teacher's always
telling you not to do anything

70
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079

 

71
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,230

and yet they're asking to do everything

72
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240

 

73
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,669

it's a um

74
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
it's a um
 

75
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,390
it's a um
a contradiction isn't it but they're

76
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
a contradiction isn't it but they're
 

77
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,350
a contradiction isn't it but they're
saying don't try

78
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
saying don't try
 

79
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,270
saying don't try
too hard and yet if you don't try you

80
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
too hard and yet if you don't try you
 

81
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,949
too hard and yet if you don't try you
won't get anywhere will you

82
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959

 

83
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,990

i think it's like if you were on a

84
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000

 

85
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,350

on an edge of a mountain

86
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
on an edge of a mountain
 

87
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,390
on an edge of a mountain
or plateau and you walk to the edge

88
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
or plateau and you walk to the edge
 

89
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,270
or plateau and you walk to the edge
and as you're getting close to the edge

90
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
and as you're getting close to the edge
 

91
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,710
and as you're getting close to the edge
you're knowing

92
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
you're knowing
 

93
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,830
you're knowing
that it's going to be

94
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
that it's going to be
 

95
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,110
that it's going to be
a big drop but you don't quite know how

96
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
a big drop but you don't quite know how
 

97
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,070
a big drop but you don't quite know how
far

98
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
far
 

99
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,229
far
you can see in the distance it's a long

100
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
you can see in the distance it's a long
 

101
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,270
you can see in the distance it's a long
way down

102
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
way down
 

103
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,030
way down
but when you get really close to the

104
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
but when you get really close to the
 

105
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,390
but when you get really close to the
edge that's the scary part

106
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400

 

107
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,630

so with yoga it's like

108
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640

 

109
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,270

get to the edge but don't get to the

110
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
get to the edge but don't get to the
 

111
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,149
get to the edge but don't get to the
scary part where it hurts the body

112
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
scary part where it hurts the body
 

113
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,149
scary part where it hurts the body
because then you're going to hurt

114
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
because then you're going to hurt
 

115
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,509
because then you're going to hurt
something you're going to damage

116
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
something you're going to damage
 

117
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,390
something you're going to damage
something pull

118
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
something pull
 

119
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,910
something pull
something strain something and

120
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
something strain something and
 

121
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,390
something strain something and
so many times have i thought that i was

122
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
so many times have i thought that i was
 

123
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,430
so many times have i thought that i was
going to the safe edge just to find the

124
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
going to the safe edge just to find the
 

125
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,589
going to the safe edge just to find the
next two or three days

126
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
next two or three days
 

127
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,750
next two or three days
that my body is telling me that i

128
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
that my body is telling me that i
 

129
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,190
that my body is telling me that i
actually

130
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
actually
 

131
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,910
actually
went over the edge and found that i was

132
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
went over the edge and found that i was
 

133
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,589
went over the edge and found that i was
hanging on

134
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
hanging on
 

135
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,910
hanging on
my fingertips on my toes

136
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920

 

137
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,949

and i'd gone too far

138
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
and i'd gone too far
 

139
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,830
and i'd gone too far
so yoga and i still do yoga today and

140
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
so yoga and i still do yoga today and
 

141
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,750
so yoga and i still do yoga today and
i'm so thankful of it

142
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
i'm so thankful of it
 

143
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,789
i'm so thankful of it
but it's a very demanding

144
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
but it's a very demanding
 

145
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,630
but it's a very demanding
i'll say our hearts because i think it's

146
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
i'll say our hearts because i think it's
 

147
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,350
i'll say our hearts because i think it's
a body art

148
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360

 

149
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,910

it really challenges the mind because

150
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
it really challenges the mind because
 

151
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,350
it really challenges the mind because
what you think you're doing and what

152
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
what you think you're doing and what
 

153
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,550
what you think you're doing and what
your

154
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
your
 

155
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,070
your
your ego your stubbornness ends up doing

156
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
your ego your stubbornness ends up doing
 

157
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,750
your ego your stubbornness ends up doing
is different the meditation

158
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
is different the meditation
 

159
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,750
is different the meditation
well to sit and to clear the mind

160
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
well to sit and to clear the mind
 

161
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,869
well to sit and to clear the mind
and not to think or hear counting

162
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
and not to think or hear counting
 

163
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,350
and not to think or hear counting

or have pictures come into your mind
just to sit there

166
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
just to sit there
 

167
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,550
just to sit there
why would you do that you might think to

168
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
why would you do that you might think to
 

169
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,670
why would you do that you might think to
yourself

170
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
yourself
 

171
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,790
yourself
many times i've thought of it why would

172
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
many times i've thought of it why would
 

173

sit here and think of nothing
not talk to myself with the voice in my
