this person and then you hold that
 

175
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,070
this person and then you hold that
enough to do that

176
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,080

around now you have a obstacle there

182
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:43,959
around now you have a obstacle there
 

183
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,310
around now you have a obstacle there
this is not the middle you can see it's

184
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
this is not the middle you can see it's
 

185
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,550
this is not the middle you can see it's
going the other way so you're confusing

186
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
going the other way so you're confusing
 

187
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,110
going the other way so you're confusing

why have
 

229
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,790
why have
to stick with you need

to stick with you need
 

231
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,990

so for
example coming in I don't want to go

234
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
example coming in I don't want to go
 

235
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,269
example coming in I don't want to go
here and even get in that

236
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
here and even get in that
 

237
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,030
here and even get in that
problem so as you're coming in I'm

238
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,040
problem so as you're coming in I'm
 

239
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,590
problem so as you're coming in I'm
moving

240
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:18,600
moving
 

241
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,829
moving
right this fting I'm moving right every

242
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
right this fting I'm moving right every
 

243
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,949
right this fting I'm moving right every
time you get your B so same thing you

244
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:27,959
time you get your B so same thing you
 

245
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,790
time you get your B so same thing you
get your V

246
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:29,800
get your V
 

247
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,910
get your V
and I'm

248
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:30,920
and I'm
 

249
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,629

259
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,069

is see that movement there right

260
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079

269
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,870
okay okay so as as you're moving to get
a better situation than this you see is

270
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
a better situation than this you see is
 

271
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,509
a better situation than this you see is
you're trying to stack them so you have

272
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519
you're trying to stack them so you have
 

273
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,590
you're trying to stack them so you have
a unified front and Not Your Flank so

274
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:28,600
a unified front and Not Your Flank so
 

275
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,790
a unified front and Not Your Flank so
right here

276
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:29,800
right here
 

277
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,670
right here
I'm flank even if I were to get out of

278
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:32,680
I'm flank even if I were to get out of
 

279
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,030
I'm flank even if I were to get out of
it I move into being flanked on both

280
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,040
it I move into being flanked on both
 

281
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,590
it I move into being flanked on both
sides

282
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600
sides
 

283
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,230
sides
okay and what I'm doing

284
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
okay and what I'm doing
 

285
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,590
okay and what I'm doing
instead is I'm trying to stack you so

286
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
instead is I'm trying to stack you so
 

287
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,750
instead is I'm trying to stack you so
you would be coming in right and I'm

288
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
you would be coming in right and I'm
 

289
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,470
you would be coming in right and I'm
trying stack you see okay so I'm trying

290
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
trying stack you see okay so I'm trying
 

291
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,750
trying stack you see okay so I'm trying
to stack

292
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
to stack
 

293
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,230
to stack
you and then I'm trying to take you into

294
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
you and then I'm trying to take you into
 

295
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,790
you and then I'm trying to take you into
the spiral geometry you see that so

296
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:57,800
the spiral geometry you see that so
 

297
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,189
the spiral geometry you see that so
we're doing the same move

298
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:02,199

 

299
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,910

you had to turn you see that so we come

300
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:05,920
you had to turn you see that so we come
 

301
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,189
you had to turn you see that so we come
back we go a little

302
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:08,199
back we go a little
 

303
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:12,629
back we go a little
slower I'm coming over here I stack your

304
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
slower I'm coming over here I stack your
 

305
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,110
slower I'm coming over here I stack your
turn there's the counter rotation now

306
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,120
turn there's the counter rotation now
 

307
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,350
turn there's the counter rotation now
you see that just like in the video you

308
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:18,360
you see that just like in the video you
 

309
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,710
you see that just like in the video you
were doing do it again so you can see

310
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
were doing do it again so you can see
 

311
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,389
were doing do it again so you can see
what I'm talking about so for example

312
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:23,399
what I'm talking about so for example
 

313
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,069
what I'm talking about so for example
here right I'm going this way tries to

314
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
here right I'm going this way tries to
 

315
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,949
here right I'm going this way tries to
box me off and that's where I counter

316
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:27,959
box me off and that's where I counter
 

317
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,389
box me off and that's where I counter
rotate Okay so the same thing

318
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
rotate Okay so the same thing
 

319
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,310
rotate Okay so the same thing
here and we're going around okay there's

320
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
here and we're going around okay there's
 

321
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,590
here and we're going around okay there's
the stack you see and you already trying

322
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600
the stack you see and you already trying
 

323
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,550
the stack you see and you already trying
to box me off if you pay attention

324
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
to box me off if you pay attention
 

325
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,949
to box me off if you pay attention
because stay where you are don't move

326
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:43,959
because stay where you are don't move
 

327
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,230
because stay where you are don't move
move him out of the way and you go

328
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,240
move him out of the way and you go
 

329
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,509
move him out of the way and you go
straight you're not on me now you're on

330
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:50,519
straight you're not on me now you're on
 

331
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,710
straight you're not on me now you're on
where you think I'm going to go that's

332
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
where you think I'm going to go that's
 

333
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,430
where you think I'm going to go that's
to try to box me in you know once you

334
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:55,440
to try to box me in you know once you
 

335
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,189
to try to box me in you know once you
try to box me in that's where the

336
00:13:58,189 --> 00:13:58,199
try to box me in that's where the
 

337
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:01,030

345
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,470
you're right here just coming out you
and so there will be less than tripal

346
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:15,480
and so there will be less than tripal
 

347
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,430
and so there will be less than tripal
energy and I'll be moving back into that

348
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:18,440
energy and I'll be moving back into that
 

349
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,710
energy and I'll be moving back into that
line so again we go here and I go to
