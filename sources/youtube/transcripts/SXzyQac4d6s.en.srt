00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,230

so on the standing C set drill number

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:03,240
so on the standing C set drill number
 

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,510
so on the standing C set drill number
one is the standing

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:05,520
one is the standing
 

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,470
one is the standing
Zen drill number two is the one we've

6
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
Zen drill number two is the one we've
 

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,230
Zen drill number two is the one we've
been doing okay this is like drill one

8
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,240
been doing okay this is like drill one
 

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,470
been doing okay this is like drill one
2.5 okay so he's going to do drill two

10
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:17,480
2.5 okay so he's going to do drill two
 

11
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,590
2.5 okay so he's going to do drill two

13
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,950
but I'm doing drill two at the same time
so he's on he's ground vectoring the

14
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
so he's on he's ground vectoring the
 

15
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,310
so he's on he's ground vectoring the
young aspect on the back mid fooot and

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,630

midfoot he maintains organization the

26
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
midfoot he maintains organization the
 

27
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,150
midfoot he maintains organization the
same way he is right now he maintains

28
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
same way he is right now he maintains
 

29
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,950
same way he is right now he maintains
that exact organization and lets

30
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960

 

31
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,389

himself be moved by that organization

32
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
himself be moved by that organization
 

33
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,549
