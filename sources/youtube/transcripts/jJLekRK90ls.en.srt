00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:04,680
there's there's pieces you can add
 

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,070
there's there's pieces you can add
if you offer them it here

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:07,080
if you offer them it here

00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
you're doing the you're doing the wrong
 

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,049
you're doing the you're doing the wrong

00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
because it's natural if it's coming like
 

11
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,490
because it's natural if it's coming like
that it's downwards isn't it it's

12
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:16,500
that it's downwards isn't it it's
 

13
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,730
that it's downwards isn't it it's
downwards if he's coming here

14
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:19,740
downwards if he's coming here
 

15
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,929
downwards if he's coming here
then you've got a chance to all right so

16
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:23,939
then you've got a chance to all right so
 

17
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,849
then you've got a chance to all right so
what I found is I'm so busy here that I

18
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:28,859
what I found is I'm so busy here that I
 

19
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,130
what I found is I'm so busy here that I
get a little bit stuck here it's a bit

20
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:31,140
get a little bit stuck here it's a bit
 

21
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,110
get a little bit stuck here it's a bit
stuck now to get this big lump through

stuck now to get this big lump through
 

23
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,190
stuck now to get this big lump through
here so I'm not very elegant of that so

24
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
here so I'm not very elegant of that so
 

25
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,709
here so I'm not very elegant of that so
I need a little more space so this is

26
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:39,719
I need a little more space so this is
 

27
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,770

without him knowing it

32
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:48,660

 

33
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,410

to give it a bit more spice

34
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:51,420
to give it a bit more spice
 

35
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,549
to give it a bit more spice
it

36
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
it
 

37
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,709
it
it's not so much pushing him as it's

38
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
it's not so much pushing him as it's
 

39
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,209
it's not so much pushing him as it's
holding him off

40
00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:56,219
holding him off
 

41
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,490
