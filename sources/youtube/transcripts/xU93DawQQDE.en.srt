00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,909
like it's so weird to them to do this
but I've always done it this way

180
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:02,919
but I've always done it this way
 

181
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,950
but I've always done it this way
okay what they want to do is

182
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:05,960
okay what they want to do is
 

183
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,870
okay what they want to do is
block okay first of all there's no

184
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:09,880
block okay first of all there's no
 

185
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,950
block okay first of all there's no
blocking if it if we're doing what looks

186
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
blocking if it if we're doing what looks
 

187
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,950
blocking if it if we're doing what looks
like a block it's because what type of

188
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:15,960
like a block it's because what type of
 

189
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,150
like a block it's because what type of
tempo or training are we doing EMB

190
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,160
tempo or training are we doing EMB
 

191
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,589
tempo or training are we doing EMB
embryonic which means this is not the

192
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:21,599
embryonic which means this is not the
 

193
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:25,029
embryonic which means this is not the
correct timing okay that's where we use

194
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
correct timing okay that's where we use
 

195
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,629
correct timing okay that's where we use
the opponent's

196
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
the opponent's
 

197
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,350
the opponent's
weapon as a vector a visible tactile

198
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
weapon as a vector a visible tactile
 

199
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,270
weapon as a vector a visible tactile
Vector marking the angle of attack where

200
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:34,280
Vector marking the angle of attack where
 

201
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,909
Vector marking the angle of attack where
we don't block

202
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:36,919
we don't block
 

203
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:38,589
we don't block
okay

204
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:38,599
okay
 

205
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,350
okay
so there that is why I don't have to end

206
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:42,360
so there that is why I don't have to end
 

207
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,670
so there that is why I don't have to end
up go pretend I don't have to end up in

this position I should have never ended

freaking know okay so I put this weapon

224
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
freaking know okay so I put this weapon
 

225
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,350
freaking know okay so I put this weapon
in his face I know that he's starting to

here pay attention to the way that I

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,230
here pay attention to the way that I
appear to twist but I move my body so I

282
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,240
appear to twist but I move my body so I
 

283
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,470
appear to twist but I move my body so I
untwist okay oh right here is Twisted

284
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
untwist okay oh right here is Twisted
 

285
00:08:48,480 --> 00:09:04,990
untwist okay oh right here is Twisted
but I move my body and it's gone

287
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,269

okay try that quickly so we can get on

288
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
okay try that quickly so we can get on
 

289
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,230
okay try that quickly so we can get on
with it all right so we're going and

290
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,240
with it all right so we're going and
 

291
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,790
with it all right so we're going and
that's where you hit it in the actual

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:13,800
that's where you hit it in the actual
 

293
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,190
that's where you hit it in the actual
timing so just like on Mia Tosh it's

294
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:18,200
timing so just like on Mia Tosh it's
 

295
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,949
timing so just like on Mia Tosh it's
somewhere around here okay there's a lot

00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:21,959
somewhere around here okay there's a lot
 

297
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,630
somewhere around here okay there's a lot

and I want to

350
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:57,320
and I want to
 

351
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,910
and I want to
go straight into the

go straight into the
 

353
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,509
go straight into the
tush which is going to put the Power

354

hand here right hand and I drop the
 

357
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:09,389

problem with this

360
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
problem with this
 

361
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,030
problem with this
technique is

362
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
technique is
 

363
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,509
technique is
that the hand comes back up so what a

364
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
that the hand comes back up so what a
 

365
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,190
that the hand comes back up so what a
lot of people do will rewind the

366
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:20,200
lot of people do will rewind the
 

367
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,509
lot of people do will rewind the
film is they Short

368
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:22,519
film is they Short

change the power hand see it never went

370
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480
change the power hand see it never went

change the power hand see it never went
down and they start to bring it up and

372
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
down and they start to bring it up and
 

373
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,870
down and they start to bring it up and
now you're on the other side of the a

374

now you're on the other side of the a
 

375
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,509
now you're on the other side of the a
you over rotated the cross you see that

376
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
you over rotated the cross you see that
 

377
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,790
you over rotated the cross you see that
now you're on the other side that

378
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
now you're on the other side that
 

379
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,269
now you're on the other side that
creates That

380
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:36,279
creates That
 

381
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,829
creates That

unless it's clear as day okay so you
 

401
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,629
unless it's clear as day okay so you
have to get the tush but when we're

402
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
have to get the tush but when we're
 

403
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,710
have to get the tush but when we're
undisciplined our right hand doesn't
