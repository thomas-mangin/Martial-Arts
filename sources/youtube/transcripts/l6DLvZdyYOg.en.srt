i'm christopher hine and this week we're
 

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,910
i'm christopher hine and this week we're
talking about filling in all the missing

8
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
talking about filling in all the missing
 

9
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,669
talking about filling in all the missing
gaps in aikido

10
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:13,679
gaps in aikido
 

11
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,190
gaps in aikido
in the last video i talked a little bit

12
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
in the last video i talked a little bit
 

13
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,430
in the last video i talked a little bit
about one of our main goals in aikido

14
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
about one of our main goals in aikido
 

15
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,429
about one of our main goals in aikido
and that's the ability to be ahead to be

16
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:19,439
and that's the ability to be ahead to be
 

17
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,510
and that's the ability to be ahead to be
mentally ahead of what's going on

18
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
mentally ahead of what's going on
 

19
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,109
mentally ahead of what's going on
and how that can help us overcome

20
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119
and how that can help us overcome
 

21
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,109
and how that can help us overcome
someone or at least manage and deal with

22
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
someone or at least manage and deal with
 

23
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:25,670
someone or at least manage and deal with
someone

24
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
someone
 

25
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,429
someone
who is bigger and stronger and faster

26
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:27,439
who is bigger and stronger and faster
 

27
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,790
who is bigger and stronger and faster
than us and wants to cause

28
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
than us and wants to cause
 

29
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,589
than us and wants to cause
trouble to us right so to be ahead and

30
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
trouble to us right so to be ahead and
 

31
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,870
trouble to us right so to be ahead and
being ahead

32
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
being ahead
 

33
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,470
being ahead
has a whole set of tactics that we'll

34
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
has a whole set of tactics that we'll
 

35
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,110
has a whole set of tactics that we'll
talk about that enable you to be ahead

36
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
talk about that enable you to be ahead
 

37
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,470
talk about that enable you to be ahead
right so all the little things you need

38
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
right so all the little things you need
 

39
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,549
right so all the little things you need
to do in order to be ahead

40
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
to do in order to be ahead
 

41
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,549
to do in order to be ahead
now one of the other important things if

42
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
now one of the other important things if
 

43
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,229
now one of the other important things if
we can't be ahead and there's lots of

44
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
we can't be ahead and there's lots of
 

45
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,750
we can't be ahead and there's lots of
times where we can't be ahead right we

46
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
times where we can't be ahead right we
 

47
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,270
times where we can't be ahead right we
got surprise all kinds of things can

48
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
got surprise all kinds of things can
 

49
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,830
got surprise all kinds of things can
happen

50
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
happen
 

51
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,189
happen
the next thing we want to do is to keep

52
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
the next thing we want to do is to keep
 

53
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,189
the next thing we want to do is to keep
a safe distance from someone so our

54
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
a safe distance from someone so our
 

55
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,110
a safe distance from someone so our
second main goal is to keep a safe

56
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
second main goal is to keep a safe
 

57
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,750
second main goal is to keep a safe
distance

58
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
distance
 

59
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,510
distance
now there's a minimum safe distance and

60
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
now there's a minimum safe distance and
 

61
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,549
now there's a minimum safe distance and
i've talked about that a lot in my

62
00:00:58,549 --> 00:00:58,559
i've talked about that a lot in my
 

63
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,830
i've talked about that a lot in my
videos and that's just

64
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840
videos and that's just
 

65
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,910
videos and that's just
that uh arm length distance right and

66
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
that uh arm length distance right and
 

67
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,510
that uh arm length distance right and
what's nice about that distance is

68
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
what's nice about that distance is
 

69
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,830
what's nice about that distance is
someone can't touch you without taking a

70
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
someone can't touch you without taking a
 

71
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,429
someone can't touch you without taking a
step first and that step

72
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
step first and that step
 

73
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,270
step first and that step
that they would take gives you enough

74
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
that they would take gives you enough
 

75
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,190
that they would take gives you enough
reaction time that you could deal with

76
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
reaction time that you could deal with
 

77
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,990
reaction time that you could deal with
it right you could defend

78
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
it right you could defend
 

79
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,590
it right you could defend
yourself against it or attack them back

80
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
yourself against it or attack them back
 

81
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,789
yourself against it or attack them back
or get out of there all kinds of other

82
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
or get out of there all kinds of other
 

83
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,670
or get out of there all kinds of other
stuff can happen

84
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
stuff can happen
 

85
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,510
stuff can happen
so that's a really important distance

86
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
so that's a really important distance
 

87
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,749
so that's a really important distance
now other distances are also available

88
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
now other distances are also available
 

89
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,749
now other distances are also available
to us right long distances are good as

90
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
to us right long distances are good as
 

91
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,230
to us right long distances are good as
well

92
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
well
 

93
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,390
well
so understanding how to manage distance

94
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
so understanding how to manage distance
 

95
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,710
so understanding how to manage distance
now this managing distance again will

96
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
now this managing distance again will
 

97
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,469
now this managing distance again will
lead us to another set of tactics that

98
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
lead us to another set of tactics that
 

99
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,830
lead us to another set of tactics that
we'll need to understand

100
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
we'll need to understand
 

101
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,590
we'll need to understand
to manage the distance so how do we

102
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
to manage the distance so how do we
 

103
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,870
to manage the distance so how do we
manage the distance

104
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
manage the distance
 

105
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,990
manage the distance
and then the interplay between distance

106
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
and then the interplay between distance
 

107
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,630
and then the interplay between distance
and headedness also is a set of tactics

108
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
and headedness also is a set of tactics
 

109
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,270
and headedness also is a set of tactics
right meaning

110
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
right meaning
 

111
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,310
right meaning
that i can use distancing as a tactic

112
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
that i can use distancing as a tactic
 

113
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,389
that i can use distancing as a tactic
to get back ahead right meaning if

114
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
to get back ahead right meaning if
 

115
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,830
to get back ahead right meaning if
someone's coming to attack me

116
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
someone's coming to attack me
 

117
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,350
someone's coming to attack me
and i can create a little distance so

118
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
and i can create a little distance so
 

119
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,789
and i can create a little distance so
they can't get to me i can start to

120
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
they can't get to me i can start to
 

121
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,469
they can't get to me i can start to
think okay this person's coming towards

122
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
think okay this person's coming towards
 

123
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,069
think okay this person's coming towards
me and they're coming like this and this

124
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
me and they're coming like this and this
 

125
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,670
me and they're coming like this and this
is the surroundings we're in and so i

126
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
is the surroundings we're in and so i
 

127
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,069
is the surroundings we're in and so i
can do

128
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
can do
 

129
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,990
can do
these kinds of things to prevent them

130
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
these kinds of things to prevent them
 

131
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,109
these kinds of things to prevent them
from getting me right so

132
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
from getting me right so
 

133
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,149
from getting me right so
i can actually use distancing as a

134
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
i can actually use distancing as a
 

135
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,030
i can actually use distancing as a
tactic

136
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
tactic
 

137
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,670
tactic
to achieve my goal so i believe that

138
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
to achieve my goal so i believe that
 

139
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,310
to achieve my goal so i believe that
distancing

140
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
distancing
 

141
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,990
distancing
is a goal in aikido so it's something to

142
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
is a goal in aikido so it's something to
 

143
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,190
is a goal in aikido so it's something to
be achieved and if i'm achieving

144
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
be achieved and if i'm achieving
 

145
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,749
be achieved and if i'm achieving
distance

146
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
distance
 

147
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,510
distance
then i'm achieving my aikido goals which

148
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
then i'm achieving my aikido goals which
 

149
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,869
then i'm achieving my aikido goals which
lead to my philosophy

150
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
lead to my philosophy
 

151
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,270
lead to my philosophy
but it's also a tactic in and of itself

152
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
but it's also a tactic in and of itself
 

153
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,070
but it's also a tactic in and of itself
to help me

154
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
to help me
 

155
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,910
to help me
get ahead again which is one of my

156
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
get ahead again which is one of my
 

157
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,750
get ahead again which is one of my
biggest goals right to be ahead

158
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
biggest goals right to be ahead
 

159
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,710
biggest goals right to be ahead
now another main goal of aikido that

160
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
now another main goal of aikido that
 

161
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,150
now another main goal of aikido that
also can be used as a tactic with the

162
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
also can be used as a tactic with the
 

163
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,030
also can be used as a tactic with the
rest of these

164
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
rest of these
 

165
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,070
rest of these
is the ability to position yourself uh

166
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
is the ability to position yourself uh
 

167
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,390
is the ability to position yourself uh
in an ideal position right so if we just

168
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
in an ideal position right so if we just
 

169
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,589
in an ideal position right so if we just
looked at two bodies

170
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
looked at two bodies
 

171
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,990
looked at two bodies
the most ideal position for you to be in

172
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
the most ideal position for you to be in
 

173
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,190
the most ideal position for you to be in
if someone was attacking you

174
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
if someone was attacking you
 

175
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,030
if someone was attacking you
is to be behind them so that's the best

176
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
is to be behind them so that's the best
 

177
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,350
is to be behind them so that's the best
position the worst position for you to

178
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
position the worst position for you to
 

179
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,830
position the worst position for you to
be in

180
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:37,840
be in
 

181
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,589
be in
would be uh right in front of them with

182
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
would be uh right in front of them with
 

183
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,270
would be uh right in front of them with
your back to them right so the exact

184
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
your back to them right so the exact
 

185
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,270
your back to them right so the exact
flip-flop of that is the worst position

186
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
flip-flop of that is the worst position
 

187
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,910
flip-flop of that is the worst position
for you

188
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
for you
 

189
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,070
for you
so understanding what position is and

190
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
so understanding what position is and
 

191
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,070
so understanding what position is and
what are good positions in bad positions

192
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
what are good positions in bad positions
 

193
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,990
what are good positions in bad positions
is another main goal in aikido we always

194
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
is another main goal in aikido we always
 

195
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,509
is another main goal in aikido we always
want to be in the good position the best

196
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
want to be in the good position the best
 

197
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,869
want to be in the good position the best
position available to us

198
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
position available to us
 

199
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,550
position available to us
and that again will lead to another set

200
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
and that again will lead to another set
 

201
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,309
and that again will lead to another set
of tactics that help us

202
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
of tactics that help us
 

203
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,030
of tactics that help us
maintain good position and positioning

204
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
maintain good position and positioning
 

205
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,750
maintain good position and positioning
again

206
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
again
 

207
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,470
again
is itself a tactic to help us achieve

208
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
is itself a tactic to help us achieve
 

209
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,270
is itself a tactic to help us achieve
distance

210
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
distance
 

211
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,750
distance
and to help us achieve being ahead so we

212
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
and to help us achieve being ahead so we
 

213
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,830
and to help us achieve being ahead so we
can use these three goals right which

214
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
can use these three goals right which
 

215
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,229
can use these three goals right which
are

216
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
are
 

217
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,589
are
basically positioning distancing

218
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
basically positioning distancing
 

219
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,990
basically positioning distancing
and the ability to be ahead of someone

220
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
and the ability to be ahead of someone
 

221
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,270
and the ability to be ahead of someone
we can use those

222
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
we can use those
 

223
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,430
we can use those
as not only just goals to be achieved on

224
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
as not only just goals to be achieved on
 

225
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,270
as not only just goals to be achieved on
themselves but also as tactics

226
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
themselves but also as tactics
 

227
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,990
themselves but also as tactics
to help us achieve our philosophy so the

228
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
to help us achieve our philosophy so the
 

229
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,309
to help us achieve our philosophy so the
the the relationship between tactics and

230
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
the the relationship between tactics and
 

231
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,550
the the relationship between tactics and
and goals is really really close the

232
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
and goals is really really close the
 

233
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,430
and goals is really really close the
goal is just

234
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
goal is just
 

235
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,149
goal is just
the goal am i far away from them or do i

236
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
the goal am i far away from them or do i
 

237
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,589
the goal am i far away from them or do i
have a good position on them

238
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
have a good position on them
 

239
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,350
have a good position on them
or am i ahead of them those are just the

240
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
or am i ahead of them those are just the
 

241
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,110
or am i ahead of them those are just the
goals right but how do we get

242
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
goals right but how do we get
 

243
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,430
goals right but how do we get
to that goal is another thing right so

244
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
to that goal is another thing right so
 

245
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,030
to that goal is another thing right so
and that's the tactics how do i achieve

246
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
and that's the tactics how do i achieve
 

247
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,550
and that's the tactics how do i achieve
that goal that's the actual tactics

248
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
that goal that's the actual tactics
 

249
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,350
that goal that's the actual tactics
and then those goals being ahead can

250
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
and then those goals being ahead can
 

251
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,390
and then those goals being ahead can
allow me to

252
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
allow me to
 

253
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,789
allow me to
keep my distance or being at distance

254
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
keep my distance or being at distance
 

255
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,390
keep my distance or being at distance
can allow me to get ahead

256
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
can allow me to get ahead
 

257
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,390
can allow me to get ahead
and so those three co-mingle in this

258
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
and so those three co-mingle in this
 

259
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,509
and so those three co-mingle in this
interesting way

260
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
interesting way
 

261
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,229
interesting way
so those are the three goals and also

262
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
so those are the three goals and also
 

263
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,070
so those are the three goals and also
they tell us what the three main sets of

264
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
they tell us what the three main sets of
 

265
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,830
they tell us what the three main sets of
tactics are and there's more tactics of

266
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
tactics are and there's more tactics of
 

267
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,789
tactics are and there's more tactics of
course that would go to those

268
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
course that would go to those
 

269
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,589
course that would go to those
but those are our set of tactics now

270
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
but those are our set of tactics now
 

271
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,470
but those are our set of tactics now
down from this

272
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
down from this
 

273
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,070
down from this
we'll go into techniques and that gets

274
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
we'll go into techniques and that gets
 

275
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,670
we'll go into techniques and that gets
into a little more familiar territory

276
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
into a little more familiar territory
 

277
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,630
into a little more familiar territory
for most aikido

278
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
for most aikido
 

279
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,710
for most aikido
practitioners but so remember our main

280
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
practitioners but so remember our main
 

281
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,630
practitioners but so remember our main
idea here is we have a philosophy

282
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
idea here is we have a philosophy
 

283
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,070
idea here is we have a philosophy
then we have goals that let us know if

284
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
then we have goals that let us know if
 

285
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,670
then we have goals that let us know if
we're achieving our philosophy

286
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
we're achieving our philosophy
 

287
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,830
we're achieving our philosophy
and then tactics right and these tactics

288
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
and then tactics right and these tactics
 

289
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,789
and then tactics right and these tactics
start to

290
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
start to
 

291
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,870
start to
give us what our overall strategy or

292
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
give us what our overall strategy or
 

293
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,789
give us what our overall strategy or
system is and then below that are the

294
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
system is and then below that are the
 

295
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:21,990
system is and then below that are the
techniques and the techniques are the

296
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
techniques and the techniques are the
 

297
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,590
techniques and the techniques are the
immediate actions we take

298
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
immediate actions we take
 

299
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,870
immediate actions we take
in order to implement our tactics

300
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
in order to implement our tactics
 

301
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,629
in order to implement our tactics
