hi fish behind we're talking about the

00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:14,610
hi fish behind we're talking about the

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,700
hi fish behind we're talking about the
basic but can work that we do here at

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:16,710
basic but can work that we do here at
 

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,550
basic but can work that we do here at
our school in this we have a basic

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:19,560
our school in this we have a basic
 

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,010
our school in this we have a basic
attack series in art school 2x which

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:22,020
attack series in art school 2x which
 

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,900
attack series in art school 2x which
spoke in I don't start with a lot of

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:23,910
spoke in I don't start with a lot of

attention played pages the booty and the

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,010
attention played pages the booty and the
 

15
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,189
attention played pages the booty and the
reason for this is because most of sort

16
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:28,199
reason for this is because most of sort
 

17
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,990
reason for this is because most of sort
work is really about understanding what

18
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
work is really about understanding what
 

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,310
work is really about understanding what
the other person is doing and what

20
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:31,320
the other person is doing and what
 

21
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,900
the other person is doing and what
you're doing and what makes good attack

22
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:32,910
you're doing and what makes good attack
 

23
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,639
you're doing and what makes good attack
to bat attacks and good defenses and

24
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:34,649
to bat attacks and good defenses and
 

25
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,770
to bat attacks and good defenses and
good counters and all these things it is

26
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:36,780
good counters and all these things it is
 

27
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,450
good counters and all these things it is
important to get the booty practice in

28
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:38,460
important to get the booty practice in
 

29
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,639
important to get the booty practice in
but I generally don't start the students

30
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:40,649
but I generally don't start the students
 

31
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,920
but I generally don't start the students
off with a lot of savuti work because

32
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:42,930
off with a lot of savuti work because
 

33
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,290
off with a lot of savuti work because
the reason is that refining cut isn't as

34
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:45,300
the reason is that refining cut isn't as
 

35
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,819
the reason is that refining cut isn't as
important to them as understanding the

36
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:46,829
important to them as understanding the
 

37
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,950
important to them as understanding the
basic theory of how swordsmanship works

38
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
basic theory of how swordsmanship works
 

39
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,350
basic theory of how swordsmanship works
so we have it set of five first attacks

40
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
so we have it set of five first attacks
 

41
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,299
so we have it set of five first attacks
which generally if the students kind of

42
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:53,309
which generally if the students kind of
 

43
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,400
which generally if the students kind of
squared away in and how to use the sword

44
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:55,410
squared away in and how to use the sword
 

45
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,869
squared away in and how to use the sword
how to swing the sword move of the sword

46
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
how to swing the sword move of the sword
 

47
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,849
how to swing the sword move of the sword
but more importantly we get the students

48
00:00:58,849 --> 00:00:58,859
but more importantly we get the students
 

49
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,520
but more importantly we get the students
squared away with how we're going to be

50
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:01,530
squared away with how we're going to be
 

51
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,349
squared away with how we're going to be
making our attacks now we're going to

52
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
making our attacks now we're going to
 

53
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,509
making our attacks now we're going to
talk about the very first attack here so

54
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
talk about the very first attack here so
 

55
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,070
talk about the very first attack here so
the first attack I'm gonna get Josh he

56
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:07,080
the first attack I'm gonna get Josh he
 

57
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,490
the first attack I'm gonna get Josh he
ran in and with me so the first is half

58
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:10,500
ran in and with me so the first is half
 

59
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,789
ran in and with me so the first is half
is there's an opening on the line and

60
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:13,799
is there's an opening on the line and
 

61
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,469
is there's an opening on the line and
you should take that opening so Josh

62
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:15,479
you should take that opening so Josh
 

63
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,240
you should take that opening so Josh
opens up for me right now

64
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,250
opens up for me right now
 

65
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,890
opens up for me right now
Josh doesn't have a defense in place

66
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:18,900
Josh doesn't have a defense in place
 

67
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,600
Josh doesn't have a defense in place
that means I have a moment in time where

68
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:20,610
that means I have a moment in time where
 

69
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,670
that means I have a moment in time where
I can possibly attack so I could come in

70
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:22,680
I can possibly attack so I could come in
 

71
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,280
I can possibly attack so I could come in
and attack this guy now anytime we're on

72
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,290
and attack this guy now anytime we're on
 

73
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,770
and attack this guy now anytime we're on
the line and I get some kind of opening

74
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:27,780
the line and I get some kind of opening
 

75
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,380
the line and I get some kind of opening
I should consider attacking that opening

76
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:30,390
I should consider attacking that opening
 

77
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,810
I should consider attacking that opening
if I wasn't even with a really crappy

78
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:32,820
if I wasn't even with a really crappy
 

79
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,249
if I wasn't even with a really crappy
person I would say you should always

80
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:34,259
person I would say you should always
 

81
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,020
person I would say you should always
attack that opening but if I'm dealing

82
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,030
attack that opening but if I'm dealing
 

83
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,760
attack that opening but if I'm dealing
with a crafty person you might have set

84
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:37,770
with a crafty person you might have set
 

85
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,990
with a crafty person you might have set
something up in that opening that I

86
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,000
something up in that opening that I
 

87
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,420
something up in that opening that I
should be wary but for the most part if

88
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:41,430
should be wary but for the most part if
 

89
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,980
should be wary but for the most part if
I don't open it appears on the line I

90
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:42,990
I don't open it appears on the line I
 

91
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,749
I don't open it appears on the line I
should be attacking that okay right now

92
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:44,759
should be attacking that okay right now
 

93
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,910
should be attacking that okay right now
Josh's sorts moved off to the side so

94
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:46,920
Josh's sorts moved off to the side so
 

95
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,350
Josh's sorts moved off to the side so
that gives me a perfect opportunity to

96
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:48,360
that gives me a perfect opportunity to
 

97
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,300
that gives me a perfect opportunity to
come in and attack now when I'm

98
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:50,310
come in and attack now when I'm
 

99
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,310
come in and attack now when I'm
attacking I want to attack in a nice

100
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
attacking I want to attack in a nice
 

101
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,100
attacking I want to attack in a nice
counter swings in there my body's not in

102
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,110
counter swings in there my body's not in
 

103
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,899
counter swings in there my body's not in
range for that body strike right I'm

104
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:56,909
range for that body strike right I'm
 

105
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,880
range for that body strike right I'm
also creating opposition wherever his

106
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:58,890
also creating opposition wherever his
 

107
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,310
also creating opposition wherever his
sword is so nothing he were to attack hi

108
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,320
sword is so nothing he were to attack hi
 

109
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,680
sword is so nothing he were to attack hi
on that line you can see these coming in

110
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:03,690
on that line you can see these coming in
 

111
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,000
on that line you can see these coming in
and attacking my head here

112
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,010
and attacking my head here
 

113
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,859
and attacking my head here
my swords already in place so I'm

114
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:06,869
my swords already in place so I'm
 

115
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,419
my swords already in place so I'm
naturally defending that if he had

116
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:08,429
naturally defending that if he had
 

117
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,310
naturally defending that if he had
dropped his sword to the other side when

118
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,320
dropped his sword to the other side when
 

119
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,830
dropped his sword to the other side when
I came in so yep if you drop this sword

120
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:12,840
I came in so yep if you drop this sword
 

121
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,300
I came in so yep if you drop this sword
to the other side when I came in I

122
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,310
to the other side when I came in I
 

123
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,220
to the other side when I came in I
actually don't have a nice line there's

124
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,230
actually don't have a nice line there's
 

125
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,290
actually don't have a nice line there's
a defender so yeah his sword was dropped

126
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:18,300
a defender so yeah his sword was dropped
 

127
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,960
a defender so yeah his sword was dropped
to the other side I would come in this

128
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:20,970
to the other side I would come in this
 

129
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,880
to the other side I would come in this
way and now you can see this is my body

130
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:22,890
way and now you can see this is my body
 

131
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,560
way and now you can see this is my body
and he goes for my head

132
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:24,570
and he goes for my head
 

133
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,479
and he goes for my head
he's not naturally have an opposition to

134
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:26,489
he's not naturally have an opposition to
 

135
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:27,830
he's not naturally have an opposition to
that right so I've always think

136
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
that right so I've always think
 

137
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,930
that right so I've always think
attention to where this sword is and

138
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:29,940
attention to where this sword is and
 

139
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,550
attention to where this sword is and
that determines how my feet will come in

140
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:31,560
that determines how my feet will come in
 

141
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,410
that determines how my feet will come in
for the attack so the first basic attack

142
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:33,420
for the attack so the first basic attack
 

143
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,050
for the attack so the first basic attack
the main idea of this attack his options

144
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,060
the main idea of this attack his options
 

145
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,360
the main idea of this attack his options
open up here and his sword is over there

146
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,370
open up here and his sword is over there
 

147
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,460
open up here and his sword is over there
on my left when I step in I want to step

148
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:40,470
on my left when I step in I want to step
 

149
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,320
on my left when I step in I want to step
in with the right side of my body that

150
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,330
in with the right side of my body that
 

151
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,090
in with the right side of my body that
way I'm here able to make an attack on

152
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,100
way I'm here able to make an attack on
 

153
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,430
way I'm here able to make an attack on
Josh now when I make that attack he

154
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:46,440
Josh now when I make that attack he
 

155
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,990
Josh now when I make that attack he
cannot swing on the same line in

156
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
cannot swing on the same line in
 

157
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,120
cannot swing on the same line in
campaign because I'm defended and it be

158
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,130
campaign because I'm defended and it be
 

159
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,250
campaign because I'm defended and it be
swings lower than that my body's out of

160
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:52,260
swings lower than that my body's out of
 

161
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,780
swings lower than that my body's out of
the way so I understand we're always

162
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:53,790
the way so I understand we're always
 

163
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,120
the way so I understand we're always
accounting for that secondary attack

164
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,130
accounting for that secondary attack
 

165
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,770
accounting for that secondary attack
that can happen if his sword is on the

166
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:57,780
that can happen if his sword is on the
 

167
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,270
that can happen if his sword is on the
other side I would step in that way

168
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
other side I would step in that way
 

169
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,920
other side I would step in that way
Sally the majority my body would be

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,680
defended against his next possible
attack for our second attack the idea

174
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:06,690
attack for our second attack the idea
 

175
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,780
attack for our second attack the idea
here is that I don't have an opening on

176
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:08,790
here is that I don't have an opening on
 

177
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,789
here is that I don't have an opening on
the line so I can make an opening on the

178
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:10,799
the line so I can make an opening on the
 

179
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,610
the line so I can make an opening on the
line by not for the side and coming in

180
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:13,620
line by not for the side and coming in
 

181
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,110
line by not for the side and coming in
like this now when I do that I'm

182
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
like this now when I do that I'm
 

183
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,580
like this now when I do that I'm
following all the same rules as the

184
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:16,590
following all the same rules as the
 

185
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,229
following all the same rules as the
first attack so the first is that taught

186
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
first attack so the first is that taught
 

187
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,390
first attack so the first is that taught
me that if I had an opening I can attack

188
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
me that if I had an opening I can attack
 

189
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,340
me that if I had an opening I can attack
and the way in which I should attack on

190
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:22,350
and the way in which I should attack on
 

191
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,350
and the way in which I should attack on
this opening is to the east went in for

opposition to that in the second one all

198
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:30,540
opposition to that in the second one all
 

199
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,300
opposition to that in the second one all
we're learning is that I can clear the

200
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,310
we're learning is that I can clear the
 

201
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,530
we're learning is that I can clear the
line so I don't have to move myself

202
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:33,540
line so I don't have to move myself
 

203
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,930
line so I don't have to move myself

I still have protection on this center
line so if I were to go like this and

222
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:51,480
line so if I were to go like this and
 

223

a lot harder for me to get that

242
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:10,349
a lot harder for me to get that
 

243
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:11,839
a lot harder for me to get that
defensive place it's not impossible it's

244
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:11,849
defensive place it's not impossible it's
 

245
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,729
defensive place it's not impossible it's
my hands move back but a lot more work

246
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:13,739
my hands move back but a lot more work
 

247
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,710
my hands move back but a lot more work
so when I'm feeling like this I want to

248
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:15,720
so when I'm feeling like this I want to
 

249
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,479
so when I'm feeling like this I want to
practice my backhand this gives me a

250
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:17,489
practice my backhand this gives me a
 

251
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,460
practice my backhand this gives me a
little more defensive place then I use

252
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:19,470
little more defensive place then I use
 

253
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,219
little more defensive place then I use
my backhand sword out of the way and I

254
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:22,229
my backhand sword out of the way and I
 

255
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,890
my backhand sword out of the way and I
also use that to set my next action then

256
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:24,900
also use that to set my next action then
 

257
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,719
also use that to set my next action then
I'm moving in here bang and I can hit

258
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:26,729
I'm moving in here bang and I can hit
 

259
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:28,760
I'm moving in here bang and I can hit
right on top like this so that's how I'm

260
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:28,770
right on top like this so that's how I'm
 

261
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,590
right on top like this so that's how I'm
setting up my second action I don't have

262
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:30,600
setting up my second action I don't have
 

263
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,570
setting up my second action I don't have
an opening on line but I can clear the

264
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:32,580
an opening on line but I can clear the
 

265
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,080
an opening on line but I can clear the
line or an opening to come in next these

266
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,090
line or an opening to come in next these
 

267
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,540
line or an opening to come in next these
is I can change my angle so the third

00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,070
opposition always so instead of making a
 

287
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,950

nice attackers now the only problem with

298
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,000
nice attackers now the only problem with
 

299
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,450
nice attackers now the only problem with
this certain attack basically one of the

300
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:11,460
this certain attack basically one of the
 

301
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,040
this certain attack basically one of the

bustling manager which is to get a
 

305
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,790
bustling manager which is to get a
superior angle the problem of it is if I

306
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
superior angle the problem of it is if I
 

307
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,440
superior angle the problem of it is if I
come in towards this guy by raising my

immediately so no no preparatory action
 

403
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,770
immediately so no no preparatory action
on that and no natural defenses are

404
