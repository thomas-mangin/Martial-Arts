modern fighting we've learned that your

216
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:42,129
modern fighting we've learned that your
 

217

modern fighting we've learned that your
hands should go high so in a fighting

218
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,290
hands should go high so in a fighting
 

219
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,349
hands should go high so in a fighting
situation Josh's hands to go high I

220
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:46,359
situation Josh's hands to go high I
 

221
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,000
situation Josh's hands to go high I
would like to illustrate two points one

222
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,010
would like to illustrate two points one
 

223
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,039
would like to illustrate two points one
is I kid is not about fighting so he

224
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,049
is I kid is not about fighting so he
 

225
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:51,899
is I kid is not about fighting so he
should be doing most of his defense with

226
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:51,909
should be doing most of his defense with
 

227
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:53,250
should be doing most of his defense with
his feet moving out of range

228
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,260
his feet moving out of range
 

229
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,920
his feet moving out of range
even if he were to get into distance

230
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:55,930
even if he were to get into distance
 

231
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,509
even if he were to get into distance
meaning someone's pushing him so hard

232
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
meaning someone's pushing him so hard
 

233
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,920
meaning someone's pushing him so hard
generally nike know we're not gonna be

234
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:58,930
generally nike know we're not gonna be
 

235
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,809
generally nike know we're not gonna be
doing any kind of boxing stuff so his

236
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:00,819
doing any kind of boxing stuff so his
 

237
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:02,520
doing any kind of boxing stuff so his
hands up onto his head isn't really

238
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:02,530
hands up onto his head isn't really
 

239
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,439
hands up onto his head isn't really
gonna help him because what he needs to

240
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:04,449
gonna help him because what he needs to
 

241
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:05,969
gonna help him because what he needs to
do is get the weapons that would be in

242
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:05,979
do is get the weapons that would be in
 

243
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,770
do is get the weapons that would be in
his waist so in Aikido you see these

244
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:07,780
his waist so in Aikido you see these
 

245
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,629
his waist so in Aikido you see these
hands low position right in front like

246
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:09,639
hands low position right in front like
 

247
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,490
hands low position right in front like
that that's a basic I did a position of

248
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:11,500
that that's a basic I did a position of
 

249
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
that that's a basic I did a position of
this he could get to a sword a knife a

250
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:13,510
this he could get to a sword a knife a
 

251
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,960
this he could get to a sword a knife a
gun any kind of weapon he had in belt

252
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:15,970
gun any kind of weapon he had in belt
 

253
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,849
gun any kind of weapon he had in belt
range so that's why his hands are going

254
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:17,859
range so that's why his hands are going
 

255
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,140
range so that's why his hands are going
low because that's where he's going to

256
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,150
low because that's where he's going to
 

257
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,269
low because that's where he's going to
go to his offensive or defensive weapons

258
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:21,279
go to his offensive or defensive weapons
 

259
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,819
go to his offensive or defensive weapons
if

260
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:21,829
if
 

261
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,740
if
gets pressed that hard so in I think we

262
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:23,750
gets pressed that hard so in I think we
 

263
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,240
gets pressed that hard so in I think we
don't have high hands because it's not

264
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,250
don't have high hands because it's not
 

265
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,100
don't have high hands because it's not
good if I had a sword and Josh had high

266
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,110
good if I had a sword and Josh had high
 

267
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,659
good if I had a sword and Josh had high
hands I would just go right through

268
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:28,669
hands I would just go right through
 

269
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,209
hands I would just go right through
Josh's hands and cut him anyways so his

270
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:31,219
Josh's hands and cut him anyways so his
 

271
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:32,740
Josh's hands and cut him anyways so his
hands being high isn't important but if

272
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:32,750
hands being high isn't important but if
 

273
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,570
hands being high isn't important but if
he give to his sword on his waist that

274
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:34,580
he give to his sword on his waist that
 

275
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,499
he give to his sword on his waist that
would be important

276
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:35,509
would be important
 

277
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,719
would be important
now that's an old idea but in the modern

278
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:37,729
now that's an old idea but in the modern
 

279
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:39,369
now that's an old idea but in the modern
era he would be getting to his firearm

280
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:39,379
era he would be getting to his firearm
 

281
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,589
era he would be getting to his firearm
so his hands up if I'm shooting at Josh

282
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:41,599
so his hands up if I'm shooting at Josh
 

283
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,059
so his hands up if I'm shooting at Josh
aren't isn't gonna help them at all

284
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:43,069
aren't isn't gonna help them at all
 

285
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:45,040
aren't isn't gonna help them at all
however if you could get to cover he can

286
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,050
however if you could get to cover he can
 

287
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,929
however if you could get to cover he can
go there and his gun coming out can you

288
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:46,939
go there and his gun coming out can you
 

289
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,909
go there and his gun coming out can you
lay down suppressive fire so depending

290
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:48,919
lay down suppressive fire so depending
 

291
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,200
lay down suppressive fire so depending
on the situation you're talking about

292
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,210
on the situation you're talking about
 

293
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,219
on the situation you're talking about
Mike you know we're always thinking

294
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:51,229
Mike you know we're always thinking
 

295
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,320
Mike you know we're always thinking
about weapons are the escalation so

296
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,330
about weapons are the escalation so
 

297
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,879
about weapons are the escalation so
because weapons are the escalation we

298
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:54,889
because weapons are the escalation we
 

299
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,680
because weapons are the escalation we
don't have high hands we have loading so

300
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:56,690
don't have high hands we have loading so
 

301
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,510
don't have high hands we have loading so
