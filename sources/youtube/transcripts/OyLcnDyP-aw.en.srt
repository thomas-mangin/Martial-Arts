hands do you remember
okay so here I'm just checking right so

324
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
okay so here I'm just checking right so
 

325
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,259
okay so here I'm just checking right so
if you look and I lose this grip or he

326
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:03,269
if you look and I lose this grip or he
 

327
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:06,139
if you look and I lose this grip or he
lets go that grip then I have the check

328
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:06,149
lets go that grip then I have the check
 

329
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:09,019
lets go that grip then I have the check
to the outside so imma being the rule of

330
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:09,029
to the outside so imma being the rule of
 

331
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,840
to the outside so imma being the rule of
angled deflection angle deviation right

332
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:11,850
angled deflection angle deviation right
 

333
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,509
angled deflection angle deviation right
synchronization so I'm to the right and

334
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:14,519
synchronization so I'm to the right and
 

335
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,519
synchronization so I'm to the right and
the angle deflection is going towards

336
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:16,529
the angle deflection is going towards
 

337
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,619
the angle deflection is going towards
the left you guys see that no I'm not

338
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:18,629
the left you guys see that no I'm not
 

339
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:20,869
the left you guys see that no I'm not
gonna go ahead and give him this so he

340
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:20,879
gonna go ahead and give him this so he
 

341
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,059
gonna go ahead and give him this so he
can do all the cooking doggies that I've

342
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:23,069
can do all the cooking doggies that I've
 

343
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:28,340
can do all the cooking doggies that I've
been training in so it's just a check

344
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:28,350
been training in so it's just a check
 

345
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,699
been training in so it's just a check
just to check at this point and I am

346
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:31,709
just to check at this point and I am
 

347
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,889
just to check at this point and I am
prioritizing everything else that I just

348
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:33,899
prioritizing everything else that I just
 

349
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,539
prioritizing everything else that I just
said and then I find it still right not

350
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:38,549
said and then I find it still right not
 

351
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,780
said and then I find it still right not
yet because I'm prioritizing the ADB

352
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:41,790
yet because I'm prioritizing the ADB
 

353
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,169
yet because I'm prioritizing the ADB
angle it's at this point that I start to

354
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:45,179
angle it's at this point that I start to
 

355
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:47,389
angle it's at this point that I start to
close and we have you stand up straight

356
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:47,399
close and we have you stand up straight
 

357
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,970
close and we have you stand up straight
coming and I have my kind of young

358
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:52,980
coming and I have my kind of young
 

359
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,730
coming and I have my kind of young
killed grip at the top here and then the

360
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:55,740
killed grip at the top here and then the
 

361
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,889
killed grip at the top here and then the
pinky that's where my sword grip goes

362
00:12:57,889 --> 00:12:57,899
pinky that's where my sword grip goes
 

363
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,549
pinky that's where my sword grip goes
and boom to add to what I had do you

364
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:01,559
and boom to add to what I had do you
 

365
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:04,970
and boom to add to what I had do you
guys see that not to be all I have to

366
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:04,980
guys see that not to be all I have to
 

367
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,960
guys see that not to be all I have to
add to the EDB angle so this is going

368
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:08,970
add to the EDB angle so this is going
 

369
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:17,410
add to the EDB angle so this is going
this way this way this way okay

370
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:17,420
this way this way this way okay
 

371
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:30,370
this way this way this way okay
so check wool finishes that angle

372
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:30,380

377
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,010

you will inhibit that if you grab her

378
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,020
you will inhibit that if you grab her
 

379
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,250
you will inhibit that if you grab her
you you won't be able to do it you're

380
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:03,260
you you won't be able to do it you're
 

381
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,790
you you won't be able to do it you're
gonna get on its forearms right and he

382
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,800
gonna get on its forearms right and he
 

383
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,970
gonna get on its forearms right and he
has leverage over me no matter what I do

384
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:09,980
has leverage over me no matter what I do
 

385
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,340
has leverage over me no matter what I do
he could be back like that because I

386
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:12,350
he could be back like that because I
 

387
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,920
he could be back like that because I
can't do this to his big forearm muscle

388
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:14,930
can't do this to his big forearm muscle
 

389
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:19,630
can't do this to his big forearm muscle
I could do it on his wrist but I can't

390
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:19,640
I could do it on his wrist but I can't
 

391
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,520
I could do it on his wrist but I can't
do it on his forearm muscle because

392
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:21,530
do it on his forearm muscle because
 

393
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,620
do it on his forearm muscle because
there's no hinge there that the hinge is

394
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:23,630
there's no hinge there that the hinge is
 

395
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,720
there's no hinge there that the hinge is
over here and it's connected to bigger

396
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:25,730
over here and it's connected to bigger
 

397
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,000
over here and it's connected to bigger
muscles that he has and you're not going

398
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,010
muscles that he has and you're not going
 

399
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,700
muscles that he has and you're not going
to get it but when you're over here you

400
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:30,710
to get it but when you're over here you
 

401
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,760
to get it but when you're over here you
can get it

402
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:32,770
can get it
 

403
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,580
can get it
so don't prematurely grab and you tend

404
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:36,590
so don't prematurely grab and you tend
 

405
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,980
so don't prematurely grab and you tend
to not prematurely grab if you rip to

406
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:38,990
to not prematurely grab if you rip to
 

407
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:52,710
to not prematurely grab if you rip to
slightly everything else you get it okay

408
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720

 

409
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,660

you might think as a forward roll is an

410
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:55,670
you might think as a forward roll is an
 

411
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,780
you might think as a forward roll is an
acceleration outside his base of support

412
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:57,790
acceleration outside his base of support
 

413
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,600
acceleration outside his base of support
and so he has to roll or get his head

414
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:01,610
and so he has to roll or get his head
 

415
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,790
and so he has to roll or get his head
that's not it

416
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:03,800
that's not it
 

417
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,930
that's not it
you create an angle right and then you

418
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:07,940
you create an angle right and then you
 

419
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,460
you create an angle right and then you
can project through that you move his

420
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:11,470
can project through that you move his
 

421
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:17,710
can project through that you move his
entire line of gravity in a different

422
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:17,720
entire line of gravity in a different
 

423
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,680
entire line of gravity in a different
direction then his base of support is

424
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:20,690
direction then his base of support is
 

425
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,040
direction then his base of support is
going an acceleration is his line of

426
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,050
going an acceleration is his line of
 

427
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,350
going an acceleration is his line of
gravity and his base of support are

428
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:26,360
gravity and his base of support are
 

429
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,930
gravity and his base of support are
traveling in the same direction but the

430
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:28,940
traveling in the same direction but the
 

431
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,900
traveling in the same direction but the
line of gravity is traveling faster okay

432
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:31,910
line of gravity is traveling faster okay
 

433
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,569
line of gravity is traveling faster okay
that is entirely based upon his

434
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:34,579
that is entirely based upon his
 

435
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:38,889
that is entirely based upon his
athleticism if he's athletic enough he

436
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:38,899
athleticism if he's athletic enough he
 

437
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:40,540
athleticism if he's athletic enough he
will be able to get his base of support

438
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:40,550
will be able to get his base of support
 

439
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,600
will be able to get his base of support
under him or if he's skilled enough

440
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:43,610
under him or if he's skilled enough
 

441
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,980
under him or if he's skilled enough
he'll be able to roll with that he turns

442
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:47,990
he'll be able to roll with that he turns
 

443
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,560
he'll be able to roll with that he turns
that whole process upside down and now

444
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:50,570
that whole process upside down and now
 

445
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,620
that whole process upside down and now
he can't accelerate me okay so the

446
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:53,630
he can't accelerate me okay so the
 

447
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,920
he can't accelerate me okay so the
example is the one I just gave so here I

448
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:56,930
example is the one I just gave so here I
 

449
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,340
example is the one I just gave so here I
go I'm gonna do nimi Naga and I'm going

450
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:00,350
go I'm gonna do nimi Naga and I'm going
 

451
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,540
go I'm gonna do nimi Naga and I'm going
to basically have this kind of

452
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:03,550
to basically have this kind of
 

453
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:10,300
to basically have this kind of
acceleration you see and if you got leg

454
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:10,310
acceleration you see and if you got leg
 

455
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:16,020
acceleration you see and if you got leg
enough you can get back on

456
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,030

 

457
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,660

so the same thing here which means I'm

458
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:18,670
so the same thing here which means I'm
 

459
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,580
so the same thing here which means I'm
gonna make everything go that way by

460
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:20,590
gonna make everything go that way by
 

461
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:33,560
gonna make everything go that way by
entry angle school in that way hold on

462
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:33,570

 

463
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:39,330

so we don't want to accelerate him we

464
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:39,340
so we don't want to accelerate him we
 

465
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:44,190
so we don't want to accelerate him we
just want to deconstruct his posture so

466
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:44,200
just want to deconstruct his posture so
 

467
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,890
just want to deconstruct his posture so
his line of gravity goes one way his

468
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:46,900
his line of gravity goes one way his
 

469
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:53,510
his line of gravity goes one way his
space is support goes the other way

470
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:53,520

 

471
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,910

so if he holds on and we do the same

472
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:56,920
so if he holds on and we do the same
 

473
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,080
so if he holds on and we do the same
thing right

474
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,090
thing right
 

475
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,770
thing right
OOP there's no face you see that there's

476
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:01,780
OOP there's no face you see that there's
 

477
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,939
OOP there's no face you see that there's
note there's no residual momentum I got

478
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:05,949
note there's no residual momentum I got
 

479
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:09,179
note there's no residual momentum I got
a deal with in he because he held on you

480
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:09,189
a deal with in he because he held on you
 

481
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:13,760
a deal with in he because he held on you
can ends up right where my strikes are

482
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:13,770
can ends up right where my strikes are
 

483
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,290
