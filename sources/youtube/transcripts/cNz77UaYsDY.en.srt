00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,480
understanding IQ no Marshall context
part three so in the latter videos we

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:13,490
part three so in the latter videos we
 

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,209
part three so in the latter videos we
had talked about what Marshall context

6
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:16,219
had talked about what Marshall context
 

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,099
had talked about what Marshall context
is so it's the situation you're going to

8
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:18,109
is so it's the situation you're going to
 

9
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,310
is so it's the situation you're going to
be using your Marshall ardian how there

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:21,320
be using your Marshall ardian how there
 

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,050
be using your Marshall ardian how there

right so there's situations involving
weapons there's unarmed situations

00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:26,510
weapons there's unarmed situations
 

17
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,570
weapons there's unarmed situations
there's multiple attackers situations

18
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:28,580
there's multiple attackers situations
 

19
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,070
there's multiple attackers situations
different environments to be fighting in

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,560
different environments to be fighting in
many many different contexts in which

many many different contexts in which
 

23
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,139
many many different contexts in which
you can possibly be using the word

24
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:35,149
you can possibly be using the word
 

25
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:36,670
you can possibly be using the word
martial art to describe a system form

26

00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:46,689
we say the word martial art to be
describing a one-on-one unarmed

conflict and this context and showing
 

45
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:01,930
conflict and this context and showing
that we really have kind of figured out

46
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:01,940
that we really have kind of figured out
 

47
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,079
that we really have kind of figured out
the most important parts to this context

48
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:05,089
the most important parts to this context
 

49
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:07,660
the most important parts to this context
so for the unarmed one-on-one context

50
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:07,670
so for the unarmed one-on-one context
 

51
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,430
so for the unarmed one-on-one context
all the things that are going to work

52
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:09,440
all the things that are going to work
 

53
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,770
all the things that are going to work
the best in MMA is no doubt one of the

54
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:11,780
the best in MMA is no doubt one of the
 

55
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,350
the best in MMA is no doubt one of the
best avenues to take to study that right

56
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:14,360
best avenues to take to study that right
 

57
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,440
best avenues to take to study that right
now but there are other contexts and MMA

58
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:17,450
now but there are other contexts and MMA
 

59
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,960
now but there are other contexts and MMA
hasn't helped us understand these other

60
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:19,970
hasn't helped us understand these other
 

61
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,870
hasn't helped us understand these other
contexts so for example whatever may did

62
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
contexts so for example whatever may did
 

63
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,390
contexts so for example whatever may did
within the realm of unarmed one-on-one

64
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:25,400
within the realm of unarmed one-on-one
 

65
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,190
within the realm of unarmed one-on-one
it helped us figure out some of the sub

66
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
it helped us figure out some of the sub
 

67
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,380
it helped us figure out some of the sub
contexts right so what happens when a

68
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,390
contexts right so what happens when a
 

69
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,600
contexts right so what happens when a
kickboxer versus a regular boxer is

70
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:31,610
kickboxer versus a regular boxer is
 

71
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,880
kickboxer versus a regular boxer is
punching so important that a kickboxer

72
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:33,890
punching so important that a kickboxer
 

73
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,260
punching so important that a kickboxer
really doesn't have a big advantage or

really doesn't have a big advantage or
 

75
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,270
really doesn't have a big advantage or
does the kickboxer have such an

advantage with kicking that he's able to

00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,860
advantage with kicking that he's able to
beat the the regular boxer up and in

00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,450
beat the the regular boxer up and in
questions like this have been answered

82
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:43,460
questions like this have been answered
 

83
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,540
questions like this have been answered
for us by MMA within that that context

84
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:46,550
for us by MMA within that that context
 

85
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,550
for us by MMA within that that context
on our one-on-one MMA has done a great

86
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
on our one-on-one MMA has done a great
 

87
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,830
on our one-on-one MMA has done a great
job of figuring that out for us what

88
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:50,840
job of figuring that out for us what
 

89
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,500
job of figuring that out for us what
what's important invalid however there

90
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:53,510
what's important invalid however there
 

91
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,570
what's important invalid however there
are other contexts so for example when

92
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:55,580
are other contexts so for example when
 

93
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,630
are other contexts so for example when
someone has a sword MMA hasn't told us a

94
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
someone has a sword MMA hasn't told us a
 

95
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,550
someone has a sword MMA hasn't told us a
lot to do with someone with a sword or

96
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
lot to do with someone with a sword or
 

97
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,620
lot to do with someone with a sword or
was someone with a gun or if you're

98
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:02,630
was someone with a gun or if you're
 

99
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,600
was someone with a gun or if you're
fighting in a crazy situation in the

100
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:04,610
fighting in a crazy situation in the
 

101
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,969
fighting in a crazy situation in the
dark or if you're fighting in the cold

102
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:06,979
dark or if you're fighting in the cold
 

103
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,889
dark or if you're fighting in the cold
or if you're fighting and someone comes

104
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:08,899
or if you're fighting and someone comes
 

105
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,270
or if you're fighting and someone comes
out behind you need and expect the

out behind you need and expect the
 

107
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,250
out behind you need and expect the
person to be there in uncontrolled

108

person to be there in uncontrolled
 

109
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,259
person to be there in uncontrolled
situations MMA hasn't done a great job

110
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:14,269
situations MMA hasn't done a great job
 

111
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:17,140
situations MMA hasn't done a great job
of helping us understand them better

112
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,150
of helping us understand them better
 

113
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,319
of helping us understand them better
I you know has a context that I believe

114
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:20,329
I you know has a context that I believe
 

115
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:22,390
I you know has a context that I believe
I cure does a great job of explaining to

116
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
I cure does a great job of explaining to
 

117
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,500
I cure does a great job of explaining to
us and telling us the techniques we're

118
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:23,510
us and telling us the techniques we're
 

119
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,140
us and telling us the techniques we're
going to need for this context is to

120
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,150
going to need for this context is to
 

121
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,380
going to need for this context is to
part its multiple attacker and weapon

122
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,390
part its multiple attacker and weapon
 

123
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,809
part its multiple attacker and weapon
oriented so weapon oriented means that

124
00:02:31,809 --> 00:02:31,819
oriented so weapon oriented means that
 

125
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,780
oriented so weapon oriented means that
it could be I'm armed or you're armed or

126
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:34,790
it could be I'm armed or you're armed or
 

127
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,229
it could be I'm armed or you're armed or
both armed it could and multiple

128
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
both armed it could and multiple
 

129
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,869
both armed it could and multiple
attackers means there were always

130
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:39,879
attackers means there were always
 

131
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,559
attackers means there were always
suspecting that there's going to be

132
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:41,569
suspecting that there's going to be
 

133
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,300
suspecting that there's going to be
another person involved so we're never

134
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,310
another person involved so we're never
 

135
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,309
another person involved so we're never
just focusing in on one person and it

136
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:45,319
just focusing in on one person and it
 

137
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:49,960
just focusing in on one person and it
being just just us in them so looking at

138
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:49,970
being just just us in them so looking at
 

139
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,000
being just just us in them so looking at
this context vs MMA you can see these

140
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,010
this context vs MMA you can see these
 

141
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,289
this context vs MMA you can see these
are these are dramatically different

142
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:53,299
are these are dramatically different
 

143
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,879
are these are dramatically different
contexts in fact they're kind of

144
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:54,889
contexts in fact they're kind of
 

145
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:57,879
contexts in fact they're kind of
opposite in every way one on one unarmed

146
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:57,889
opposite in every way one on one unarmed
 

147
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:02,199
opposite in every way one on one unarmed
is exactly the opposite of armed or

148
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:02,209
is exactly the opposite of armed or
 

149
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,330
is exactly the opposite of armed or
weapon oriented and multiple attackers

150
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:04,340
weapon oriented and multiple attackers
 

151
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,210
weapon oriented and multiple attackers
so you can't expect one context to

152
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:07,220
so you can't expect one context to
 

153
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,099
so you can't expect one context to
answer questions about the other so I

154
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:09,109
answer questions about the other so I
 

155
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:10,690
answer questions about the other so I
kiddo being a martial art that's very

156
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:10,700
kiddo being a martial art that's very
 

157
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,039
kiddo being a martial art that's very
focused on armed multiple attackers

158
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,049
focused on armed multiple attackers
 

159
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:18,879
focused on armed multiple attackers
situations is going to do miserably in a

160
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:18,889
situations is going to do miserably in a
 

161
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:21,189
situations is going to do miserably in a
situation where there's just one person

162
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:21,199
situation where there's just one person
 

163
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,750
situation where there's just one person
and we're unarmed now it might seem at

164
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:22,760
and we're unarmed now it might seem at
 

165
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,059
and we're unarmed now it might seem at
first like that's not true because you

166
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:25,069
first like that's not true because you
 

167
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,680
first like that's not true because you
might say well if you can beat up

168
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:26,690
might say well if you can beat up
 

169
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,379
might say well if you can beat up
multiple people while they're armed then

170
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:29,389
multiple people while they're armed then
 

171
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:30,729
multiple people while they're armed then
how come you can't deal with one person

172
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:30,739
how come you can't deal with one person
 

173
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,530
how come you can't deal with one person
one-on-one and that is a way of looking

174
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:32,540
one-on-one and that is a way of looking
 

175
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,229
one-on-one and that is a way of looking
at it but kind of a fallacious way of

176
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:35,239
at it but kind of a fallacious way of
 

177
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,689
at it but kind of a fallacious way of
looking at it there are specifics about

178
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:37,699
looking at it there are specifics about
 

179
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:39,789
looking at it there are specifics about
the situations that will change what's

180
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:39,799
the situations that will change what's
 

181
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,680
the situations that will change what's
going on so for example when I'm

182
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:41,690
going on so for example when I'm
 

183
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,170
going on so for example when I'm
specifically trying to compete against a

184
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:44,180
specifically trying to compete against a
 

185
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,000
specifically trying to compete against a
person that's very different than trying

186
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,010
person that's very different than trying
 

187
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,800
person that's very different than trying
to survive a situation so if I'm gonna

188
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:47,810
to survive a situation so if I'm gonna
 

189
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,599
to survive a situation so if I'm gonna
give em a ring with somebody and my

190
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:49,609
give em a ring with somebody and my
 

191
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,520
give em a ring with somebody and my
solution is to just keep getting away

192
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:51,530
solution is to just keep getting away
 

193
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,990
solution is to just keep getting away
from them to keep moving away from them

194
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,000
from them to keep moving away from them
 

195
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,640
from them to keep moving away from them
so they can never do anything to me and

196
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:54,650
so they can never do anything to me and
 

197
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,080
so they can never do anything to me and
I'm not going to hurt them but I'm just

198
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,090
I'm not going to hurt them but I'm just
 

199
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,309
I'm not going to hurt them but I'm just
going to keep moving away I'm going to

200
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:57,319
going to keep moving away I'm going to
 

201
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,080
going to keep moving away I'm going to
lose the MMA match because I'm running

202
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,090
lose the MMA match because I'm running
 

203
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,099
lose the MMA match because I'm running
from the other person we're there to

204
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:00,109
from the other person we're there to
 

205
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,809
from the other person we're there to
compete where they're just physically

206
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:01,819
compete where they're just physically
 

207
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,640
compete where they're just physically
specifically compete over in a

208
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:03,650
specifically compete over in a
 

209
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,349
specifically compete over in a
life-or-death situation where I managed

210
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:05,359
life-or-death situation where I managed
 

211
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,149
life-or-death situation where I managed
to avoid someone had never get killed

212
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:07,159
to avoid someone had never get killed
 

213
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,039
to avoid someone had never get killed
that's a win for me it's a big victory

214
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,049
that's a win for me it's a big victory
 

215
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,819
that's a win for me it's a big victory
for me so understanding what the

216
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:12,829
for me so understanding what the
 

217
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:14,439
for me so understanding what the
differences are and why those

218
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:14,449
differences are and why those
 

219
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:16,270
differences are and why those
differences are important is the first

220
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:16,280
differences are important is the first
 

221
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,360
differences are important is the first
key to understanding I kido and what's

222
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,370
key to understanding I kido and what's
 

223
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,250
key to understanding I kido and what's
important about it so we're going to

224
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:21,260
important about it so we're going to
 

225
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,560
important about it so we're going to
make one more addition to this the next

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:23,570
make one more addition to this the next
 

227
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,159
make one more addition to this the next
video is going to cover what the

video is going to cover what the
 

229
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:29,140
video is going to cover what the
specifics are and why you can see that I

00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,150
specifics are and why you can see that I
