00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:23,450
dealing with silver you have in
front of you okay so when you do your

170
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:23,460
front of you okay so when you do your
 

171
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,959
front of you okay so when you do your
technique you push on that elbow okay

172
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:26,969
technique you push on that elbow okay
 

173
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:33,939
technique you push on that elbow okay
and if I just come in whoa

174
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:33,949

 

175
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:36,829

so which way to my average you want to

176
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:36,839
so which way to my average you want to
 

177
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,769
so which way to my average you want to
go it want to go backwards you see that

178
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:39,779
go it want to go backwards you see that
 

179
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,689
go it want to go backwards you see that
so that's where you should let the

180
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:41,699
so that's where you should let the
 

181
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:43,850
so that's where you should let the
energy here but you're trying to push it

182
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:43,860
energy here but you're trying to push it
 

183
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,639
energy here but you're trying to push it
and only the only problem is with that

184
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:46,649
and only the only problem is with that
 

185
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:51,319
and only the only problem is with that
just what yeah you yeah exactly

186
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:51,329
just what yeah you yeah exactly
 

187
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:53,210
just what yeah you yeah exactly
or maybe she's violating you can be

188
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:53,220
or maybe she's violating you can be
 

189
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,800
or maybe she's violating you can be
rules and it's going like this yeah you

190
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:57,810
rules and it's going like this yeah you
 

191
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,900
rules and it's going like this yeah you
see that difference you weren't told to

192
00:08:59,900 --> 00:08:59,910
see that difference you weren't told to
 

193
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,350
see that difference you weren't told to
do that you're just totally coming in

194
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
do that you're just totally coming in
 

195
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,920
do that you're just totally coming in
and keep my Center didn't matter change

196
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:06,930
and keep my Center didn't matter change
 

197
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:15,129
and keep my Center didn't matter change
whoa do you understand so he's coming in

198
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:15,139
whoa do you understand so he's coming in
 

199
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:19,220
whoa do you understand so he's coming in
it's ever so slight this is how we start

200
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:19,230
it's ever so slight this is how we start
 

201
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,800
it's ever so slight this is how we start
with the classes you think you're doing

202
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:21,810
with the classes you think you're doing
 

203
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,920
with the classes you think you're doing
it but you're not it's ever so slightly

204
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:24,930
it but you're not it's ever so slightly
 

205
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,460
it but you're not it's ever so slightly
you are resisting so when I give you a

206
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:28,470
you are resisting so when I give you a
 

207
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,680
you are resisting so when I give you a
different technique that needs that

208
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:30,690
different technique that needs that
 

209
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,620
different technique that needs that
requires no resist there's no forward

210
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:33,630
requires no resist there's no forward
 

211
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,980
requires no resist there's no forward
progress hence you can't do it okay so

212
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:36,990
progress hence you can't do it okay so
 

213
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,059
progress hence you can't do it okay so
here's your tiny bit of resistance here

214
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:41,069
here's your tiny bit of resistance here
 

215
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:45,800
here's your tiny bit of resistance here
your body you try to push this you still

216
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:45,810
your body you try to push this you still
 

217
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,220
your body you try to push this you still
aren't having him up go around your hip

218
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:48,230
aren't having him up go around your hip
 

219
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,860
aren't having him up go around your hip
but you have it on the forward he goes

220
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:51,870
but you have it on the forward he goes
 

221
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,519
but you have it on the forward he goes
forward here and then you're doing that

222
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:55,529
forward here and then you're doing that
 

223
00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:01,040
forward here and then you're doing that
you see that and what I'm doing is this

224
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,050
you see that and what I'm doing is this
 

225
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,750
you see that and what I'm doing is this
elbows going this way USBC that

226
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
elbows going this way USBC that
 

227
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,199
elbows going this way USBC that
different so that's where it is is as

228
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:09,209
different so that's where it is is as
 

229
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:13,720
different so that's where it is is as
you move this elbow market as a

230
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:13,730
you move this elbow market as a
 

231
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:21,730
you move this elbow market as a
nice face you move it forward his elbow

232
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:21,740
nice face you move it forward his elbow
 

233
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:28,930
nice face you move it forward his elbow
keeps going around me so that hence I

234
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:28,940
keeps going around me so that hence I
 

235
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,699
keeps going around me so that hence I
can do this technique you see you get it

236
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:33,709
can do this technique you see you get it
 

237
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:37,720
can do this technique you see you get it
so I want you to focus on the elbow it

238
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:37,730
so I want you to focus on the elbow it
 

239
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,350
so I want you to focus on the elbow it
cannot go forward in space that's going

240
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
cannot go forward in space that's going
 

241
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,230
cannot go forward in space that's going
to be a clash that you tend to get away

242
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
to be a clash that you tend to get away
 

243
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,280
to be a clash that you tend to get away
with because who gets turn turn

244
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,290
with because who gets turn turn
 

245
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,720
with because who gets turn turn
do you see and yet you get up or you're

246
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:52,730
do you see and yet you get up or you're
 

247
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,240
do you see and yet you get up or you're
stronger than you do can I just

248
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,250
stronger than you do can I just
 

249
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,110
stronger than you do can I just
technique is elbow keeps going around me

250
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:58,120
technique is elbow keeps going around me
 

251
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,550
technique is elbow keeps going around me
poom ok so we're working on that one

252
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
poom ok so we're working on that one
 

253
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:11,930
poom ok so we're working on that one
don't let the elbow go forward go

254
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:11,940

 

255
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:33,009

get it on your head

256
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:33,019

 

257
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:44,320

on your head

258
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,330

 

259
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,270

your your hit your arm is the Astra

260
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,280
your your hit your arm is the Astra
 

261
00:11:47,280 --> 00:12:00,700
your your hit your arm is the Astra
sauce goes right to your hip better

262
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:00,710

 

263
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:16,250

so you see you want to push him don't

264
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,260
so you see you want to push him don't
 

265
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:27,460
so you see you want to push him don't
need that extra step

266
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:27,470

 

267
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,300

that's different pattern so if I change

268
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:31,310
that's different pattern so if I change
 

269
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,329
that's different pattern so if I change
the pattern it's because I'm not doing

270
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:34,339
the pattern it's because I'm not doing
 

271
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:36,490
the pattern it's because I'm not doing
the right Union young reconciliations

272
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:36,500
the right Union young reconciliations
 

273
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:57,309
the right Union young reconciliations
okay you have to let her pass you that's

274
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:57,319
okay you have to let her pass you that's
 

275
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:03,189
okay you have to let her pass you that's
not the pattern and the elbow does not

276
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:03,199
not the pattern and the elbow does not
 

277
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:10,250
not the pattern and the elbow does not
come back forward

278
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:10,260

 

279
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,370

right on your head make it tight let's

280
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:13,380
right on your head make it tight let's
 

281
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:22,310
right on your head make it tight let's
marshal it up right nope nope nope

282
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
marshal it up right nope nope nope
 

283
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,320
marshal it up right nope nope nope
switch roles

284
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,330

 

285
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,810

well you've changing the pattern you

286
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:29,820
well you've changing the pattern you
 

287
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:42,080
well you've changing the pattern you
have the wrong footwork

288
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,090

 

289
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,280

all the bass was weak so the elbows yen

290
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:46,290
all the bass was weak so the elbows yen
 

291
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,340
all the bass was weak so the elbows yen
but your bass is young so that's part of

292
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,350
but your bass is young so that's part of
 

293
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,490
but your bass is young so that's part of
the coordination right so you know

294
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:52,500
the coordination right so you know
 

295
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,340
the coordination right so you know
that's the problems like oh if I relax I

296
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:55,350
that's the problems like oh if I relax I
 

297
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,660
that's the problems like oh if I relax I
get mushy no no we don't yen's not mushy

298
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:58,670
get mushy no no we don't yen's not mushy
 

299
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:07,510
get mushy no no we don't yen's not mushy
okay go

300
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:07,520

 

301
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:19,470

lock it up so again

302
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:19,480

 

303
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,020

that's why I want you to marshal up your

304
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,030
that's why I want you to marshal up your
 

305
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,540
that's why I want you to marshal up your
yen is I'll go to sleep I'm gonna go to

306
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:24,550
yen is I'll go to sleep I'm gonna go to
 

307
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:30,030
yen is I'll go to sleep I'm gonna go to
I'm gonna go Mimi no well look at your

308
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,040
I'm gonna go Mimi no well look at your
 

309
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,780
I'm gonna go Mimi no well look at your
knee caving in and it's very important

310
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:36,790
knee caving in and it's very important
 

311
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,820
knee caving in and it's very important
that you kid doesn't start dancing for

312
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:38,830
that you kid doesn't start dancing for
 

313
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:46,910
that you kid doesn't start dancing for
us so your your elbow hand got jammed

314
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:46,920
us so your your elbow hand got jammed
 

315
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,410
us so your your elbow hand got jammed
well just because you're pressing on

316
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:49,420
well just because you're pressing on
 

317
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,220
well just because you're pressing on
your elbow

318
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,230
your elbow
 

319
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:57,990
your elbow
let it go by you so you don't have the

320
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
let it go by you so you don't have the
 

321
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,810
let it go by you so you don't have the
pattern so if you go off the pattern

322
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:00,820
pattern so if you go off the pattern
 

323
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,790
pattern so if you go off the pattern
then when we put this back in the

324
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:02,800
then when we put this back in the
 

325
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,710
then when we put this back in the
technique you're gonna be further away

326
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720
technique you're gonna be further away
 

327
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,210
technique you're gonna be further away
from the technique

328
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,220

 

329
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,290

don't push it forward bring it around

330

let's do this kind of warrior pose right

348
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:56,140
let's do this kind of warrior pose right
 

349
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,730
let's do this kind of warrior pose right
here you see that now I'm going to just

350
00:15:59,730 --> 00:15:59,740
here you see that now I'm going to just
 

351
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,660
here you see that now I'm going to just
do the obvious push his leg out you see

352
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:03,670
do the obvious push his leg out you see
 

353
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,720
do the obvious push his leg out you see
that you guys see that okay let's just

354
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:06,730
that you guys see that okay let's just
 

355
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,270
that you guys see that okay let's just
first look at the body naturally you can

356
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:09,280
first look at the body naturally you can
 

357
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,300
first look at the body naturally you can
relax right and you don't hold your

358
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,310
relax right and you don't hold your
 

359
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:18,439
relax right and you don't hold your
balance just left

360
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:18,449

 

361
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:24,030

yep okay so the body when you do this in

362
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,040
yep okay so the body when you do this in
 

363
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,759
yep okay so the body when you do this in
this center of gravity he's heavy on

364
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:26,769
this center of gravity he's heavy on
 

365
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:29,550
this center of gravity he's heavy on
this side and the body wants to go that

366
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:29,560
this side and the body wants to go that
 

367
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,540
this side and the body wants to go that
way that's right

368
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:32,550
way that's right
 

369
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,220
way that's right
when you came this way you lean this

370
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:35,230
when you came this way you lean this
 

371
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,470
when you came this way you lean this
that way do you understand

372
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:37,480
that way do you understand
 

373
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,309
that way do you understand
don't leave it just hang out lift it

374
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:40,319
don't leave it just hang out lift it
 

375
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:43,319
don't leave it just hang out lift it
just hang out do you see who wants to do

376
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:43,329
just hang out do you see who wants to do
 

377
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:43,800
just hang out do you see who wants to do
that

378
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:43,810
that
 

379
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,090
that
that is all I exaggerated when you share

380
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,100
that is all I exaggerated when you share
 

381
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,550
that is all I exaggerated when you share
and I did this he wants to do that this

382
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:53,560
and I did this he wants to do that this
 

383
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,910
and I did this he wants to do that this
come back this is gonna take strength

384
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:56,920
come back this is gonna take strength
 

385
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,840
come back this is gonna take strength
hmm see that difference okay so what

386
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:00,850
hmm see that difference okay so what
 

387
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,319
hmm see that difference okay so what
happens when his body comes in and I

388
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:04,329
happens when his body comes in and I
 

389
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:09,120
happens when his body comes in and I
stop his elbow the leg came up and then

390
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,130
stop his elbow the leg came up and then
 

391
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,049
stop his elbow the leg came up and then
when I do this with his body look he's

392
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:13,059
when I do this with his body look he's
 

393
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:15,390
when I do this with his body look he's
going into it you see he's going into

394
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:15,400
going into it you see he's going into
 

395
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,220
going into it you see he's going into
that balance do you understand

396
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,230
that balance do you understand
 

397
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,460
that balance do you understand
so I don't have to do this technique

398
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,470
so I don't have to do this technique
 

399
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,890
so I don't have to do this technique
like that I just have to set up that

400
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:27,900
like that I just have to set up that
 

401
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,980
like that I just have to set up that
Kazushi because I'm here so you can't

402
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:31,990
Kazushi because I'm here so you can't
 

403
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,820
Kazushi because I'm here so you can't
come the other way

404
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:32,830
come the other way
 

405
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,610
come the other way
and his inertia was going that way and

406
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:35,620
and his inertia was going that way and
 

407
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,039
and his inertia was going that way and
I'm just turning his head which would be

408
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:38,049
I'm just turning his head which would be
 

409
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:41,430
I'm just turning his head which would be
very much like making his foot go out do

410
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,440
very much like making his foot go out do
 

411
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,289
very much like making his foot go out do
you understand cuz if you watch this

412
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:43,299
you understand cuz if you watch this
 

413
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:47,430
you understand cuz if you watch this
head now when I push this this egg will

414
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
head now when I push this this egg will
 

415
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,279
head now when I push this this egg will
come towards me you see and that's all

416
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:50,289
come towards me you see and that's all
 

417
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:56,600
come towards me you see and that's all
I'm doing when I control his elbow here

418
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:56,610

 

419
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:02,510

so again you are taking him down I am

420

so again you are taking him down I am
 

421
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,180
so again you are taking him down I am
aiming at falling person do you see that

422
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,190
aiming at falling person do you see that
 

423
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,440

I'm using the energy inertia the

430
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
I'm using the energy inertia the
 

431
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,140
I'm using the energy inertia the
momentum of the gravity that's all I'm

432
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,150
momentum of the gravity that's all I'm
 

433

legs are being pinned by him do you
 

491
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,920
legs are being pinned by him do you
understand that so you can't step until
