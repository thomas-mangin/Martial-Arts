in this situation mike's grab both of my
shoulders from behind
i want to try simply to escape by
pulling free here
but he has a good grip on me so as i try
to do that he stays right with me i use
this moment to duck underneath both of
his arms so bind his arms together like
a giache nugget i step through
compromising his balance and finish him
one more time at speed
okay
