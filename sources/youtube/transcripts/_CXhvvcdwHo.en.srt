his grip is straight but when he does
 

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,910
his grip is straight but when he does
the push

42
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
the push
 

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,109
the push
i'm going to use that energy to get his

44
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
i'm going to use that energy to get his
 

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,270
i'm going to use that energy to get his
grip to change

46
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
grip to change
 

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,030
grip to change
you see and i'm now in in this thing

48
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,040
you see and i'm now in in this thing
 

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,109
you see and i'm now in in this thing
okay i'm moving here

50
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119

 

51
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,990

and once once i get that grip i make his

52
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
and once once i get that grip i make his
 

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,950
and once once i get that grip i make his
elbow go

54
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
elbow go
 

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,149
elbow go
under me you see his elbows underneath

56
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
under me you see his elbows underneath
 

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,350
under me you see his elbows underneath
and now i can get him

58
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
and now i can get him
 

59
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,310
and now i can get him
on his toes but it's not that i'm going

60
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
on his toes but it's not that i'm going
 

61
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,350
on his toes but it's not that i'm going
like that i'm just using the ground path

62
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
like that i'm just using the ground path
 

63
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,309
like that i'm just using the ground path
you see it's over here

64
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
you see it's over here
 

65
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,190
you see it's over here
so he's coming in you're basically doing

66
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
so he's coming in you're basically doing
 

67
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,550
so he's coming in you're basically doing
this

68
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560

 

69
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,110

okay so once once you get him here he's

70
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
okay so once once you get him here he's
 

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,990
okay so once once you get him here he's
higher

72
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
higher
 

73
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,589
higher
he's not down and you're trying to

74
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
he's not down and you're trying to
 

75
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,030
he's not down and you're trying to
he's up here you see and

76
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
he's up here you see and
 

77
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,309
he's up here you see and
his energy is going this way

78
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
his energy is going this way
 

79
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,949
his energy is going this way
because that's the spiral so he's going

80
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
because that's the spiral so he's going
 

81
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:33,830
because that's the spiral so he's going
that way

82
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
that way
 

83
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,830
that way
that's the way i go and then

84
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840

 

85
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,550

doing the push i yield change the grip

86
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
doing the push i yield change the grip
 

87
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,550
doing the push i yield change the grip
he's going that way i keep him going

88
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
he's going that way i keep him going
 

89
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,430
he's going that way i keep him going
that way

90
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
that way
 

91
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:56,470
that way
with the lock and now with my head

92
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480

 

93
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,390

this would be wrong

94
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400

 

95
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,670

nothing until now

96
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
nothing until now
 

97
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:24,030
nothing until now
warm up

98
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,040

 

99
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,040

okay
