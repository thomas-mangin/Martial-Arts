1
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:18,260

and again start from the 10 we're going

2
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,270
and again start from the 10 we're going
 

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:30,060
and again start from the 10 we're going
to add the hand

4
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,070

 

5
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:59,830

so living through get to the black here

6
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840

 

7
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:35,830

[Music]

8
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840

 

9
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,520

so which way should is inertia P go over

10
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:42,530
so which way should is inertia P go over
 

11
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,060
so which way should is inertia P go over
so if I'm turning them in place I have

12
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,070
so if I'm turning them in place I have
 

13
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,810
so if I'm turning them in place I have
to solve them so if I go like this you

14
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:53,820
to solve them so if I go like this you
 

15
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,660
to solve them so if I go like this you
see yeah it stopped but if I keep him

16
00:01:59,660 --> 00:01:59,670
see yeah it stopped but if I keep him
 

17
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,580
see yeah it stopped but if I keep him
going forward now I'm pulling against it

18
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:04,590
going forward now I'm pulling against it
 

19
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,359
going forward now I'm pulling against it
so when I turn I keep him going into

20
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:08,369
so when I turn I keep him going into
 

21
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,830
so when I turn I keep him going into
this model but he's never pulling away

22
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:12,840
this model but he's never pulling away
 

23
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,100
this model but he's never pulling away
from me but he's going forward okay so I

24
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,110
from me but he's going forward okay so I
 

25
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,039
from me but he's going forward okay so I
don't want to come here and then turn

26
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:22,049
don't want to come here and then turn
 

27
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:24,590
don't want to come here and then turn
you on that leg because that's where

28
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:24,600
you on that leg because that's where
 

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,150
you on that leg because that's where
this thing got in the clocks me or stabs

30
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,160
this thing got in the clocks me or stabs
 

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,250
this thing got in the clocks me or stabs
me but I hated you go forward I'm going

32
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:34,260
me but I hated you go forward I'm going
 

33
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,199
me but I hated you go forward I'm going
to use a spiral to do this

34
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:36,209
to use a spiral to do this
 

35
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:43,420
to use a spiral to do this
you see these keeps going forward boom

36
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:43,430

 

37
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:54,460

then that is very much like just take me

38
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:54,470

 

39
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:04,640

so use the spider would when he takes

40
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:04,650
so use the spider would when he takes
 

41
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,509
so use the spider would when he takes
that step all I do is hold the on

42
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:08,519
that step all I do is hold the on
 

43
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:17,449
that step all I do is hold the on
position here is inertia makes the ball

44
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:17,459

 

45
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,540

here he goes whoa hold it just hold it

46
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:21,550
here he goes whoa hold it just hold it
 

47
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:37,059
here he goes whoa hold it just hold it
here inside

48
00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:37,069

 

49
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:44,330

you will lose more of the Kazushi the

50
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:44,340
you will lose more of the Kazushi the
 

51
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,370
you will lose more of the Kazushi the
further you are from this line or the

52
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:49,380
further you are from this line or the
 

53
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,250
further you are from this line or the
less you connect from where you're

54
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:52,260
less you connect from where you're
 

55
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,729
less you connect from where you're
touching to the center you understand

56
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:55,739
touching to the center you understand
 

57
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,059
touching to the center you understand
these two things so depending on their

58
00:03:59,059 --> 00:03:59,069
these two things so depending on their
 

59
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,910
these two things so depending on their
skill level those are two things or

60
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
skill level those are two things or
 

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,589
skill level those are two things or
they're the same thing okay so when I

62
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
they're the same thing okay so when I
 

63
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,320
they're the same thing okay so when I
come up here on his wrist it's still on

64
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,330
come up here on his wrist it's still on
 

65
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,110
come up here on his wrist it's still on
this Center it's still on his Center no

66
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,120
this Center it's still on his Center no
 

67
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,979
this Center it's still on his Center no
me i affected his Center from where I'm

68
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:18,989
me i affected his Center from where I'm
 

69
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,659
me i affected his Center from where I'm
touching but as your skill level is down

70
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:22,669
touching but as your skill level is down
 

71
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,879
touching but as your skill level is down
you have moved further from the spine

72
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:25,889
you have moved further from the spine
 

73
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:27,740
you have moved further from the spine
and you can have what's lacking the

74
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:27,750
and you can have what's lacking the
 

75
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,540
and you can have what's lacking the
shoulder joint because you didn't carry

76
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:29,550
shoulder joint because you didn't carry
 

77
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,030
shoulder joint because you didn't carry
tension into there and he starts to turn

78
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,040
tension into there and he starts to turn
 

79
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,700
tension into there and he starts to turn
on you and here thumbs up lunge but yes

80
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:36,710
on you and here thumbs up lunge but yes
 

81
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,550
on you and here thumbs up lunge but yes
so it's a feeling that you're not that

82
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
so it's a feeling that you're not that
 

83
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,240
so it's a feeling that you're not that
high

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,250
high
 

85
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,800
high
I have to feel that from here I have his

86
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:45,810
I have to feel that from here I have his
 

87
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,990
I have to feel that from here I have his
Center no matter where I am in a circle

88
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,000

 

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,310

did I push it on his body boom boom and

90
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
did I push it on his body boom boom and
 

91
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,219
did I push it on his body boom boom and
again it's relaxed but can you push it

92
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:01,229
again it's relaxed but can you push it
 

93
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:04,969
again it's relaxed but can you push it
to me no he can't push it okay so we're

94
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:04,979
to me no he can't push it okay so we're
 

95
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:05,270
to me no he can't push it okay so we're
here

96
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
here
 

97
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,870
here

pushing whoa and then I use that same
 

101
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:19,239
pushing whoa and then I use that same
to take that corner out he continues

102
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:19,249
to take that corner out he continues
 

103
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:23,079

have him going around he has to first go
 

213
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,320
have him going around he has to first go
around then he can go out so you you add

214
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,330
around then he can go out so you you add
 

215
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,650
around then he can go out so you you add
