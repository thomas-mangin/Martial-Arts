more y than me then I will move to what
 

37
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,710
more y than me then I will move to what
I call relative Yin so you made me Yin

38

it will go relativ in okay so if you and

42
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:47,319
it will go relativ in okay so if you and
 

43
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,229
it will go relativ in okay so if you and
I stop him he's going to come in and we

44
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:51,239
I stop him he's going to come in and we
 

45
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,390
I stop him he's going to come in and we
just push him okay here he goes and we

46
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
just push him okay here he goes and we
 

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:17,470

49
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,509

we end up making him go that

50
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
we end up making him go that
 

51
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,030
we end up making him go that
way he ended up going that way okay does

52
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
way he ended up going that way okay does
 

53
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,390

that make sense well the takeaway here

54
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
that make sense well the takeaway here
 

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,229
that make sense well the takeaway here

exteral Superior y aspect and he will

66
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
exteral Superior y aspect and he will
 

67
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,750
exteral Superior y aspect and he will
get displaced okay so um meaning like

68
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:54,760
get displaced okay so um meaning like
 

69
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,069
get displaced okay so um meaning like
I'm here and I go like

75
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,869

displacement that means that

76
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
displacement that means that
 

77
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,309
displacement that means that
displacement is not actually what we're

78
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:07,319
displacement is not actually what we're
 

79
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,390

169
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,830
work on all of that
stuff but I will not work on

170
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:52,840
stuff but I will not work on
 

171
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,790
stuff but I will not work on
my natural sight

172
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
my natural sight

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,430
index without that Target there
the

176
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
the
 

177
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,150
the
target is making sure that I'm in one

target is making sure that I'm in one
 

179
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,589
target is making sure that I'm in one

place and one place only on my body over
 

181
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,189

here I could work I could move my grip

182
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
here I could work I could move my grip
 

183
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,350
here I could work I could move my grip
over here to my left that's not where my

184
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
over here to my left that's not where my
 

185
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,830
over here to my left that's not where my
sight index line is and I could work on

186
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
sight index line is and I could work on
 

187
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,270
sight index line is and I could work on
my trigger press but I'm not working on

188
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,280
my trigger press but I'm not working on
 

189
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,270
my trigger press but I'm not working on
my sight index line the target is

190
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
my sight index line the target is
 

191
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,830
my sight index line the target is
helping me work on the site index line

192
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:24,840
helping me work on the site index line
 

193
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,830
helping me work on the site index line
every time and when I make

194
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
every time and when I make
 

195
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,670
every time and when I make
it just a point Point as opposed to a

196
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:30,680
it just a point Point as opposed to a
 

197
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,990
it just a point Point as opposed to a
whole

198
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000
whole
 

199
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,869
whole
Target then that's what I'm working on

200
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:34,879
Target then that's what I'm working on
 

201
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,869
Target then that's what I'm working on
if I use the whole Target it almost

202
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:36,879
if I use the whole Target it almost
 

203
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,029
if I use the whole Target it almost
becomes like having no target okay and

204
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
becomes like having no target okay and
 

205
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,309
becomes like having no target okay and
it's not necessarily that I'm working on

206
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:43,319
it's not necessarily that I'm working on
 

207
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,670
it's not necessarily that I'm working on
accuracy cuz I'm just working on that

208
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
accuracy cuz I'm just working on that
 

209
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,909
accuracy cuz I'm just working on that
sight index line if I if I develop my

210
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:48,919
sight index line if I if I develop my
 

211
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,350
sight index line if I if I develop my
sight index line accuracy is the

212
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
sight index line accuracy is the
 

213
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,790
sight index line accuracy is the
consequence of it I don't I don't want

214
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:53,800
consequence of it I don't I don't want
 

215
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,909
consequence of it I don't I don't want
to be over here and aim my gun that's

216
00:07:58,909 --> 00:07:58,919
to be over here and aim my gun that's
 

217
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,510
to be over here and aim my gun that's
not com that effective I want to bring

218
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
not com that effective I want to bring
 

219
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,550
not com that effective I want to bring
and learn how to bring the gun to the

220
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:03,560
and learn how to bring the gun to the
 

221
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,830
and learn how to bring the gun to the
sight index line every single time so

222
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:06,840
sight index line every single time so
 

223
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,749
sight index line every single time so
just by staring at that little black

224
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:08,759
just by staring at that little black
 

225
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,029
just by staring at that little black
piece of tape bring the gun up the dot

226
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
piece of tape bring the gun up the dot
 

227
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,589
piece of tape bring the gun up the dot
is right on the black piece of tape okay

228
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:14,599
is right on the black piece of tape okay
 

229
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:16,070
is right on the black piece of tape okay
so I'm not

230
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
so I'm not
 

231
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,589
so I'm not
aiming per se in that training that

232
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:18,599
aiming per se in that training that
 

233
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:19,790
aiming per se in that training that
looks like

234
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:19,800
looks like
 

235
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,270
looks like
aiming same thing goes

236
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:22,280
aiming same thing goes
 

237
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,790
aiming same thing goes
here I'm not trying to just make him go

238
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:25,800
here I'm not trying to just make him go
 

239
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,790
here I'm not trying to just make him go
backwards that's not what I'm trying to

240
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:27,800
backwards that's not what I'm trying to
 

241
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,790
backwards that's not what I'm trying to
do but by set setting up the elements of

242
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800
do but by set setting up the elements of
 

243
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,310
do but by set setting up the elements of
the drill I set up the

244
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
the drill I set up the
 

245
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,430
the drill I set up the
crisis internal or external okay and

246
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:38,440
crisis internal or external okay and
 

247
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,110
crisis internal or external okay and
this is why I say it's not

248
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
this is why I say it's not
 

249
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,550
this is why I say it's not
important that he goes backwards it's

250
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:45,560
important that he goes backwards it's
 

251
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,750
important that he goes backwards it's
how are you making him go backwards okay

252
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:48,760
how are you making him go backwards okay
 

253
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,949
how are you making him go backwards okay
so as you'll see on the

254
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
so as you'll see on the
 

255
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,470
so as you'll see on the
video you're trying

256
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:53,480
video you're trying
 

257
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,990
video you're trying
to just get an

258
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
to just get an
 

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,670
to just get an
external displacement of him

260
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
external displacement of him
 

261
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,590
external displacement of him
and as you said you got pushed back on

262
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:02,600
and as you said you got pushed back on
 

263
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,790
and as you said you got pushed back on
your heels there was even one rep where

264
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:05,800
your heels there was even one rep where
 

265
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,630
your heels there was even one rep where
you didn't establish relative y to him

266
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
you didn't establish relative y to him
 

267
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,069
you didn't establish relative y to him
and you got relative Yin okay so you

268
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:12,079
and you got relative Yin okay so you
 

269
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:15,710
and you got relative Yin okay so you
have to make sure that this is going

270
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:15,720
have to make sure that this is going
 

271
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,269
have to make sure that this is going
in to your body and not just that you're

272
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:20,279
in to your body and not just that you're
 

273
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,150
in to your body and not just that you're
trying to push him okay so likewise

274
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
trying to push him okay so likewise
 

275
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,430
trying to push him okay so likewise
yesterday's video when we came here in

276
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,440
yesterday's video when we came here in
 

277
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,230
yesterday's video when we came here in
all likelihood if you did an external

278
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
all likelihood if you did an external
 

279
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,470
all likelihood if you did an external
yield is because you had to and if you

280
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
yield is because you had to and if you
 

281
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,430
yield is because you had to and if you
had to you're probably doing an external

282
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:38,440
had to you're probably doing an external
 

283
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,269
had to you're probably doing an external
push there

284
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
push there
 

285
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,470
push there
okay if you can SE on

286
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:45,480
okay if you can SE on
 

287
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,430
okay if you can SE on
contact you can do an an internal push

288
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
contact you can do an an internal push
 

289
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,910
contact you can do an an internal push
so again I deviate and this is probably

290
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
so again I deviate and this is probably
 

291
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,790
so again I deviate and this is probably
this external displacement over a

292
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:57,800
this external displacement over a
 

293
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,949
this external displacement over a
totally inferior

294
00:09:59,949 --> 00:09:59,959
totally inferior
 

295
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:03,110
totally inferior
mechanical uh output that just can't do

296
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
mechanical uh output that just can't do
 

297
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,750
mechanical uh output that just can't do
it he's he's off balance and I move

298
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
it he's he's off balance and I move
 

299
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,069
it he's he's off balance and I move
inside his uh shaku angle you're going

300
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:09,079
inside his uh shaku angle you're going
 

301
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,790
inside his uh shaku angle you're going
to be able to push him but instead

302
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:11,800
to be able to push him but instead
 

303
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,550
to be able to push him but instead
there's a

304
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:13,560
there's a
 

305
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,350
there's a
seizure and uh that's different it looks

306
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
seizure and uh that's different it looks
 

307
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,150
seizure and uh that's different it looks
different the movement's different it

308
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,160
different the movement's different it
 

309
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,870
different the movement's different it
feels different and there's no chance of

310
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:21,880
feels different and there's no chance of
 

311
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,670
feels different and there's no chance of
me ever becoming uh relative y to him

312
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
me ever becoming uh relative y to him
 

313
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,710
me ever becoming uh relative y to him
it's just the more he comes in the more

314
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:27,720
it's just the more he comes in the more
 

315
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,069
it's just the more he comes in the more
it's internalized the more he's going to

316
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
it's internalized the more he's going to
 

317
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,069
it's internalized the more he's going to
go out so that's the how that we're

318
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
go out so that's the how that we're
 

319
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,269
go out so that's the how that we're
after not what happens to him how did I

320
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:36,279
after not what happens to him how did I
 

321
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,870
after not what happens to him how did I
make him Traverse the sagittal plane on

322
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
make him Traverse the sagittal plane on
 

323
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,949
make him Traverse the sagittal plane on
the map that's what we're doing okay all

324
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:41,959
the map that's what we're doing okay all
 

325
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,600
the map that's what we're doing okay all
right
