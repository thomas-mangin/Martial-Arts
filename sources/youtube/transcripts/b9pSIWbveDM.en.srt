00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,629

going back to an earlier video you have

2
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:12,639
going back to an earlier video you have
 

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,550
going back to an earlier video you have
to remember that that equal and opposite

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:15,560
to remember that that equal and opposite
 

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,710
to remember that that equal and opposite
angle or or

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:17,720
angle or or
 

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,390
angle or or
Force you don't want it to cut through

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
Force you don't want it to cut through
 

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,230
Force you don't want it to cut through
your your shikaku cuz you're going to

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,240
your your shikaku cuz you're going to
 

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,029
your your shikaku cuz you're going to
lose your

12
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:25,039
lose your
 

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,669
lose your
balance

14
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:26,679
balance
 

15
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:29,310
balance
or what usually happens is you won't

16
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:29,320
or what usually happens is you won't
 

17
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,470
or what usually happens is you won't
have the power to actually throw someone

18
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:31,480
have the power to actually throw someone
 

19
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,470
have the power to actually throw someone
because it's a choice between do I keep

20
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
because it's a choice between do I keep
 

21
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,549
because it's a choice between do I keep
applying pressure well if I do that

22
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:37,559
applying pressure well if I do that

equal an opposite energy is going to

24
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
equal an opposite energy is going to
 

25
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,350
equal an opposite energy is going to
make me lose my balance so what we tend

26
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,360
make me lose my balance so what we tend
 

27
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,389
make me lose my balance so what we tend
to do is start decreasing the throwing

28
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
to do is start decreasing the throwing
 

29
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,069
to do is start decreasing the throwing
energy and as a result you can't throw

30
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:47,079
energy and as a result you can't throw
 

31
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,150
energy and as a result you can't throw
bigger heavier people or resisting

32
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:49,160
bigger heavier people or resisting
 

33
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,430

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,630
make these circles with my feet that's
where you get into problems okay so we

42
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
where you get into problems okay so we
 

43
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,230
where you get into problems okay so we
know I'm going to

44
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
know I'm going to
 

45
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,510
know I'm going to
be uh some part of me it's usually the

46
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
be uh some part of me it's usually the
 

47
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,390
be uh some part of me it's usually the

and I have a foot here and then my
 

57
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:30,830
and I have a foot here and then my
spine's in the middle that doesn't work

okay you're double weighted and that

60
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:33,479
okay you're double weighted and that

okay and we know we have some lever of
 

71
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,709
okay and we know we have some lever of
some kind like usually the the UK's arm

72
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:49,719
some kind like usually the the UK's arm
 

73
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,789
some kind like usually the the UK's arm
and we know that we want that arm to

and we know that we want that arm to
 

75
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,109
and we know that we want that arm to
move on some sort of curve that's all

should be
oriented with that lever of the arm so

88
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,000
oriented with that lever of the arm so
 

89
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,190

you're going to get into problems as you
 

111
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,390
you're going to get into problems as you
try to move this lever around because

that equal and opposite energy is going
to cut through your shikaku we already

116
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
to cut through your shikaku we already

00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
we already made that video okay but

Rule and they'll point the center line

126
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
Rule and they'll point the center line
 

127
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,990
Rule and they'll point the center line
over this

128
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,000
over this
 

129
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,430
over this
way ahead of let's say I'm trying to

130
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
way ahead of let's say I'm trying to
 

131
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,550
way ahead of let's say I'm trying to
move this lever around this circle this

132
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
move this lever around this circle this
 

133
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,070
move this lever around this circle this
way they'll point it around here and

134
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
way they'll point it around here and
 

135
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,350
way they'll point it around here and
then they'll pull it into place okay

136
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
then they'll pull it into place okay
 

137
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,110
then they'll pull it into place okay
I'll give you an example of that so the

138
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,120
I'll give you an example of that so the
 

139
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,430
I'll give you an example of that so the
one we're working with is he's clenching

140
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
one we're working with is he's clenching
 

141
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,429
one we're working with is he's clenching
I was trying to do my ballistics on him

142
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:32,439
I was trying to do my ballistics on him
 

143
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:36,030
I was trying to do my ballistics on him
okay but he drove hard and there's a lot

144
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,040
okay but he drove hard and there's a lot
 

145
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,990
okay but he drove hard and there's a lot
of pressure on that arm

146
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,000
of pressure on that arm
 

147
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,509
of pressure on that arm
okay so what I'm going to do is pass it

148
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:42,519
okay so what I'm going to do is pass it
 

149
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,110
okay so what I'm going to do is pass it
and then take this throw here okay and

150
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
and then take this throw here okay and
 

151
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,710
and then take this throw here okay and
we know I'm going to make a circle and

152
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:49,720
we know I'm going to make a circle and
 

153
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,589
we know I'm going to make a circle and
generate some centrifugal energy and

154
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
generate some centrifugal energy and
 

155
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,670
generate some centrifugal energy and
then let him loose okay but a lot of

156
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:54,680
then let him loose okay but a lot of
 

157
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,990
then let him loose okay but a lot of
people will put their Center in the

158
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
people will put their Center in the
 

159
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,030
people will put their Center in the
middle of the axis of rotation where

160
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,040
middle of the axis of rotation where
 

161
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,949
middle of the axis of rotation where
they separate their feet and now the

162
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
they separate their feet and now the
 

163
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,030
they separate their feet and now the
center line is ahead of him and now they

164
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,040
center line is ahead of him and now they
 

165
