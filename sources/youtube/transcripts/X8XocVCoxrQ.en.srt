the so this these I adions where I make
 

87
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,070
the so this these I adions where I make
contact and slide down something and go

contact and slide down something and go
 

89
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,670
contact and slide down something and go
around it it's still mid-range

90
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
around it it's still mid-range
 

91
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,070
around it it's still mid-range

gra so in midrange grapping you have to

100
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:07,160
gra so in midrange grapping you have to
 

101
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,270
gra so in midrange grapping you have to
reach out and touch these

102
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:10,280
reach out and touch these
 

103
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,790

so and where where do I reach out I

110
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,280
so and where where do I reach out I
 

111
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,350
so and where where do I reach out I
reach out in the space so he has to go

112
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:26,360
reach out in the space so he has to go
 

113
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,589
reach out in the space so he has to go
slow and we have to watch his tip

114
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599

 

115
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,909

00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,670
missed is that I don't have the angle of
what we call an angle incidence I

1058
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:19,680
what we call an angle incidence I
 

1059
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,430
what we call an angle incidence I
establish the

1060
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:21,440
establish the
 

1061
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,589
establish the
cross and now there's no way I'm going

1062
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:23,599
cross and now there's no way I'm going
 

1063
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,870
cross and now there's no way I'm going
to miss so I make contact here

1064
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:27,880
to miss so I make contact here
 

1065
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,870
to miss so I make contact here
not over here that's a very small thing

1066
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:30,880
not over here that's a very small thing
 

1067
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,109
not over here that's a very small thing
to hit you see so I I go perpendicular

1068
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:35,119
to hit you see so I I go perpendicular
 

1069
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,230
to hit you see so I I go perpendicular
to the weapon system then I can always

1070
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:38,240
to the weapon system then I can always
 

1071
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,109
to the weapon system then I can always
hit so there's a perpendicular moment in

1072
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:42,119
hit so there's a perpendicular moment in
 

1073
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:45,510
hit so there's a perpendicular moment in
all of these techniques so perpendicular

1074
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:45,520
all of these techniques so perpendicular
 

1075
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,549
all of these techniques so perpendicular
then the

1076
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
then the
 

1077
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,789
then the
ru and he

1078
00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:48,799
ru and he
 

1079
00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:51,630
ru and he
goes I come

1080
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:51,640
goes I come
 

1081
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:58,270
goes I come
here and I am going to go around this

1082
00:53:58,270 --> 00:53:58,280
here and I am going to go around this
 

1083
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:04,230
here and I am going to go around this
there it is okay

1084
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:04,240

 

1085
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,270

drop so we're going to look for that

1086
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:09,280

 

1087
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:20,349

cross go around it

1088
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:20,359

 

1089
00:54:20,359 --> 00:54:21,950

down

1090
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:21,960
down
 

1091
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,190
down
cross down

1092
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:24,200
cross down
 

1093
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,510
cross down
it okay let's try that

1094
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:28,520

 

1095
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,390

your right hand is going to have to

1096
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:31,400
your right hand is going to have to
 

1097
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,030
your right hand is going to have to
move a little to the

1098
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:34,040
move a little to the
 

1099
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:39,349
move a little to the
left can't go from here back here it's

1100
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:39,359
left can't go from here back here it's
 

1101
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,950
left can't go from here back here it's
going to go this

1102
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:41,960
going to go this
 

1103
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,150
going to go this
way then from there it goes down right

1104
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:45,160
way then from there it goes down right
 

1105
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,190
way then from there it goes down right
okay let's

1106
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:48,200

 

1107
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,030

try for this Dr hold your sword out

1108
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:51,040
try for this Dr hold your sword out
 

1109
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,710
try for this Dr hold your sword out
there until they move your hands which

1110
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:52,720
there until they move your hands which
 

1111
00:54:52,720 --> 00:55:02,470
there until they move your hands which
is the right

1112
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:02,480

 

1113
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,710

change temp all

1114
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:04,720
change temp all
 

1115
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,710
change temp all
right okay we're going to make that

1116
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:07,720
right okay we're going to make that
 

1117
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,309
right okay we're going to make that
cross wait don't move it try not to move

1118
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:10,319
cross wait don't move it try not to move
 

1119
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,870
cross wait don't move it try not to move
it Just a Little Joe

1120
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:12,880
it Just a Little Joe
 

1121
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,470
it Just a Little Joe
game okay stay there now don't move it

1122
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:17,480
game okay stay there now don't move it
 

1123
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:25,309
game okay stay there now don't move it
just come down it boom underneath

1124

okay a little close
 

1157
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,950
okay a little close
good are you moving me and you're a

1158
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:29,960
good are you moving me and you're a
 

1159
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,750
good are you moving me and you're a
little closer let's Mo back

1160
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:31,760
little closer let's Mo back
 

1161
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,190
little closer let's Mo back
for okay back up top around it straight

1162
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:36,200
for okay back up top around it straight
 

1163
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,390
for okay back up top around it straight
down move me ever so slightly leave it

1164
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:39,400
down move me ever so slightly leave it
 

1165
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,270
down move me ever so slightly leave it
there in space go around it you move it

1166
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:43,280
there in space go around it you move it
 

1167
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,069
there in space go around it you move it
right there at the

1168
00:56:47,069 --> 00:56:47,079

 

1169
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:50,829

end yes there it is go down and you see

1170
00:56:50,829 --> 00:56:50,839
end yes there it is go down and you see
 

1171
00:56:50,839 --> 00:57:06,270
end yes there it is go down and you see
you're at my spot okay

1172
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:06,280

 

1173
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:16,360

that's where you move

1174
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:16,370

1179
00:57:53,960 --> 00:58:05,270

right you have to be careful this

1180
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:05,280

 

1181
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,430

two

00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:07,440
two
 

1183
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,190
two
okay when I'm here like this I can't

1184
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:11,200
okay when I'm here like this I can't
 

1185
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,349
okay when I'm here like this I can't
keep dropping in the

1186
00:58:13,349 --> 00:58:13,359
keep dropping in the
 

1187
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:17,069
keep dropping in the
perpendicular so I keep dropping i' come

1188
00:58:17,069 --> 00:58:17,079
perpendicular so I keep dropping i' come
 

1189
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:22,069
perpendicular so I keep dropping i' come
off if he keeps cutting it's too

1190
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:22,079
off if he keeps cutting it's too
 

1191
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,109
off if he keeps cutting it's too
low I only

1192
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:25,119
low I only
 

1193
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,430
low I only
drop to go around this

1194
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:28,440
drop to go around this
 

1195
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,190
drop to go around this
part as if this is happening you

1196
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:33,200
part as if this is happening you
 

1197
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,870
part as if this is happening you
see I don't want this whole transition

1198
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:36,880
see I don't want this whole transition
 

1199
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,029
see I don't want this whole transition
to happen somewhere down here so when

1200
00:58:40,029 --> 00:58:40,039
to happen somewhere down here so when
 

1201
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:43,190
to happen somewhere down here so when
it's there in

1202
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:43,200

 

1203
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:48,789

space I have if I don't

1204
00:58:48,789 --> 00:58:48,799

 

1205
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:51,950

lower I there's pressure right going

1206
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:51,960
lower I there's pressure right going
 

1207
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,789
lower I there's pressure right going
this way so I lower to take that lateral

1208
00:58:55,789 --> 00:58:55,799
this way so I lower to take that lateral
 

1209
00:58:55,799 --> 00:59:01,069
this way so I lower to take that lateral
pressure off but it's high when I do

1210
00:59:01,069 --> 00:59:01,079

 

1211
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,710

it let your sort of be relaxed and it

1212
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:03,720
it let your sort of be relaxed and it
 

1213
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,309
it let your sort of be relaxed and it
will follow you

1214
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:05,319
will follow you
 

1215
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:07,549
will follow you
down and it's

1216
00:59:07,549 --> 00:59:07,559
down and it's
 

1217
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:10,589
down and it's
too low you

1218
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:10,599
too low you
 

1219
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:14,829
too low you
see I lower to go around

1220
00:59:14,829 --> 00:59:14,839
see I lower to go around
 

1221
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:17,510
see I lower to go around

little close

1244
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:20,760

 

1245
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:39,750

not to move me

1246
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:39,760

 

1247
01:01:39,760 --> 01:02:03,549

go St

1248
01:02:03,549 --> 01:02:03,559

 

1249
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:17,029

y you're

1250
01:02:17,029 --> 01:02:17,039

 

1251
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:19,789

fine so have this little urge for then

1252
01:02:19,789 --> 01:02:19,799
fine so have this little urge for then
 

1253
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:22,029
fine so have this little urge for then
you catch yourself okay let go of the

1254
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:22,039
you catch yourself okay let go of the
 

1255
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:35,630
you catch yourself okay let go of the
urge and don't worry about catch

1256
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:35,640

 

1257
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,950

so that's why it's important that you're

1258
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:37,960
so that's why it's important that you're
 

1259
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,950
so that's why it's important that you're
out of that sword range because you

1260
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:40,960
out of that sword range because you
 

1261
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,829
out of that sword range because you
don't want to take it into you okay and

1262
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:43,839
don't want to take it into you okay and
 

1263
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:46,029
don't want to take it into you okay and
also like

1264
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:46,039
also like
 

1265
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:48,990
also like
my my

1266
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:49,000
my my
 

1267
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,870
my my
uh my overall

1268
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:51,880
uh my overall
 

1269
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,670
uh my overall
strategy he has a major advantage

1270
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:54,680
strategy he has a major advantage
 

1271
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,789
strategy he has a major advantage
because of the length of his

1272
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:56,799
because of the length of his
 

1273
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:00,269
because of the length of his
okay so my overall strategy is always

1274
01:03:00,269 --> 01:03:00,279
okay so my overall strategy is always
 

1275
01:03:00,279 --> 01:03:04,390
okay so my overall strategy is always
got to be close close as much as

1276
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:04,400
got to be close close as much as
 

1277
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,549
got to be close close as much as
possible and at least

1278
01:03:07,549 --> 01:03:07,559
possible and at least
 

1279
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:11,470
possible and at least
generate the Dilemma of closing okay

1280
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:11,480
generate the Dilemma of closing okay
 

1281
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,589
generate the Dilemma of closing okay
that I can try other long longer range

1282
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:14,599
that I can try other long longer range
 

1283
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:17,150
that I can try other long longer range
things okay that might surprise him

1284
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:17,160
things okay that might surprise him
 

1285
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,470
things okay that might surprise him
after he's used to and having to feel

1286
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:19,480
after he's used to and having to feel
 

1287
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,470
after he's used to and having to feel
like he def has to defend Clos so if you

1288
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:22,480
like he def has to defend Clos so if you
 

1289
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,029
like he def has to defend Clos so if you
look at the first move the first move is

1290
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:25,039
look at the first move the first move is
 

1291
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,829
look at the first move the first move is
the shorter we

1292
01:03:26,829 --> 01:03:26,839
the shorter we
 

1293
01:03:26,839 --> 01:03:30,670
the shorter we
trying to get inside this weapon his

1294
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:30,680
trying to get inside this weapon his
 

1295
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,990
trying to get inside this weapon his
defense is get outside of that weapon

1296
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:33,000
defense is get outside of that weapon
 

1297
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,349
defense is get outside of that weapon
can go back to

1298
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:38,359

 

1299
01:03:38,359 --> 01:03:42,910

okay so my as we're going and I'm trying

1300
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:42,920
okay so my as we're going and I'm trying
 

1301
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,870
okay so my as we're going and I'm trying
this I would be trying this kind of

1302
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:45,880
this I would be trying this kind of
 

1303
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,470
this I would be trying this kind of
stuff if he moved inside the

1304
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:49,480
stuff if he moved inside the
 

1305
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:53,230
stuff if he moved inside the
circle then I would be thinking

1306
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:53,240
circle then I would be thinking
 

1307
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,589
circle then I would be thinking
this okay has to

1308
01:03:56,589 --> 01:03:56,599
this okay has to
 

1309
01:03:56,599 --> 01:04:00,230
this okay has to
where my advantage outside the sword

1310
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:00,240
where my advantage outside the sword
 

1311
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,230
where my advantage outside the sword
which is outside the leg okay and then

which is outside the leg okay and then
 

1313
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,789

if you stay outside the sword you can

if you stay outside the sword you can
 

1315
01:04:05,799 --> 01:04:10,029
if you stay outside the sword you can
attack this sword from the inside as if

1316
01:04:10,029 --> 01:04:10,039
attack this sword from the inside as if
 

1317
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:11,950
attack this sword from the inside as if
you're on the outside it does not going

do with grounding mechanics that she
 

1419
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,269
do with grounding mechanics that she
cannot do with exal

1420

cannot do with exal
 

1421
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:26,189
cannot do with exal
mechanics to the extrem well I've

1422
01:09:26,189 --> 01:09:26,199
mechanics to the extrem well I've
 

1423
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:28,669
mechanics to the extrem well I've
demonstrated several things this week on

1424
01:09:28,669 --> 01:09:28,679
demonstrated several things this week on
 

1425

doesn't really know how to do these
 

1455
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,510
doesn't really know how to do these
things so

1456
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:26,520
things so
 

1457
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,350
things so
position

1458

position
 

1459
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:36,630
position
okay and if I wanted to try to lift this

1460
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,640

 

1461
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,550

thing it's not going to be

1462
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:39,560
thing it's not going to be
 

1463
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,550
thing it's not going to be
possible if

1464
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:42,560
possible if
 

1465
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,070
possible if
he squats to the side of it even if the

he squats to the side of it even if the
 

1467
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,350
he squats to the side of it even if the
hand is you can move it back a little

1468
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:49,360
hand is you can move it back a little

that okay is boom you're going to finish
and then your partner will come out and

1482
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:13,080
and then your partner will come out and
 

1483
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:13,990
and then your partner will come out and
lift

1484
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:14,000
lift
 

1485
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,750
lift
up straight up the middle of the Joe

1486
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:19,760
up straight up the middle of the Joe
 

1487
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,630
up straight up the middle of the Joe
okay that's our girl now go okay and

1488
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:23,640
okay that's our girl now go okay and
 

1489
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,950
okay that's our girl now go okay and
you'll try to get your weight over that

1490
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:25,960
you'll try to get your weight over that
 

1491
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,790
you'll try to get your weight over that
spot I'm going to tell you we're not

1492
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:28,800
spot I'm going to tell you we're not
 

1493
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,870
spot I'm going to tell you we're not
pinned like the externalist will think

we're going to be every bit as mobile
 

1499
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,070
we're going to be every bit as mobile
okay so now we're just I'm just

1500
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:40,080
okay so now we're just I'm just

answering the question are we heavier
 

1503
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,669
answering the question are we heavier
I'll then answer are we mobile okay so

1504
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:46,679
I'll then answer are we mobile okay so
 

1505
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:49,030
I'll then answer are we mobile okay so
let's

1506
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:49,040
let's
 

1507
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,709
let's
go and you're lifting straight up the

1508
01:11:51,709 --> 01:11:51,719
go and you're lifting straight up the
 

1509
01:11:51,719 --> 01:12:02,110
go and you're lifting straight up the
Joe between the two hands

1510
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:02,120

 

1511
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,590

you do the whole four top Yeah from the
