some time to income in there it's
important to understand where your

that there are many different theories

24
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:34,590
that there are many different theories
 

25
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,470
that there are many different theories
on where weight should be placed right

26
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
on where weight should be placed right
 

27
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,510
on where weight should be placed right
so when I was growing up there was this

28
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:38,520
so when I was growing up there was this
 

29
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,709
so when I was growing up there was this
big thing that you know everything

30
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:39,719
big thing that you know everything
 

31
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,930
big thing that you know everything
should be a 70/30 stance that's the big

32
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:41,940
should be a 70/30 stance that's the big
 

33
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,330
should be a 70/30 stance that's the big
thing you know so there should be 70% in

34
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:44,340
thing you know so there should be 70% in
 

35
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,040
thing you know so there should be 70% in
your back foot and 30% in your front

36
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,050
your back foot and 30% in your front
 

37
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,630
your back foot and 30% in your front
foot and this was a really common idea

38
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:47,640
foot and this was a really common idea
 

39
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,260
foot and this was a really common idea
there is no absolute standard for where

40
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:51,270
there is no absolute standard for where
 

41
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,240
there is no absolute standard for where
your weight should be placed but there

42
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,250
your weight should be placed but there
 

43
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,950
your weight should be placed but there
by placing your weight in different

44
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
by placing your weight in different
 

45
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,959
by placing your weight in different
positions it will enable different

46
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:56,969
positions it will enable different
 

47
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,029
positions it will enable different
things so understanding the details of

48
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
things so understanding the details of
 

49
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,290
things so understanding the details of
where you should be placing your weight

50
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,300
where you should be placing your weight
 

51

52
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:01,859
is really really important and will make
 

53
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,110
is really really important and will make
a lot of a lot of difference in your

54
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
a lot of a lot of difference in your
 

55
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,759
a lot of a lot of difference in your
footwork when I started learning I you

56
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:04,769
footwork when I started learning I you
 

57
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,530
footwork when I started learning I you
know I remember my teacher talking about

58
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:06,540
know I remember my teacher talking about
 

59
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,929
know I remember my teacher talking about
a 50/50 stance putting half your weight

60
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:08,939
a 50/50 stance putting half your weight
 

61
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,010
a 50/50 stance putting half your weight
in each foot and that was the perfect

62
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:10,020
in each foot and that was the perfect
 

63
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,990
in each foot and that was the perfect
position because that meant that you

64
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
position because that meant that you
 

65
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,420
position because that meant that you
could equally move right or left at any

66
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:14,430
could equally move right or left at any
 

67
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,850
could equally move right or left at any
moment as I've begun to study footwork

68
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:16,860
moment as I've begun to study footwork
 

69
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,130
moment as I've begun to study footwork
and my life I started to realize that

70
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,140
and my life I started to realize that
 

71
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,090
and my life I started to realize that
this is not exactly the ideal and when

72
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,100
this is not exactly the ideal and when
 

73
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,440
this is not exactly the ideal and when
we're talking about quick movement which

74
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:24,450
we're talking about quick movement which
 

75
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,730
we're talking about quick movement which
is what I can't show is be able to do

76
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:25,740
is what I can't show is be able to do
 

77
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,010
is what I can't show is be able to do
there is probably a likelihood of

78
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,020
there is probably a likelihood of
 

79
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,480
there is probably a likelihood of
placing your weight in a different spot

80
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:29,490
placing your weight in a different spot
 

81
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,249
placing your weight in a different spot
and in this video we're gonna talk about

82
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:31,259
and in this video we're gonna talk about
 

83
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,749
and in this video we're gonna talk about
that so where should you be placing your

84
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:32,759
that so where should you be placing your
 

85
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,940
that so where should you be placing your
foot your weight in your footwork in

86
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:34,950
foot your weight in your footwork in
 

87
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,770
foot your weight in your footwork in

Josh generally is gonna want to keep his

104
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,140
Josh generally is gonna want to keep his
 

105
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,350
Josh generally is gonna want to keep his
weight forward and I'm gonna explain why

106
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:54,360
weight forward and I'm gonna explain why
 

107
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,929
weight forward and I'm gonna explain why
that is yeah Aikido the idea is to

108
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:56,939
that is yeah Aikido the idea is to
 

109
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,850
that is yeah Aikido the idea is to
always be in motion so you should always

110
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:58,860
always be in motion so you should always
 

111
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,429
always be in motion so you should always
be in motion because if they're stronger

112
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
be in motion because if they're stronger
 

113
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,020
be in motion because if they're stronger
and more powerful than us if we stay in

114
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,030
and more powerful than us if we stay in
 

115
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,179
and more powerful than us if we stay in
one place that disables them to get a

116
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:05,189
one place that disables them to get a
 

117
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,310
one place that disables them to get a
very powerful genre so we don't want to

118
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:07,320
very powerful genre so we don't want to
 

119
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,869
very powerful genre so we don't want to
square up with anyone we don't want to

120
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
square up with anyone we don't want to
 

121
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,350
square up with anyone we don't want to
stay in one place at all we

122
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:10,360
stay in one place at all we
 

123
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,970
stay in one place at all we
also be moving now when you're

124
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:11,980
also be moving now when you're
 

125
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,410
also be moving now when you're
constantly moving whether you realize it

126
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:13,420
constantly moving whether you realize it
 

127
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,720
constantly moving whether you realize it
or not you're always keeping your weight

128
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:15,730
or not you're always keeping your weight
 

129
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,270
or not you're always keeping your weight
forward so if Josh stands like this like

130
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:18,280
forward so if Josh stands like this like
 

131
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,830
forward so if Josh stands like this like
he is right now with his weight in the

132
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
he is right now with his weight in the
 

133
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,110
he is right now with his weight in the
majority of his front foot he can easily

134
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,120
majority of his front foot he can easily
 

135
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,810
majority of his front foot he can easily
move his back foot like this now that's

136
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:24,820
move his back foot like this now that's
 

137
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,200
move his back foot like this now that's
the way that regular walking steps look

138
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,210
the way that regular walking steps look
 

139
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,610
the way that regular walking steps look
right so if I get Josh to come kind of

140
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:29,620
right so if I get Josh to come kind of
 

141
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,620
right so if I get Josh to come kind of
over here just to the side and just walk

142
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:31,630
over here just to the side and just walk
 

143
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,420
over here just to the side and just walk
through the frame for my second see now

144
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:33,430
through the frame for my second see now
 

145
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,520
through the frame for my second see now
when you watch him walking every single

146
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:35,530
when you watch him walking every single
 

147
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,900
when you watch him walking every single
time he's shifting his weight to the

148
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:36,910
time he's shifting his weight to the
 

149
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,030
time he's shifting his weight to the
front keeping it in front and then

150
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
front keeping it in front and then
 

151
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,970
front keeping it in front and then
taking the next step now notice if you

152
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:41,980
taking the next step now notice if you
 

153
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,050
taking the next step now notice if you
were to do that and shift his weight

154
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,060
were to do that and shift his weight
 

155
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,810
were to do that and shift his weight
back in between be a really weird way to

156
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:45,820
back in between be a really weird way to
 

157
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,910
back in between be a really weird way to
walk says maybe looks like some kind of

158
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
walk says maybe looks like some kind of
 

159
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,800
walk says maybe looks like some kind of
wedding a funeral procession something

160
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:49,810
wedding a funeral procession something
 

161
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,170
wedding a funeral procession something
special and formal or something but he's

162
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:52,180
special and formal or something but he's
