00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:57,239
sometimes we can have demonstrations
 

49
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,420
sometimes we can have demonstrations
that look like a ton of ghee which would

50
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,430
that look like a ton of ghee which would

manipulation so one class of active

56
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
manipulation so one class of active
 

57
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,420
manipulation so one class of active
demonstration of this is if Sascha had

58
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:08,430
demonstration of this is if Sascha had
 

59
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,789
demonstration of this is if Sascha had
the the end of the stick here and Josh I

60
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
the the end of the stick here and Josh I
 

61
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,280
the the end of the stick here and Josh I
do both to grab the state if Sascha were

62
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,290
do both to grab the state if Sascha were
 

63
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,260
do both to grab the state if Sascha were
to convince us to push the stick down

64
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,270
to convince us to push the stick down
 

65
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,210
to convince us to push the stick down
flat right so meaning we can't drive it

66
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:17,220
flat right so meaning we can't drive it
 

67
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,770
flat right so meaning we can't drive it
down and weird angles or anything that

68
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:18,780
down and weird angles or anything that
 

69
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,690
down and weird angles or anything that
our job is simply to push the stick flat

70
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:20,700
our job is simply to push the stick flat
 

71
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,999
our job is simply to push the stick flat
to the ground so Sasha convinces us and

72
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:23,009
to the ground so Sasha convinces us and
 

73
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,039
to the ground so Sasha convinces us and
conditions us to drive the stick flat

74
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,049
conditions us to drive the stick flat
 

75
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,620
conditions us to drive the stick flat
like that now if we were to do that and

76
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,630
like that now if we were to do that and
 

77
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,450
like that now if we were to do that and
Sasha would not to let us go on that

78
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:29,460
Sasha would not to let us go on that
 

79
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:38,240
Sasha would not to let us go on that
side but you can see that this option is

80
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,250
side but you can see that this option is
 

81
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,920
side but you can see that this option is
easily able to keep us from pushing it

82
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:39,930
easily able to keep us from pushing it
 

83
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,690
easily able to keep us from pushing it
down now that seems impressive that

84
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:41,700
down now that seems impressive that
 

85
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,590
down now that seems impressive that
seems like some really impressive

86
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:42,600
seems like some really impressive
 

87
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,270
seems like some really impressive
honey-b back to what's happening is a

88
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:44,280
honey-b back to what's happening is a
 

89
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,310
honey-b back to what's happening is a
really simple psychological factor so

90
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
really simple psychological factor so
 

91
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,230
really simple psychological factor so
when Josh and I believe that the stick

92
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
when Josh and I believe that the stick
 

93
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,060
when Josh and I believe that the stick
has to go flat meaning has to go totally

94
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,070
has to go flat meaning has to go totally
 

95
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,550
has to go flat meaning has to go totally
flat to the ground if one end is kept up

96
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
flat to the ground if one end is kept up
 

97
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,440
flat to the ground if one end is kept up
so Sasha just won't let that man go down

98
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,450
so Sasha just won't let that man go down
 

99
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,270
so Sasha just won't let that man go down
well it happened inside my brain when

100
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:56,280
well it happened inside my brain when
 

101
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,530
well it happened inside my brain when
I'm really convinced is instead of just

102
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:58,540
I'm really convinced is instead of just
 

103
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,240
I'm really convinced is instead of just
at an angle which might make this easy

104
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,250
at an angle which might make this easy
 

105
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,970
at an angle which might make this easy
for me I will try to keep it flat right

106
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:02,980
for me I will try to keep it flat right
 

107
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,980
for me I will try to keep it flat right
so I'm actually helping something I'm

108
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:04,990
so I'm actually helping something I'm
 

109
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,050
so I'm actually helping something I'm
holding up on this side nowadays if

110
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,060
holding up on this side nowadays if
 

111
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,850
holding up on this side nowadays if
multiple people are involved in this

112
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:08,860
multiple people are involved in this
 

113
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,010
multiple people are involved in this
then what happens is I would suddenly

114
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:11,020
then what happens is I would suddenly
 

115
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,810
then what happens is I would suddenly
realize that I'm not pushing down all

116
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:12,820
realize that I'm not pushing down all
 

117
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,670
realize that I'm not pushing down all
the way another person will often

118
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:14,680
the way another person will often
 

119
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,500
the way another person will often
realize that's the case so as this

120
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:16,510
realize that's the case so as this
 

121
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,450
realize that's the case so as this
starts to get out of alignment then Josh

122
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:18,460
starts to get out of alignment then Josh
 

123
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,130
starts to get out of alignment then Josh
will change and now all of a sudden it

124
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,140
will change and now all of a sudden it
 

125
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,450
will change and now all of a sudden it
feels difficult to push down but I'm

126
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:21,460
feels difficult to push down but I'm
 

127
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,740
feels difficult to push down but I'm
really trying to push down and it won't

128
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:22,750
really trying to push down and it won't
 

129
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,570
really trying to push down and it won't
work so what's happening is a

130
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:24,580
work so what's happening is a
 

131
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,420
work so what's happening is a
psychological situation there where I'm

132
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,430
psychological situation there where I'm
 

133
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,040
psychological situation there where I'm
convinced that we have to obey some

134
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,050
convinced that we have to obey some
 

135
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,690
convinced that we have to obey some
special set of rules so it's not

136
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:30,700
special set of rules so it's not
 

137
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,070
special set of rules so it's not
actually cutting but it looks like

138
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
actually cutting but it looks like
 

139
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,580
actually cutting but it looks like
cutting

140
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:32,590
cutting
 

141
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,110
cutting
and that's another demonstration that

142
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,120
and that's another demonstration that
 

143
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,940
and that's another demonstration that
can be give to kind of explain how this

144
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:35,950
can be give to kind of explain how this
 

145
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,670
can be give to kind of explain how this
stuff works so it's important to

146
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:38,680
stuff works so it's important to
 

147
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,810
stuff works so it's important to
understand there's lots of ways that we

148
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:39,820
understand there's lots of ways that we
 

149
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,150
understand there's lots of ways that we
can give these kinds of demonstrations

150
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
can give these kinds of demonstrations
 

151
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,250
can give these kinds of demonstrations
in and a lot of people said that while

152
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,260
in and a lot of people said that while
 

153
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,270
in and a lot of people said that while
you as she would do it as a

154
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
you as she would do it as a
 

155
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,890
you as she would do it as a
demonstration was never what he would

156
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:46,900
demonstration was never what he would
 

157
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,230
demonstration was never what he would
teach in class sometimes to make a good

158
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,240
teach in class sometimes to make a good
 

159
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,729
teach in class sometimes to make a good
demonstration it's fun to show these

160
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:50,739
demonstration it's fun to show these
 

161
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:52,290
demonstration it's fun to show these
kinds of interesting ideas and they

162
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:52,300
kinds of interesting ideas and they
 

163
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,330
kinds of interesting ideas and they
