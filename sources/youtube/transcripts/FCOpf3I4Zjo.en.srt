77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,590

okay let's check okay so this is not our

78
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
okay let's check okay so this is not our
 

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,150
okay let's check okay so this is not our
range

80
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
range
 

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,710
range
this is our our range okay because of

82
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
this is our our range okay because of
 

83
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,469
this is our our range okay because of
the leg weapons

84
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
the leg weapons
 

85
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,510
the leg weapons
if if he's if he if i'm this

86
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
if if he's if he if i'm this
 

87
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,230
if if he's if he if i'm this
close to him it's likely because he's

88
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
close to him it's likely because he's
 

89
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,270
close to him it's likely because he's
rushing in

90
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
rushing in
 

91
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,590
rushing in
and he's checking his own legs with his

92
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
and he's checking his own legs with his
 

93
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,830
and he's checking his own legs with his
aggression

94
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840

 

95
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,870

secondly you don't chase things that

96
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
secondly you don't chase things that
 

97
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,870
secondly you don't chase things that
aren't going to touch you

98
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
aren't going to touch you
 

99
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,390
aren't going to touch you
so do that again i'll do the same

100
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
so do that again i'll do the same
 

101
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,070
so do that again i'll do the same
deviation there's no point in touching

102
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
deviation there's no point in touching
 

103
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,390
deviation there's no point in touching
the same thing goes for kicks i'm not

104
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
the same thing goes for kicks i'm not
 

105
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,629
the same thing goes for kicks i'm not
going here

106
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
going here
 

107
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,670
going here
that kick's not going to touch me

108
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
that kick's not going to touch me
 

109
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,870
that kick's not going to touch me

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
okay third thing uh
 

111
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,870
okay third thing uh
and this is the the problem with just

112
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
and this is the the problem with just
 

113
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,550
and this is the the problem with just
doing children wasn't

114
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
doing children wasn't
 

115
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,310
doing children wasn't

119
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,590

the ik adhesion properly one maybe you

120
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
the ik adhesion properly one maybe you
 

121
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,350
the ik adhesion properly one maybe you
don't have one

122
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
don't have one
 

123
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,270

but two you don't understand its realm
 

125
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,870
but two you don't understand its realm
of application

126
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
of application
 

127
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,749
