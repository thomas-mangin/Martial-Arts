but when you look at

00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:37,400
but when you look at
 

241
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,330
but when you look at
it is that ritual

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:41,340
it is that ritual
 

243
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,450
it is that ritual
not a self-defense or a sparring

244
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:44,460
not a self-defense or a sparring
 

245
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,770
not a self-defense or a sparring
environment

environment
 

247
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,590
environment
you have to pull that out

248
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:51,600

 

249
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,350

so in that sense

250
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,360
so in that sense
 

251
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,370
so in that sense
you're not necessarily working on here's

252
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:58,380
you're not necessarily working on here's
 

253
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,370
you're not necessarily working on here's
what you do when somebody uh tries to

254
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:01,380
what you do when somebody uh tries to
 

255
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,230
what you do when somebody uh tries to
cut your head

256
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:03,240
cut your head
 

257
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,450
cut your head
and then you start arguing over who

258
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:05,460
and then you start arguing over who
 

259
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,610
and then you start arguing over who
would cut your head like that

260
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:07,620
would cut your head like that
 

261
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,490
would cut your head like that
do you understand

262
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:10,500

 

263
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,050

the beginning point is totally arbitrary

264
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:15,060
the beginning point is totally arbitrary
 

265
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,350
the beginning point is totally arbitrary
because the sole goal is

266
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,360
because the sole goal is
 

267
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,629
because the sole goal is
this integration

268
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
this integration
 

269
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,770
this integration
of the egoic mind and the god of mind

270
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:24,780
of the egoic mind and the god of mind
 

271
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,129
of the egoic mind and the god of mind
that's what you're after

272
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:28,139

 

273
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,950

so

274
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960

 

275
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,830

what Aikido has done over the course of

276
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
what Aikido has done over the course of
 

277
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,589
what Aikido has done over the course of
very relatively short time

278
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:36,599
very relatively short time
 

279
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,650
very relatively short time
is that has been lost why because

280
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:39,660
is that has been lost why because
 

281
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,089
is that has been lost why because
culturally oh Sensei was at the end the

282
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:44,099
culturally oh Sensei was at the end the
 

283
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,230
culturally oh Sensei was at the end the
tail end of an age

284
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240

 

285
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,170

where secular materialism and the

286
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:51,180
where secular materialism and the
 

287
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,110
where secular materialism and the
scientific epistemy established its

288
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,120
scientific epistemy established its
 

289
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,490
scientific epistemy established its
economic dominance

290
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:58,500

 

291
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,309

and the resultant of that is that the

292
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:01,319
and the resultant of that is that the
 

293
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,870
and the resultant of that is that the
art is understood materialistically

294
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:05,880

 

295
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,350

not metaphysically

296
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360

 

297
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,409

and that's how you get into the little

298
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:12,419
and that's how you get into the little
 

299
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,290
and that's how you get into the little
debate that is going on in the Aikido

300
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:15,300
debate that is going on in the Aikido
 

301
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,430
debate that is going on in the Aikido
world all Aikido needs to be Marshall

302
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:18,440
world all Aikido needs to be Marshall
 

303
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,529
world all Aikido needs to be Marshall
Aikido is nothing about fighting and you

304
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:21,539
Aikido is nothing about fighting and you
 

305
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,029
Aikido is nothing about fighting and you
do see

306
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
do see
 

307
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,450
do see
do you get that

308
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:26,460

 

309
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,550

but no one can do what the founder did

310
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:31,560

 

311
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,310

so yesterday

312
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:33,320
so yesterday
 

313
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,490
so yesterday
I did a video with you and you are

314
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:37,500
I did a video with you and you are
 

315
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,810
I did a video with you and you are
working

316
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:38,820
working
 

317
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,010
working
uh on something that the general Aikido

318
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,020
uh on something that the general Aikido
 

319
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,670
uh on something that the general Aikido
rule does not understand what

320
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:46,680

 

321
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,050

so

322
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,060
so
 

323
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,990
so
why don't they understand what and how

324
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,000
why don't they understand what and how
 

325
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,110
why don't they understand what and how
would you understand better what quihon

326
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,120
would you understand better what quihon
 

327
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,350
would you understand better what quihon

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,210
and the inertia increases there would be
more uh resistance to radical changes in

530
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,220
more uh resistance to radical changes in
 

531
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,090
more uh resistance to radical changes in
direction do you guys understand that so

532
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:17,100
direction do you guys understand that so
 

533
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,930
direction do you guys understand that so
if she's coming full speed up and full

534
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:20,940
if she's coming full speed up and full
 

535
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,550
if she's coming full speed up and full
speed down

536
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
speed down
 

537
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,069
speed down
and forward it would be harder for her

538
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:25,079
and forward it would be harder for her
 

539
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,670
and forward it would be harder for her
to change to go rearward or to turn this

540
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:28,680
to change to go rearward or to turn this
 

541
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,490
to change to go rearward or to turn this
thing around you get it okay but it

doesn't matter I'm gonna exaggerate the
 

545
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,569
doesn't matter I'm gonna exaggerate the
forces uh in the at slow speed it still

546
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:38,579
forces uh in the at slow speed it still
 

547
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,490
forces uh in the at slow speed it still
will not matter you'll see there's a

548
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:40,500
will not matter you'll see there's a
 

549
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,269
will not matter you'll see there's a
track

550
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279

and there's not a track you can be off
 

555
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:50,329
and there's not a track you can be off
okay so as kihon Wasa the initial energy

556
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:50,339
okay so as kihon Wasa the initial energy
 

557
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,230
okay so as kihon Wasa the initial energy
is prescribed so she's gonna do a strike

665
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,650

so what am I doing I'm grounding I'm

666
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:33,660
so what am I doing I'm grounding I'm
 

667
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,250
so what am I doing I'm grounding I'm
grounding over here so I'm not holding

668
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,260
grounding over here so I'm not holding
 

669
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,610
grounding over here so I'm not holding
here like this again this is the

670
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:40,620
here like this again this is the
 

671
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,630
here like this again this is the
internal stuff you cannot see

672
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640

 

673
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,270

this is supposed to be impossible right

674
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
this is supposed to be impossible right
 

675
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,850
this is supposed to be impossible right
in other words if she pulls the arm I'm

676
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:49,860
in other words if she pulls the arm I'm
 

677
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,890
in other words if she pulls the arm I'm
supposed to go like this

678
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:51,900
supposed to go like this
 

679
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,049
supposed to go like this
but here I'm just gonna grab

680
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:57,059

 

681
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:01,610

you see

682
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:01,620

 

683
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,450

that's it then

684
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:04,460
that's it then
 

685
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,990
that's it then
again all impossible

686
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,000

 

687
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,390

because there's no internal skills that

688
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:11,400
because there's no internal skills that
 

689
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,010
because there's no internal skills that
are visible

690
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,020
are visible
 

691
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,930
are visible
there's no

692
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:14,940
there's no
 

693
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,570
there's no
experience in the internal

694
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:17,580
experience in the internal
 

695
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,190
experience in the internal
so yesterday when your knees were

696
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
so yesterday when your knees were
 

697
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,830
so yesterday when your knees were
hurting that would be not internal

698
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:24,840

 

699
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,770

so again at full speed that would be

700
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:27,780
so again at full speed that would be
 

701
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,390
so again at full speed that would be
very hard because she's supposed to cut

702
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,400
very hard because she's supposed to cut
 

703
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,570
very hard because she's supposed to cut
down remember but it's not like your

704
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:32,580
down remember but it's not like your
 

705
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,330
down remember but it's not like your
arm's gonna go there because there's an

706
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:35,340
arm's gonna go there because there's an
 

707
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,270
arm's gonna go there because there's an
internal movement

708
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,280
internal movement
 

709
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,250
internal movement
that is happening

710
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:40,260
that is happening
 

711
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,430
that is happening
that's inside the centrifugal energy

712
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
that's inside the centrifugal energy
 

713
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,010
that's inside the centrifugal energy
that everyone knows and sees do you see

714
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,020
that everyone knows and sees do you see
 

715
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,510
that everyone knows and sees do you see
that and as in your body

716
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:50,520
that and as in your body
 

717
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,970
that and as in your body
there is enough resistance in the

718
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:52,980
there is enough resistance in the
 

719
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,310
there is enough resistance in the
movement of your mass

720
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,320
movement of your mass
 

721
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,130
movement of your mass
that that's what's actually making you

722
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:58,140
that that's what's actually making you
 

723
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,270
that that's what's actually making you
come around

724
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
come around
 

725
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,450
come around
okay so for example

726
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:01,460
okay so for example
 

727
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,970
okay so for example
uh don't add any energy or bring you

728
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:04,980
uh don't add any energy or bring you
 

729
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,930
uh don't add any energy or bring you
around

730
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:08,940

 

731
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,190

add the energy that way

732
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,200

 

733
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,789

faster because her energy is generating

734
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
faster because her energy is generating
 

735
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,190
faster because her energy is generating
more Force at the point of contact

736
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
more Force at the point of contact
 

737
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,490
more Force at the point of contact
so I do that with your mass

738
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:22,500
so I do that with your mass
 

739
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,529
so I do that with your mass
here's your mass I'm going to move your

740
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:24,539
here's your mass I'm going to move your
 

741
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,470
here's your mass I'm going to move your
mass I ground your mass

742
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:27,480
mass I ground your mass
 

743
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,930
mass I ground your mass
and it brings the body around

744
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:29,940
and it brings the body around
 

745
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,909
and it brings the body around
but not by me

746
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
but not by me
 

747
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,430
but not by me
doing a mad amount of strength on your

748
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:34,440
doing a mad amount of strength on your
 

749
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,250
doing a mad amount of strength on your
joint

750
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:37,260

 

751
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,850

bye

752
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:40,860

 

753
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,110

so if we go slow again

754
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
so if we go slow again
 

755
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,049
so if we go slow again
she has to finish the cut but it doesn't

756
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:48,059
she has to finish the cut but it doesn't
 

757
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,930
she has to finish the cut but it doesn't
matter you can pull you can pull it's

758
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:50,940
matter you can pull you can pull it's
 

759
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,730
matter you can pull you can pull it's
still going to come around this way as I

760
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:52,740
still going to come around this way as I
 

761
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,909
still going to come around this way as I
ground

762
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919

 

763
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:02,210

okay now actually

764
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:02,220

 

765
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,370

that's what she's supposed to do in the

766
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:04,380
that's what she's supposed to do in the
 

767
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,590
that's what she's supposed to do in the
keyhon per prescription she resists

768
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600

 

769
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,250

um

770
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,260
um
 

771
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,130
um
I could use those same skills

772
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:13,140
I could use those same skills
 

773
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,870
I could use those same skills
do you see

774
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:14,880
do you see
 

775
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,169
do you see
uh I'll just focus on this hat

776
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:18,179
uh I'll just focus on this hat
 

777
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,049
uh I'll just focus on this hat
okay so imagine I have this I have this

778
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:21,059
okay so imagine I have this I have this
 

779
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,730
okay so imagine I have this I have this
joint locked and keep her hand from

780
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:22,740
joint locked and keep her hand from
 

781
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,590
joint locked and keep her hand from
posting

782
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:24,600
posting
 

783
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,710
posting
okay I'll take off the joint log

784
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:27,720
okay I'll take off the joint log
 

785
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,810
okay I'll take off the joint log
and again

786
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:29,820
and again
 

787
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,270
and again
as she tries to stand up

788
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:32,280
as she tries to stand up
 

789
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,490
as she tries to stand up
that's internalized and you see all it

790
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:34,500
that's internalized and you see all it
 

791
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,010
that's internalized and you see all it
does is make her go off balance so you

792
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,020
does is make her go off balance so you
 

793
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,630
does is make her go off balance so you
want to try to get up

794
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
want to try to get up
 

795
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,570
want to try to get up
get up all the way

796
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:41,580
get up all the way
 

797
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:49,789
get up all the way
go

798
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:49,799

 

799
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,890

okay so what I do in the technique

800
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:51,900
okay so what I do in the technique
 

801
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,190
okay so what I do in the technique
though is when I feel her resistance to

802
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
though is when I feel her resistance to
 

803
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,850
though is when I feel her resistance to
the Eco Ura instead of shoving it down

804
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:58,860
the Eco Ura instead of shoving it down
 

805
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,029
the Eco Ura instead of shoving it down
I go one more Tank on

806
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:02,039
I go one more Tank on
 

807
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:05,690
I go one more Tank on
and this Push Pull again so if you if

808
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:05,700
and this Push Pull again so if you if
 

809
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,570
and this Push Pull again so if you if
the push pull let's do that so she's

810
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:08,580
the push pull let's do that so she's
 

811
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,890
the push pull let's do that so she's
here

812
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:09,900
here
 

813
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,230
here
it's the same thing here's an internal

814
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
it's the same thing here's an internal
 

815
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,450
it's the same thing here's an internal
pulling like you had on the first one

816
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:14,460
pulling like you had on the first one
 

817
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,390
pulling like you had on the first one
and uh internal

818
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:17,400
and uh internal
 

819
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:27,590
and uh internal
pushing so you're gonna push your hand

820
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600

 

821
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,289

same thing

822
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:30,299
same thing
 

823
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,049
same thing
just move the center okay it's not here

824
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:33,059
just move the center okay it's not here
 

825
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,990
just move the center okay it's not here
in the joint it's in the body

826
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,000
in the joint it's in the body
 

827
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,789
in the joint it's in the body
but what I'm going to do instead is

828
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:37,799
but what I'm going to do instead is
 

829
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,350
but what I'm going to do instead is
leave it there

830
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
leave it there
 

831
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,870
leave it there
and come around to here

832
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:41,880
and come around to here
 

833
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,850
and come around to here
that's it

834
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:43,860
that's it
 

835
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,330
that's it
then I attack with rokio

836
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:47,340
then I attack with rokio
 

837
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,310
then I attack with rokio
but she's gonna counter another

838
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,320
but she's gonna counter another
 

839
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,909
but she's gonna counter another
prescription in Nico so stay there if

840
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:52,919
prescription in Nico so stay there if
 

841
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,250
prescription in Nico so stay there if
she doesn't counter a hover

842
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:55,260
she doesn't counter a hover
 

843
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,789
she doesn't counter a hover
Roku

844
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799

 

845
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,370

she's gonna counter rokio

846
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:01,380
she's gonna counter rokio
 

847
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,549
she's gonna counter rokio
by dipping her elbow under and that

848
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
by dipping her elbow under and that
 

849
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,169
by dipping her elbow under and that
walks her into Nico again go back

850
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:09,179
walks her into Nico again go back
 

851
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:12,830
walks her into Nico again go back
just like I don't she posts there I

852
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:12,840
just like I don't she posts there I
 

853
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,190
just like I don't she posts there I
would not want to do the ritual like

854
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,200
would not want to do the ritual like
 

855
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,350
would not want to do the ritual like
this

856
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:18,360
this
 

857
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,149
this
go

858
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159

 

859
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,770

instead I should post stairs here trying

860
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:24,780
instead I should post stairs here trying
 

861
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,510
instead I should post stairs here trying
to shove her down with the kill or do I

862
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:26,520

00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,430
my Center
there's no that's I would never do that

1036
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:58,440
there's no that's I would never do that
 

1037
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,470
there's no that's I would never do that
I might try once and then go no that's

1038
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,480
I might try once and then go no that's
 

1039
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,250
I might try once and then go no that's
not gonna work you stronger than me

1040
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:04,260

 

1041
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,950

so instead I go around the contention

1042
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
so instead I go around the contention
 

1043
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,789
so instead I go around the contention
point the neutral point it's over here

1044
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:10,799
point the neutral point it's over here
 

1045
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,210
point the neutral point it's over here
you see and then the elbows are

1046
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:14,220
you see and then the elbows are
 

1047
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,490
you see and then the elbows are
available there's no support

1048
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:16,500
available there's no support
 

1049
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,169
available there's no support
do you see

1050
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:18,179
do you see
 

1051
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,390
do you see
and I'm going to make a smaller Circle

1052
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:20,400
and I'm going to make a smaller Circle
 

1053
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,010
and I'm going to make a smaller Circle
so that arm helps me okay so if I do

1054
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,020
so that arm helps me okay so if I do
 

1055
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,930
so that arm helps me okay so if I do
equal again

1056
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:26,940
equal again
 

1057
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,750
equal again
it won't we'll do all that again

1058
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:29,760
it won't we'll do all that again
 

1059
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,669
it won't we'll do all that again
but my smaller circle is going to go

1060
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:31,679
but my smaller circle is going to go
 

1061
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,149
but my smaller circle is going to go
this way

1062
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:35,159

 

1063
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:38,110

you see and again

1064
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,120
you see and again
 

1065
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,850
you see and again
uh you land

1066
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:40,860
uh you land
 

1067
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,090
uh you land
in the technique do you see that yeah

1068
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:44,100
in the technique do you see that yeah
 

1069
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,470
in the technique do you see that yeah
it's not here

1070
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:45,480
it's not here
 

1071
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,409
it's not here
and then I go here so let's go back

1072
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:51,419

 

1073
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,610

your counter here right we're back here

1074
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:55,620
your counter here right we're back here
 

1075
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,590
your counter here right we're back here
your countered here

1076
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,600
your countered here
 

1077
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,930
your countered here
allows me to go around it

1078
00:27:59,930 --> 00:27:59,940
allows me to go around it
 

1079
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,169
allows me to go around it
and we're going to do the same thing

1080
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:03,179
and we're going to do the same thing
 

1081
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:07,850
and we're going to do the same thing
okay so we'll do uh

1082
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:07,860
okay so we'll do uh
 

1083
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:13,669
okay so we'll do uh
pull your arm out

1084
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:13,679

 

1085
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,750

okay take that energy pull your arm out

1086
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:20,760

 

1087
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,630

and then what did it do what do you

1088
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:23,640
and then what did it do what do you
 

1089
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,090
and then what did it do what do you
notice now about the final pin it's

1090
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,100
notice now about the final pin it's
 

1091
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,090
notice now about the final pin it's
tighter it's tighter okay it all got

1092
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:29,100
tighter it's tighter okay it all got
 

1093
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,350
tighter it's tighter okay it all got
tighter so you land immediately in the

1094
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:33,360
tighter so you land immediately in the
 

1095
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:41,149
tighter so you land immediately in the
dislocation

1096
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:41,159

 

1097
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,890

to beat

1098
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:42,900
to beat
 

1099
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,289
to beat
and

1100
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:44,299
and
 

1101
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:47,450
and
co-participate in

1102
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:47,460
co-participate in
 

1103
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,630
co-participate in
this egoic God mind integration

1104
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,640
this egoic God mind integration
 

1105
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,630
this egoic God mind integration
concentrically is

1106
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:55,640
concentrically is
 

1107
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,230
concentrically is
that pressurized hotter

1108
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,240
that pressurized hotter
 

1109
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,830
that pressurized hotter
is conjoined with my pressurized heart

1110
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:03,840
is conjoined with my pressurized heart
 

1111
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,090
is conjoined with my pressurized heart
okay and what you notice is

1112
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:08,100
okay and what you notice is
 

1113
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,390
okay and what you notice is
while I can't go anywhere

1114
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:11,400
while I can't go anywhere
 

1115
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,970
while I can't go anywhere
the technique does not hurt

1116
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:13,980
the technique does not hurt
 

1117
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,990
the technique does not hurt
okay so imagine for any number of

1118
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
okay so imagine for any number of
 

1119
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,370
okay so imagine for any number of
reasons

1120
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:19,380
reasons
 

1121
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,610
reasons
you tried to go up or out or in you see

1122
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:22,620
you tried to go up or out or in you see
 

1123
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,370
you tried to go up or out or in you see
that it just hurts right

1124
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:25,380
that it just hurts right
 

1125
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,269
that it just hurts right
um and you're gonna go anyways okay

1126
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:29,279
um and you're gonna go anyways okay
 

1127
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,669
um and you're gonna go anyways okay
here's the thing

1128
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:31,679
here's the thing
 

1129
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,169
here's the thing
when

1130
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:33,179
when
 

1131
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:37,190
when
the egoic mind and the god mind are not

1132
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,200
the egoic mind and the god mind are not
 

1133
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,529
the egoic mind and the god mind are not
integrated the center is not Unified

1134
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:42,539
integrated the center is not Unified
 

1135
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:47,690
integrated the center is not Unified
my own nor mine to yours okay and that

1136
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:47,700
my own nor mine to yours okay and that
 

1137
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,610
my own nor mine to yours okay and that
will always lead

1138
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:49,620
will always lead
 

1139
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,130
will always lead
to all those things

1140
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,140
to all those things
 

1141
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,230
to all those things
uh that generate pain or crashing on

1142
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:57,240
uh that generate pain or crashing on
 

1143
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,549
uh that generate pain or crashing on
your end

1144
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
your end
 

1145
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,090
your end
you're still gonna go do you see but how

1146
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:02,100
you're still gonna go do you see but how
 

1147
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,169
you're still gonna go do you see but how
you experience the nagawaza as UK is

1148
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:06,179
you experience the nagawaza as UK is
 

1149
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,649
you experience the nagawaza as UK is
entirely different as different as a

1150
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:09,659
entirely different as different as a
 

1151
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:12,889
entirely different as different as a
human being who experiences work

1152
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:12,899
human being who experiences work
 

1153
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:16,490
human being who experiences work
solely from the egoic mind that's one

1154
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:16,500
solely from the egoic mind that's one
 

1155
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,990
solely from the egoic mind that's one
day at work

1156
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,000
day at work
 

1157
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,990
day at work
and another person in the same job doing

1158
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,000
and another person in the same job doing
 

1159
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,409
and another person in the same job doing
the same exact thing can integrate the

1160
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:24,419
the same exact thing can integrate the
 

1161
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:26,810
the same exact thing can integrate the
god mind and the egoic mind they have an

1162
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:26,820
god mind and the egoic mind they have an
 

1163
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,090
god mind and the egoic mind they have an
entirely different experience at work

1164
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:29,100
entirely different experience at work
 

1165
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,330
entirely different experience at work
okay so when we go what I am feeling for

1166
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:34,340
okay so when we go what I am feeling for
 

1167
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,370
okay so when we go what I am feeling for
and in yesterday's class

1168
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:37,380
and in yesterday's class
 

1169
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,049
and in yesterday's class
is

1170
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:39,059
is
 

1171
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:43,970
is
that egoic mind okay what how can I feel

1172
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:43,980
that egoic mind okay what how can I feel
 

1173
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,990
that egoic mind okay what how can I feel
it I feel your Center separating from

1174
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,000
it I feel your Center separating from
 

1175
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,810
it I feel your Center separating from
mine do you see that oh I feel

1176
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:53,820

 

1177
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,510

that the center to Center connection is

1178
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:56,520
that the center to Center connection is
 

1179
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,190
that the center to Center connection is
one way my way to you okay so uh for

1180
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,200
one way my way to you okay so uh for
 

1181
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,810
one way my way to you okay so uh for
example we're back on yesterday's

1182
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:02,820
example we're back on yesterday's
 

1183
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,350
example we're back on yesterday's
training okay and there was a time

1184
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:06,360
training okay and there was a time
 

1185
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,430
training okay and there was a time
when you came in this way do you see

1186
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:10,440
when you came in this way do you see
 

1187
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,870
when you came in this way do you see
that that is a disconnect from the arm

1188
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:14,880
that that is a disconnect from the arm
 

1189
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,409
that that is a disconnect from the arm
so I told you you would not be able to

1190
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:18,419
so I told you you would not be able to
 

1191
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:21,350
so I told you you would not be able to
come that way because the arm cutting

1192
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,360
come that way because the arm cutting
 

1193
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,370
come that way because the arm cutting
down

1194
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:22,380
down
 

1195
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,630
down
and you'll see

1196
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:26,640

 

1197
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,269

it so you fell out of the ritual right

1198
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
it so you fell out of the ritual right
 

1199
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,590
it so you fell out of the ritual right
so

1200
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:30,600
so
 

1201

00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,310
you can intend all you want those are
all intellectual processes they are all

1368
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:49,320
all intellectual processes they are all
 

1369
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,589
all intellectual processes they are all
part of the egoic mine and they will

1370
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:51,599
part of the egoic mine and they will
 

1371
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,470
part of the egoic mine and they will
keep you your ego with mind functioning

1372
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:54,480
keep you your ego with mind functioning
 

1373
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,589
keep you your ego with mind functioning
and they will not be able thereby to

1374
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:57,599
and they will not be able thereby to
 

1375
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,589
and they will not be able thereby to
manifest the god mind and therefore you

1376
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:00,599
manifest the god mind and therefore you
 

1377
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,290
manifest the god mind and therefore you
do not have the original communion and

1378

do not have the original communion and
 

1379
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,510
do not have the original communion and
so you do not have the subsequent

1380
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,520
so you do not have the subsequent
 

1381
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,210
so you do not have the subsequent
concentric communions do you understand

1382
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:08,220
concentric communions do you understand
 

1383
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,410
concentric communions do you understand

Center you see uh but if I think if we
 

1435
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,150
Center you see uh but if I think if we
were to turn it up you would lose

1436
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,160
were to turn it up you would lose

your hand in the technique do you see
that

1468
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:20,880
that
 

1469
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,510
that
um why

1470
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:23,520
um why
 

1471
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,150
um why
that was the culture culture

1472
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,160
that was the culture culture
 

1473
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,990
that was the culture culture
no no it's an egoic tendency you want

1474
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000
no no it's an egoic tendency you want
 

1475
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,970
no no it's an egoic tendency you want
your control

1476
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:31,980
your control
 

1477
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,210
your control
and the scary part

1478
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:35,220
and the scary part
 

1479
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,690
and the scary part
of having your center from is you're not

1480
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:38,700
of having your center from is you're not
 

1481
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,410
of having your center from is you're not
in control you're not in control and so

1482
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:42,420
in control you're not in control and so
 

1483
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,829
in control you're not in control and so
your egoic mind will start to function

1484
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:45,839
your egoic mind will start to function
 

1485
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,190
your egoic mind will start to function
it will not cease that God mind will not

1486
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,200
it will not cease that God mind will not
 

1487
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,890
it will not cease that God mind will not
be integrated and you will lose your

1488
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:51,900
be integrated and you will lose your
 

1489
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,230
be integrated and you will lose your
Center that's that's what happens okay

1490
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,240
Center that's that's what happens okay
 

1491
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,010
Center that's that's what happens okay
so there is a relationship between the

1492
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:58,020
so there is a relationship between the
 

1493
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,109
so there is a relationship between the
communion of the first mind and the

1494
00:39:00,109 --> 00:39:00,119
communion of the first mind and the
 

1495
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,050
communion of the first mind and the
second mind the egoic mind and the god

1496
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,060
second mind the egoic mind and the god
 

1497
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,450
second mind the egoic mind and the god
of mine

1498
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:04,460
of mine
 

1499
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,690
of mine
if with the cessation and the

1500
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:08,700
if with the cessation and the
 

1501
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,690
if with the cessation and the
reconciliation and the absence of fear

1502
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:11,700
reconciliation and the absence of fear
 

1503
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,550
reconciliation and the absence of fear
okay

1504
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:13,560
okay
 

1505
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,950
okay
um which is why as you increase the

1506
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:15,960
um which is why as you increase the
 

1507
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,829
um which is why as you increase the
intensity the quality of the communion

1508
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:18,839
intensity the quality of the communion
 

1509
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:21,550
intensity the quality of the communion
of the two minds is increased because

1510
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:21,560
of the two minds is increased because
 

1511
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,069
of the two minds is increased because
increased intensity has a propensity to

1512
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:25,079
increased intensity has a propensity to
 

1513
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:27,890
increased intensity has a propensity to
generate more self-preservation more

1514
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:27,900
generate more self-preservation more
 

1515
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,470
generate more self-preservation more
fear Okay so

1516
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:30,480
fear Okay so
 

1517
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,829
fear Okay so
and if you paid attention

1518
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:32,839
and if you paid attention
 

1519
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:37,130
and if you paid attention
when you did all of your uh self-control

1520
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:37,140
when you did all of your uh self-control
 

1521
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,349
when you did all of your uh self-control
there's a hell of a lot of tension in

1522
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:39,359
there's a hell of a lot of tension in
 

1523
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,569
there's a hell of a lot of tension in
your arm

1524
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:41,579

 

1525
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,710

used a lot of guarding uh to help you
