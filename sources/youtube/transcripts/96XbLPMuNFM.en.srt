1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,450

okay let's go over the geometry that we

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:05,460
okay let's go over the geometry that we
 

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,390
okay let's go over the geometry that we
use so we crank read it tilted the body

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,400
use so we crank read it tilted the body
 

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,600
use so we crank read it tilted the body
right so there's this kind of curve you

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:11,610
right so there's this kind of curve you
 

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,939
right so there's this kind of curve you
see that and then it takes more energy

8
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:16,949
see that and then it takes more energy
 

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,810
see that and then it takes more energy
to try to lift this over to get it in

10
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:20,820
to try to lift this over to get it in
 

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,570
to try to lift this over to get it in
the fall so we don't do that we tilt and

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:26,580
the fall so we don't do that we tilt and
 

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,599
the fall so we don't do that we tilt and
then we start another rotation over here

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:29,609
then we start another rotation over here
 

15
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,040
then we start another rotation over here
so that this hip goes out now when you

16
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,050
so that this hip goes out now when you
 

17
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:47,830
so that this hip goes out now when you
combine the two okay so if we're here I

18
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
combine the two okay so if we're here I
 

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,750
combine the two okay so if we're here I
am but I'm gonna do that in one motion

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:50,760
am but I'm gonna do that in one motion
 

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,619
am but I'm gonna do that in one motion
not too bad so this is that part yeah

22
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:54,629
not too bad so this is that part yeah
 

23
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:10,000
not too bad so this is that part yeah
this is the tilt and then coming back

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,010

 

25
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,789

and instead of having these two big

26
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:13,799
and instead of having these two big
 

27
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,090

circles or even bleeding them this way

28

let's look at what his center is okay

30
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:21,710
let's look at what his center is okay
 

31
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:27,130
let's look at what his center is okay
his center come up his centers kind of

32
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:27,140
his center come up his centers kind of
 

33
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,340
his center come up his centers kind of
experiencing this kind of force do you

34
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:31,350
experiencing this kind of force do you
 

35
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,240

get it

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,250
