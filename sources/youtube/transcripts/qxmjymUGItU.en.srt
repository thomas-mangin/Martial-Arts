there see if I can so he's come around
 

361
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,069
there see if I can so he's come around
this way right and normally I'd go

362
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:33,079

 

363
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:36,949

here but he turned so sharp so sharp

364
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
here but he turned so sharp so sharp
 

365
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,990
here but he turned so sharp so sharp
this way so it came this

366
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,000
this way so it came this
 

367
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,590
this way so it came this
way I I won't Force the the one of

368
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:42,600
way I I won't Force the the one of
 

369
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,389
way I I won't Force the the one of
thetion poers where is his body going

370
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
thetion poers where is his body going
 

371
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,350
thetion poers where is his body going
keep it going in from where he's is to

372
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:50,360
keep it going in from where he's is to
 

373
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,189
keep it going in from where he's is to
where he's going to one of the kazushi

374
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
where he's going to one of the kazushi
 

375
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,949
where he's going to one of the kazushi
patterns okay and then the way that I

376
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:55,959
patterns okay and then the way that I
 

377
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,470
patterns okay and then the way that I
mean you could do that from the very

378
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:57,480
mean you could do that from the very
 

379
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,670
mean you could do that from the very
beginning right so look

380
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
beginning right so look
 

381
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,389
beginning right so look
see but I like to play in in my gu I

382
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:03,399
see but I like to play in in my gu I
 

383
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,230
see but I like to play in in my gu I
play with it I feel what he's

384
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:07,240
play with it I feel what he's
 

385
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,509
play with it I feel what he's
doing do you get what I'm saying

386
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:10,519
doing do you get what I'm saying
 

387
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,350
doing do you get what I'm saying
so um play a little bit but the

388
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:14,360
so um play a little bit but the
 

389
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,269
so um play a little bit but the
principle is going to be the same

390
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
principle is going to be the same
 

391
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,030
principle is going to be the same
don't you know your destination front in

radical turns and reversals in his

398
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:29,079
radical turns and reversals in his
 

399
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:32,829
radical turns and reversals in his
energy as you get him there so you let

400
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:32,839
energy as you get him there so you let
 

401
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:36,430
energy as you get him there so you let
him decide which one of those he's going

402
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:36,440
him decide which one of those he's going
 

403

here
okay uh

418
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
okay uh
 

419
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,670
okay uh
is kind of gaming it because we we say

420
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
is kind of gaming it because we we say
 

421
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,270
is kind of gaming it because we we say
go slow that's a lot of energy that

422
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,280
go slow that's a lot of energy that
 

423
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,429
go slow that's a lot of energy that
we've be coming at you okay so if you

424
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
we've be coming at you okay so if you

pay attention even like I like to do
 

427
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,390
pay attention even like I like to do
this one right I like to do that one

428
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:15,400
this one right I like to do that one
 

429

back if you pay
 

433
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,029
back if you pay
attention so his energy we'll start from

434
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:24,039
attention so his energy we'll start from
 

435
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,789
attention so his energy we'll start from
the

436
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:25,799
the
 

437
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,190
the
T his energy is going that way you see

438
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
T his energy is going that way you see
 

439
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,470
T his energy is going that way you see
but there's a small turn back that way

440
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
but there's a small turn back that way
 

441
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,480
but there's a small turn back that way
you see um so

442
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:35,490
you see um so
 

443
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,990
you see um so

going
 

449
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,070
going
backwards and you can't uh shove shove

450
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
backwards and you can't uh shove shove
 

451
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,070
backwards and you can't uh shove shove
the other way what's coming forward you

452
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
the other way what's coming forward you
 

453
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,070
the other way what's coming forward you
can't do that you got to harmonize Y and

454
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
can't do that you got to harmonize Y and
 

455
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,390
can't do that you got to harmonize Y and
Y okay so if uh if I'm rocking this one

456
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,400
Y okay so if uh if I'm rocking this one
 

457
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,430
Y okay so if uh if I'm rocking this one
you see I don't go yeah got it you

you see I don't go yeah got it you
 

459
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,070
you see I don't go yeah got it you
you'll you'll see that I'll I'll kind of

460
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,080
you'll you'll see that I'll I'll kind of
 

461
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,070
you'll you'll see that I'll I'll kind of
fade right here you see I always fade so

462
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,080
fade right here you see I always fade so
 

463
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,590

can you feel that
so right now I would do it there but

468
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,000
so right now I would do it there but
 

469
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,950
so right now I would do it there but
same thing when I go here I don't go

470
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
same thing when I go here I don't go
 

471
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,270
same thing when I go here I don't go
boom and I shove them backwards that way

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
see to kind of get that turn going right
 

477
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,950
see to kind of get that turn going right
boom po there

478
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:30,960

you come this way Bo and
 

489
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,630
you come this way Bo and
there's again

490
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:51,640
there's again
 

491
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,870
there's again
okay we not

492
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
okay we not
 

493
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,950
okay we not
here the first one is Boom here
