you have to work with his skeletal
system so when he's down

186
00:06:59,210 --> 00:06:59,220
system so when he's down
 

187
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,550
system so when he's down
a normal katakatane

188
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,560
a normal katakatane
 

189
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,710
a normal katakatane
you're attacking the scapula mechanism

190
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:03,720
you're attacking the scapula mechanism
 

191
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,689
you're attacking the scapula mechanism
okay

192
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:05,699
okay
 

193
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,870
okay
it's not it's not in his elbow so this

194
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
it's not it's not in his elbow so this
 

195
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,670
it's not it's not in his elbow so this
arm

196
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:10,680
arm
 

197
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,309
arm
is going to press this scapula down

198
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:13,319
is going to press this scapula down
 

199
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,809
is going to press this scapula down
towards the ground this way okay

200
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:17,819
towards the ground this way okay
 

201
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,110
towards the ground this way okay
to do that with your legs you would have

202
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
to do that with your legs you would have
 

203
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,210
to do that with your legs you would have
to stand up like I tried to show but

204
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:23,220
to stand up like I tried to show but
 

205
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,710
to stand up like I tried to show but
it's just too tight so we're not going

206
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
it's just too tight so we're not going
 

207
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,050
it's just too tight so we're not going
to do it tonight do you understand so

208
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,060
to do it tonight do you understand so
 

209
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,930
to do it tonight do you understand so
when I'm here like this

210
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:29,940
when I'm here like this
 

211
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,029
when I'm here like this
this foot

212
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:32,039
this foot
 

213
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,089
this foot
imagine I'm here this foot steps up and

214
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:37,099
imagine I'm here this foot steps up and
 

215
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:40,490
imagine I'm here this foot steps up and
that's the same downward pressure you

216
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:40,500
that's the same downward pressure you
 

217
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,870
that's the same downward pressure you
see

218
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:43,880

 

219
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,689

you have uh it's not really cutting a

220
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:47,699
you have uh it's not really cutting a
 

221
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:48,890
you have uh it's not really cutting a
Tama anymore but if you go to your

222
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:48,900
Tama anymore but if you go to your
 

223
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,110
Tama anymore but if you go to your
nebuaza you have the Kimura

224
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,120

 

225
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,689

usually from here right and you're gonna

usually from here right and you're gonna
 

227
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,450
usually from here right and you're gonna
work it I can do a katakatama variation

228
00:07:59,450 --> 00:07:59,460
work it I can do a katakatama variation
 

229
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,790
work it I can do a katakatama variation
here the same way you see how I'm moving

230
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:01,800
here the same way you see how I'm moving
 

231
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,809
here the same way you see how I'm moving
it I move the scapular mechanism or I

232
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:05,819
it I move the scapular mechanism or I
 

233
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,490
it I move the scapular mechanism or I
can attack the elbow

234
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:07,500
can attack the elbow
 

235
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,450
can attack the elbow
you see by rotating elbows goes back

236
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:11,460

the elbow's going towards me
 

251
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,490
the elbow's going towards me
do you see that it's going backwards

252
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:34,500
do you see that it's going backwards
 

253
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,110
do you see that it's going backwards
it's not going forward

the takeaway is leverage it's up here
you see

272
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:57,420
you see
 

273
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,810
you see
and when you get his two arms like this

do it
try to understand that okay the higher

286
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:12,779
try to understand that okay the higher
 

287
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,650
try to understand that okay the higher
the shoulder pin is the harder it is for

288
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:15,660
the shoulder pin is the harder it is for
 

289
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,810
the shoulder pin is the harder it is for
someone to get their hips under them so

290

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:21,420
here you uh do hip control do you see
 

293
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,370
here you uh do hip control do you see
and then you break his other arm

294
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:25,380

 

295
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,710

okay so this

296
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:27,720
okay so this
 

297
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,310
okay so this
is hip control this is the elbow

298
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:31,320
is hip control this is the elbow
 

299
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,710
is hip control this is the elbow
dislocation okay

300
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:33,720
dislocation okay
 

301
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,750
dislocation okay
try it again don't put your weight on

302
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760

back
 

307
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,970
back
that that doesn't work so he puts his

308
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:40,980
that that doesn't work so he puts his
 

309
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,430

was that knee on my back you see uh I
 

313
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,130
was that knee on my back you see uh I
can I'm gonna move because he never

314
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,140
can I'm gonna move because he never
 

315
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,930
can I'm gonna move because he never
really has Arm Control

316
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:50,940
really has Arm Control
 

317
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,210
really has Arm Control
do you understand you're never going to

318
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:53,220
do you understand you're never going to
 

319
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,370
do you understand you're never going to
be heavy enough that I can't move you

320
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:55,380
be heavy enough that I can't move you
 

321
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,590
be heavy enough that I can't move you
that way okay so you're attacking the

322
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
that way okay so you're attacking the
 

323
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,530
that way okay so you're attacking the
elbow with the knee and then the other

324
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:00,540
elbow with the knee and then the other
 

325
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,690
elbow with the knee and then the other
one is hip control bring that up high
