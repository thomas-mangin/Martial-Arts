1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,870

okay so uh the naga euka dynamic is a

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:04,880
okay so uh the naga euka dynamic is a
 

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,310
okay so uh the naga euka dynamic is a
simulated conflict it's a simulated

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,320
simulated conflict it's a simulated
 

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,230
simulated conflict it's a simulated
clash between uh yong and yang okay

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,240
clash between uh yong and yang okay
 

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,509
clash between uh yong and yang okay
and what it's working with is that uh

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:15,519
and what it's working with is that uh
 

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,109
and what it's working with is that uh
you're a young value so all clashes are

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
you're a young value so all clashes are
 

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,790
you're a young value so all clashes are
generated by you

12
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
generated by you
 

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,269
generated by you
okay if you didn't go young against that

14
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
okay if you didn't go young against that
 

15
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,429
okay if you didn't go young against that
yawn you wouldn't have the clash

16
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
yawn you wouldn't have the clash
 

17
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,029
yawn you wouldn't have the clash
so it starts with the yongyang clash

18
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
so it starts with the yongyang clash
 

19
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,509
so it starts with the yongyang clash
which is demonstrated by

20
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
which is demonstrated by
 

21
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,790
which is demonstrated by
uh he's extending and then i push into

22
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
uh he's extending and then i push into
 

23
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,670
uh he's extending and then i push into
that

24
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:35,680
that
 

25
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,950
that
uh extension do you see that

26
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
uh extension do you see that
 

27
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,590
uh extension do you see that
and then his job is to now

28
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
and then his job is to now
 

29
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,830
and then his job is to now
reconcile the young young clash but

30
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:43,840
reconcile the young young clash but
 

31
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,630
reconcile the young young clash but

33
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,590

okay

34
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
okay
 

35
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,910
okay
uh but the problem is

36
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
uh but the problem is
 

37
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,830
uh but the problem is
that our fear

38
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
that our fear
 

39
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,750
that our fear
or our desire

40
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
or our desire
 

41
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,270
or our desire
is going to always add to the clash

42
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
is going to always add to the clash
 

43
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,150
is going to always add to the clash
versus not add to the clash okay

44
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
versus not add to the clash okay
 

45
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,389
versus not add to the clash okay
um and we either have we have two

46
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
um and we either have we have two
 

47
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,149
um and we either have we have two
options at which point either you

48
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
options at which point either you
 

49
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,030
options at which point either you
overpower the clash or you lose the

50
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
overpower the clash or you lose the
 

51
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,710
overpower the clash or you lose the
clash do you see

52
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,720
clash do you see
 

53
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,990
clash do you see
um

54
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
um
 

55
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,510
um
and there's a third option stop clashing

56
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
and there's a third option stop clashing
 

57
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,550
and there's a third option stop clashing
okay

58
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
okay
 

59
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,550
okay
uh that way you don't have to be

60
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
uh that way you don't have to be
 

61
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,710
uh that way you don't have to be
stronger than the other person

62
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
stronger than the other person
 

63
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,910
stronger than the other person
uh and also you have no possibility of

64
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
uh and also you have no possibility of
 

65
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,149

75
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,550
pushing he's pushing whoa
uh and what i'm going to do is just

76
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
uh and what i'm going to do is just
 

77
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,270
uh and what i'm going to do is just
redirect his push over here

78
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
redirect his push over here
 

79
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,910
redirect his push over here
so as opposed to wait wait i'm not ready

80
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
so as opposed to wait wait i'm not ready
 

81
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,389

that's all young do you see instead of

00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
that's all young do you see instead of
 

83
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,270
that's all young do you see instead of
just pushing i just leave them here

84
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280

 

85
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,030

so it's not that i'm leaving him

86
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040

 

87
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,030

is that he's pushing or i let him push

88
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
is that he's pushing or i let him push
 

89
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:03,510
is that he's pushing or i let him push
that over there okay

00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520

 

91
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,510

so i'm not leaving him or pulling him

92
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,520
so i'm not leaving him or pulling him
 

93
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,180

143
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:27,030

okay let's try it again so

144
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040

 

145
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,950

i have in my aikido camouflage
 

147
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,230
i have in my aikido camouflage
so i'm doing the outward spiral the our

148
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
so i'm doing the outward spiral the our
 

149
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,990
so i'm doing the outward spiral the our
spiral goes like this we see it comes

150
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
spiral goes like this we see it comes
 

151
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,830
spiral goes like this we see it comes
back out

152
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
back out
 

153
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,909
back out
but i'm turning my hips so you cannot

154
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
but i'm turning my hips so you cannot
 

155
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,830
but i'm turning my hips so you cannot
see that it's doing that so my hip

156
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
see that it's doing that so my hip
 

157
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,230
see that it's doing that so my hip
change rotation okay but so i'm not

158
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
change rotation okay but so i'm not
 

159
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,430

painting a circle on the ground

160
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
painting a circle on the ground
 

161
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,430
painting a circle on the ground
and it goes like that

162
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
and it goes like that
 

163
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,510
and it goes like that
if i stay still that arm will go like

164
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
if i stay still that arm will go like
 

165
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,950

this

166
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
this
 

167
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,950
this
my arm is going back that way but i turn

168
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
my arm is going back that way but i turn
 

169
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,350
my arm is going back that way but i turn
my hips

170
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
my hips
 

171
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,830

so i'll exaggerate the end is where you

172
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
so i'll exaggerate the end is where you
