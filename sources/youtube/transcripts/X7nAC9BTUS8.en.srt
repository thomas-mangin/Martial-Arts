so when you go here
 

71
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,529
so when you go here
you're going to make a corkscrew shape

72
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:09,539
you're going to make a corkscrew shape
 

73
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,390
you're going to make a corkscrew shape
relax

74
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,400

75
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,010

on

76
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,020
on
 

77
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,350
on
his shoulder

78
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
his shoulder
 

79
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,690
his shoulder
so this movement

80
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:17,700
so this movement
 

81
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,869
so this movement
comes around go ahead and go down like I

82
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
comes around go ahead and go down like I
 

83
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,770
comes around go ahead and go down like I
did it

84
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:21,780
did it
 

85
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,270
did it
and

86
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
and
 

87
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:31,130
and
goes right into the lock rewind

88
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:31,140

 

89
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,770

it's going to Corkscrew

90
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:33,780
it's going to Corkscrew
 

91
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,550
it's going to Corkscrew
and go right into the lock

92
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:37,560
and go right into the lock
 

93
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,670
and go right into the lock
that gives the sensation of tightening

94
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:40,680
that gives the sensation of tightening
 

95
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,830
that gives the sensation of tightening
as opposed to

96
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:42,840
as opposed to
 

97
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,150
as opposed to
down

98
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
down
 

99
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,610
down
then you brought it off and now you're

100
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:46,620
then you brought it off and now you're
 

101
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,070
then you brought it off and now you're
gonna put it on okay

102
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,080
gonna put it on okay
 

103
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:58,490
gonna put it on okay
okay so my recommendation

104
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:58,500

 

105
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,589

is

106
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:00,599
is
 

107
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,570
is
an yogic ritual to release because it is

108
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:05,580
an yogic ritual to release because it is
 

109
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,229
an yogic ritual to release because it is
going to tighten okay

110
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:09,239

you see and it's fluidity

260
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,100

 

261
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:55,610

[Music]

262

263
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,490

but that's also what allows no room for

264
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:58,500
but that's also what allows no room for
 

265
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,350
but that's also what allows no room for
escape okay

266
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360

 

267
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,890

okay so as as you're concentrically

268
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:06,900
okay so as as you're concentrically
 

269
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,309
okay so as as you're concentrically
doing all of those things uh and you're

270
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
doing all of those things uh and you're
 

271
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,370
doing all of those things uh and you're
achieving that beauty

272
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:13,380
achieving that beauty
 

273
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,309
achieving that beauty
um you have to watch your undoing of

274
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
um you have to watch your undoing of
 

275
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,390
um you have to watch your undoing of
things the technique is constantly going

276
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,400
things the technique is constantly going
 

277
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,089
things the technique is constantly going
inward on a spiral so you want to watch

278
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:23,099
inward on a spiral so you want to watch
 

279
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,770
inward on a spiral so you want to watch
your straight lines

280
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:24,780
your straight lines
 

281
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,650
your straight lines
and you want to watch your undoing of it

282
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:27,660
and you want to watch your undoing of it
 

283
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,209
and you want to watch your undoing of it
okay so uh what you're doing very common

284
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:32,219
okay so uh what you're doing very common
 

285
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:33,949
okay so uh what you're doing very common
boom

286
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:33,959
boom
 

287
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,810
boom
around

288
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:35,820
around
 

289
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,550
around
pop

290
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:37,560
pop
 

291
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,130
pop
here all good

292
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:40,140
here all good
 

293
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,250
here all good
here see how it's still going that way

294
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:42,260
here see how it's still going that way
 

295
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,110
here see how it's still going that way
okay and then you come down

296
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
okay and then you come down
 

297
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,350
okay and then you come down
and then you come back

and then you come back
 

299
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,210
and then you come back
and he comes off at that point does it

300
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:50,220
and he comes off at that point does it
 

301
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,730
and he comes off at that point does it
so for example let's unwind the film a

302
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:52,740
so for example let's unwind the film a
 

303
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,750
so for example let's unwind the film a
little

304
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
little
 

305
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,090
little
and if you're

306
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:56,100
and if you're
 

307
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,889
and if you're
an opponent

308
00:08:57,889 --> 00:08:57,899
an opponent
 

309
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,570
an opponent
you would always look for the yin

310
00:08:59,570 --> 00:08:59,580
you would always look for the yin
 

311
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,210
you would always look for the yin
released you see you're doing Jiu Jitsu

312
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:02,220
released you see you're doing Jiu Jitsu
 

313
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,910

okay
 

353
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,829
okay
so we're gonna go down

354
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:54,839
so we're gonna go down
 

355
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,750
so we're gonna go down
and that shoulder is going to go right

356
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:56,760
and that shoulder is going to go right
 

357
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,810
and that shoulder is going to go right
to this knee right you see right to this

358
00:09:59,810 --> 00:09:59,820
to this knee right you see right to this
 

359
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,570
to this knee right you see right to this
knee and feel like your hand does not go

360
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:02,580
knee and feel like your hand does not go
 

361
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,250
knee and feel like your hand does not go
backwards right

362
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,260
backwards right
 

363
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:13,250
backwards right
see

364
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:13,260

 

365
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,790

oh another point I made again in your

366
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
oh another point I made again in your
 

367
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,300
oh another point I made again in your
body

368
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:22,310

 

369
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,690

[Music]

370
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:26,700

 

371
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:32,030

okay

372
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,040

 

373
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,449

okay so we go slow to demonstrate so you

374
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:35,459
okay so we go slow to demonstrate so you
 

375
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,090
okay so we go slow to demonstrate so you
can see and feel okay

376
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,100
can see and feel okay
 

377
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,730
can see and feel okay
um but the physics changes because the

378
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:40,740
um but the physics changes because the
 

379
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,009
um but the physics changes because the
inertia momentum values are all they're

380
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:43,019
inertia momentum values are all they're
 

381
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,470
inertia momentum values are all they're
lowered you see that and then the UK

382
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:45,480
lowered you see that and then the UK
 

383
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,829
lowered you see that and then the UK
will milk the out of it and uh and

384
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:48,839
will milk the out of it and uh and
 

385
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,410
will milk the out of it and uh and
then you get a uh inaccurate

386
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:51,420
then you get a uh inaccurate
 

387
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,389
then you get a uh inaccurate
understanding of what is going on okay

388
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:53,399
understanding of what is going on okay
 

389
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,130
understanding of what is going on okay
so we go okay

390
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:58,140

 

391
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,210

the arm is is more easily extendable as

392
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:02,220
the arm is is more easily extendable as
 

393
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,750
the arm is is more easily extendable as
you keep the energy going

394
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760

 

395
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,370

when we go here and all I have is this

396
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:10,380
when we go here and all I have is this
 

397
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,829
when we go here and all I have is this
tiny lever of push pull you can put your

398
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839
tiny lever of push pull you can put your
 

399
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,350
tiny lever of push pull you can put your
hand on the mat come on make it go do

400
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
hand on the mat come on make it go do
 

401
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,990
hand on the mat come on make it go do
you see okay but when you add the energy

402
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,000

 

403
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,110

not let that arm die that's an example

404
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,120
not let that arm die that's an example
 

405
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,930
not let that arm die that's an example
do you see yes okay now we come around

406
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:26,940
do you see yes okay now we come around
 

407
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,550
do you see yes okay now we come around
here

408
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
here
 

409
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,990
here
okay

410
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
okay
 

411
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,790
okay
and uh again she's all Slinky do you see

412
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
and uh again she's all Slinky do you see
 

413
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,329
and uh again she's all Slinky do you see
it's all Slinky do you get it go back

414
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:37,339
it's all Slinky do you get it go back
 

415
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:40,850
it's all Slinky do you get it go back
but I do the movement oh

416
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:40,860
but I do the movement oh
 

417
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,130
but I do the movement oh
the whole body

418
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,140
the whole body
 

419
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,710
the whole body
we get it okay so look at your the

420
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:45,720
we get it okay so look at your the
 

421
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,769
we get it okay so look at your the
length of your body all right and then

422
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:48,779
length of your body all right and then
 

423
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,250
length of your body all right and then
same thing here you were able to put

424
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:52,260
same thing here you were able to put
 

425
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,130
same thing here you were able to put
your knees under and then we get in this

426
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,140
your knees under and then we get in this
 

427
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,449
your knees under and then we get in this
weird position

428
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:56,459
weird position
 

429
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,550
weird position
go back where you were

430
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
go back where you were
 

431
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,009
go back where you were
you're all sprawled out

432
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:01,019
you're all sprawled out
 

433
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,430
you're all sprawled out
you get it we just threw her and I'm

434
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:04,440
you get it we just threw her and I'm
 

435
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,030
you get it we just threw her and I'm
gonna actually lengthen her more

436
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,040
gonna actually lengthen her more
 

437
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,030
gonna actually lengthen her more
do you see she's not on her knees you

438
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
do you see she's not on her knees you
 

439
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,370
do you see she's not on her knees you
get it and so you're in this position

440
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:13,380
get it and so you're in this position
 

441
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,329
get it and so you're in this position
now

442
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:14,339
now
 

443
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,370
now
do you understand hey do you guys see

444
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:16,380
do you understand hey do you guys see
 

445
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,069
do you understand hey do you guys see
that okay so

446
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:19,079
that okay so
 

447
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,210
that okay so
if I if you're okay and we're going slow

448
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,220
if I if you're okay and we're going slow
 

449
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,889
if I if you're okay and we're going slow
go ahead

450
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:24,899
go ahead
 

451
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,829
go ahead
you don't want to milk the lower

452
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
you don't want to milk the lower
 

453
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,670
you don't want to milk the lower
energetic values you keep the form okay

454
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
energetic values you keep the form okay
 

455
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,370
energetic values you keep the form okay
okay

456
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:33,380
okay
 

457
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,290
okay
boom that's it

458
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:36,300
boom that's it
 

459
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,290
boom that's it
uh your body will move as a unit

460
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:39,300
uh your body will move as a unit
 

461
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,750
uh your body will move as a unit
all the way there you go

462
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:44,760

 

463
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,730

and then you have a more realistic

464
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:46,740
and then you have a more realistic
 

465
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,250
and then you have a more realistic
understanding of what that final move

466
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:49,260
understanding of what that final move
 

467
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,889
understanding of what that final move
does it takes the turtle out of them

468
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:51,899
does it takes the turtle out of them
 

469
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,370
does it takes the turtle out of them
okay that arm's not all lowered and

470
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:55,380
okay that arm's not all lowered and
 

471
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,269
okay that arm's not all lowered and
bunched up like that okay

472
00:12:58,269 --> 00:12:58,279
bunched up like that okay
 

473
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,370
bunched up like that okay
I'd still break that arm though if I had

474
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:01,380
I'd still break that arm though if I had
 

475
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,610
I'd still break that arm though if I had
okay so another common straight line as

476
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:04,620
okay so another common straight line as
 

477
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,610
okay so another common straight line as
you're going around

478
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:10,620

 

479
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,110

is this knee is gonna go

480
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
is this knee is gonna go
 

481
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,970
is this knee is gonna go
I'll just leave your arm there for a

482
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:16,980
I'll just leave your arm there for a
 

483
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,889
I'll just leave your arm there for a
second this knee is going to go this way

484
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:18,899
second this knee is going to go this way
 

485
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,190
second this knee is going to go this way
that's a straight line see that and it

486
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:22,200
that's a straight line see that and it
 

487
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,050
that's a straight line see that and it
was cutting across the circle that's

488
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,060
was cutting across the circle that's
 

489
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,650
was cutting across the circle that's
going this way so we rewind the film

490
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:27,660
going this way so we rewind the film
 

491
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,069
going this way so we rewind the film
okay here uh here

492
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:31,079
okay here uh here
 

493
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,650
okay here uh here
I'm going to make this shoulder stay on

494
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:33,660
I'm going to make this shoulder stay on
 

495
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,050
I'm going to make this shoulder stay on
the circle and meet this knee over here

496
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:36,060
the circle and meet this knee over here
 

497
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,569
the circle and meet this knee over here
as opposed to put that shoulder down and

498
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:38,579
as opposed to put that shoulder down and
 

499
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,269
as opposed to put that shoulder down and
my knee goes to you high so it goes in

500
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
my knee goes to you high so it goes in
 

501
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,690
my knee goes to you high so it goes in
the circle

502
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:44,700

 

503
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,430

that might

504
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:46,440
that might
 

505
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,850
that might
make this other knee not touch you all

506
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:49,860
make this other knee not touch you all
 

507
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,150
make this other knee not touch you all
right that is not important okay the

508
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,160
right that is not important okay the
 

509
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,230
right that is not important okay the
shoulder pin is this knee stopping you

510
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:57,240
shoulder pin is this knee stopping you
 

511
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,250
shoulder pin is this knee stopping you
going forward all right you see hi

512
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:01,260
going forward all right you see hi
 

513
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,069
going forward all right you see hi
stop you going forward that's what adds

514
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
stop you going forward that's what adds
 

515
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,170
stop you going forward that's what adds
to right to the dislocation let's go

516
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:06,180
to right to the dislocation let's go
 

517
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,509
to right to the dislocation let's go
right there okay hi

518
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:08,519
right there okay hi
 

519
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,850
right there okay hi
so I would never

520
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:10,860
so I would never
 

521
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,769
so I would never
if you're down just

522
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:12,779
if you're down just
 

523
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,990
if you're down just
sometimes you'll hear

524
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,000
sometimes you'll hear
 

525
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,110
sometimes you'll hear
like I'm pinching High I'm pinching you

526
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,120
like I'm pinching High I'm pinching you
 

527
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,889
like I'm pinching High I'm pinching you
and I'm holding you and don't know

528
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:21,899
and I'm holding you and don't know
 

529
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,990
and I'm holding you and don't know
you're not standing

530
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,000
you're not standing
 

531
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,069
you're not standing
it's not it okay

532
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079

 

533
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,810

so it's

534
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:29,820
so it's
 

535
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,470
so it's
bring his shoulder into this knee in the

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:33,480
bring his shoulder into this knee in the
 

537
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,110
bring his shoulder into this knee in the
arm into the spiral

538
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,120
arm into the spiral
 

539
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,170
arm into the spiral
same thing going back to you lace when

540
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:39,180
same thing going back to you lace when
 

541
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,949
same thing going back to you lace when
you get here right you were here

542
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
you get here right you were here
 

543
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,410
you get here right you were here
let's say you're fine

544
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:45,420
let's say you're fine
 

545
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,769
let's say you're fine
don't have your hands

546
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:48,779
don't have your hands
 

547
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:53,329
don't have your hands
undo the spiral

548
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:53,339

 

549
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,730

your hands will continue to do the

550
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:55,740
your hands will continue to do the
 

551
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,629
your hands will continue to do the
circle so push down and this hand is

552
00:14:59,629 --> 00:14:59,639
circle so push down and this hand is
 

553
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,430
circle so push down and this hand is
going to come around

554
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
going to come around
 

555
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,689
going to come around
this way

556
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:02,699
this way
 

557
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,850
this way
not a straight line

558
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:04,860
not a straight line
 

559
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,990
not a straight line
so we're here right if this hand is

560
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,000
so we're here right if this hand is
 

561
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,370
so we're here right if this hand is
going to paint the circle this way

562
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:13,380
going to paint the circle this way
 

563
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,650
going to paint the circle this way
you see and this hand is going to paint

564
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:15,660
you see and this hand is going to paint
 

565
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,329
you see and this hand is going to paint
that Circle

566
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:17,339
that Circle
 

567
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,650
that Circle
this way

568
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:18,660
this way
 

569
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,110
this way
so my body's going here into

570
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
so my body's going here into
 

571
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,230
so my body's going here into
as opposed to here you see the straight

572
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
as opposed to here you see the straight
 

573
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:33,670
as opposed to here you see the straight
line so

574
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680

 

575
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,009

you see they're still in the circles

576
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:37,019
you see they're still in the circles
 

577
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,530
you see they're still in the circles
right locked

578
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:39,540
right locked
 

579
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,870
right locked
my knee happened to match attention's

580
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:41,880
my knee happened to match attention's
 

581
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,750
my knee happened to match attention's
body but not important to me

582
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:47,760

 

583
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:59,509

I missed it okay

584
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519

 

585
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,949

my arms paint the same Circle

586
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:03,959

 

587
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,110

okay

588
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,120
okay
 

589
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,509
okay
try

590
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:08,519
try
 

591
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,889
try
okay so uh we're going and what I said

592
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:12,899
okay so uh we're going and what I said
 

593
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,769
okay so uh we're going and what I said
was you should feel free

594
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:15,779
was you should feel free
 

595
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,710
was you should feel free
to move your knee

596
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
to move your knee
 

597
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,990
to move your knee
because what this is doing tactically

598
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,000
because what this is doing tactically
 

599
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,449
because what this is doing tactically
again you wouldn't necessarily be so

600
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:23,459
again you wouldn't necessarily be so
 

601
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,910
again you wouldn't necessarily be so
turtle is taking away the turtle

602
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
turtle is taking away the turtle
 

603
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,670
turtle is taking away the turtle
potential okay meaning you want to lay

604
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:28,680
potential okay meaning you want to lay
 

605
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,910
potential okay meaning you want to lay
him out okay so let's let's say he's

606
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
him out okay so let's let's say he's
 

607
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,610
him out okay so let's let's say he's
he's pretty turnable right now but it

608
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:34,620
he's pretty turnable right now but it
 

609
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,410
he's pretty turnable right now but it
wouldn't be like that at full speed okay

610
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:36,420
wouldn't be like that at full speed okay
 

611
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,829
wouldn't be like that at full speed okay
but let's say he is here if I take this

612
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
but let's say he is here if I take this
 

613
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,769
but let's say he is here if I take this
down to where that knee is he won't be

614
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:42,779
down to where that knee is he won't be
 

615
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:48,170
down to where that knee is he won't be
uh spread out so I'm I'm got here

616
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:48,180
uh spread out so I'm I'm got here
 

617
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,810
uh spread out so I'm I'm got here
right I'm I'll move that leg again

618
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:50,820
right I'm I'll move that leg again
 

619
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,730
right I'm I'll move that leg again
because the main goal is to get the

620
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:52,740
because the main goal is to get the
 

621
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,490
because the main goal is to get the
Shoulder on the ground and to deturtle

Shoulder on the ground and to deturtle
 

623
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,009
Shoulder on the ground and to deturtle
him so I might move it again

624
00:16:58,009 --> 00:16:58,019
him so I might move it again
 

625
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,350
him so I might move it again
excuse me and then there's there's the

626
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:00,360
excuse me and then there's there's the
 

627
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,470
excuse me and then there's there's the
circle and I keep it though okay

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:03,480
circle and I keep it though okay
 

629
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,449
circle and I keep it though okay
um as opposed to uh when I saw you doing

630
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:07,459
um as opposed to uh when I saw you doing
 

631
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,990
um as opposed to uh when I saw you doing
coming around and you're deterling

straight

634
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:13,620
straight
 

635
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,590
straight
do you see that all right

636
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
do you see that all right
 

637
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,549
do you see that all right
again that's gonna let him out again the

638
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:19,559
again that's gonna let him out again the
 

639
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,010
again that's gonna let him out again the
same thing that adds to the grace and

640
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,020
same thing that adds to the grace and
 

641
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,289
same thing that adds to the grace and
the beauty and the harmonization of the

642
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:24,299
the beauty and the harmonization of the
 

643
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,569
the beauty and the harmonization of the
yin and yang and the martial viability

644

yin and yang and the martial viability
 

645
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,350
yin and yang and the martial viability
and the mechanical advantages right

646
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:30,360
and the mechanical advantages right
 

647
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,110
and the mechanical advantages right
the opposite of all those things

648
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
the opposite of all those things
 

649
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,570
the opposite of all those things
is going to come from undoing the

650
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:35,580
is going to come from undoing the
 

651
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,770
is going to come from undoing the
pattern so if I try to go straight here

652
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:39,780
pattern so if I try to go straight here
 

653
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,409
pattern so if I try to go straight here
that's where he's going to get out

654
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:42,419
that's where he's going to get out
 

655
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,630
that's where he's going to get out
do you understand get your ass out of

okay but

662
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:49,620
okay but
 

663
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,150
okay but
he tries to go forward now it actually

664
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:53,160
he tries to go forward now it actually
 

665
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,770
he tries to go forward now it actually
makes the other technique work better

666
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:54,780
makes the other technique work better
 

667
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,650
makes the other technique work better
because his energy is now more energy is

668
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:57,660
because his energy is now more energy is
 

669
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,190
because his energy is now more energy is
being brought into the

being brought into the
um centripetal energy got it and every

672
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
um centripetal energy got it and every
 

673
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,010
um centripetal energy got it and every
time he touches the ground I have

674
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,020
time he touches the ground I have
 

675
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,350
time he touches the ground I have
another Coq point that I can now

676
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
another Coq point that I can now
 

677

internally launch him deeper and deeper

678
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:11,700
internally launch him deeper and deeper
 

679
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,090
internally launch him deeper and deeper
into the inner spiral okay

680
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,100
into the inner spiral okay
 

681
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,190
into the inner spiral okay
okay

682
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200

 

683
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,430

do you see that hole down you held her

684
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:22,440
do you see that hole down you held her
 

685
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,669
do you see that hole down you held her
elbow down against her her resistance to

686
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:25,679
elbow down against her her resistance to
 

687
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,810
elbow down against her her resistance to
