00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,500
Happy new year everybody

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,860
To welcome so many of you today

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,720
to celebrate this year's Hombu Dojo Kagamibiraki,

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,480
fills me with joy.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:30,240
This is made possible thanks to the support and cooperation of everybody.

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,360
I would like to thank you from the bottom
of my heart.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,880
This is where we stand today, on the grounds of this dojo,

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:48,240
that in 1932, the Founder established the Ueshiba Dojo.

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,320
In 1968, the Second Doshu Kisshomaru,

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,400
turned the original [wooden] structure into the present reinforced concrete dojo.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,160
Today it has been 50 years.

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:09,360
Today, Aikido has spread to, and unified people from around 130 countries.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,280
Last year, I gave a seminar during the 50th anniversary of Argentinian Aikido.

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,280
The event was an occasion for 1000 people to get together.

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,040
During my journey, I passed the Strait of
Magellan

16
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,760
and visited the small island of Ushuaia.

17
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,640
There too, there were 50 people practicing Aikido.

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,400
Moreover,

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,520
the Hombu Dojo-cho Ueshiba Mitsuteru held a seminar in Cape Town,  at the southwestern tip of Africa,

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:54,480
to celebrate Republic of Africa's 40th Aikido anniversary.

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,080
Those events took place at he southwestern tips of both Africa and America.

22
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,200
He [Hombu Dojo-cho] also went to Iceland, which is the northernmost land.

23
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,920
In these places, there are people who are diligently training in Aikido.

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:19,920
I believe that it is the thanks to the wonderful nature of the Founder's Aikido,

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,960
and the diligent training and transmission
by many people, from then up to today,

26
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,760
that the creation of such a wide circle of
unity was possible.

27
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:45,280
Of course, it is my duty to maintain
this flow of transmission of Aikido in its correct form, to the next generation,

28
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,840
and to contribute to society by using the positive values learnt through Aikido in daily life.

29
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:00,600
This is what I think we ought to do.

30
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,240
If we want to achieve this, we will need to
continue training in a diligent and resolute manner.

31
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:13,680
I hope to continue, this journey with you
all, together,

32
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:23,080
so please, this year again, keep on training hard.

33
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,520
Thank you very much.
