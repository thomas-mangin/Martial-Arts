1
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,150

it's not turned

2
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,160

 

3
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,069

it doesn't matter which side you want to

4
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
it doesn't matter which side you want to
 

5
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,549
it doesn't matter which side you want to
go to because the spiral can be

6
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
go to because the spiral can be
 

7
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,229
go to because the spiral can be
generated from this angle

8
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
generated from this angle
 

9
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,189
generated from this angle
the spiral

10
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199

 

11
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,950

you are going to yield

12
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960

 

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,789

how far do you heal when he hits zero

14
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
how far do you heal when he hits zero
 

15
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:22,789
how far do you heal when he hits zero
okay so he hits zero

16
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799

 

17
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,190

you have to reconcile

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
you have to reconcile
 

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,710
you have to reconcile
this one

20
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
this one
 

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:48,540
this one
this way

22
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:48,550

 

23
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:54,469

[Music]

24
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479

 

25
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:17,030

different

26
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040

 

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:31,509

not too young

28
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:31,519

 

29
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:47,509

uh

30
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519

 

31
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,949

wow

32
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959

 

33
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,030

uh so this this pattern is a

34
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
uh so this this pattern is a
 

35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,229
uh so this this pattern is a
key

36
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239

 

37
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,430

this pattern this pattern

38
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440

 

39
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,790

this this is

40
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
this this is
 

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,509
this this is
the fight is inspiring

42
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
the fight is inspiring
 

43
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,949
the fight is inspiring
okay

44
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
okay
 

45
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,309
okay
it doesn't matter

46
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
it doesn't matter
 

47
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,030
it doesn't matter
he's here right you know

48
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
he's here right you know
 

49
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,830
he's here right you know
you see how i did that same time okay

50
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
you see how i did that same time okay
 

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,990
you see how i did that same time okay
so that's why i don't i don't really

52
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
so that's why i don't i don't really
 

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,830
so that's why i don't i don't really
care if you do it with multiple steps

54
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
care if you do it with multiple steps
 

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,789
care if you do it with multiple steps
you know

56
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799

 

57
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,229

you don't have to be you know mr kamaya

58
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
you don't have to be you know mr kamaya
 

59
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,350
you don't have to be you know mr kamaya
okay

60
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
okay
 

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,869
okay
but

62
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
but
 

63
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,910
but
it's off to the back diagonal

64
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
it's off to the back diagonal
 

65
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,270
it's off to the back diagonal
okay

66
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
okay
 

67
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,509
okay
so here this way

68
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519

 

69
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,750

it could be this way

70
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
it could be this way
 

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,270
it could be this way
you see

72
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
you see
 

73
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,190
you see
okay this matters

74
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200

 

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,030

but again

76
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
but again
 

77
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,830
but again
it's not this

78
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840

 

79
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,110

you're fading into the spiral that's

82
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
you're fading into the spiral that's
 

83
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,509
you're fading into the spiral that's
that's the footwork you want that's the

84
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
that's the footwork you want that's the
 

85
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,990
that's the footwork you want that's the
the uh thai sabaki you want how do i

86
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
the uh thai sabaki you want how do i
 

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,830
the uh thai sabaki you want how do i
fade into the spiral

88
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840
fade into the spiral
 

89
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,069
fade into the spiral
okay um

90
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079

 

91
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,629

then the second one you have is

92
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
then the second one you have is
 

93
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,510
then the second one you have is
the question is how far do i pay

94
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
the question is how far do i pay
 

95
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,390
the question is how far do i pay
fake when he hits zero

96
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
fake when he hits zero
 

97
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,830
fake when he hits zero
okay so in other words i'm here

98
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
okay so in other words i'm here
 

99
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,710
okay so in other words i'm here
oh that's not zero

100
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
oh that's not zero
 

101
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,150
oh that's not zero
okay

102
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
okay
 

103
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:54,870
okay
so fade till he hits zero

104
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880

 

105
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,670

just shy of zero do you understand

106
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680

 

107
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,510

because you're gonna do the next phase

108
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
because you're gonna do the next phase
 

109
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,070
because you're gonna do the next phase
so as he's coming in

110
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
so as he's coming in
 

111
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,870
so as he's coming in
instead of shoving him back that way

112
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
instead of shoving him back that way
 

113
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,350
instead of shoving him back that way
he you're gonna do a kind of

114
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
he you're gonna do a kind of
 

115
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,189
he you're gonna do a kind of
a niche on his head

116
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
a niche on his head
 

117
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,469
a niche on his head
kodagash on his head

118
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479

 

119
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,070

you get that

120
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
you get that
 

121
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,469
you get that
so don't go here

122
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
so don't go here
 

123
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,950
so don't go here
and boom here

124
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
and boom here
 

125
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,189
and boom here
you're gonna go here there's his head

126
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
you're gonna go here there's his head
 

127
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,749
you're gonna go here there's his head
and around

128
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
and around
 

129
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,710
and around
you see that

130
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720

 

131
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,710

and that way he go he's

132
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
and that way he go he's
 

133
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,469
and that way he go he's
he's not going backwards yet you see

134
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
he's not going backwards yet you see
 

135
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,550
he's not going backwards yet you see
he's not going backwards but when i take

136
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
he's not going backwards but when i take
 

137
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,790
he's not going backwards but when i take
his head around then he's going

138
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
his head around then he's going
 

139
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,670
his head around then he's going
backwards

140
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680

 

141
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,749

then i can enter because

142
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
then i can enter because
 

143
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,990
then i can enter because
he's going that way and i'm going with

144
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
he's going that way and i'm going with
 

145
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,189
he's going that way and i'm going with
him he goes that way he has a you know

146
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
him he goes that way he has a you know
 

147
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,510
him he goes that way he has a you know
if i if he's still going forward when i

148
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
if i if he's still going forward when i
 

149
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,430
if i if he's still going forward when i
enter this is a clash and you're just

150
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
enter this is a clash and you're just
 

151
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,749
enter this is a clash and you're just
trying to overpower someone he has to be

152
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
trying to overpower someone he has to be
 

153
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,390
trying to overpower someone he has to be
going the other way so

154
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400

 

155
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,230

without the entry you see okay

156
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
without the entry you see okay
 

157
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,029
without the entry you see okay
so when i enter don't enter where he's

158
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
so when i enter don't enter where he's
 

159
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,029
so when i enter don't enter where he's
falling

160
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
falling
 

161
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,870
falling
so even though his head goes that way

162
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
so even though his head goes that way
 

163
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,350
so even though his head goes that way
i am not entering that one

164
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
i am not entering that one
 

165
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,590
i am not entering that one
you could i you could

166
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600

 

167
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,510

but we're doing the x-patch

168
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520

 

169
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,790

you see so

170
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
you see so
 

171
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,870
you see so
head goes one way

172
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
head goes one way
 

173
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:39,909
head goes one way
boom there it is

174
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919

 

175
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,990

okay

176
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
okay
 

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,150
okay
let's go okay so the question is the

178
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
let's go okay so the question is the
 

179
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,070
let's go okay so the question is the
kodak on the neck okay well let's make

180
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
kodak on the neck okay well let's make
 

181

435
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,430

that's not you're in the wrong place

437
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,509

we don't have that rank that title
 

439
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,829
we don't have that rank that title
there's just what we're doing what are

440
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
there's just what we're doing what are
 

441
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,629
there's just what we're doing what are
we doing and what is worth doing

442
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639

 

443
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,389

it can't be

444
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:58,399
it can't be
 

445
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,590
it can't be
technical artistry it can't be

446
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
technical artistry it can't be
 

447
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,230
technical artistry it can't be
and it can't be martial prowess it can't

448
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
and it can't be martial prowess it can't
 

449
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,350
and it can't be martial prowess it can't
be these are temporary things

450
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
be these are temporary things
 

451
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:17,350
be these are temporary things
worldly things meaningless things

452
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360

 

453
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,030

but reconciling fear

454
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040

 

455
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,629

that's a real thing

456
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639

 

457
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,749

we use it's a budo so we use

458
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:31,759
we use it's a budo so we use
 

459
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,590
we use it's a budo so we use
the training in martial arts

460
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
the training in martial arts
 

461
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,110
the training in martial arts
and here's the one the part you don't

462
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
and here's the one the part you don't
 

463
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,670
and here's the one the part you don't
like we use the training in martial arts

464
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
like we use the training in martial arts
 

465
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,069
like we use the training in martial arts
to generate fear

466
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
to generate fear
 

467
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,629
to generate fear
in you

468
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639

 

469
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,949

so that you can reconcile fear

470
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959

 

471
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,030

you can't work on

472
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
you can't work on
 

473
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,110
you can't work on
what you don't put on the work bench

474
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120

 

475
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,749

do you understand

476
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:01,759
do you understand
 

477
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,030
do you understand
so we use that training

478
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040

 

479
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,590

but the goal is not the martial arts

480
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
but the goal is not the martial arts
 

481
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,749
but the goal is not the martial arts
training

482
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759

 

483
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,069

and so for that reason

484
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
and so for that reason
 

485
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,269
and so for that reason
it's wherever you're facing fear

486
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
it's wherever you're facing fear
 

487
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,350
it's wherever you're facing fear
that is the training

488
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
that is the training
 

489
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,910
that is the training
not the technique

490
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
not the technique
 

491
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,949
not the technique
or not just the technique

492
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
or not just the technique
 

493
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,470
or not just the technique
so sometimes it's

494
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480

 

495
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,470

the uk is coming at you and you're

496
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
the uk is coming at you and you're
 

497
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,150
the uk is coming at you and you're
you're afraid you're afraid of failure

498
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
you're afraid you're afraid of failure
 

499
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,990
you're afraid you're afraid of failure
you're afraid of not getting it you're

500
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
you're afraid of not getting it you're
 

501
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,389
you're afraid of not getting it you're
afraid of how you're going to look to

502
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
afraid of how you're going to look to
 

503
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,870
afraid of how you're going to look to
people all that is [\h__\h] up well that's

504
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
people all that is [\h__\h] up well that's
 

505
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,790
people all that is [\h__\h] up well that's
why we're working on it

506
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800
why we're working on it
 

507
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,269
why we're working on it
all that stuff leads to your suffering

508
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
all that stuff leads to your suffering
 

509

all that stuff leads to your suffering

and to the generation of your suffering
 

511
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,389
and to the generation of your suffering
it just keeps going

512
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
it just keeps going
 

513
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,069
it just keeps going
you are out of alignment

514
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079

 

515
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,629

you're broken

516
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
you're broken
 

517
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,550
you're broken
but you don't just break yourself you

518
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560
but you don't just break yourself you
 

519
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,150
but you don't just break yourself you
start breaking everything you want to

520
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,160
start breaking everything you want to
 

521
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,029
start breaking everything you want to
break everything

522
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039

 

523
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,710

so that then

524
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
so that then
 

525
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,350
so that then
we watch the fear in the ukemi

526
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,360

902
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:58,720
but he's yielding you see he's doing the
 

903

yield
he's doing the yin yield do you see the

906
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,320
he's doing the yin yield do you see the
 

907
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,269
he's doing the yin yield do you see the
yin yield into the spiraling geometry

908
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:07,279
yin yield into the spiraling geometry
 

909
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,950
yin yield into the spiraling geometry
this is an important geometry if you

910
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:08,960
this is an important geometry if you
 

911
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,789
this is an important geometry if you
watch the old films of both sensei

that's all he did this particular one
okay but

916
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:15,360
okay but
 

917
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,789
okay but
if you watch our films where we're doing

918
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
if you watch our films where we're doing
 

919
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,870
if you watch our films where we're doing
anything goes and the guy's punching and

anything goes and the guy's punching and
 

921
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,870
anything goes and the guy's punching and
kicking you're going to watch me do that

922
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:22,880
kicking you're going to watch me do that
 

923
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,630
kicking you're going to watch me do that
same yin yield into the spiraling

924
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:24,640
same yin yield into the spiraling
 

925
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,669
same yin yield into the spiraling
geometry do you see that because

926
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:27,679
geometry do you see that because
 

927
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,389
geometry do you see that because
the next thing the guy tries to do is

928
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:30,399
the next thing the guy tries to do is
 

929
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,110
the next thing the guy tries to do is
turn really sharp into where i'm at and

930

turn really sharp into where i'm at and
 

931
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,990
turn really sharp into where i'm at and
that takes them into the throes

932
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,000
that takes them into the throes
 

933
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,549
that takes them into the throes
you see that

934
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:40,559

 

935
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,950

so you just work on this do you see

936
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:42,960
so you just work on this do you see
 

937
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,510
so you just work on this do you see
if you watched on the video again i i

945
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,630

so i have to bring fear to the technique

946
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
so i have to bring fear to the technique
 

947
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,110
so i have to bring fear to the technique
the fear we're using here is

948
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,120
the fear we're using here is
 

949

975
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,230

right it's again going back to the

976
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,240
right it's again going back to the
 

977

do you see
 

993
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,630
do you see
that's enough to generate the fear that

994
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:00,640
that's enough to generate the fear that
 

995
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,430
that's enough to generate the fear that
now lets her practice on acceptance

996
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,440

very gentle throw do you see
 

1009
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,389
very gentle throw do you see
so i'm not going hey

1010
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:22,399
so i'm not going hey
 

1011
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,789
so i'm not going hey
you're my dishy [\h__\h] off do you get it

1012
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799
you're my dishy [\h__\h] off do you get it
 

1013
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,389
you're my dishy [\h__\h] off do you get it
this this is the place to work on food

1014
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
this this is the place to work on food
 

1015
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,710
this this is the place to work on food
right it's enough

1016
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:32,720
right it's enough
 

1017
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,710
right it's enough
do what you can

1018

1021
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,149

but in this way it's very confusion

1022
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:44,159
but in this way it's very confusion
 

1023
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,389
but in this way it's very confusion
because you do what you can and you do

1024
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:46,399
because you do what you can and you do
 

1025

1031
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,909
i can't that's very woke
which is the opposite of confusion budo

1032
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
which is the opposite of confusion budo
 

1033
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,269
which is the opposite of confusion budo
has a confusion element to it you see so

1034
00:29:59,269 --> 00:29:59,279
