1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,990

let's do it from

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,000
let's do it from
 

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,870
let's do it from
my I just want to work on

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:07,880
my I just want to work on
 

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:15,430
my I just want to work on
the this part

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440

 

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:58,709

here don't really care how you get

8
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719

 

9
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,349

all right we have to empoy the same

10
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:02,359
all right we have to empoy the same
 

11
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,189
all right we have to empoy the same
thing we always

12
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,199
thing we always
 

13
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,950
thing we always
do we're not going to come up with a

14
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:06,960
do we're not going to come up with a
 

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,590
do we're not going to come up with a
different way

16
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:10,600

 

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,789

of generating a falling geometry okay

18
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:15,799
of generating a falling geometry okay
 

19
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,310
of generating a falling geometry okay
this is's a couple things different in

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:17,320
this is's a couple things different in
 

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,510
this is's a couple things different in
this one however from the when I

22
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:20,520
this one however from the when I
 

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,109
this one however from the when I
introduced the concepts to you they were

24
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
introduced the concepts to you they were
 

25
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,630
introduced the concepts to you they were
in

26
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
in
 

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,149
in
Naga okay we're we're now in pinning

28
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
Naga okay we're we're now in pinning
 

29
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,469
Naga okay we're we're now in pinning
technique so there's a there's one

30
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
technique so there's a there's one
 

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,230
technique so there's a there's one
subtle difference and that is that in

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
subtle difference and that is that in
 

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,069
subtle difference and that is that in
Naga I don't want the person near me I

34
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
Naga I don't want the person near me I
 

35
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,670
Naga I don't want the person near me I
want them to fall away from me but in

36
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:40,680
want them to fall away from me but in
 

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,069
want them to fall away from me but in
pinning techniques I want them under me

38
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
pinning techniques I want them under me
 

39
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,429
pinning techniques I want them under me
okay and the only thing that changes

40
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
okay and the only thing that changes
 

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,870
okay and the only thing that changes
there there in is how much I

42
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
there there in is how much I
 

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,510
there there in is how much I
displace their

44
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
displace their
 

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,550
displace their
Center uh outside of the Spiral okay so

46
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
Center uh outside of the Spiral okay so
 

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,550
Center uh outside of the Spiral okay so
we know we know

48
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
we know we know
 

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,550
we know we know
that um I'm in my x pattern right so

50
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
that um I'm in my x pattern right so
 

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,990
that um I'm in my x pattern right so
let's just

52
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
let's just
 

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,309
let's just
two-dimensionally you're you're going to

54
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
two-dimensionally you're you're going to
 

55
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,110
two-dimensionally you're you're going to
establish a

56
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,120
establish a
 

57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,470
establish a
spiral with uh

58
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
spiral with uh
 

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,710
spiral with uh
UK UK center of gravity okay uh it's

60
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
UK UK center of gravity okay uh it's
 

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,509
UK UK center of gravity okay uh it's
going to go in the vertical in the

62
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:21,519
going to go in the vertical in the
 

63
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,030
going to go in the vertical in the
vertical plane uh in a circular fashion

64
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
vertical plane uh in a circular fashion
 

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,869
vertical plane uh in a circular fashion
and so now it's in the horizontal plane

66
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
and so now it's in the horizontal plane
 

67
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,390
and so now it's in the horizontal plane
so I'm either going to bring it up or

68
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
so I'm either going to bring it up or
 

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,430
so I'm either going to bring it up or
down at some point

70
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:30,440
down at some point
 

71
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,670
down at some point
probably both I'm going to bring it left

72
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:32,680
probably both I'm going to bring it left
 

73
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,070
probably both I'm going to bring it left
or right at some point and I'm also

74
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,080
or right at some point and I'm also
 

75
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,949
or right at some point and I'm also
traversing the mat so it's also moving

76
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:37,959
traversing the mat so it's also moving
 

77
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,990
traversing the mat so it's also moving
through the sagittal plane and once I

78
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,000
through the sagittal plane and once I
 

79
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,910
through the sagittal plane and once I
establish that Center that spiral I will

80
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
establish that Center that spiral I will
 

81
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,790
establish that Center that spiral I will
acknowledge where well where is the axis

82
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:49,800
acknowledge where well where is the axis
 

83
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,030
acknowledge where well where is the axis
of this

84
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
of this
 

85
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,350
of this
rotation uh once the spiral is

86
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
rotation uh once the spiral is
 

87
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,030
rotation uh once the spiral is
established and once I have that spiral

88
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,040
established and once I have that spiral
 

89
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,149
established and once I have that spiral
once I have this axis of

90
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159
once I have this axis of
 

91
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,030
once I have this axis of
rotation at the time that I want them to

92
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
rotation at the time that I want them to
 

93
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,750
rotation at the time that I want them to
fall I am going to let's say this is

94
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:04,760
fall I am going to let's say this is
 

95
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,509
fall I am going to let's say this is
where their center of gravity is at this

96
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
where their center of gravity is at this
 

97
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,949
where their center of gravity is at this
point okay it's coming

98
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
point okay it's coming
 

99
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,470
point okay it's coming
around at when I want them to fall I am

100
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
around at when I want them to fall I am
 

101
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,670
around at when I want them to fall I am
going to push this center of gravity

102
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:18,680
going to push this center of gravity
 

103
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,110
going to push this center of gravity
outside of this spiral 90° to that axis

104
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,120
outside of this spiral 90° to that axis
 

105
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,390
outside of this spiral 90° to that axis
of rotation that's your CQ projection of

106
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:25,400
of rotation that's your CQ projection of
 

107
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,750
of rotation that's your CQ projection of
the x pattern that's what I call the x

108
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
the x pattern that's what I call the x
 

109
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,390
the x pattern that's what I call the x
pattern Okay so they're going that way

110
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:31,400
pattern Okay so they're going that way
 

111
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,630
pattern Okay so they're going that way
and here's your little X that's

112
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:33,640
and here's your little X that's
 

113
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,789
and here's your little X that's
happening okay because it's always on

114
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:35,799
happening okay because it's always on
 

115
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,869
happening okay because it's always on
some sort of

116
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:37,879
some sort of
 

117
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,910
some sort of
spiral uh I don't like the plus sign I

118
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:40,920
spiral uh I don't like the plus sign I
 

119
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,190
spiral uh I don't like the plus sign I
just like the feeling of the X okay I'm

120
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
just like the feeling of the X okay I'm
 

121
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,869
just like the feeling of the X okay I'm
never really making a plus sign there

122
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
never really making a plus sign there
 

123
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,470
never really making a plus sign there
okay all right so I have to do that in

124
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
okay all right so I have to do that in
 

125
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,350
okay all right so I have to do that in
eel the difference from this and cyho

126
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:54,360
eel the difference from this and cyho
 

127
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,789
eel the difference from this and cyho
when I introduced this geometry to you

128
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
when I introduced this geometry to you
 

129
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,270
when I introduced this geometry to you
is I don't I want them to fall

130
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,280
is I don't I want them to fall
 

131
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,149
is I don't I want them to fall
underneath me and not away from me so

132
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:01,159
underneath me and not away from me so
 

133
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,949
underneath me and not away from me so
all that Ma all that changes is how far

134
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
all that Ma all that changes is how far
 

135
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,910
all that Ma all that changes is how far
from that axis of rotation through the

136
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:06,920
from that axis of rotation through the
 

137
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,270
from that axis of rotation through the
spiral do I uh displace the center of

138
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,280
spiral do I uh displace the center of
 

139
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,589
spiral do I uh displace the center of
gravity that's the

140
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:12,599
gravity that's the
 

141
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,470
gravity that's the
okay uh no further than I can keep them

142
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:15,480
okay uh no further than I can keep them
 

143
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,509
okay uh no further than I can keep them
under me that's that's the rule

144
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:18,519
under me that's that's the rule
 

145
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,749
under me that's that's the rule
okay all right

146
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
okay all right
 

147
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,230
okay all right
so at a certain

148
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
so at a certain
 

149
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,350
so at a certain
point for the EDI in EO whether it

150
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,360
point for the EDI in EO whether it
 

151
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,710
point for the EDI in EO whether it
doesn't matter what the Vari ation is so

152
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
doesn't matter what the Vari ation is so
 

153
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,710
doesn't matter what the Vari ation is so
here we're

154
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
here we're
 

155
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,310
here we're
doing it doesn't matter if

156
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
doing it doesn't matter if
 

157
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,510
doing it doesn't matter if
it's it doesn't matter this is this is

158
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
it's it doesn't matter this is this is
 

159
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,670
it's it doesn't matter this is this is
how you always enter on aot okay at some

160
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
how you always enter on aot okay at some
 

161
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,830
how you always enter on aot okay at some
certain point you brought them into the

162
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:48,840
certain point you brought them into the
 

163
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,909
certain point you brought them into the
front

164
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
front
 

165
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,070
front
inward kazushi so you're going to get

166
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,080
inward kazushi so you're going to get
 

167
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,230
inward kazushi so you're going to get
some angle of their body we're going to

168
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,240
some angle of their body we're going to
 

169
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,189
some angle of their body we're going to
go here okay

170
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
go here okay
 

171
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,350
go here okay
they're going to be on one leg and then

172
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
they're going to be on one leg and then
 

173
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,310
they're going to be on one leg and then
the other leg is up in the air as you

174
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,320
the other leg is up in the air as you
 

175
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,710
the other leg is up in the air as you
started to tilt

176
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:07,720
started to tilt
 

177
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,310
started to tilt
them okay and I now have an

178
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
them okay and I now have an
 

179
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,590
them okay and I now have an
object very much like the Bulan I was

180
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:16,600
object very much like the Bulan I was
 

181
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,990
object very much like the Bulan I was
using in koky hole where the spine was

182
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,000
using in koky hole where the spine was
 

183
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,510
using in koky hole where the spine was
straight up and

184
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:20,520
straight up and
 

185
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,110
straight up and
down okay the first thing I do is I

186
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
down okay the first thing I do is I
 

187
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,909
down okay the first thing I do is I
tilted that spine this is just a review

188
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
tilted that spine this is just a review
 

189
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,710
tilted that spine this is just a review
of that video then I'm going to let the

190
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
of that video then I'm going to let the
 

191
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,870
of that video then I'm going to let the
feet keep

192
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
feet keep
 

193
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,670
feet keep
going then I'm going to bring the head

194
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
going then I'm going to bring the head
 

195
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,309
going then I'm going to bring the head
around and let it go back

196
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:38,319
around and let it go back
 

197
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,309
around and let it go back
around and then the body falls very

198
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:41,319
around and then the body falls very
 

199
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,029
around and then the body falls very
similarly only as to the front inward

200
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:44,039
similarly only as to the front inward
 

201
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,990
similarly only as to the front inward
which means I'm going to bring the head

202
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
which means I'm going to bring the head
 

203
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,629
which means I'm going to bring the head
around I'm going to let the foot go

204
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:51,639
around I'm going to let the foot go
 

205
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,870
around I'm going to let the foot go
around this way and then at some point I

206
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
around this way and then at some point I
 

207
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,390
around this way and then at some point I
know the center's a little off I'm going

208
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
know the center's a little off I'm going
 

209
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,230
know the center's a little off I'm going
to take the center and make it go the

210
00:05:59,230 --> 00:05:59,240
to take the center and make it go the
 

211
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,469
to take the center and make it go the
other way way okay that's what I'm going

212
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
other way way okay that's what I'm going
 

213
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,430
other way way okay that's what I'm going
to do every single time I am not going

214
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:06,440
to do every single time I am not going
 

215
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,230
to do every single time I am not going
to take the body and just move it this

216
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,240
to take the body and just move it this
 

217
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,270
to take the body and just move it this
is very common so the spine would be

218
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
is very common so the spine would be
 

219
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,830
is very common so the spine would be
like this I'll show you again this is

220
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
like this I'll show you again this is
 

221
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,909
like this I'll show you again this is
very

222
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:16,919
very
 

223
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,670
very
common you get something like

224
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
common you get something like
 

225
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,790
common you get something like
this okay and then all they do this is

226
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
this okay and then all they do this is
 

227
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,070
this okay and then all they do this is
the spine is they just move it

228
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
the spine is they just move it
 

229
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,629
the spine is they just move it
over off of this Bas of support and then

230
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:29,639
over off of this Bas of support and then
 

231
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,029
over off of this Bas of support and then
then the person falls down okay I say

232
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
then the person falls down okay I say
 

233
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,029
then the person falls down okay I say
 they don't all you have to do

234
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
they don't all you have to do
 

235
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,309
they don't all you have to do
is try it on someone who doesn't know

236
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:37,319
is try it on someone who doesn't know
 

237
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,629
is try it on someone who doesn't know
your choreography they don't fall down

238
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:39,639
your choreography they don't fall down
 

239
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,670
your choreography they don't fall down
they just keep stepping to reput their

240
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:42,680
they just keep stepping to reput their
 

241
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,950
they just keep stepping to reput their
base of support underneath the line of

242
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
base of support underneath the line of
 

243
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,950
base of support underneath the line of
gravity that's all that happens and then

244
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
gravity that's all that happens and then
 

245
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,270
gravity that's all that happens and then
the skilled fighter will use that one

246
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,280
the skilled fighter will use that one
 

247
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,270
the skilled fighter will use that one
time and then adjust to take your

248
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:52,280
time and then adjust to take your
 

249
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,350
time and then adjust to take your
leverage away from the arm and you're

250
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,360
leverage away from the arm and you're
 

251
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,469
leverage away from the arm and you're
not arresting anyone then that's what's

252
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
not arresting anyone then that's what's
 

253
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,950
not arresting anyone then that's what's
going to happen Okay but with this

254
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
going to happen Okay but with this
 

255
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,589
going to happen Okay but with this
component here the entire uh elements

256
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:02,599
component here the entire uh elements
 

257
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,230
component here the entire uh elements
that construct the basis support they

258
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:05,240
that construct the basis support they
 

259
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,550
that construct the basis support they
get sent off in three different

260
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:07,560
get sent off in three different
 

261
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,110
get sent off in three different
directions the dude's going to fall okay

262
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
directions the dude's going to fall okay
 

263
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,469
directions the dude's going to fall okay
and that's what we're doing so I'll show

264
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:13,479
and that's what we're doing so I'll show
 

265
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,070
and that's what we're doing so I'll show
you this variant here and then we'll

266
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,080
you this variant here and then we'll
 

267
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,309
you this variant here and then we'll
review again this variant which I was

268
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:19,319
review again this variant which I was
 

269
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,790
review again this variant which I was
demonstrating in the first clip again

270
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:23,800
demonstrating in the first clip again
 

271
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,749
demonstrating in the first clip again
we're working from

272
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
we're working from
 

273
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,070
we're working from
clot okay and so here the guy

274
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
clot okay and so here the guy
 

275
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,710
clot okay and so here the guy
is down and he's in that L shape this is

276
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:33,720
is down and he's in that L shape this is
 

277
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,589
is down and he's in that L shape this is
the incorrect way and then the I just

278
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:36,599
the incorrect way and then the I just
 

279
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,950
the incorrect way and then the I just
let me do it this time the idea is that

280
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:39,960
let me do it this time the idea is that
 

281
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,469
let me do it this time the idea is that
I'm going to shove him and then he'll

282
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:45,479

 

283
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,350

fall

284
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,360
fall
 

285
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,830
fall
okay here and I shove him and he falls

286
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840

 

287
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,909

okay one and again

288
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
okay one and again
 

289
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,230
okay one and again
let's just do a couple of ways that he

290
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
let's just do a couple of ways that he
 

291
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,309
let's just do a couple of ways that he
can get a Bas of support back underneath

292
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:05,319
can get a Bas of support back underneath
 

293
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,909
can get a Bas of support back underneath
the line of gravity so this works if his

294
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
the line of gravity so this works if his
 

295
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,270
the line of gravity so this works if his
feet stays still if that foot stays

296
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:10,280
feet stays still if that foot stays
 

297
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,990
feet stays still if that foot stays
still then I can push the line of

298
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,000
still then I can push the line of
 

299
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,149
still then I can push the line of
gravity outside the Bas cor and he will

300
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:17,159
gravity outside the Bas cor and he will
 

301
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,990
gravity outside the Bas cor and he will
fall

302
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,000
fall
 

303
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,830
fall
okay if he puts his hand down he's going

304
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:22,840
okay if he puts his hand down he's going
 

305
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,070
okay if he puts his hand down he's going
to get his Bas of support and I didn't

306
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
to get his Bas of support and I didn't
 

307
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,070
to get his Bas of support and I didn't
get the thing I wanted okay

308
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,080
get the thing I wanted okay
 

309
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,630
get the thing I wanted okay
even if he doesn't move his foot and he

310
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:33,640
even if he doesn't move his foot and he
 

311
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,909
even if he doesn't move his foot and he
just puts his hand down when I

312
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:36,919
just puts his hand down when I
 

313
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,790
just puts his hand down when I
go I you're not going he's not going to

314
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:39,800
go I you're not going he's not going to
 

315
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,389
go I you're not going he's not going to
fall

316
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
fall
 

317
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,829
fall
okay but as you saw what he would do is

318
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
okay but as you saw what he would do is
 

319
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,190
okay but as you saw what he would do is
he moves in stages boom boom and he's

320
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
he moves in stages boom boom and he's
 

321
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,110
he moves in stages boom boom and he's
out he's out of the technique and the

322
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,120
out he's out of the technique and the
 

323
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,710
out he's out of the technique and the
pin is now not under me and he can use

324
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:55,720
pin is now not under me and he can use
 

325
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,710
pin is now not under me and he can use
his leg strength and just stand back up

326
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
his leg strength and just stand back up
 

327
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,870
his leg strength and just stand back up
and I can't get

328
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880

 

329
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,910

there's also the assumption that I can

330
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
there's also the assumption that I can
 

331
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,470
there's also the assumption that I can
actually even push the line of gravity

332
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
actually even push the line of gravity
 

333
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,269
actually even push the line of gravity

I can do it
 

355
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,870
I can do it
okay what are we doing

here get the Tilt bring him body put the
 

369
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,630
here get the Tilt bring him body put the
body around that

370
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
body around that
 

371
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,350
body around that
way if we look at the other one even if

372
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:18,360
way if we look at the other one even if

of the pin being under me I have to now

378
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:25,399
of the pin being under me I have to now
 

379
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,310
of the pin being under me I have to now
catch back up to it but at this moment

380
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
catch back up to it but at this moment
 

381
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:36,670
catch back up to it but at this moment
it's not under me

382
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:36,680

 

383
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,190

the pin is under me so you have a brake

384
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,200

 

385
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,069

here which shows that you have a

386
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
here which shows that you have a
 

387
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,069
here which shows that you have a
pin okay

388
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:49,079
pin okay
 

389
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:53,310
pin okay
so the biggest mistake is where does the

390
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:53,320
so the biggest mistake is where does the
 

391
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,670
so the biggest mistake is where does the
x pattern go on his

392
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:56,680
x pattern go on his
 

393
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,990
x pattern go on his
body that's the biggest mistake

394
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
body that's the biggest mistake
 

395
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,670
body that's the biggest mistake

my hip goes in

402
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
my hip goes in
 

403
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,470
my hip goes in
here where I'm going to finally displac

404
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:17,480
here where I'm going to finally displac
 

405
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,670
here where I'm going to finally displac
it my hip goes in

406
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680

 

407
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,629

here but I bring his head around with

408
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:26,639
here but I bring his head around with
 

409
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,389
here but I bring his head around with
his arm

410
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:31,399

 

411
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:38,790

so if you watch the other way watch his

412
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800

 

413
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,629

hips watch his

414
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:43,639

 

415
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,870

hip so now let's pay

416
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
hip so now let's pay
 

417
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,910
hip so now let's pay
attention this can't go in his

418
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
attention this can't go in his
 

419
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,430
attention this can't go in his
armpit because it's his Center that I'm

420
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:52,440
armpit because it's his Center that I'm
 

421
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,629
armpit because it's his Center that I'm
just

422
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:53,639
just
 

423
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,230
just
placing he goes somewhere around the

424
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
placing he goes somewhere around the
 

425
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:16,990
placing he goes somewhere around the
hips around the pushies

426
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,000

 

427
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,389

let's get the the entry angle so round

428
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
let's get the the entry angle so round
 

429
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,350
let's get the the entry angle so round
the cushy then we'll work with how do

430
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:22,360
the cushy then we'll work with how do
 

431
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,829
the cushy then we'll work with how do
you actually enter and then we'll work

432
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:24,839
you actually enter and then we'll work
 

433
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,350
you actually enter and then we'll work
with what do you do with the

434
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
with what do you do with the
 

435
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,750
with what do you do with the
arm but it's important to note that in

436
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:30,760
arm but it's important to note that in
 

437
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,990
arm but it's important to note that in
the version that we do we always get his

438
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,000
the version that we do we always get his
 

439
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,110
the version that we do we always get his
inertia that's going forward we let it

440
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,120
inertia that's going forward we let it
 

441
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,870
inertia that's going forward we let it
go forward when we attack his body so

442
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:41,880
go forward when we attack his body so
 

443
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,430
go forward when we attack his body so
that his leg keeps going forward just

444
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:44,440
that his leg keeps going forward just
 

445
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,069
that his leg keeps going forward just

okay so like most of the
 

497
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,910
okay so like most of the
Naga we don't do anything with the

498
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:36,920
Naga we don't do anything with the
 

499
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,189
Naga we don't do anything with the
feet on the on the falling

500
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:40,199
feet on the on the falling
 

501
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:45,269
feet on the on the falling
geometry once we establish the

502
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279

 

503
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,870

rotation then the centrifugal energy

504
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:47,880
rotation then the centrifugal energy
 

505
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,870
rotation then the centrifugal energy
does what it does with the foot okay so

506
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
does what it does with the foot okay so
 

507
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,829
does what it does with the foot okay so
we don't I'm going to take that part off

508
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:52,839
we don't I'm going to take that part off
 

509
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:54,870
we don't I'm going to take that part off
because we don't need it I don't you

510
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
because we don't need it I don't you
 

511
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:09,710
because we don't need it I don't you
don't have to worry about it

512
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:09,720

 

513
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,870

here's really what we're dealing

514
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:11,880
here's really what we're dealing
 

515
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:19,069
here's really what we're dealing
with I am going to

516
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:19,079

 

517
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,110

cut that's my cou Vector which is

518
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,120
cut that's my cou Vector which is
 

519
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,949
cut that's my cou Vector which is
happening with my

520
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:23,959
happening with my
 

521
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:26,629
happening with my
Koshi on their

522
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
Koshi on their
 

523
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,430
Koshi on their
Koshi and then here here is

524
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:32,440

 

525
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,829

the distal end of the head side of the

526
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
the distal end of the head side of the
 

527
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,910
the distal end of the head side of the
lever of the spine it's these two forces

528
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
lever of the spine it's these two forces
 

529
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,910
lever of the spine it's these two forces
okay and what I'm doing

530
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:42,920
okay and what I'm doing
 

531
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,949
okay and what I'm doing
here is every time I have an

532
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
here is every time I have an
 

533
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,030
here is every time I have an
arc and that's what we're going to look

534
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,040
arc and that's what we're going to look
 

535
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,509
arc and that's what we're going to look
at

536
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:54,519

 

537
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,309

now I need to be in the middle of the

538
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:57,319
now I need to be in the middle of the
 

539
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:00,550
now I need to be in the middle of the
Ark

540
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560

 

541
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,350

okay always in the middle of the

542
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:04,360
okay always in the middle of the
 

543
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,949
okay always in the middle of the
Ark and so this arm has to move around

544
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:09,959
Ark and so this arm has to move around
 

545
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,069
Ark and so this arm has to move around
moving their head around at the moment

546
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
moving their head around at the moment
 

547
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,430
moving their head around at the moment
that my

548
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
that my
 

549
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,389
that my
coosi is touching their

550
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
coosi is touching their
 

551
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,670
coosi is touching their
Koshi at the moment the space

552
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
Koshi at the moment the space
 

553
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,629
Koshi at the moment the space
time that this arm is moving around okay

554
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:25,639
time that this arm is moving around okay
 

555
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,910
time that this arm is moving around okay
and I'll show you what I

556
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
and I'll show you what I
 

557
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,230
and I'll show you what I
mean so if I don't move I know that his

558
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:31,240
mean so if I don't move I know that his
 

559
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,389
mean so if I don't move I know that his
arm does

560
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:35,399

 

561
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,870

that his arms going to go this

562
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:41,880

 

563
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,389

way his arms going to go this way

564
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:45,399
way his arms going to go this way
 

565
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,230
way his arms going to go this way
because it has to go around

566
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:49,240

 

567
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,790

me and so I know I need to be in the

568
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
me and so I know I need to be in the
 

569
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,550
me and so I know I need to be in the
middle of that motion as it goes around

570
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:55,560
middle of that motion as it goes around
 

571
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,949
middle of that motion as it goes around
me

572
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959

 

573
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,110

and I know that I have to be touching

574
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,120
and I know that I have to be touching
 

575
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,189
and I know that I have to be touching
his

576
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:03,199
his
 

577
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,270
his
hip okay and I have to line these things

578
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:08,280

 

579
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,949

up and that's what I'm doing

580
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
up and that's what I'm doing
 

581
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,189
up and that's what I'm doing
here this

582
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:13,199
here this
 

583
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,710
here this
hand is on

584
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:15,720
hand is on
 

585
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,669

in
 

595
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,669
in
it goes around me what would be

or I enter on a straight line I'm
 

605
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,110
or I enter on a straight line I'm
close but I'm entering on a straight

606
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,120
close but I'm entering on a straight
 

607

line now I can't get
 

609
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,590
line now I can't get
there so when I

610
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:56,600

 

611
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,590

enter yes I am good going to start

612
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
enter yes I am good going to start
 

613
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,590
enter yes I am good going to start
straight but as I get in

614
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:02,600
straight but as I get in
 

615
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,909
straight but as I get in
there it's going to

616
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:06,919

 

617
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,710

619
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,110

so yes it's starting straight but it

620
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,120
so yes it's starting straight but it
 

621
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,590
so yes it's starting straight but it
starts to

622
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
starts to
 

623
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,990
starts to
turn so I end up

624
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
turn so I end up
 

625
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,789
turn so I end up
here you

626
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:20,799
here you
 

627
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:29,010
here you
see not here

628
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:29,020

631
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:00,950

different goes around me

632
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960

 

633
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,669

and when it goes around

634
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
and when it goes around
 

635
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,990
and when it goes around
me it's under me I can crack the hell

636
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,000
me it's under me I can crack the hell
 

637
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,070
me it's under me I can crack the hell
out of that

638
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,080
out of that
 

639
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,350
out of that
thing

640
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
thing

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,590
thing
okaying

642
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
okaying
 

643
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,470
okaying
in

644
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:15,480
in
 

645
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,870
in
um I know in modern iido they talk

646
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
um I know in modern iido they talk
 

647
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,870
um I know in modern iido they talk
constantly like there's a counter to

648
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
constantly like there's a counter to
 

649
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,070
constantly like there's a counter to
every counter and I don't

650
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
every counter and I don't
 

651
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,750
every counter and I don't
agree uh what I would say is you're

652
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:27,760
agree uh what I would say is you're
 

653
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,230
agree uh what I would say is you're
going to have to free your

654
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:29,240
going to have to free your
 

655
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,990
going to have to free your
Center then there's a counter okay so it

656
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,000
Center then there's a counter okay so it
 

657
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,590
Center then there's a counter okay so it
can't just be a matter of you extending

658
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600
can't just be a matter of you extending
 

659
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,350
can't just be a matter of you extending
the circle and that's just not right

660
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,360
the circle and that's just not right
 

661
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,430
the circle and that's just not right
that's so because the x pattern is there

662
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
that's so because the x pattern is there
 

663
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,590
that's so because the x pattern is there
uh it's not going to work okay when you

664
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
uh it's not going to work okay when you
 

665
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,750
uh it's not going to work okay when you
don't have the x pattern you just have a

666
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
don't have the x pattern you just have a
 

667
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,950
don't have the x pattern you just have a
some kind of weird two-dimensional

668
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:47,960
some kind of weird two-dimensional
 

669
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,110
some kind of weird two-dimensional
Circle or a line you kind extend the

670
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120
Circle or a line you kind extend the
 

671
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,990
Circle or a line you kind extend the
line and then what was Nag's energy

672
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,000
line and then what was Nag's energy
 

673
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,870
line and then what was Nag's energy
becomes UK's energy okay so for example

674
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880
becomes UK's energy okay so for example
 

675
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,710
becomes UK's energy okay so for example
if I'm doing that other version and I

676
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:01,720
if I'm doing that other version and I
 

677
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,110
if I'm doing that other version and I
shove him

678
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,120
shove him
 

679
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,350
shove him
out he can use that energy to keep

680
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
out he can use that energy to keep
 

681
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,070
out he can use that energy to keep
pulling me over him

682
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,080
pulling me over him
 

683
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,070
pulling me over him
okay we don't want it that's not right

684
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:15,080
okay we don't want it that's not right
 

685
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,029
okay we don't want it that's not right
okay so in this version the whole

686
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:19,039
okay so in this version the whole
 

687
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,070
okay so in this version the whole
goal is to not have that this shoulder

688
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
goal is to not have that this shoulder
 

689
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,190
goal is to not have that this shoulder
the one I'm trying to control go up it's

690
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,200
the one I'm trying to control go up it's
 

691
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,549
the one I'm trying to control go up it's
going to go down

692
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:29,559
going to go down
 

693
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:34,510
going to go down
down there's a lot of pressure

694
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:34,520

 

695
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,430

there I don't want the other shoulder to

696
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:37,440
there I don't want the other shoulder to
 

697
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,909
there I don't want the other shoulder to
go down and that shoulder to go up until

698
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:40,919
go down and that shoulder to go up until
 

699
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,190
go down and that shoulder to go up until
I get it down no that's

700
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,200

 

701
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,149

crazy

702
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:47,159
crazy
 

703
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:54,270
crazy
boom pressure into the

704
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,280

 

705
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,870

shoulder

706
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
shoulder
 

707
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,830
shoulder
boom Okay so this is another benefit

708
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:00,840
boom Okay so this is another benefit
 

709
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,029
boom Okay so this is another benefit
because I'm trying to pin him what am I

710
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
because I'm trying to pin him what am I
 

711
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,950
because I'm trying to pin him what am I
trying to pin the inside shoulder so the

712
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:05,960
trying to pin the inside shoulder so the
 

713
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,470
trying to pin the inside shoulder so the
inside shoulder has to go down not up

714
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:09,480
inside shoulder has to go down not up
 

715
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,190
inside shoulder has to go down not up
okay so let's try and make that point go

716
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,200
okay so let's try and make that point go
 

717
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,190
okay so let's try and make that point go
okay now if you if you have all those

718
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
okay now if you if you have all those
 

719
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,110
okay now if you if you have all those
concerns the the left hand moves with

720
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,120
concerns the the left hand moves with
 

721
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,029
concerns the the left hand moves with
the left quaw

722
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:20,039
the left quaw
 

723
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,870
the left quaw
okay uh I'm entering on a circle and my

724
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:23,880
okay uh I'm entering on a circle and my
 

725
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,110
okay uh I'm entering on a circle and my
goal is to get this shoulder down you

726
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
goal is to get this shoulder down you
 

727
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,750
goal is to get this shoulder down you
don't want to ever push this elbow in

728
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:29,760
don't want to ever push this elbow in
 

729
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,390
don't want to ever push this elbow in
that direction this elbow never goes

730
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
that direction this elbow never goes
 

731
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,470
that direction this elbow never goes
that way and then comes back to me now

732
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:35,480
that way and then comes back to me now
 

733
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,950
that way and then comes back to me now
that's not going to

734
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
that's not going to
 

735
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,070
that's not going to
work the elbow is going around me

736
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,080
work the elbow is going around me
 

737
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:47,190
work the elbow is going around me
because I'm the middle of the

738
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,200

 

739
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,430

circle not going this way you see and

740
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440
circle not going this way you see and
 

741
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,230
circle not going this way you see and
then that way no no

742
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
then that way no no
 

743
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:02,149
then that way no no
no the elbows going around me this way

744
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159

 

745
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:10,630

this

746
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,640

 

747
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,470

way then notice my arms going this way

748
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:13,480
way then notice my arms going this way
 

749
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,789
way then notice my arms going this way
with my

750
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799
with my
 

751
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,070
with my
hips this

752
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,080

 

753
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:25,430

way never push then try to come up

754
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,440

 

755
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:39,310

no around

756
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:39,320

 

757
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,430

okay try that okay after a certain level

758
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:43,440
okay try that okay after a certain level
 

759
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,029
okay try that okay after a certain level
of uh you don't have the internal skills

760
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:46,039
of uh you don't have the internal skills
 

761
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,510
of uh you don't have the internal skills
you can't really do my variation okay uh

762
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,520
you can't really do my variation okay uh
 

763
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,630
you can't really do my variation okay uh
the hard part here on this one is uh

764
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:53,640
the hard part here on this one is uh
 

765
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,710
the hard part here on this one is uh
when when I'm about to move there's a

766
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:56,720
when when I'm about to move there's a
 

767
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,630
when when I'm about to move there's a
lot of inertia here cuz I took him that

768
00:22:59,630 --> 00:22:59,640
lot of inertia here cuz I took him that
 

769
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,430
lot of inertia here cuz I took him that
way okay and there's going to be a point

770
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:02,440
way okay and there's going to be a point
 

771
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,789
way okay and there's going to be a point
where I'm on one leg so he's trying he

772
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:06,799
where I'm on one leg so he's trying he
 

773
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,870
where I'm on one leg so he's trying he
let's just he'll do a force Vector that

774
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,880
let's just he'll do a force Vector that
 

775
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,390
let's just he'll do a force Vector that
way go ahead and push you see I can't do

776
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:13,400

 

777
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,110

that I have to be able he's he's pushing

778
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,120
that I have to be able he's he's pushing
 

779
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,230
that I have to be able he's he's pushing
and I'm just here he can't can't push me

780
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240
and I'm just here he can't can't push me
 

781
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,669
and I'm just here he can't can't push me
he's not going to push me over than and

782
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:22,679
he's not going to push me over than and
 

783
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,470
he's not going to push me over than and
so that's what allows me to bring it

784
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
so that's what allows me to bring it
 

785
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,549
so that's what allows me to bring it
around me as I'm entering

00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:29,559

 

787
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:32,590

when you don't have that you're going to
 

789
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,269
when you don't have that you're going to
push it off of your foot you see you're

790
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:35,279
push it off of your foot you see you're
 

791
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,870
push it off of your foot you see you're
trying to push it ahead of you and then

trying to push it ahead of you and then
 

793
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,909
trying to push it ahead of you and then
you're going to try to bring it around

794
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:40,919
you're going to try to bring it around
 

795
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,750
you're going to try to bring it around
that's not the thing okay well on on on

00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
that's not the thing okay well on on on
