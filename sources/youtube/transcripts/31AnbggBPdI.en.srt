what you were doing
 

45
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,630
what you were doing
is you're kind of let's say their center

46
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:47,640
is you're kind of let's say their center
 

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,610
is you're kind of let's say their center
of gravity is here

00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:49,620
of gravity is here
 

49
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,110

you're you're accelerating it

00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,120

 

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,770

in One Direction so this is the the head
 

53
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,809
in One Direction so this is the the head
there's the nose you accelerate it to

54
00:02:59,809 --> 00:02:59,819
there's the nose you accelerate it to
 

55
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,009

the front

56
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:01,019
the front
 

57
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,710
the front
so you get like a little tilt maybe

58
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:03,720
so you get like a little tilt maybe
 

59
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,270
so you get like a little tilt maybe
you're here

you're here
 

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,330
you're here
and then you accelerate

62
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:08,340
and then you accelerate
 

63
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,449
and then you accelerate
that center of gravity

64
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:11,459
that center of gravity
 

65
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,570
that center of gravity
and then what happens is that the

66
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:14,580
and then what happens is that the
 

67
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,149
and then what happens is that the
UK is it gets lazy

68
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:17,159
UK is it gets lazy
 

69
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,509
UK is it gets lazy
and it's more of a convenience so

70
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:20,519
and it's more of a convenience so
 

71
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,630
and it's more of a convenience so
it's a little more difficult to get

72
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:23,640
it's a little more difficult to get
 

73
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,210
it's a little more difficult to get
their feet back underneath

74
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,220
their feet back underneath
 

75
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,030
their feet back underneath
so they get that upright posture again

76
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040

 

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,770

and then but so what they do instead is

78
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:33,780
and then but so what they do instead is
 

79
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,050
and then but so what they do instead is
they leave their feet there and they let

80
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,060
they leave their feet there and they let
 

81
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,729
they leave their feet there and they let
just

82
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:37,739
just
 

83
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,309

from from their will to leave their feet

eventually this acceleration of this

for a convenience sake to take a

163
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,570

so here is the top

164
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:50,580
so here is the top
 

165
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,650

Force working on your head okay

166

175
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,890

so after I do the chikai 10

176
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:09,900
so after I do the chikai 10
 

177
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,409
so after I do the chikai 10
and I cut down on your hand that's the

178
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:12,419
and I cut down on your hand that's the
 

179
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,950
and I cut down on your hand that's the
top force on your head and in my base

180
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:15,960
top force on your head and in my base

as I continue to work this part as I
continue to spin the technique

546
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:51,780

your foot in its effort to gain balance

548
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
your foot in its effort to gain balance
 

549
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,190
your foot in its effort to gain balance
is going to try to move back under your

550
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:58,200
is going to try to move back under your
 

551
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,650
is going to try to move back under your
basis support so I'm going to work on

552
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:00,660
basis support so I'm going to work on
 

553
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,630
basis support so I'm going to work on
that eventually your body is going to

554
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:02,640
that eventually your body is going to
 

555
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,610
that eventually your body is going to
tilt

556
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:04,620
tilt
 

557
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,590
tilt
and then you're gonna try to put your

558
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:06,600
and then you're gonna try to put your
 

559
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,930
and then you're gonna try to put your
foot underneath your base of support so

560
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:08,940
foot underneath your base of support so
 

561
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,690
foot underneath your base of support so
that your back standing upright okay

562
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:11,700
that your back standing upright okay
 

563
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,450

597
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,190

and because you see is continuous to the
 

871
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:00,470
and because you see is continuous to the
throw so it never tilts then goes

872
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:00,480
throw so it never tilts then goes
 

873
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,750
throw so it never tilts then goes
upright and then tilts again it doesn't

upright and then tilts again it doesn't
 

875
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,370
upright and then tilts again it doesn't
happen okay

876
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:04,380
happen okay
 

877
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,169
happen okay
and then the way that I have it tilt is
