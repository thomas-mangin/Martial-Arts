let's go

22
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000

 

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,780

okay a lot of times you do your

24
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:22,790
okay a lot of times you do your
 

25
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,380
okay a lot of times you do your
horizontal reconciliation is more of a

26
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:26,390
horizontal reconciliation is more of a
 

27
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,920
horizontal reconciliation is more of a
vertical reference you're trying to get

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:29,930
vertical reference you're trying to get
 

29
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,740
vertical reference you're trying to get
around this energy and then over the top

30
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:32,750
around this energy and then over the top
 

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,900
around this energy and then over the top
of the energy so if you just try to do

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:37,910
of the energy so if you just try to do
 

33
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:43,060
of the energy so if you just try to do
this for a zombie yeah like that so your

34
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,070
this for a zombie yeah like that so your
 

35
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,920
this for a zombie yeah like that so your
body you're overlapping circles can't

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:47,930
body you're overlapping circles can't
 

37
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:53,920
body you're overlapping circles can't
just do that you have to figure out how

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:53,930
just do that you have to figure out how
 

39
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:05,080
just do that you have to figure out how
to get over it see I'm doing that

40
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,090

 

41
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,479

following it and I need to take one more
turn here so from here can't go here

134
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:15,960
turn here so from here can't go here
 

135
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,560

141
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,820

and it's just sticking zero pressure

142
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:30,830
and it's just sticking zero pressure
 

143
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,250
and it's just sticking zero pressure
remember that concept that's how you

144
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:34,260
remember that concept that's how you
 

145
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,240
remember that concept that's how you
stick to it and then I'm just applying

146
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,250
stick to it and then I'm just applying
 

147
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,690
stick to it and then I'm just applying
the the circles of the other technique

148
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:43,700
the the circles of the other technique
 

149
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:50,810
the the circles of the other technique

151
00:06:50,820 --> 00:07:04,420
so it has to get to my spine easy and
then I have to get over it boom boom

152
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:04,430
then I have to get over it boom boom
 

153
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:11,310
then I have to get over it boom boom
okay let's just try that lead to throw

154
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:11,320

 

155
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:17,380

okay so let's work with the ski okay so

156
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,390
okay so let's work with the ski okay so
 

157
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:26,580
okay so let's work with the ski okay so
he's gonna come in and I have the same

158
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:26,590

 

159
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:33,340

yeah I'm usually the initial but I've

160
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:33,350
yeah I'm usually the initial but I've
 

161
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:41,770
yeah I'm usually the initial but I've
used this far but I'm doing it to

162
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:41,780
used this far but I'm doing it to
 

163
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,090
used this far but I'm doing it to
deviate so I can do the first town just

164
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,100
deviate so I can do the first town just
