so we know he's got an upward energy
 

7
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,350
so we know he's got an upward energy
followed by a downward energy

8
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:06,360
followed by a downward energy
 

9
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,990
followed by a downward energy
okay so I can't catch it on the way down

10
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
okay so I can't catch it on the way down

okay on the best of us it's 3/4 of a
 

73
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,229
okay on the best of us it's 3/4 of a
second reaction time you're just not

74
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:29,239
second reaction time you're just not

okay let's look at

172
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
okay let's look at
 

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,749
okay let's look at
the tering arm so where am I I'm over

174
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:50,759
the tering arm so where am I I'm over
 

175
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,790
the tering arm so where am I I'm over
here the angle canellation on this arm

176
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:53,800
here the angle canellation on this arm
 

177
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,869
here the angle canellation on this arm
is on the outside it's not on the top on

178
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:57,879
is on the outside it's not on the top on
 

179

185
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,029
of things at the lower level if he drops
to get on you're on the outside so he

186
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:08,039
to get on you're on the outside so he
 

187
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,670
to get on you're on the outside so he
tries to drop you're still

188

checking you're on this side we already
know that hand's going to go down right

192
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:17,400
know that hand's going to go down right
 

193
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,070
know that hand's going to go down right
cuz it's striking it has a y face to

194
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
cuz it's striking it has a y face to
 

195

shikaku you stay back here you see and
 

219
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:03,189
shikaku you stay back here you see and
there's your angle cancellation on that

220
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
there's your angle cancellation on that
 

221
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,110
there's your angle cancellation on that
