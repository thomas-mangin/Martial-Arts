1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,270

let's look at this

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
let's look at this
 

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,470
let's look at this
from the uk's side okay so this

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,480
from the uk's side okay so this
 

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,589
from the uk's side okay so this
is not you can

6
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599

 

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,230

so my uh

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
so my uh
 

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,870
so my uh
energy is gonna go right into him right

10
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
energy is gonna go right into him right
 

11
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,910
energy is gonna go right into him right
right on contact

12
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920

 

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,189

not here and not on his shoulders

14
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
not here and not on his shoulders
 

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,470
not here and not on his shoulders
right into his center

16
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:28,480

 

17
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,830

so i'm addressing with a cochlear

18
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
so i'm addressing with a cochlear
 

19
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,549
so i'm addressing with a cochlear
projection

20
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559

 

21
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,670

into his face i'm not here like this

22
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
into his face i'm not here like this
 

23
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,389
into his face i'm not here like this
getting ready to take my fall okay so

24
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
getting ready to take my fall okay so
 

25
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,029
getting ready to take my fall okay so
that will be drill one

26
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
that will be drill one
 

27
00:00:45,039 --> 00:01:05,350
that will be drill one
rhino contact

28
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360

 

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,830

it's against that that he tries to do

30
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
it's against that that he tries to do
 

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,149
it's against that that he tries to do
the technique

32
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
the technique
 

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,270
the technique
okay against that you do the technique

34
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
okay against that you do the technique
 

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,590
okay against that you do the technique
do technique dude

36
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600

 

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,469

okay it's gonna expose the

38
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479

 

39
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:35,270

the absence of the adhesion and the

40
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280

 

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,310

a little bit so when he's he's doing

42
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
a little bit so when he's he's doing
 

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,950
a little bit so when he's he's doing
that

44
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
that
 

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,270
that
he's gotta get my center that was a

46
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
he's gotta get my center that was a
 

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,429
he's gotta get my center that was a
little high over my center

48
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
little high over my center
 

49
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,510
little high over my center
you gotta get my body it's still a

50
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
you gotta get my body it's still a
 

51
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,069
you gotta get my body it's still a
little high

52
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
little high
 

53
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,550
little high
but what you're doing is tilting to

54
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
but what you're doing is tilting to
 

55
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,109
but what you're doing is tilting to
doing this

56
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
doing this
 

57
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:58,550
doing this
it's gotta go

58
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560

 

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,830

a little better

60
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840

 

61
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,749

okay so he's doing that we'll do it one

62
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
okay so he's doing that we'll do it one
 

63
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,389
okay so he's doing that we'll do it one
arm at a time so

64
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
arm at a time so
 

65
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,710
arm at a time so
uh this will this is going to be the yin

66
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
uh this will this is going to be the yin
 

67
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,750
uh this will this is going to be the yin
arm

68
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
arm
 

69
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,190
arm
but yin has to be preceded by yaw

70
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
but yin has to be preceded by yaw
 

71
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,190
but yin has to be preceded by yaw
so this arm is actually going to reach

72
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
so this arm is actually going to reach
 

73
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,630
so this arm is actually going to reach
towards him before

74
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
towards him before
 

75
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,390
towards him before
yielding to that push

76
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
yielding to that push
 

77
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,510
yielding to that push
so i don't go here and then i go like

78
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
so i don't go here and then i go like
 

79
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,550
so i don't go here and then i go like
this because

80
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
this because
 

81
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,070
this because
i wouldn't be able to do that because

82
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
i wouldn't be able to do that because
 

83
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,670
i wouldn't be able to do that because
he's pushing into you that's going to

84
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
he's pushing into you that's going to
 

85
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,190
he's pushing into you that's going to
collapse

86
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
collapse
 

87
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,630
collapse
so as he comes in and reaches and then

88
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
so as he comes in and reaches and then
 

89
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,270
so as he comes in and reaches and then
gets out of the way of that push so do

90
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
gets out of the way of that push so do
 

91
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,710
gets out of the way of that push so do
the yin arm over here

92
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
the yin arm over here
 

93
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,110
the yin arm over here
you can't go like this it gets collapsed

94
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
you can't go like this it gets collapsed
 

95
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,750
you can't go like this it gets collapsed
here

96
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
here
 

97
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,430
here
it wasn't getting collapsed because the

98
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
it wasn't getting collapsed because the
 

99
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,589
it wasn't getting collapsed because the
guy was just holding your arms there

100
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
guy was just holding your arms there
 

101
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,670
guy was just holding your arms there
okay so he's trying to push into my body

102
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
okay so he's trying to push into my body
 

103
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,390
okay so he's trying to push into my body
and push i reach out and then go around

104
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
and push i reach out and then go around
 

105
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,630
and push i reach out and then go around
and push

106
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640

 

107
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,990

the yawn arm this is the young arm

108
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
the yawn arm this is the young arm
 

109
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,110
the yawn arm this is the young arm
well if it's yawn it has to first be hit

110
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
well if it's yawn it has to first be hit
 

111
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,070
well if it's yawn it has to first be hit
so it absorbs

112
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
so it absorbs
 

113
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,830
so it absorbs
the push this way then he hits the

114
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
the push this way then he hits the
 

115
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,710
the push this way then he hits the
yonk there don't do it on this side it

116
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
yonk there don't do it on this side it
 

117
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,270
yonk there don't do it on this side it
goes

118
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
goes
 

119
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,110
goes
in down and around

120
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120

 

121
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,949

he's trying to push center and it yields

122
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
he's trying to push center and it yields
 

123
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,830
he's trying to push center and it yields
boom and then

124
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
boom and then
 

125
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,030
boom and then
goes back on him so that's what i'm

126
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
goes back on him so that's what i'm
 

127
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,869
goes back on him so that's what i'm
trying to do is knock him

128
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
trying to do is knock him
 

129
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,430
trying to do is knock him
he's trying to do the push my center

130
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440

 

131
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,149

one side's gonna warm the other side

132
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:35,159
one side's gonna warm the other side
 

133
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,789
one side's gonna warm the other side
yields

134
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799

 

135
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:49,910

make sure

136
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920

 

137
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,949

then as i go i want to

138
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
then as i go i want to
 

139
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,110
then as i go i want to
enter so i'm here

140
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120

 

141
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,670

his hand is above his shoulder

142
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
his hand is above his shoulder
 

143
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,270
his hand is above his shoulder
and his other hand is by his shoulder by

144
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
and his other hand is by his shoulder by
 

145
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,589
and his other hand is by his shoulder by
here so let's just look at something

146
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
here so let's just look at something
 

147
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,030
here so let's just look at something
let's just look at that

148
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
let's just look at that
 

149
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,229
let's just look at that
what this does anatomically to him try

150
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
what this does anatomically to him try
 

151
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,429
what this does anatomically to him try
to lift your hand

152
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
to lift your hand
 

153
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,670
to lift your hand
you're going to see it's very weak

154
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
you're going to see it's very weak
 

155
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,430
you're going to see it's very weak
and then the same thing he's here he

156
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
and then the same thing he's here he
 

157
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,270
and then the same thing he's here he
tries to push his hand out here

158
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
tries to push his hand out here
 

159
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,550
tries to push his hand out here
it's very strong but let's put it back

160
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
it's very strong but let's put it back
 

161
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,870
it's very strong but let's put it back
it's very weak now because it's too

162
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
it's very weak now because it's too
 

163
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,550
it's very weak now because it's too
close to his body

164
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
close to his body
 

165
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,310
close to his body
okay so that's where i want to be

166
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
okay so that's where i want to be
 

167
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,350
okay so that's where i want to be
in this position here and

168
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
in this position here and
 

169
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,790
in this position here and
the energy is being

170
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
the energy is being
 

171
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,510
the energy is being
challenged from the side so don't seek

172
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
challenged from the side so don't seek
 

173
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,350
challenged from the side so don't seek

just drops

190
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
just drops
 

191

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
after you get here he's gonna
 

195
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,350
after you get here he's gonna
turn his body out and give me some

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
turn his body out and give me some
 

197
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:28,310
turn his body out and give me some
extra challenge okay

198
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320

 

199
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,749

so he's doing his thing

200
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
so he's doing his thing
 

201
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,790
so he's doing his thing
i do my thing i end up in that same

his body
 

209
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,430
his body
he took the fall then he kicks back and

210
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
he took the fall then he kicks back and
 

211
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,830
he took the fall then he kicks back and
i don't lean over here i just stay where

212
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
i don't lean over here i just stay where
 

213
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,550
i don't lean over here i just stay where
i am

i am
 

215
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,909
i am
here everything is relaxing he really

216
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
here everything is relaxing he really
 

217
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,550
here everything is relaxing he really
he i want that okay to really try to

218
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
he i want that okay to really try to
 

219
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,510
he i want that okay to really try to
muscle that

220
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
muscle that
 

221
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,350
muscle that
so it doesn't trigger me i just keep

222
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
so it doesn't trigger me i just keep
 

223
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,629
so it doesn't trigger me i just keep
releasing

224
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
releasing
 

225
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,790
releasing
the energy

226
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800

 

227
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,550

okay so drill two uh let's clean up

228
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
okay so drill two uh let's clean up
 

229
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,110
okay so drill two uh let's clean up
noggin

230
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
noggin
 

231
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:18,830
noggin
let me just demonstrate some of the

232
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840

 

233
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:33,749

techniques

234
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759

 

235
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,870

you can just release everything release

236
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
you can just release everything release
 

237
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,469
you can just release everything release
everything

238
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
everything
 

239
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:47,430
everything
heart to my usual your muscles

240
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440

 

241
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,870

okay now we're gonna get back to uk

242
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
okay now we're gonna get back to uk
 

243
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,909
okay now we're gonna get back to uk
okay

244
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919

 

245
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,230

his side as naga is a reconciling of yin

246
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
his side as naga is a reconciling of yin
 

247
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,950
his side as naga is a reconciling of yin
and yang

248
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
and yang
 

249
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,629
and yang
and i am doing it too a reconciling of

250
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
and i am doing it too a reconciling of
 

251
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,830
and i am doing it too a reconciling of
yin beyond

252
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
yin beyond
 

253
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,749
yin beyond
so first my movement is governed by

254
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
so first my movement is governed by
 

255
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,830
so first my movement is governed by
a prescription i i had to do this

256
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
a prescription i i had to do this
 

257
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,510
a prescription i i had to do this
i had to attack the center

258
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520

 

259
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,909

since this is called your whole i should

260
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
since this is called your whole i should
 

261
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,070
since this is called your whole i should
attack it with a coking projection which

262
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
attack it with a coking projection which
 

263
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,230
attack it with a coking projection which
you do every time and every

264
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
you do every time and every
 

265
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,670
you do every time and every
lucas roll

266
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680

 

267
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,670

he's going to start one hand's got to

268
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
he's going to start one hand's got to
 

269
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,029
he's going to start one hand's got to
reach out yes

270
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
reach out yes
 

271
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,110
reach out yes
and one's going back and then they trade

272
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
and one's going back and then they trade
 

273
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,390
and one's going back and then they trade
places there you go

274
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
places there you go
 

275
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,469
places there you go
and you're going to fall into the front

276
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
and you're going to fall into the front
 

277
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,830
and you're going to fall into the front
inward position

278
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840

 

279
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,790

elbow down you're going to fall into

280
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
elbow down you're going to fall into
 

281
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,670
elbow down you're going to fall into
this front inward position

282
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
this front inward position
 

283
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,589
this front inward position
this cocky is pushing

284
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599

 

285
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:55,189

and this one is yielding on a curve

286
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199

 

287
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,710

which means my body can't

288
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
which means my body can't
 

289
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,869
which means my body can't
does not want to be pulled because now

290
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
does not want to be pulled because now
 

291
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,510
does not want to be pulled because now
i'm not reconciling that

292
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
i'm not reconciling that
 

293
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,589
i'm not reconciling that
and also my body being ahead of this

294
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
and also my body being ahead of this
 

295
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,070
and also my body being ahead of this
is just being pushed i'm not reconciling

296
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
is just being pushed i'm not reconciling
 

297
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,670
is just being pushed i'm not reconciling
that energy either

298
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
that energy either
 

299
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,710
that energy either
so what i'm going to do is disappear

300
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
so what i'm going to do is disappear
 

301
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,909
so what i'm going to do is disappear
inside

302
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
inside
 

303
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,629
inside
around i'm going to disappear inside

304
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
around i'm going to disappear inside
 

305
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,070
around i'm going to disappear inside
that energy

306
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
that energy
 

307
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:38,829
that energy
a little bit more for real

308
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839

 

309
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,190

nope

310
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
nope
 

311
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,710
nope
tie it again

312
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720

 

313
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,230

more energy

314
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240

 

315
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:58,230

so you have that 10 cup causes problems

316
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240

 

317
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:09,509

is very weak

318
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
is very weak
 

319
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,710
is very weak
so this is going to require that i dive

320
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
so this is going to require that i dive
 

321
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,110
so this is going to require that i dive
under this here

322
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120

 

323
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,350

not go around my leg

324
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360

 

325
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:59,190

the yield underneath

326
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200

 

327
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,670

let's try okay so uh let's let's explain

328
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
let's try okay so uh let's let's explain
 

329
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,389
let's try okay so uh let's let's explain
the first few reps there he had he had a

330
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
the first few reps there he had he had a
 

331
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:06,790
the first few reps there he had he had a
weak

332
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
weak
 

333
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,030
weak
um um so it's hard to reconcile the

334
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
um um so it's hard to reconcile the
 

335
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,550
um um so it's hard to reconcile the
energy that's not there but

336
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
energy that's not there but
 

337
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,710
energy that's not there but
the example is that he's pushing this

338
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
the example is that he's pushing this
 

339
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,230
the example is that he's pushing this
hand

340
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
hand
 

341
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,350
hand
and what i'm going to do is go

342
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
and what i'm going to do is go
 

343
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,269
and what i'm going to do is go
underneath his hand

344
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
underneath his hand
 

345
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,750
underneath his hand
okay that that's right so he he's he's

346
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
okay that that's right so he he's he's
 

347
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,030
okay that that's right so he he's he's

350
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
hip and the back hips gonna go
 

351
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,389

underneath him
 

353
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,829

here and let that energy go by

354
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839

 

355
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,910

okay um and what i'm doing

356
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
okay um and what i'm doing
 

357
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,110
okay um and what i'm doing
is de uh accelerating

358
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
is de uh accelerating
 

359
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,870
is de uh accelerating
i'm not um continually being accelerated

360
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
i'm not um continually being accelerated
 

361
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,750
i'm not um continually being accelerated
okay because to be continually

362
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
okay because to be continually
 

363
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,590
okay because to be continually
accelerated

364
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
accelerated
 

365
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,550

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
is a young young clash he's he's
 

367
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,310
is a young young clash he's he's
accelerating me because i'm pushing on

368
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
accelerating me because i'm pushing on
 

369
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,030

him he's
overpowering me okay i want to get rid

372
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
overpowering me okay i want to get rid
 

373
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,509

um there's a reason for that well first

376
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
um there's a reason for that well first
 

377
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,990
um there's a reason for that well first
of all that's the art

378
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
of all that's the art
 

379
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,190
of all that's the art
but you'll see that you're going to gain

380
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
but you'll see that you're going to gain
 

381
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,710
but you'll see that you're going to gain
some benefits once your

382
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
some benefits once your
 

383
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,430
some benefits once your
chemi can get up at that level so first

384
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
chemi can get up at that level so first
 

385
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,750

386
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
of all
 

387
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,790
of all
try to demonstrate it again so

388
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800

 

389
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:26,829

still too weak you're trying not to fall

390
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839

 

391
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:41,670

backwards

392
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680

 

393
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,590

so now look how i'm going to disarm

394
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
so now look how i'm going to disarm
 

395
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,230
so now look how i'm going to disarm

396
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
the cull cube by rolling this hip
 

397
00:11:50,240 --> 00:12:08,629
the cull cube by rolling this hip
underneath it

398
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639

 

399
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:16,550

now here's the thing um

400
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560

 

401
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,990

when you do that you actually

402
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
when you do that you actually
 

403
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,310
when you do that you actually
stay in the movement longer

404
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320

 

405
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,350

whereas for example he goes

406
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
whereas for example he goes
 

407
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,150
whereas for example he goes
and you come down here you're already

408
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
and you come down here you're already
 

409
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,590
and you come down here you're already
moving away

410
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
moving away
 

411
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,310
moving away
from the knot and

412
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
from the knot and
 

413
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,110
from the knot and
he is pushing you after a while you

414
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
he is pushing you after a while you
 

415
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,629
he is pushing you after a while you
start moving that way

416
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
start moving that way
 

417
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,550
start moving that way
and so you're less resistance

418
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
and so you're less resistance
 

419
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,829
and so you're less resistance
in terms of how long you wore resistance

420
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839
in terms of how long you wore resistance
 

421
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,430
in terms of how long you wore resistance
okay so if i do

422
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
okay so if i do
 

423
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,949
okay so if i do
the barrel roll thing shoulder and hips

424
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
the barrel roll thing shoulder and hips
 

425
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,150
the barrel roll thing shoulder and hips
down

426
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160

 

427
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,030

if he's strong enough go dude

428
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
if he's strong enough go dude
 

429
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,829
if he's strong enough go dude
eventually he gets it

430
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839

 

431
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,470

but once i stay engaged

432
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
but once i stay engaged
 

433
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,310
but once i stay engaged
he's going to feel low you see that

434
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
he's going to feel low you see that
 

435
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,509
he's going to feel low you see that
weight stalled him

436
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
weight stalled him
 

437
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,509
weight stalled him
because i don't i don't yield by

438
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
because i don't i don't yield by
 

439
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,990
because i don't i don't yield by
running from him or being pushable to

440
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,000
running from him or being pushable to
 

441
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,710
running from him or being pushable to
him

442
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
him
 

443
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,910
him
i wait for him to

444
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920
i wait for him to
 

445
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,949
i wait for him to
overpower it and that's what i yield to

446
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
overpower it and that's what i yield to
 

447
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:35,590
overpower it and that's what i yield to
it so

448
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
it so
 

449
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,629
it so
he'll feel a lot of weight as i go

450
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
he'll feel a lot of weight as i go
 

451
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,030
he'll feel a lot of weight as i go
you see he can't he can't even get the

452
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
you see he can't he can't even get the
 

453
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,990
you see he can't he can't even get the
technique

454
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
technique
 

455
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,189
technique
okay uh and then on the other side so

456
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:45,199
okay uh and then on the other side so
 

457
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,910
okay uh and then on the other side so
he has to improve his technique as

458
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
he has to improve his technique as
 

459
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,189
he has to improve his technique as
opposed to

460
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:49,199
opposed to
 

461
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,870
opposed to
he goes like this and he's already

462
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
he goes like this and he's already
 

463
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,590
he goes like this and he's already
falling there's no more technique

464
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
falling there's no more technique
 

465
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,269
falling there's no more technique
he's fallen away

466
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:57,279

 

467
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,509

there was nothing there

468
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519

 

469
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,189

but the downside of that is

470
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
but the downside of that is
 

471
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,629
but the downside of that is
when i do the technique right my uk has

472
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
when i do the technique right my uk has
 

473
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,990
when i do the technique right my uk has
no chance

474
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000
no chance

okay so meaning when i'm not relying on

um my technique gets really hard like
 

485
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,110
um my technique gets really hard like
for him to

486
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
for him to
 

487
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,170
for him to
try to stay in front of so we're going

488
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:29,180
try to stay in front of so we're going

he couldn't move and the grip got

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,550
he couldn't move and the grip got
compromised because

494
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
compromised because
 

495
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,509
compromised because
his weight is pulling against the grip

496
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:37,519
his weight is pulling against the grip
 

497
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,470
his weight is pulling against the grip
okay

okay
 

499
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,670
okay
and so he just he just kind of get

500
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,680
and so he just he just kind of get
 

501
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,389
and so he just he just kind of get
hit you see

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,430

you would probably say that is that like

508
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
you would probably say that is that like
 

509
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,030
you would probably say that is that like

two to five percent right

his body is too still and so his grips

516
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
his body is too still and so his grips
 

517
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,269
his body is too still and so his grips
get pulled out because his body is not

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,350
to reconcile then he's just gonna feel
all that weight of that

548
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
all that weight of that
 

549
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,590
