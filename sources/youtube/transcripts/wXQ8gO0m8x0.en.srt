00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,990
look what your look at your center
watch your center

190
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
watch your center
 

191
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,870
watch your center
okay

192
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880

shoulder

194
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
shoulder
 

195
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,389
shoulder

but this didn't this not affected this
 

199
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,829
but this didn't this not affected this
you see it tilted

200
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
you see it tilted
 

201
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,910
you see it tilted
and then that

202
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
and then that
 

203
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:58,630
and then that
i tilt

204
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640

 

205
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,070

now if we watch

206
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080

 

207
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,470

um
now look how

224
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
now look how
 

225
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,150
now look how
you're turning your weight

226
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
you're turning your weight
 

227
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,350
you're turning your weight
you see so

228
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
you see so
 

229
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,269
you see so
tilt your pelvis angle that's an

230
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
tilt your pelvis angle that's an
 

231
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,630
tilt your pelvis angle that's an
absorption

232
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
absorption
 

233
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,829
absorption
easy

234
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
easy
 

235
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,110
easy
and then

236
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
and then
 

237
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,110
and then
it starts to turn and now your center is

238
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
it starts to turn and now your center is
 

239
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,710
it starts to turn and now your center is
not moving

240
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:32,720
not moving
 

241
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,990
not moving
just like

242
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
just like
 

243
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,389
just like
this one

244
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
this one
 

245
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,030
this one
okay so watch how it doesn't matter what

246
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
okay so watch how it doesn't matter what
 

247
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,470
okay so watch how it doesn't matter what
you do

248
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
you do
 

249
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,870
you do
yep there's that tilt again look how i

250
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
yep there's that tilt again look how i
 

251
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,870
yep there's that tilt again look how i
keep it moving

252
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
keep it moving
 

253
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,070
keep it moving
you see

254
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
you see
 

255
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,590
you see
so you see how you had to reach for the

256
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
so you see how you had to reach for the
 

257
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,350
so you see how you had to reach for the
ground i will keep one trajectory just

258
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
ground i will keep one trajectory just
 

259
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,190
ground i will keep one trajectory just
like you're keeping one right now into

260
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
like you're keeping one right now into
 

261
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,389
like you're keeping one right now into
the shoulder

262
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
the shoulder
 

263
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,550
the shoulder
not paying attention to what you

264
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
not paying attention to what you
 

265
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,550
not paying attention to what you
actually want to accomplish so you go

266
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
actually want to accomplish so you go
 

267

277
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,790
yeah maybe put your hand down
and then i can come in and keep that

278
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
and then i can come in and keep that
 

279
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,389
and then i can come in and keep that
same feeling

280
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
same feeling
 

281
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,790
same feeling
on your body

282
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800

 

283
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,990

so it goes

284
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
so it goes
 

285
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,230
so it goes
not up here

286
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
not up here
 

287
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,870
not up here
that's just a tilt

288
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
that's just a tilt
 

289
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,030

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
because my
 

369
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,790
because my
uke

370
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
uke
 

371
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,750
uke
keeps trying to pull their center out

372
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
keeps trying to pull their center out
 

373
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,190
keeps trying to pull their center out
of the koku

374
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
of the koku
 

375
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,190
of the koku
construct do you see

376
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
construct do you see
 

377
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,350
construct do you see
oh it's good for me

378
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
oh it's good for me
 

379
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,629
oh it's good for me
because i i'm basically doing gu

380
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
because i i'm basically doing gu
 

381
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,389
because i i'm basically doing gu
all the time

382
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
all the time
 

383
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,509
all the time
but

384
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
but
 

385
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,590
but
not good for use you can

386
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
not good for use you can
 

387
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,150
not good for use you can
because

388
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
because
 

389
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,710
because
of the process

390
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
of the process
 

391
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,870
of the process
by which you can do this skill that i'm

392
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
by which you can do this skill that i'm
 

393
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,829
by which you can do this skill that i'm
doing

394
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
doing
 

395
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,110
doing
okay

396
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120
okay
 

397
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,190
okay
so uh imagine i disconnect you see

398
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
so uh imagine i disconnect you see
 

399
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,550
so uh imagine i disconnect you see
i'm going to do

400
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:06,560
i'm going to do
 

401
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,310
i'm going to do
i'll show you what you do she's going to

402
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
i'll show you what you do she's going to
 

403
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,590
i'll show you what you do she's going to
push into me

404
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:09,600
push into me
 

405
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,910
push into me
and you see how i did that

406
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
and you see how i did that
 

407
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,190
and you see how i did that
so

408
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
so
 

409
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,910
so
whom these are counters

410
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
whom these are counters
 

411
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,389
whom these are counters
so if i keep my

412
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
so if i keep my
 

413
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,470
so if i keep my
same construct

414
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
same construct
 

415
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,790
same construct
she'll she'll move me but it's a little

416
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
she'll she'll move me but it's a little
 

417
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,750
she'll she'll move me but it's a little
heavy for her because her her construct

418
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
heavy for her because her her construct
 

419
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,949
heavy for her because her her construct
is not that

420
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
is not that
 

421
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,829
is not that
organized doesn't have integrity

422
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
organized doesn't have integrity
 

423
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,030
organized doesn't have integrity
okay

424
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
okay
 

425
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,550
okay
so imagine

426
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
so imagine
 

427
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,750
so imagine
uh

428
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
uh
 

429
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,069
uh
when she pushes on me

430
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
when she pushes on me
 

431
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,910
when she pushes on me
i do those

432
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
i do those
 

433
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,509
i do those
dismantling you see and now i cannot i'm

434
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
dismantling you see and now i cannot i'm
 

435
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,509
dismantling you see and now i cannot i'm
never gonna control her center i'm gonna

436
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
never gonna control her center i'm gonna
 

437
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,790
never gonna control her center i'm gonna
have to do this externally

438
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
have to do this externally
 

439
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,949
have to do this externally
you see

440
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
you see
 

441
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,030
you see
so

442
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040

 

443
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,150

what you're learning as uke

444

is
what it's like

448
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
what it's like
 

449
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,350
what it's like
to be in a you construct

450
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
to be in a you construct
 

451
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,310
to be in a you construct
so that you can go from i have no idea

452
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
so that you can go from i have no idea
 

453
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,949
so that you can go from i have no idea
what that why that's happening to me do

454
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959
what that why that's happening to me do
 

455
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,069
what that why that's happening to me do
you get it

456
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
you get it
 

457
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,189
you get it
at first for example

458
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
at first for example
 

459
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,310
at first for example
uh

460
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
uh
 

461
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,230
uh
as you guys uh our testament to is it

462
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
as you guys uh our testament to is it
 

463
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,790
as you guys uh our testament to is it
looks very external

464
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
looks very external
 

465
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,710
looks very external
you see so you do your you do your

466
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
you see so you do your you do your
 

467
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,990
you see so you do your you do your
technique external everything's external

468
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
technique external everything's external
 

469
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,629
technique external everything's external
and then you start paying attention

470
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
and then you start paying attention
 

471
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,790
and then you start paying attention
she ends up turtling

472
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
she ends up turtling
 

473
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,629
she ends up turtling
you end up with this super tight grip

474
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
you end up with this super tight grip
 

475
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,870
you end up with this super tight grip
over here

476
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880

 

477
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,829

or you have to really

478
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839
or you have to really
 

479
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,550
or you have to really
pull them

480
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
pull them
 

481
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,750
pull them
do you see

482
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:45,760
do you see
 

483
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,870
do you see
or

484
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
or
 

485
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,189
or
uh you don't know how to do it so i have

486
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
uh you don't know how to do it so i have
 

487
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,030
uh you don't know how to do it so i have
to tell you how to do it you you go

488
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
to tell you how to do it you you go
 

489
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,430
to tell you how to do it you you go
flying around me

490
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
flying around me
 

491
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,230
flying around me
basically you you get them to do it

492
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
basically you you get them to do it
 

493
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,670
basically you you get them to do it
because it's all external okay

494
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
because it's all external okay
 

495
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,350
because it's all external okay
um

496
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
um
 

497
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,310
um
because i don't know what else to do

i can't
 

501
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,670
i can't
i've never felt it

502
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
i've never felt it
 

503
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,150
i've never felt it
but then after i feel it for the first

504
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
but then after i feel it for the first
 

505
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,189
but then after i feel it for the first
time

506
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,199
time
 

507
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,269
time
i can't understand it

508
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
i can't understand it
 

509
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,550
i can't understand it
do you see

510
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
do you see
 

511
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,590
do you see
so the traditional arts are like

512
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
so the traditional arts are like
 

513
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,670
so the traditional arts are like
understanding is never going to give it

514
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
understanding is never going to give it
 

515
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,269
understanding is never going to give it
to you

516
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
to you
 

517
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,269
to you
you trying to do it you trying to

518
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279
you trying to do it you trying to
 

519
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,629
you trying to do it you trying to
understand it

520
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
understand it
 

521
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,750
understand it
is why you did the external stuff

522
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:27,760
is why you did the external stuff
 

523
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,990
is why you did the external stuff
so

524
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
so
 

525
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,230
so
the teacher is going to

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,789
you're turning a little shy it's a
little shy on the turn

906
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
little shy on the turn
 

907
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,830
little shy on the turn
keep going

908
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:25,840

 

909
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,190

and now you don't have that feeling

910
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
and now you don't have that feeling
 

911
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:35,750
and now you don't have that feeling
anymore

912
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760

 

913
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,789

find the center finder center again

914
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:40,799

 

915
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,390

and now you have it again right there

916
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,400
and now you have it again right there
 

917
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,750
and now you have it again right there
but that's a lot of not have it okay

918
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:45,760
but that's a lot of not have it okay
 

919
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,590
but that's a lot of not have it okay
okay so earlier

920
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
okay so earlier
 

921
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,909
okay so earlier
i discussed how

922
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
i discussed how
 

923
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,750
i discussed how
uh it does not have to travel in

924
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:51,760
uh it does not have to travel in
 

925
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,909
uh it does not have to travel in
straight line you remember that and

926
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
straight line you remember that and
 

927
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,750
straight line you remember that and
energy is not

928
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:55,760
energy is not
 

929
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,269
energy is not
energy does not have to travel in a

930
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
energy does not have to travel in a
 

931
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,990
energy does not have to travel in a
straight line your your uh your material

932
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,000
straight line your your uh your material
 

933
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,470
straight line your your uh your material
your secular material mind

934
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:02,480
your secular material mind
 

935
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,950
your secular material mind
only sees straight lines okay

936
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:04,960
only sees straight lines okay
 

937
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,390
only sees straight lines okay
um

938
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,400
um
 

939
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,549
um
but

940
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
but
 

941
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,430
but
you want to let go of those things so

942
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,440
you want to let go of those things so
 

943
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,029
you want to let go of those things so
energy does not have to travel in a

944
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
energy does not have to travel in a
 

945
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,390
energy does not have to travel in a
straight line

946
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,400
straight line
 

947
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,590
straight line
and also energy does not require certain

948
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
and also energy does not require certain
 

949
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,630
and also energy does not require certain
shape

950
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,640
shape
 

951
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,669
shape
okay

952
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:19,679
okay
 

953
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,470
okay
so what you're doing

954
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:22,480
so what you're doing
 

955
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,590
so what you're doing
is you're con you you're thinking even

956
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:25,600
is you're con you you're thinking even
 

957
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,909
is you're con you you're thinking even
though i told you you're not

958
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:27,919
though i told you you're not
 

959
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,390
though i told you you're not
you're thinking uh

960
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:30,400
you're thinking uh
 

961
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,870
you're thinking uh
this pushing thing you see

962
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:32,880
this pushing thing you see
 

963
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,269
this pushing thing you see
um

964
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:35,279
um
 

965
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,390
um
but

966
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:36,400
but
 

967
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,990
but
the example i gave where you're just

968
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,000
the example i gave where you're just
 

969
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,029
the example i gave where you're just
touching

970
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
touching
 

971
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,870
touching
this is a horizontal touch if you pay

972
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:40,880
this is a horizontal touch if you pay
 

973
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,710
this is a horizontal touch if you pay
attention

974
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:42,720
attention
 

975
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,070
attention
but on the

976
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,080
but on the
 

977
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,870
but on the
horizontal touch you see

978
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
horizontal touch you see
 

979
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,870
horizontal touch you see
you get it and uh also the fact that it

980
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:50,880
you get it and uh also the fact that it
 

981
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,110
you get it and uh also the fact that it
would mechanically you would go that

982
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,120
would mechanically you would go that
 

983
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,269
would mechanically you would go that
would be slippery do you see

984
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:55,279
would be slippery do you see
 

985
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,310
would be slippery do you see
um

986
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,320
um
 

987
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,310
um
but it doesn't require the

988
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
but it doesn't require the
 

989
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,870
but it doesn't require the
the grip you just you you you match her

990
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:00,880
the grip you just you you you match her
 

991
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,390
the grip you just you you you match her
energy

992
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,400
energy
 

993
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,029
energy
okay i'm gonna match her energy and then

994
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:05,039
okay i'm gonna match her energy and then
 

995
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,909
okay i'm gonna match her energy and then
you will stick to it because energy

996
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:07,919
you will stick to it because energy
 

997
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,310
you will stick to it because energy
doesn't realize it's from two different

998
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,320
doesn't realize it's from two different
 

999
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,110
doesn't realize it's from two different
sources it's just one energy and you

1000
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,120
sources it's just one energy and you
 

1001
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,269
sources it's just one energy and you
generate friction okay

1002
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
generate friction okay
 

1003
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,789
generate friction okay
um a ikea adhesion got it so it doesn't

1004
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
um a ikea adhesion got it so it doesn't
 

1005
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,950
um a ikea adhesion got it so it doesn't
require a certain shape

1006
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
require a certain shape
 

1007
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,190
require a certain shape
wherever you're touching

1008
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
wherever you're touching
 

1009
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,269
wherever you're touching
you can do call q or aiki okay

1010
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:27,279
you can do call q or aiki okay
 

1011
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,549
you can do call q or aiki okay
so

1012
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
so
 

1013
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,110
so
let us get to

1014
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,120
let us get to
 

1015
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,630
let us get to
uh

1016
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
uh
 

1017
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,789
uh
let's just correct one thing you start

1018
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:34,799
let's just correct one thing you start
 

1019
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,710
let's just correct one thing you start
to go shy here you see that okay so i

1020
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:38,720
to go shy here you see that okay so i
 

1021
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,830
to go shy here you see that okay so i
just want you to feel it it there's that

1022
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
just want you to feel it it there's that
 

1023
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,470
just want you to feel it it there's that
this would be the other mistakes

1024
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:44,480
this would be the other mistakes
 

1025
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,350
this would be the other mistakes
you see

1026
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
you see
 

1027
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,190
you see
but

1028
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,200
but
 

1029
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,310
but
i and keep you right at that edge

1030
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
i and keep you right at that edge
 

1031
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,269
i and keep you right at that edge
right at that edge do you see that okay

1032
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:53,279
right at that edge do you see that okay
 

1033
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,389
right at that edge do you see that okay
all right so now let's look at i'm over

1034
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
all right so now let's look at i'm over
 

1035
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,350
all right so now let's look at i'm over
here

1036
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,360
here
 

1037
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,630
here
do you see

1038
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:58,640
do you see
 

1039
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,789
do you see
this is a shape different from the other

1040
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:00,799
this is a shape different from the other
 

1041
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,870
this is a shape different from the other
shape

1042
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:02,880
shape
 

1043
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,149
shape
but you only recognize straight lines

1044
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:06,159
but you only recognize straight lines
 

1045
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,149
but you only recognize straight lines
so here i am

1046
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
so here i am
 

1047
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,430
so here i am
and i'm not doing a wrist lock

1048
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:11,440
and i'm not doing a wrist lock
 

1049
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,590
and i'm not doing a wrist lock
just wherever i'm touching

1050
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,600
just wherever i'm touching
 

1051
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,830
just wherever i'm touching
i'm keeping that same thing can you see

1052
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:17,840
i'm keeping that same thing can you see
 

1053
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,430
i'm keeping that same thing can you see
so

1054
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:19,440
so
 

1055
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,789
so
a q

1056
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:20,799
a q
 

1057
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,990
a q
would be

1058
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,000
would be
 

1059
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,470
would be
when i go here

1060
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:26,480

 

1061
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,230

you stopped

1062
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,240
you stopped
 

1063
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,510
you stopped
until

1064
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:29,520
until
 

1065
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,950
until
i get your center again okay

1066
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:34,960

 

1067
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,070

so

1068
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,080
so
 

1069
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,909
so
uh

1070
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:37,919
uh
 

1071
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,230
uh
boom

1072
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,240
boom
 

1073
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,149
boom
wherever i'm touching

1074
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:42,159
wherever i'm touching
 

1075
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,909
wherever i'm touching
so it's not this

1076
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919

 

1077
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,789

wherever i'm touching you you can see

1078
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:48,799

1251
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,830
now you got to move it all the way
around because you all at once you got

1252
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:21,840
around because you all at once you got
 

1253
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,509
around because you all at once you got
to bring it all the way around as

1254
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:23,519
to bring it all the way around as
 

1255
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:31,110
to bring it all the way around as
opposed to incrementally bringing it

1256
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,120

 

1257
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,830

just stand stand still stand still

00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:33,840
just stand stand still stand still
 

1259
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,669
just stand stand still stand still
and now you find your inside elbow hand

1260
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:37,679
and now you find your inside elbow hand
 

1261
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,830
and now you find your inside elbow hand
but that's

1262
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:40,840

 

1263
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,509

external in front of her center

1264
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:43,519
external in front of her center
 

1265
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,029
external in front of her center
keep going

1266
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:45,039
keep going
 

1267
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,990
keep going
and look how in order to get your right

and look how in order to get your right
 

1269
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,669
and look how in order to get your right
hand in place

1270
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:49,679
hand in place
 

1271
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,950
hand in place
look how dominant your left hand has to

1272
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:52,960
look how dominant your left hand has to
 

1273
00:32:52,960 --> 00:33:03,190
look how dominant your left hand has to
be on the grip you see okay

1274
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,200

 

1275
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,110

okay

1276
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,120

 

1277
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,509

okay so right here

1278
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:11,519
okay so right here
 

1279
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,509
okay so right here
you leave it all there

1280
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:15,519

 

1281
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,470

and then this hand is now on the outside

1282
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:18,480
and then this hand is now on the outside
 

1283
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,669
and then this hand is now on the outside
of you

1284
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
of you
 

1285
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,430
of you
now you don't you know not to push here

1286
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
now you don't you know not to push here
 

1287
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,630
now you don't you know not to push here
because it's your inner deltoid so you

1288
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:24,640
because it's your inner deltoid so you
 

1289
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,549
because it's your inner deltoid so you
death grip this hand

1290
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:26,559
death grip this hand
 

1291
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,789
death grip this hand
to bring it back underneath your

1292
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:28,799
to bring it back underneath your
 

1293
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:38,870
to bring it back underneath your
centerpiece

1294
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880

 

1295
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,430

off as it goes off

1296
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:41,440
off as it goes off
 

1297
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,110
off as it goes off
pull it

1298
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,120
pull it
 

1299
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,110
pull it
and then you get then you can put it

1300
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,120
and then you get then you can put it
 

1301
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,389
and then you get then you can put it
down here but here's the thing

1302
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:48,399
down here but here's the thing
 

1303
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,669
down here but here's the thing
uh

1304
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:49,679
uh
 

1305
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,149
uh
grip really hard okay

1306
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:56,159

 

1307
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,070

so i can barely get

1308
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,080
so i can barely get
 

1309
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,110
so i can barely get
it off

1310
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,120
it off
 

1311
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,269
it off
and it took a while in that time you're

1312
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:01,279
and it took a while in that time you're
 

1313
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,389
and it took a while in that time you're
not

1314
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:02,399
not
 

1315
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,110
not
see

1316
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
see
 

1317
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,149
see
so

1318
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:04,159
so
 

1319
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,789
so
while you're not necessarily

1320
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:06,799
while you're not necessarily
 

1321
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,669
while you're not necessarily
overpowering the elbow because you're

1322
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:09,679
overpowering the elbow because you're
 

1323
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,190
overpowering the elbow because you're
using sound body mechanics

1324
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,200
using sound body mechanics
 

1325
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,869
using sound body mechanics
you did have to overpower the grip okay

1326
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:16,879
you did have to overpower the grip okay
 

1327
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,669
you did have to overpower the grip okay
so

1328
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:17,679
so
 

1329
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,710
so
we'll get to that part

1330
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:20,720
we'll get to that part
 

1331
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,829
we'll get to that part
but what i'm saying is this keeps moving

1332
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:25,839

 

1333
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,149

you see that

1334
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,159
you see that
 

1335
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,710
you see that
so

1336
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:30,720

 

1337
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,270

right where i touch you i keep that same

1338
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:33,280
right where i touch you i keep that same
 

1339
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,550
right where i touch you i keep that same
feeling

1340
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:38,560

 

1341
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,990

it's not that

1342
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,000
it's not that
 

1343
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,510
it's not that
i'm going here

1344
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:41,520
i'm going here
 

1345
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,349
i'm going here
and then i'm making

1346
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:45,359

 

1347
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,829

the same feeling

1348
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:51,839

 

1349
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,310

so we'll slow it down

1350
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:54,320
so we'll slow it down
 

1351
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,550
so we'll slow it down
we'll get to where we need to be here we

1352
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:56,560
we'll get to where we need to be here we
 

1353
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,310
we'll get to where we need to be here we
are right here

1354
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,320
are right here
 

1355
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,190
are right here
this here right here these two hands

1356
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
this here right here these two hands
 

1357
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,230
this here right here these two hands
keep you moving

1358
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:04,240

 

1359
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,150

and then i enter not on a straight line

1360
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,160
and then i enter not on a straight line
 

1361
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,190
and then i enter not on a straight line
but on a curve

1362
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,200

 

1363
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,270

look how my waist is turning

1364
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:13,280
look how my waist is turning
 

1365
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:27,109
look how my waist is turning
and look how far into

1366
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:27,119

 

1367
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,829

and then a

1368
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:28,839
and then a
 

1369
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,870
and then a
turn so you can see the uk stays still

1370
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:32,880
turn so you can see the uk stays still
 

1371
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,990
turn so you can see the uk stays still
that's different the udemy angle is

1372
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,000
that's different the udemy angle is
 

1373
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,270
that's different the udemy angle is
straight

1374
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:37,280
straight
 

1375
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,069
straight
uh

1376
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
uh
 

1377
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,069
uh
and then there's a delay

1378
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:40,079
and then there's a delay
 

1379
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:40,870
and then there's a delay
for

1380
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:40,880
for
 

1381
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,430
for
when i bring the elbow hand back into

1382
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:43,440
when i bring the elbow hand back into
 

1383
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,670
when i bring the elbow hand back into
play and then a stress

1384
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:45,680
play and then a stress
 

1385
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,630
play and then a stress
on the

1386
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:46,640
on the
 

1387
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,150
on the
grip at the wrist

1388
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,160
grip at the wrist
 

1389
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,109
grip at the wrist
you see so when you lose the internal

1390
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:51,119
you see so when you lose the internal
 

1391
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,069
you see so when you lose the internal
skills all these external problems come

1392
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:54,079
skills all these external problems come
 

1393
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,510
skills all these external problems come
up okay so

1394
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:55,520
up okay so
 

1395
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,270
up okay so
what we want to do

1396
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,280
what we want to do
 

1397
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,870
what we want to do
again

1398
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:58,880
again
 

1399
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,670
again
is

1400
00:35:59,670 --> 00:35:59,680
is
 

1401
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,710
is
here

1402
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:00,720
here
 

1403
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,150
here
with this touch this this touch you see

everything keeps moving
 

1411
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,950
everything keeps moving
then you just enter in when the yin

1412
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:20,960
then you just enter in when the yin
 

1413
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,829
then you just enter in when the yin
space creates when the in space

1414
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:24,839
space creates when the in space
 

1415
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,550
space creates when the in space
moves amazing

1416
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:28,560
moves amazing
 

1417
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,510
moves amazing
so

1418
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,520
so
 

1419
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,670
so
rather than your solution

1420
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:31,680
rather than your solution
 

1421
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,190
rather than your solution
this

1422
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,200
this
 

1423
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,990
this
keep them moving and feeling okay and

1424
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,000
keep them moving and feeling okay and
 

1425
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,790
keep them moving and feeling okay and
