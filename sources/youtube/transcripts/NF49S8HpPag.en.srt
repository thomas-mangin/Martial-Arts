00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:06,299
okay so Coq Dosa is a micro drill of the
 

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,049
okay so Coq Dosa is a micro drill of the
keyhon Masa where you work on that

00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:09,059
keyhon Masa where you work on that
 

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,810
keyhon Masa where you work on that
rotating cross energetic pattern okay

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:11,820
rotating cross energetic pattern okay
 

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,089
rotating cross energetic pattern okay
what we're going to do is a micro drill

8
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:14,099
what we're going to do is a micro drill
 

9
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,970
what we're going to do is a micro drill
of the micro drill so you're going to

10
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:16,980
of the micro drill so you're going to
 

11
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,950
of the micro drill so you're going to
use that same

12
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
use that same
 

13
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,130
use that same
uh energetic pattern

14
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:22,140
uh energetic pattern
 

15
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,650
uh energetic pattern
and you're going to do we could call it

16
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:24,660
and you're going to do we could call it
 

17
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,890
and you're going to do we could call it
a a hot rod deconstruction

18
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:27,900
a a hot rod deconstruction
 

19
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,830
a a hot rod deconstruction
so I'm gonna displace her hata okay

20
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:30,840
so I'm gonna displace her hata okay
 

21
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,729
so I'm gonna displace her hata okay
which is a part of all your kazushi so

right now normally when you do cocidosa

24
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,040
right now normally when you do cocidosa
 

25
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,470
right now normally when you do cocidosa
it kinda looks like you might have it I

26
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
it kinda looks like you might have it I
 

27
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,030
it kinda looks like you might have it I
can tell you don't though

but all I'm going to do now is uh the on
the scent on her Center

32
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:50,219
the scent on her Center
 

33
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,510
the scent on her Center
and you have to push to generate oh my

00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:04,070
and you have to push to generate oh my
Tom's end field oh

36
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080

 

37
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:15,649

oh

38
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:15,659

 

39
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:50,630

foreign

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640

 

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,149

just take her Hot Off

42
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:53,159
just take her Hot Off
 

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,630
just take her Hot Off
so for the heart of the to be Hara it

44
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
so for the heart of the to be Hara it
 

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,090
so for the heart of the to be Hara it
has to be in a three element

46
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,100
has to be in a three element
 

47
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,310
has to be in a three element
relationship with the perimeters so her

48
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
relationship with the perimeters so her
 

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,350
relationship with the perimeters so her
head and her base

50
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,360
head and her base
 

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,690
head and her base
right there's no Center if I don't have

52
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:08,700
right there's no Center if I don't have
 

53
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,790
right there's no Center if I don't have
a perimeter of symmetrical on both sides

54
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
a perimeter of symmetrical on both sides
 

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,190
a perimeter of symmetrical on both sides
so what I'm doing is displacing that

56
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
so what I'm doing is displacing that
 

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,390
so what I'm doing is displacing that
part

58
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
part
 

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,910
part
okay

60
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:16,920

 

61
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,190

and therefore you deconstruct the

62
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
and therefore you deconstruct the
 

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,970
and therefore you deconstruct the
relationship okay that's true

64
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:25,980

 

65
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,050

okay so what you're

66
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,060
okay so what you're
 

67
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,869
okay so what you're
doing you use the right word and I think

68
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
doing you use the right word and I think
 

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,270
doing you use the right word and I think
that's probably the best uh uh English

70
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
that's probably the best uh uh English
 

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,910
that's probably the best uh uh English
word there's an Alchemy that's happening

72
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
word there's an Alchemy that's happening
 

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,470
word there's an Alchemy that's happening
there's a a transformation of one aspect

74
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
there's a a transformation of one aspect
 

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,710
there's a a transformation of one aspect
into something other than it was and

76
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:45,720
into something other than it was and
 

77
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,550
into something other than it was and
it's an internal Alchemy okay but you

78
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:49,560
it's an internal Alchemy okay but you
 

79
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,190
it's an internal Alchemy okay but you
can only work with these Universal

80
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,200
can only work with these Universal
 

81
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,690
can only work with these Universal
principles okay

82
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:53,700
principles okay
 

83
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,150
principles okay
okay so in essence

84
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
okay so in essence
 

85
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,210
okay so in essence
we in Aikido discourse have an Ike and a

86
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:02,220
we in Aikido discourse have an Ike and a
 

87
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,610
we in Aikido discourse have an Ike and a
Coq

88
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:04,620
Coq
 

89
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,309
Coq
but they are

90
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:07,319
but they are
 

91
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,410
but they are
um

92
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:08,420
um
 

93
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,390
um
concentric with of course yin and yang

94
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:11,400
concentric with of course yin and yang
 

95
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,790
concentric with of course yin and yang
but concentric with a let us say

96
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:15,800
but concentric with a let us say
 

97
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,970
but concentric with a let us say
Obviously a communion uh element and

98
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:19,980
Obviously a communion uh element and
 

99
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,449
Obviously a communion uh element and
then a separation element but you could

100
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:23,459
then a separation element but you could
 

101
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,610
then a separation element but you could
also think of it as a

102
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:27,620
also think of it as a
 

103
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,970
also think of it as a
uh uh a stabilizing element and a

104
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:31,980
uh uh a stabilizing element and a
 

105
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,470
uh uh a stabilizing element and a
disruptive element okay so for example

106
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:35,480
disruptive element okay so for example
 

107
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,250
disruptive element okay so for example
uh ikey is a stabilizing element and

108
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:40,260
uh ikey is a stabilizing element and
 

109
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,509
uh ikey is a stabilizing element and
cocues a disruptive elements so uh when

110
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:44,519
cocues a disruptive elements so uh when
 

111
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,990
cocues a disruptive elements so uh when
we do when you feel the eye cohesion we

112
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
we do when you feel the eye cohesion we
 

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,050
we do when you feel the eye cohesion we
are I am maintaining our relationship

114
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:51,060
are I am maintaining our relationship
 

115
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,789
are I am maintaining our relationship
and when you feel the Coq projections

116
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
and when you feel the Coq projections
 

117
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,710
and when you feel the Coq projections
that I'm done with ours have you seen

118
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:57,720
that I'm done with ours have you seen
 

119
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,289
that I'm done with ours have you seen
you want to think it that way and what

120
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:00,299
you want to think it that way and what
 

121
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,149
you want to think it that way and what
you're trying to do uh in your Arts is

122
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:05,159
you're trying to do uh in your Arts is
 

123
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,030
you're trying to do uh in your Arts is
use both of those as you need to you're

124
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,040
use both of those as you need to you're
 

125
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,630
use both of those as you need to you're
trying to bring agency

126
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
trying to bring agency
 

127
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,509
trying to bring agency
to these natural elements that are out

128
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:14,519
to these natural elements that are out
 

129
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,289
to these natural elements that are out
there okay so in this drill

130
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:18,299
there okay so in this drill
 

131
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,129
there okay so in this drill
um I never really uh

do the disruptive elements you see so

138
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:31,800
do the disruptive elements you see so
 

139
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,830
do the disruptive elements you see so
you're going to feel a lot more eye key

140
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
you're going to feel a lot more eye key
 

141
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,350
you're going to feel a lot more eye key
and I take Coq

142
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:36,360
and I take Coq
 

143
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,050
and I take Coq
uh never to that the absence of the ID I

144
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,060
uh never to that the absence of the ID I
 

145
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,850
uh never to that the absence of the ID I
take the disruptive Force never to the

146
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:46,860
take the disruptive Force never to the
 

147
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,570
take the disruptive Force never to the
cessation of the uh sustaining Force

okay so the first thing again you see

150
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:53,340
okay so the first thing again you see
 

151
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,770
okay so the first thing again you see
how you have a push in me

152
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:56,780
how you have a push in me
