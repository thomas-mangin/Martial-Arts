it in One Direction so if this is the

it in One Direction so if this is the
 

59
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,309
it in One Direction so if this is the
the head there's the nose you accelerate

60

the head there's the nose you accelerate
 

61
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,990
the head there's the nose you accelerate
it to the the front so you get like a

62
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
it to the the front so you get like a
 

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,750
it to the the front so you get like a
little tilt maybe you're here and then

accelerate that center of

the the UK gets

the the UK gets
 

73
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,630
the the UK gets
lazy and it's more of a convenience so

74
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
lazy and it's more of a convenience so
 

75
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,350
lazy and it's more of a convenience so
it's a little more difficult to get

76
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
it's a little more difficult to get
 

77
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,149
it's a little more difficult to get
their feet back

78
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:25,159
their feet back
 

79
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,630
their feet back
underneath so they get that upright

80
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:27,640
underneath so they get that upright
 

81
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,670

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,869

they leave their feet there and they let

they leave their feet there and they let
 

87
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,949

but as I continue to work this part as I
continue to spin the

534
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:50,840

535
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,789

technique your foot in its effort to

536
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:53,799
technique your foot in its effort to
 

537
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:57,190
technique your foot in its effort to
gain balance is going to try to move

538
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
gain balance is going to try to move
 

539
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,750
gain balance is going to try to move
back under your base Bas support so I'm

540
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:59,760
back under your base Bas support so I'm
 

541
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,750
back under your base Bas support so I'm
going to work on that eventually your

542
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:01,760
going to work on that eventually your
 

543
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,149
going to work on that eventually your
body's going to tilt do you see and then

544
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:05,159
body's going to tilt do you see and then
 

545
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,750
body's going to tilt do you see and then
you're going to try to put your foot

546
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:06,760
you're going to try to put your foot
 

547
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,950
you're going to try to put your foot
underneath your Bas of support so that

548
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
underneath your Bas of support so that
 

549
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,390
underneath your Bas of support so that
your back standing upright okay once you

550
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
your back standing upright okay once you
 

551
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,430
your back standing upright okay once you
put that foot out wherever you let's say

552
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
put that foot out wherever you let's say
 

553
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,870
put that foot out wherever you let's say
you put it here okay once you put that

554
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
you put it here okay once you put that
 

555
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,390
you put it here okay once you put that
foot down I continue this Force going

556
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:23,400
foot down I continue this Force going
 

557
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,070

and now I will

558
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,080
and now I will
 

559
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,549

right
 

573
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,470
right
and you're

574
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
and you're
 

575
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,269
and you're
tilted I'm going to keep bringing this

576
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:49,279

577
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,110
tilted I'm going to keep bringing this
part over here and I'm going to make the

578
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,120
part over here and I'm going to make the
 

579
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,310
part over here and I'm going to make the
whole base of support move out here I

580
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:55,320
whole base of support move out here I
 

581
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,149
whole base of support move out here I
make that go out there how by making

582
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
make that go out there how by making
 

583
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,549
make that go out there how by making
your Center go out that way okay and

584
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:02,559
your Center go out that way okay and
 

585
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,149
your Center go out that way okay and
then that way you can't keep stepping

586
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:06,159
then that way you can't keep stepping
 

587
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,029
then that way you can't keep stepping
underneath your Bas of support because

588
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:08,039
underneath your Bas of support because
 

589
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:11,430
underneath your Bas of support because
your Bas support moved in the opposite

590
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
your Bas support moved in the opposite
 

591
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,269
your Bas support moved in the opposite
direction from where you were trying to

592
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:13,279

593
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:15,590

replace it underneath your line of

00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
replace it underneath your line of

00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:32,519
tilting so when I go to the inside and
 

831
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:35,070

he takes that turn towards me you see

832
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,080
he takes that turn towards me you see
 

833
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,870
he takes that turn towards me you see
he's going to I Can Begin the tilting of

834
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
he's going to I Can Begin the tilting of
 

835
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,389
he's going to I Can Begin the tilting of
his body much easier so first rule

836
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:43,399
his body much easier so first rule
 

837
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:45,630
his body much easier so first rule
kazushi starts before you

838
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:45,640
kazushi starts before you
 

839
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,230
kazushi starts before you
touch

840
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:47,240
touch
 

841
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,549
touch
okay second rule kazushi has his spine

842
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:51,559
okay second rule kazushi has his spine
 

843
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:55,430
okay second rule kazushi has his spine
tilting it's never upright and kazushi

844
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,440
tilting it's never upright and kazushi
 

845
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,070
tilting it's never upright and kazushi
is continuous to the throat

846
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,080
is continuous to the throat
 

847
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,149
is continuous to the throat
so it never tilts then goes upright and

848
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:01,159
so it never tilts then goes upright and
 

849
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,909
so it never tilts then goes upright and
then tilts again doesn't happen Okay and

850
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:04,919
then tilts again doesn't happen Okay and
 

851
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:09,430
then tilts again doesn't happen Okay and
then the way that I have it tilt is

852
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,440
then the way that I have it tilt is
 

853
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,190
then the way that I have it tilt is
