00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,710

Hi, I'm Christopher Hine. Today I'm

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:02,720
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine. Today I'm
 

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,110
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine. Today I'm
going to talk a little bit about Kagash.

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,120
going to talk a little bit about Kagash.
 

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,470
going to talk a little bit about Kagash.
So, I'm just going to bring it up

6
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,480
So, I'm just going to bring it up
 

7
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,829
So, I'm just going to bring it up
because I brought it up in the last

8
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:07,839
because I brought it up in the last
 

9
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,549
because I brought it up in the last
perspective video on the new perspective

10
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
perspective video on the new perspective
 

11
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,789
perspective video on the new perspective
for Nagaywaza video. And I feel like

12
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,799
for Nagaywaza video. And I feel like
 

13
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,630
for Nagaywaza video. And I feel like
there's a lot to talk about with Kotag

14
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
there's a lot to talk about with Kotag
 

15
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,310
there's a lot to talk about with Kotag
because I think Kagashi is kind of this

16
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
because I think Kagashi is kind of this
 

17
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,349
because I think Kagashi is kind of this
really important technique actually for

18
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359
really important technique actually for
 

19
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,750
really important technique actually for
what previously was talked about in

20
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
what previously was talked about in
 

21
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,189
what previously was talked about in
classic jiu-jitsu and for what we're

22
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
classic jiu-jitsu and for what we're
 

23
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,750
classic jiu-jitsu and for what we're
doing in iikido. And I think honestly

24
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,760
doing in iikido. And I think honestly
 

25
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,509
doing in iikido. And I think honestly
the way at least I see Iikido whether

26
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
the way at least I see Iikido whether
 

27
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,630
the way at least I see Iikido whether
anyone else saw it that way or not um

28
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
anyone else saw it that way or not um
 

29
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,470
anyone else saw it that way or not um
its importance kind of has this shift

30
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
its importance kind of has this shift
 

31
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,750
its importance kind of has this shift
and I think that's kind of why it got

32
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
and I think that's kind of why it got
 

33
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,110
and I think that's kind of why it got
put in this limbo and in my opinion

34
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
put in this limbo and in my opinion
 

35
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,430
put in this limbo and in my opinion
quote kind of sits in a limbo. Um so I'm

36
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
quote kind of sits in a limbo. Um so I'm
 

37
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,310
quote kind of sits in a limbo. Um so I'm
going to talk a little bit about that.

38
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
going to talk a little bit about that.
 

39
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,590
going to talk a little bit about that.
I'm g get Josh over here. We're gonna go

40
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
I'm g get Josh over here. We're gonna go
 

41
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,350
I'm g get Josh over here. We're gonna go
to work. Josh.

42
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360

 

43
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,470

All right. So let's

44
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,480
All right. So let's
 

45
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,790
All right. So let's
that was exciting. Let's talk a little

46
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
that was exciting. Let's talk a little
 

47
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,069
that was exciting. Let's talk a little
bit about kotish. Um so kodish is I

48
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
bit about kotish. Um so kodish is I
 

49
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,110
bit about kotish. Um so kodish is I
think like this really key technique for

50
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
think like this really key technique for
 

51
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,750
think like this really key technique for
some things like you you couldn't have

52
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
some things like you you couldn't have
 

53
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,350
some things like you you couldn't have
this kind of system without the

54
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
this kind of system without the
 

55
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,149
this kind of system without the
existence of kodish kodash culturally

56
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
existence of kodish kodash culturally
 

57
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,070
existence of kodish kodash culturally
exists in a whole lot of places you can

58
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
exists in a whole lot of places you can
 

59
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,590
exists in a whole lot of places you can
see it in old European manuscripts you

60
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
see it in old European manuscripts you
 

61
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,950
see it in old European manuscripts you
can see it in Chinese manuscripts you

62
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
can see it in Chinese manuscripts you
 

63
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,190
can see it in Chinese manuscripts you
can see it in all kinds of places it is

64
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
can see it in all kinds of places it is
 

65
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,030
can see it in all kinds of places it is
a key technique however kind of I think

66
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
a key technique however kind of I think
 

67
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,710
a key technique however kind of I think
it's not as useful for the new ideas of

68
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
it's not as useful for the new ideas of
 

69
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,910
it's not as useful for the new ideas of
kodaiish so for example in the kilowaza.

70
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
kodaiish so for example in the kilowaza.
 

71
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,350
kodaiish so for example in the kilowaza.
I think it didn't get stuck in there

72
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
I think it didn't get stuck in there
 

73
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,749
I think it didn't get stuck in there
because it's not as important for the

74
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
because it's not as important for the
 

75
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,390
because it's not as important for the
stuff we do. So, it just kind of is

76
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
stuff we do. So, it just kind of is
 

77
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,390
stuff we do. So, it just kind of is
floating around. Okay. So, let's talk

78
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
floating around. Okay. So, let's talk
 

79
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,950
floating around. Okay. So, let's talk
about these big three that used to exist

80
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
about these big three that used to exist
 

81
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,190
about these big three that used to exist
um as these three names iconically. And

82
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
um as these three names iconically. And
 

83
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,870
um as these three names iconically. And
I think this goes back to the Kobukan,

84
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
I think this goes back to the Kobukan,
 

85
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,230
I think this goes back to the Kobukan,
the old school Yoshiba dojo. So, you

86
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
the old school Yoshiba dojo. So, you
 

87
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,109
the old school Yoshiba dojo. So, you
have uh Kot Haneeri and we now call that

88
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
have uh Kot Haneeri and we now call that
 

89
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,350
have uh Kot Haneeri and we now call that
Sanio, Kot Moashi, we now call that Nio.

90
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
Sanio, Kot Moashi, we now call that Nio.
 

91
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,270
Sanio, Kot Moashi, we now call that Nio.
and Kotagish, which we still call

92
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
and Kotagish, which we still call
 

93
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,030
and Kotagish, which we still call
Kotagish. Those three cannot be

94
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040
Kotagish. Those three cannot be
 

95
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,789
Kotagish. Those three cannot be
separated from weapon grappling centric

96
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
separated from weapon grappling centric
 

97
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,950
separated from weapon grappling centric
stuff. You can't pull them out because

98
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
stuff. You can't pull them out because
 

99
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,590
stuff. You can't pull them out because
those are the ways you get knives out of

100
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
those are the ways you get knives out of
 

101
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,109
those are the ways you get knives out of
someone's hand or a sword or a spear or

102
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
someone's hand or a sword or a spear or
 

103
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:07,830
someone's hand or a sword or a spear or
whatever it is you're going to take out

104
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
whatever it is you're going to take out
 

105
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,070
whatever it is you're going to take out
of someone's hand, you have to use those

106
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
of someone's hand, you have to use those
 

107
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,430
of someone's hand, you have to use those
three. They're they're really really

108
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
three. They're they're really really
 

109
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,990
three. They're they're really really
key. Kotag, in my opinion, is the king

110
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
key. Kotag, in my opinion, is the king
 

111
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,550
key. Kotag, in my opinion, is the king
of those because most of the time Josh

112
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
of those because most of the time Josh
 

113
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,470
of those because most of the time Josh
is going to orient his elbow down. So,

114
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
is going to orient his elbow down. So,
 

115
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,150
is going to orient his elbow down. So,
he's going to be try to be elbow down.

116
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
he's going to be try to be elbow down.
 

117
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,070
he's going to be try to be elbow down.
So most of the time I'm going to be

118
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
So most of the time I'm going to be
 

119
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,390
So most of the time I'm going to be
working the wrist this way to to disarm

120
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
working the wrist this way to to disarm
 

121
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,790
working the wrist this way to to disarm
him, right? So the kotashi is the key

122
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
him, right? So the kotashi is the key
 

123
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,030
him, right? So the kotashi is the key
one. Now of course if he forces it

124
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
one. Now of course if he forces it
 

125
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,470
one. Now of course if he forces it
opposite we'll get kot moashi or kote

126
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
opposite we'll get kot moashi or kote
 

127
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,710
opposite we'll get kot moashi or kote
haneeri. So nikio or sanio depending on

128
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
haneeri. So nikio or sanio depending on
 

129
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,630
haneeri. So nikio or sanio depending on
if his elbow goes above my arm or goes

130
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
if his elbow goes above my arm or goes
 

131
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,869
if his elbow goes above my arm or goes
below my arm and he rolls his arm over

132
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
below my arm and he rolls his arm over
 

133
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,470
below my arm and he rolls his arm over
but with his arm down which is going to

134
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
but with his arm down which is going to
 

135
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,110
but with his arm down which is going to
be his normal position then I'm gonna

136
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
be his normal position then I'm gonna
 

137
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,430
be his normal position then I'm gonna
get kaggish. When I'm teaching knife

138
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
get kaggish. When I'm teaching knife
 

139
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,630
get kaggish. When I'm teaching knife
disarm stuff, I call kodish our number

140
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
disarm stuff, I call kodish our number
 

141
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,190
disarm stuff, I call kodish our number
one because it's the number one

142
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
one because it's the number one
 

143
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,550
one because it's the number one
technique when we're looking at

144
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
technique when we're looking at
 

145
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,550
technique when we're looking at
disarming. It just it is your number

146
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
disarming. It just it is your number
 

147
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,229
disarming. It just it is your number
your number one and called Niko number

148
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
your number one and called Niko number
 

149
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,670
your number one and called Niko number
two because to me it's the second best

150
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
two because to me it's the second best
 

151
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,470
two because to me it's the second best
and most likely right. So kaggos is a

152
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
and most likely right. So kaggos is a
 

153
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,630
and most likely right. So kaggos is a
king technique in lots of ways but for

154
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
king technique in lots of ways but for
 

155
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,309
king technique in lots of ways but for
iikido context as far as like I see it

156
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
iikido context as far as like I see it
 

157
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,630
iikido context as far as like I see it
and what I think kind of the evolution

158
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
and what I think kind of the evolution
 

159
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,309
and what I think kind of the evolution
of it is it's not as useful because look

160
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
of it is it's not as useful because look
 

161
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,910
of it is it's not as useful because look
so we are going to disarm people so that

162
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
so we are going to disarm people so that
 

163
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,350
so we are going to disarm people so that
is a part of it but look if Josh has me

164
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
is a part of it but look if Josh has me
 

165
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,309
is a part of it but look if Josh has me
here I can get a kodish this way it's a

166
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
here I can get a kodish this way it's a
 

167
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,070
here I can get a kodish this way it's a
little bit awkward right we we have the

168
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
little bit awkward right we we have the
 

169
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,350
little bit awkward right we we have the
technique I teach the technique I use

170
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
technique I teach the technique I use
 

171
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,750
technique I teach the technique I use
the technique so it comes up but it's a

172
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
the technique so it comes up but it's a
 

173
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,790
the technique so it comes up but it's a
little bit awkward

174
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:28,800
little bit awkward
 

175
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,430
little bit awkward
much more awkward than this. This is

176
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
much more awkward than this. This is
 

177
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,030
much more awkward than this. This is
much more natural. So, this is probably

178
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
much more natural. So, this is probably
 

179
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,309
much more natural. So, this is probably
going to be your go-to. And that's

180
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
going to be your go-to. And that's
 

181
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,789
going to be your go-to. And that's
Nikio's second second principle, right?

182
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
Nikio's second second principle, right?
 

183
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,229
Nikio's second second principle, right?
Okay. So, we can use kodish, but it's

184
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
Okay. So, we can use kodish, but it's
 

185
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,910
Okay. So, we can use kodish, but it's
probably a little more awkward in the

186
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
probably a little more awkward in the
 

187
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,910
probably a little more awkward in the
other sense. If Josh is up here, okay,

188
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
other sense. If Josh is up here, okay,
 

189
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,390
other sense. If Josh is up here, okay,
now if I circle this way, this is a

190
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
now if I circle this way, this is a
 

191
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,229
now if I circle this way, this is a
really natural way to get and Josh

192
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
really natural way to get and Josh
 

193
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,350
really natural way to get and Josh
didn't want to give it to me there, but

194
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
didn't want to give it to me there, but
 

195
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,149
didn't want to give it to me there, but
it's a really natural way to get the the

196
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
it's a really natural way to get the the
 

197
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,550
it's a really natural way to get the the
nikio, right? So the kot washing but to

198
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
nikio, right? So the kot washing but to
 

199
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,630
nikio, right? So the kot washing but to
get the kodish you have to go like this

200
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
get the kodish you have to go like this
 

201
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,949
get the kodish you have to go like this
and this and totally doable but it's

202
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
and this and totally doable but it's
 

203
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,550
and this and totally doable but it's
really not the kodagish that's working

204
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
really not the kodagish that's working
 

205
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,710
really not the kodagish that's working
as much as this elbow that's working to

206
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
as much as this elbow that's working to
 

207
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,429
as much as this elbow that's working to
to get him free right so for making

208
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
to get him free right so for making
 

209
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,670
to get him free right so for making
hodoki kodish is just not quite on the

210
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
hodoki kodish is just not quite on the
 

211
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,110
hodoki kodish is just not quite on the
same level as say a nikio is right so in

212
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
same level as say a nikio is right so in
 

213
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,190
same level as say a nikio is right so in
my opinion it's like it's just not quite

214
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
my opinion it's like it's just not quite
 

215
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,189
my opinion it's like it's just not quite
as good at that when we're talking about

216
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
as good at that when we're talking about
 

217
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,590
as good at that when we're talking about
disarming of course it's king but when

218
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
disarming of course it's king but when
 

219
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,110
disarming of course it's king but when
we're talking about not trying to

220
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
we're talking about not trying to
 

221
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,189
we're talking about not trying to
grapple I'm not really going to use it

222
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
grapple I'm not really going to use it
 

223
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,110
grapple I'm not really going to use it
that much. So a lot of the kiosa the

224
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
that much. So a lot of the kiosa the
 

225
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,430
that much. So a lot of the kiosa the
functionality is going to come more in

226
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
functionality is going to come more in
 

227
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,790
functionality is going to come more in
the situations of either hodoki or

228
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
the situations of either hodoki or
 

229
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,909
the situations of either hodoki or
doiwaza ocomi waza, right? So holding or

230
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
doiwaza ocomi waza, right? So holding or
 

231
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,590
doiwaza ocomi waza, right? So holding or
take down pinning techniques. Okay, now

232
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
take down pinning techniques. Okay, now
 

233
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,350
take down pinning techniques. Okay, now
look, Nikio can do a good job of taking

234
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
look, Nikio can do a good job of taking
 

235
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,870
look, Nikio can do a good job of taking
him down because it puts a ton of force

236
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
him down because it puts a ton of force
 

237
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,830
him down because it puts a ton of force
and he collapses down. Kotish really

238
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
and he collapses down. Kotish really
 

239
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,430
and he collapses down. Kotish really
doesn't take him down. Now as I talked

240
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
doesn't take him down. Now as I talked
 

241
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,510
doesn't take him down. Now as I talked
about in the throwing video, I can step

242
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
about in the throwing video, I can step
 

243
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,110
about in the throwing video, I can step
back here and make that work. But this

244
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
back here and make that work. But this
 

245
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,350
back here and make that work. But this
is all kind of inherently dangerous

246
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
is all kind of inherently dangerous
 

247
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,350
is all kind of inherently dangerous
because Josh can always wrap around,

248
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
because Josh can always wrap around,
 

249
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,189
because Josh can always wrap around,
right? It's really hard to avoid that

250
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
right? It's really hard to avoid that
 

251
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,870
right? It's really hard to avoid that
wraparound. I have to catch just a

252
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
wraparound. I have to catch just a
 

253
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,550
wraparound. I have to catch just a
perfect moment in time to avoid that

254
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
perfect moment in time to avoid that
 

255
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,469
perfect moment in time to avoid that
wraparound. So, it's not really that

256
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
wraparound. So, it's not really that
 

257
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,110
wraparound. So, it's not really that
good of a takedown technique. It's not a

258
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
good of a takedown technique. It's not a
 

259
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,430
good of a takedown technique. It's not a
good holding technique. So, if I had

260
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
good holding technique. So, if I had
 

261
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,830
good holding technique. So, if I had
Josh in Sancho, right? So, Koteri and

262
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
Josh in Sancho, right? So, Koteri and
 

263
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,230
Josh in Sancho, right? So, Koteri and
Josh comes to hit me, he can't because I

264
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
Josh comes to hit me, he can't because I
 

265
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,749
Josh comes to hit me, he can't because I
can control the other side. Meaning, if

266
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
can control the other side. Meaning, if
 

267
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,670
can control the other side. Meaning, if
he turns into me this way, he gets

268
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
he turns into me this way, he gets
 

269
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,590
he turns into me this way, he gets
cranked here. Nikio is the same way. I

270
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
cranked here. Nikio is the same way. I
 

271
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,029
cranked here. Nikio is the same way. I
have him here and he turns into me, he

272
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
have him here and he turns into me, he
 

273
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,150
have him here and he turns into me, he
gets cranked. Kagash I can crank him

274
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
gets cranked. Kagash I can crank him
 

275
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,909
gets cranked. Kagash I can crank him
hard but his action of turning in

276
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
hard but his action of turning in
 

277
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,310
hard but his action of turning in
doesn't hurt him at all. So it doesn't

278
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
doesn't hurt him at all. So it doesn't
 

279
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,150
doesn't hurt him at all. So it doesn't
have the kind of holding power that

280
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
have the kind of holding power that
 

281
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,430
have the kind of holding power that
Sanio or Nikio has, right? And Sanio is

282
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
Sanio or Nikio has, right? And Sanio is
 

283
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,870
Sanio or Nikio has, right? And Sanio is
really good at that holding power,

284
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
really good at that holding power,
 

285
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,150
really good at that holding power,
right? So it kind of has this in modern

286
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
right? So it kind of has this in modern
 

287
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,990
right? So it kind of has this in modern
Iikido this kind of like well it's a

288
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
Iikido this kind of like well it's a
 

289
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,469
Iikido this kind of like well it's a
great technique for one thing but it

290
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
great technique for one thing but it
 

291
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,909
great technique for one thing but it
doesn't have the power of the rest of

292
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
doesn't have the power of the rest of
 

293
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,590
doesn't have the power of the rest of
the Kyowaza, right? So to me the other

294
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
the Kyowaza, right? So to me the other
 

295
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,909
the Kyowaza, right? So to me the other
Kyoaza kind of have more use, right?

296
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
Kyoaza kind of have more use, right?
 

297
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,189
Kyoaza kind of have more use, right?
Even if you get into something like

298
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
Even if you get into something like
 

299
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,350
Even if you get into something like
Yonko, which in my opinion is kind of

300
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
Yonko, which in my opinion is kind of
 

301
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,670
Yonko, which in my opinion is kind of
underplayed in Iikido, I can use Yonko

302
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
underplayed in Iikido, I can use Yonko
 

303
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,950
underplayed in Iikido, I can use Yonko
every time I grab him, right? So if I

304
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
every time I grab him, right? So if I
 

305
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,029
every time I grab him, right? So if I
grabbed him katate, I'm yonoing him,

306
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
grabbed him katate, I'm yonoing him,
 

307
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,629
grabbed him katate, I'm yonoing him,
right? I can grab him yak. I can grab

308
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
right? I can grab him yak. I can grab
 

309
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,909
right? I can grab him yak. I can grab
him any way I grab him. If I grab him

310
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919
him any way I grab him. If I grab him
 

311
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,350
him any way I grab him. If I grab him
with my hands, I can use the technique

312
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
with my hands, I can use the technique
 

313
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,510
with my hands, I can use the technique
of uh Yonkyo. Now Gokyo is like, well,

314
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
of uh Yonkyo. Now Gokyo is like, well,
 

315
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,350
of uh Yonkyo. Now Gokyo is like, well,
is Gokyo better than um Kagash? I bet

316
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
is Gokyo better than um Kagash? I bet
 

317
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,029
is Gokyo better than um Kagash? I bet
they're pretty close to equal when

318
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
they're pretty close to equal when
 

319
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,110
they're pretty close to equal when
you're talking about just disarming and

320
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
you're talking about just disarming and
 

321
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,909
you're talking about just disarming and
how often that's going to come up. So,

322
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
how often that's going to come up. So,
 

323
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,510
how often that's going to come up. So,
it doesn't really merit being part of

324
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
it doesn't really merit being part of
 

325
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,309
it doesn't really merit being part of
the killwaza in a lot of ways, but it

326
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
the killwaza in a lot of ways, but it
 

327
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,550
the killwaza in a lot of ways, but it
also can't be removed from the system

328
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
also can't be removed from the system
 

329
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,469
also can't be removed from the system
because it's so powerful really at one

330
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
because it's so powerful really at one
 

331
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,070
because it's so powerful really at one
thing, which is disarming. It's really,

332
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
thing, which is disarming. It's really,
 

333
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,150
thing, which is disarming. It's really,
really good for disarming. So, it gets

334
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
really good for disarming. So, it gets
 

335
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,909
really good for disarming. So, it gets
caught in this kind of crummy position.

336
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
caught in this kind of crummy position.
 

337
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,309
caught in this kind of crummy position.
And I also think the highfall from it is

338
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
And I also think the highfall from it is
 

339
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,510
And I also think the highfall from it is
so nice to take that we like to like

340
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
so nice to take that we like to like
 

341
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,270
so nice to take that we like to like
capitalize upon. Look, I can throw a guy

342
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
capitalize upon. Look, I can throw a guy
 

343
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,110
capitalize upon. Look, I can throw a guy
with just his little wrist. And it's so

344
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
with just his little wrist. And it's so
 

345
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,189
with just his little wrist. And it's so
obvious with that. That's not as obvious

346
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
obvious with that. That's not as obvious
 

347
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,670
obvious with that. That's not as obvious
with Nikio. It's not as obvious with

348
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
with Nikio. It's not as obvious with
 

349
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,390
with Nikio. It's not as obvious with
Sankio, right? So, so you can see how

350
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
Sankio, right? So, so you can see how
 

351
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,469
Sankio, right? So, so you can see how
Kotagashi makes it look like you're

352
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
Kotagashi makes it look like you're
 

353
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,309
Kotagashi makes it look like you're
really cool and powerful. So, then it

354
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
really cool and powerful. So, then it
 

355
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,070
really cool and powerful. So, then it
kind of becomes iconic for Iikido and

356
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
kind of becomes iconic for Iikido and
 

357
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,909
kind of becomes iconic for Iikido and
then we're kind of stuck with it. And

358
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
then we're kind of stuck with it. And
 

359
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,270
then we're kind of stuck with it. And
I'm not saying it should be totally

360
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
I'm not saying it should be totally
 

361
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,710
I'm not saying it should be totally
removed from the system, but it's not

362
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
removed from the system, but it's not
 

363
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,430
removed from the system, but it's not
quite as good as the Kyoaza. Now, if I

364
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
quite as good as the Kyoaza. Now, if I
 

365
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,749
quite as good as the Kyoaza. Now, if I
wanted to really revise things and and I

366
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
wanted to really revise things and and I
 

367
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,749
wanted to really revise things and and I
don't want to do this, then I would just

368
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
don't want to do this, then I would just
 

369
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,270
don't want to do this, then I would just
make it the seventh or eighth kilowaza,

370
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
make it the seventh or eighth kilowaza,
 

371
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,230
make it the seventh or eighth kilowaza,
right? Like that's what I would just

372
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
right? Like that's what I would just
 

373
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,749
right? Like that's what I would just
tack it on to the end and say, "Oh, it's

374
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
tack it on to the end and say, "Oh, it's
 

375
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,749
tack it on to the end and say, "Oh, it's
a kill wasn't now." But it is this

376
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
a kill wasn't now." But it is this
 

377
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,990
a kill wasn't now." But it is this
iconic thing. And so you I I I don't

378
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
iconic thing. And so you I I I don't
 

379
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,189
iconic thing. And so you I I I don't
want to do that. So it's kind of stuck

380
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
want to do that. So it's kind of stuck
 

381
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,270
want to do that. So it's kind of stuck
in this limbo land. Um and that's why

382
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
in this limbo land. Um and that's why
 

383
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,790
in this limbo land. Um and that's why
it's stuck in this limbo land in my

384
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
it's stuck in this limbo land in my
 

385
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,029
it's stuck in this limbo land in my
opinion. Um I I hope that was useful to

386
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
opinion. Um I I hope that was useful to
 

387
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,029
opinion. Um I I hope that was useful to
you. I don't know. Was it useful? Yeah.

388
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
you. I don't know. Was it useful? Yeah.
 

389
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,390
you. I don't know. Was it useful? Yeah.
All right. Good. Yeah. Josh agrees. All

390
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
All right. Good. Yeah. Josh agrees. All
 

391
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,909
All right. Good. Yeah. Josh agrees. All
right. So I'm Christopher. This is

392
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
right. So I'm Christopher. This is
 

393
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,749
right. So I'm Christopher. This is
Joshua Te. My salon McDaniel's behind

Joshua Te. My salon McDaniel's behind
that camera right there and we'll see

396
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
that camera right there and we'll see
 

397
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,000
that camera right there and we'll see
you in a future video.
