1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,550

so i want to re-address something i

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:04,560
so i want to re-address something i
 

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,670
so i want to re-address something i
demonstrated with you okay

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
demonstrated with you okay
 

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,470
demonstrated with you okay
so

6
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
so
 

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,629
so
uh we were doing the drill where you're

8
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
uh we were doing the drill where you're
 

9
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,350
uh we were doing the drill where you're
trying to touch my chest right boom

10
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360

 

11
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,150

and i'm going and i am

12
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,160
and i'm going and i am
 

13
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,990
and i'm going and i am
working a mixture of ikea ankles

14
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
working a mixture of ikea ankles
 

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,710
working a mixture of ikea ankles
to get that

16
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:24,720
to get that
 

17
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,349
to get that
and you can see there that adhesion came

18
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
and you can see there that adhesion came
 

19
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,950
and you can see there that adhesion came
in okay

20
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
in okay
 

21
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,310
in okay
and then we said

22
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320
and then we said
 

23
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,830
and then we said
that

24
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
that
 

25
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,549
that
you create that adhesion and sometimes

26
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
you create that adhesion and sometimes
 

27
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,389
you create that adhesion and sometimes
you lose the adhesion

28
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
you lose the adhesion
 

29
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,950
you lose the adhesion
because sometimes they try to pull off

30
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
because sometimes they try to pull off
 

31
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,270
because sometimes they try to pull off
of that adhesion so

32
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
of that adhesion so
 

33
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,830
of that adhesion so
you you can uh feel it right there okay

34
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
you you can uh feel it right there okay
 

35
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,590
you you can uh feel it right there okay
now just pull your hand back please say

36
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
now just pull your hand back please say
 

37
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,590
now just pull your hand back please say
it's off okay

38
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
it's off okay
 

39
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,350
it's off okay
um

40
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
um
 

41
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,630
um
but

42
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
but
 

43
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,069
but
let's go slowly i got two options that i

44
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
let's go slowly i got two options that i
 

45
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,189
let's go slowly i got two options that i
can do

46
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
can do
 

47
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,430
can do
even though it's on people will counter

48
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
even though it's on people will counter
 

49
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,910
even though it's on people will counter
you they want to fight you so they can

50
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
you they want to fight you so they can
 

51
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,469
you they want to fight you so they can
feel your your control so they just try

52
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
feel your your control so they just try
 

53
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,310
feel your your control so they just try
to pull off okay

54
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
to pull off okay
 

55
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,950
to pull off okay
one option was that you just follow the

56
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
one option was that you just follow the
 

57
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,070
one option was that you just follow the
hand in and you stay on it but i'm the

58
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
hand in and you stay on it but i'm the
 

59
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,870
hand in and you stay on it but i'm the
one following it so following is the

60
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
one following it so following is the
 

61
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,550
one following it so following is the
first one okay

62
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
first one okay
 

63
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,230
first one okay
and the second one is important so as

64
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
and the second one is important so as
 

65
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,550
and the second one is important so as
she's bringing this hand in

66
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
she's bringing this hand in
 

67
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,270
she's bringing this hand in
there's still another way of getting the

68
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
there's still another way of getting the
 

69
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,270
there's still another way of getting the
adhesion this way

70
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
adhesion this way
 

71
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,760
adhesion this way
do you see

72
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:27,770
do you see
 

73
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,749
do you see
[Music]

74
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
[Music]
 

75
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,550
[Music]
so

76
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
so
 

77
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,429
so
uh

78
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
uh
 

79
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,830
uh
let me just get the first one so let me

80
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
let me just get the first one so let me
 

81
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,590
let me just get the first one so let me
put you in it first you just stay where

82
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
put you in it first you just stay where
 

83
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,390
put you in it first you just stay where
you are okay

84
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400
you are okay
 

85
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,950
you are okay
there it is you see right there and

86
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
there it is you see right there and
 

87
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,710
there it is you see right there and
you're gonna pull it back and i just

88
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
you're gonna pull it back and i just
 

89
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,710
you're gonna pull it back and i just
follow it in do you see

90
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
follow it in do you see
 

91
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,030
follow it in do you see
and let me get it again there it is

92
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
and let me get it again there it is
 

93
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,749
and let me get it again there it is
right there and you go back and i take

94
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
right there and you go back and i take
 

95
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,830
right there and you go back and i take
it this way

96
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
it this way
 

97
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,710
it this way
do you understand okay

98
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
do you understand okay
 

99
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,789
do you understand okay
um

100
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
um
 

101
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,270
um
you're doing that in this technique

102
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
you're doing that in this technique
 

103
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,590
you're doing that in this technique
or you're trying to

104
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
or you're trying to
 

105
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,709
or you're trying to
okay

106
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
okay
 

107
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,230
okay
um so

108
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
um so
 

109
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,749
um so
we're here and a lot of you lose the arm

110
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
we're here and a lot of you lose the arm
 

111
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,949
we're here and a lot of you lose the arm
all right

112
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
all right
 

113
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,190
all right
it's the same thing there's the adhesion

114
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
it's the same thing there's the adhesion
 

115
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,309
it's the same thing there's the adhesion
do you see

116
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
do you see
 

117
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,430
do you see
and she wants to bring her arm down

118
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
and she wants to bring her arm down
 

119
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,589
and she wants to bring her arm down
let's just go dead

120
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
let's just go dead
 

121
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,990
let's just go dead
just go dead there you go do you see

122
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
just go dead there you go do you see
 

123
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,309
just go dead there you go do you see
that oh that arm is going from here

124
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
that oh that arm is going from here
 

125
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,350
that oh that arm is going from here
to

126
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
to
 

127
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,790
to
there i have a couple options i can

128
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
there i have a couple options i can
 

129
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,390
there i have a couple options i can
follow it in

130
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
follow it in
 

131
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,949
follow it in
and i pick this up over here

132
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
and i pick this up over here
 

133
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,910
and i pick this up over here
or

134
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
or
 

135
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,630
or
as she's moving

136
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
as she's moving
 

137
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,830
as she's moving
as that arm's moving i am extending it

138
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
as that arm's moving i am extending it
 

139
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,869
as that arm's moving i am extending it
out with another adhesion you see

140
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
out with another adhesion you see
 

141
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,589
out with another adhesion you see
uh the other thing you can do in this

142
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,599
uh the other thing you can do in this
 

143
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,750
uh the other thing you can do in this
technique that is a little harder to do

144
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
technique that is a little harder to do
 

145
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,830
technique that is a little harder to do
in the other drill

146
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
in the other drill
 

147
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,710
in the other drill
is

148
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
is
 

149
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,229
is
i will actually use the other hand

150
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
i will actually use the other hand
 

151
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,869
i will actually use the other hand
to move her other arm into the adhesion

152
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
to move her other arm into the adhesion
 

153
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,470
to move her other arm into the adhesion
okay so

154
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
okay so
 

155
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,190
okay so
uh her arm is going dead you see and

156
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
uh her arm is going dead you see and
 

157
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,229
uh her arm is going dead you see and
i'll use this to move her

158
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
i'll use this to move her
 

159
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,790
i'll use this to move her
into the adhesion of the other hand you

160
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
into the adhesion of the other hand you
 

161
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,550
into the adhesion of the other hand you
see that and

162
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
see that and
 

163
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,830
see that and
that makes this kind of

164
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
that makes this kind of
 

165
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,830
that makes this kind of
stuff totally wrong i don't really have

166
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
stuff totally wrong i don't really have
 

167
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,630
stuff totally wrong i don't really have
the adhesion okay

168
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
the adhesion okay
 

169
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,830
the adhesion okay
so look for that and don't give up

170
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
so look for that and don't give up
 

171
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,750
so look for that and don't give up
okay don't give up

172
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
okay don't give up
 

173
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,830
okay don't give up
keep working it

174
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840

00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
i'm all the way back here
 

209
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,910
i'm all the way back here
this

210
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
this
 

211
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,070
this
you think is the back but it's not the

212
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
you think is the back but it's not the
 

213
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,390
you think is the back but it's not the
back of the rotating cross the back of

214
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
back of the rotating cross the back of
 

215
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,310
back of the rotating cross the back of
the rotating cross

216
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
the rotating cross
 

217
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,550
the rotating cross
is going to be on the other side of her

218
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
is going to be on the other side of her
 

219
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,909
is going to be on the other side of her
spine not on her spine here because as

220
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
spine not on her spine here because as
 

221
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,230
spine not on her spine here because as
soon as you start to rotate you see that

222
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
soon as you start to rotate you see that
 

223
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,469
soon as you start to rotate you see that
we're no longer in alignment

224
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
we're no longer in alignment
 

225
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,510
we're no longer in alignment
okay we're like two circles here and the

226
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
okay we're like two circles here and the
 

227
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,070
okay we're like two circles here and the
only way i can do it is what you guys

228
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
only way i can do it is what you guys
 

229
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,110
only way i can do it is what you guys
are doing

230
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
are doing
 

231
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,270
are doing
pull her into it

232
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
pull her into it
 

233
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,950
pull her into it
and then when i take her down i'm

234
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
and then when i take her down i'm
 

235
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,390
and then when i take her down i'm
actually in front of her okay

so
 

239
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,110
so
boom get all the way on the other side

240
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
boom get all the way on the other side
 

241
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,550
boom get all the way on the other side
of her and rotate with her you see

242
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
of her and rotate with her you see
 

243
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,670
of her and rotate with her you see
you're gonna rotate with her

244
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680

 

245
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,710

all the way
 

249
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:08,629
all the way
other side

250
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639

 

251
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,150

okay let's try to do

252
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160

 

253
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,990

there is a common thing i'm going to

254
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
there is a common thing i'm going to
 

255
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,310
there is a common thing i'm going to
show you what where what is going to

256
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
show you what where what is going to
 

257
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,070
show you what where what is going to
happen so i'm going to do it one way

258
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
happen so i'm going to do it one way
 

259
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,950
happen so i'm going to do it one way
okay

260
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
okay
 

261
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,790
okay
so i go here you see that foot

262
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
so i go here you see that foot
 

263
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,189
so i go here you see that foot
i made that foot a pivot point because

264
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
i made that foot a pivot point because
 

265
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,510
i made that foot a pivot point because
i'm not controlling his center you see

266
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
i'm not controlling his center you see
 

267
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,310
i'm not controlling his center you see
that

268
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
that
 

269
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,550
that
and now i'm just tilting him first of

270
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
and now i'm just tilting him first of
 

271
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,390
and now i'm just tilting him first of
all people in real life will not tilt

272
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
all people in real life will not tilt
 

273
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,110
all people in real life will not tilt
for you only aikido gymnast will do that

274

uh so
you weren't in the center and that foot

280
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
you weren't in the center and that foot
 

281
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,950

nope you see okay when i come around
 

285
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,830
nope you see okay when i come around
here i don't start turning here that

286
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
here i don't start turning here that
 

287
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,710
here i don't start turning here that
foot is going to move again

288
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
foot is going to move again
 

289
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,110

don't let it do what he wants to do okay
 

293
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,350
don't let it do what he wants to do okay
you're in his center everybody every uk

294
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
you're in his center everybody every uk
 

295
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,270
you're in his center everybody every uk
wants to do that because every new kid

296
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
wants to do that because every new kid
 

297
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,510

is going to be a
 

299
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,670
is going to be a
self-centered that's why we're here

300
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
self-centered that's why we're here
 

301
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,510
self-centered that's why we're here
right so he's all like this is good

302
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
right so he's all like this is good
 

303
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,309
right so he's all like this is good
enough

304
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
enough
 

305
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,230
enough
that's your opportunity to go no it's

306
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
that's your opportunity to go no it's
 

307
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,230
that's your opportunity to go no it's
not good enough okay so that foot

308
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
not good enough okay so that foot
 

309
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,430
not good enough okay so that foot
keeps moving you see it's moving where i

310
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
keeps moving you see it's moving where i
 

311
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,670
keeps moving you see it's moving where i
need it to go

312
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
need it to go
 

313
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,590
need it to go
then the same thing

314
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
then the same thing
 

315
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,270
then the same thing
is once they

316
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
is once they
 

317
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,870
is once they
there's the same rookie that wants to

318
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
there's the same rookie that wants to
 

319
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,430
there's the same rookie that wants to
tilt here once they figure out where

320
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
tilt here once they figure out where
 

321
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,590

they think you want them to fall they go
 

323
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,830
they think you want them to fall they go
ahead and just take a dive and that's

324
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
ahead and just take a dive and that's
 

325
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,550
ahead and just take a dive and that's
another opportunity

326
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560

 

327
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,510

you see he wanted to go belly down but i

328
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
you see he wanted to go belly down but i
 

329
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,710
you see he wanted to go belly down but i
made him go sideways okay

330
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
made him go sideways okay
 

331
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,029
made him go sideways okay
so control

332
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
so control
 

333
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,629
so control

control
sideways

338
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
sideways
 

339
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,469
sideways
because he's still descending and i'm

340
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
because he's still descending and i'm
 

341
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,629
because he's still descending and i'm
just making these micro adjustments as

just making these micro adjustments as
 

343
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,350

spines with her spine i'm bringing her
forward into the technique

374
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
forward into the technique
 

375
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,189
forward into the technique
uh

376
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
