00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:06,159
Don't shuffle in. Don't bring that back
 

523
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:14,549
Don't shuffle in. Don't bring that back
foot with you.

524
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559

 

525
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:25,350

That's it. But we got heel weight.

526
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:25,360

 

527
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,029

Use your shoulder.

528
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039

 

529
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,590

Good.

Good. Good. Good.
Watch how much you're leaning forward

534
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
Watch how much you're leaning forward
 

535
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,310
Watch how much you're leaning forward
cuz it has to be mid foot back.

536
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:42,320

 

537
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,909

That's it.

538
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919

 

539
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:53,029

Watch the back foot.

540
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:53,039

 

541
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,950

Don't Don't bump. Don't bump. Keep keep.

Don't Don't bump. Don't bump. Keep keep.
 

543
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,789
Don't Don't bump. Don't bump. Keep keep.
So if I if I'm lying on my weight on the

544
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:00,799
So if I if I'm lying on my weight on the
 

545
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,750
So if I if I'm lying on my weight on the
back foot and I do that, then some of my

546
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:03,760
back foot and I do that, then some of my
 

547
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,590
back foot and I do that, then some of my
weight's over here. You see that? So

548
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:05,600
weight's over here. You see that? So
 

549
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,390
weight's over here. You see that? So
that's why we we don't bump. I know you

550
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:08,400
that's why we we don't bump. I know you
 

551
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,110
that's why we we don't bump. I know you
want to bump, but we don't bump. You

552
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,120
want to bump, but we don't bump. You
 

553
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,950
want to bump, but we don't bump. You
don't want to go here like this.

554
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:14,960
don't want to go here like this.
 

555
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,269
don't want to go here like this.
Okay. You're just you're just moving

through.
Just moving through.

560
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:38,960

 

561
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:48,070

Yes. Ground the back foot.

562
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,080

 

563
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,230

Good. Ground the back foot. Your weight.

567
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,350

You went too far around the back.

568
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:16,360
You went too far around the back.
 

569
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,909
You went too far around the back.

Careful. You want to do

574
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:45,600

 

575
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,909

You got to do it with your foot.

576
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:47,919
You got to do it with your foot.
 

577
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,350
You got to do it with your foot.
If you can't put your foot there and

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,360
If you can't put your foot there and
 

579
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,269
If you can't put your foot there and
bend your hip,

580
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:51,279
bend your hip,
 

581
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,669
bend your hip,
you'll move as a unit.

582
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679
you'll move as a unit.
 

583
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:03,029
you'll move as a unit.
Watch the back foot

584
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:03,039

 

585
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:41,990

to desire.

586
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,000

 

587
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,909

your foot.

588
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:43,919
your foot.
 

589
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,149
your foot.
Put your foot there and then make

590
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:46,159
Put your foot there and then make
 

591
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,310
Put your foot there and then make
contact.

592
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,320
contact.
 

593
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,149
contact.
Okay.

594
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:50,159
Okay.
 

595
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,870
Okay.
So, I'm here there.

596
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:56,880

 

597
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,750

The yin space is behind, right? Okay.

598
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
The yin space is behind, right? Okay.
 

599
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,870
The yin space is behind, right? Okay.
So, I got to step down. This is space,

600
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:02,880
So, I got to step down. This is space,
 

601
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,149
So, I got to step down. This is space,
but I got to touch the cushion. Okay. So

602
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
but I got to touch the cushion. Okay. So
 

603
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,389
but I got to touch the cushion. Okay. So
you're going to go right behind her so

604
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:10,399
you're going to go right behind her so
 

605
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,149
you're going to go right behind her so
that this can touch. So I'm going to do

606
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:12,159
that this can touch. So I'm going to do
 

607
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,750
that this can touch. So I'm going to do
what I'm telling you not to do. You can

608
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:13,760
what I'm telling you not to do. You can
 

609
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,269
what I'm telling you not to do. You can
see it's in alignment. Okay. Now the

610
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:17,279
see it's in alignment. Okay. Now the
 

611
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,590
see it's in alignment. Okay. Now the
engine for it

612
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,600
engine for it
 

613
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,830
engine for it
isn't me moving her this way.

614
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:23,840
isn't me moving her this way.
 

615
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,950
isn't me moving her this way.
The engine is not me bumping her. The

616
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
The engine is not me bumping her. The
 

617
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,669
The engine is not me bumping her. The
engine is on the ad.

618
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:31,679
engine is on the ad.
 

619
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,350
engine is on the ad.
Okay. There's no that and my foot's not

620
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
Okay. There's no that and my foot's not
 

621
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,070
Okay. There's no that and my foot's not
there first and then I go. Okay. And I

622
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,080
there first and then I go. Okay. And I
 

623
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,990
there first and then I go. Okay. And I
don't pull them. I'll do it. You would

624
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
don't pull them. I'll do it. You would
 

625
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,669
don't pull them. I'll do it. You would
have positioned them already. That's

626
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:41,679
have positioned them already. That's
 

627
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,110
have positioned them already. That's
telling you where to step. There's no

628
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,120
telling you where to step. There's no
 

629
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,230
telling you where to step. There's no
more need to pull on them. Okay. So, in

630
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,240
more need to pull on them. Okay. So, in
 

631
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,789
more need to pull on them. Okay. So, in
this drill, maybe you get on the bridge

632
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:48,799
this drill, maybe you get on the bridge
 

633
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,950
this drill, maybe you get on the bridge
and on that line.

634
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:50,960
and on that line.
 

635
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,350
and on that line.
I'm going to go right behind that

636
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,360
I'm going to go right behind that
 

637
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,149
I'm going to go right behind that
and displace. Okay. Try it.

638
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159

 

639
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,590

Just stand with your feet together.

640
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:03,600
Just stand with your feet together.
 

641
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,590
Just stand with your feet together.
We'll simplify it even more in case

642
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:05,600
We'll simplify it even more in case
 

643
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:18,230
We'll simplify it even more in case
you're in time.

644
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,240

 

645
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,110

Now, don't expect a lot, but don't don't

646
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,120
Now, don't expect a lot, but don't don't
 

647
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,269
Now, don't expect a lot, but don't don't
be tempted to shuffle in that back foot.

648
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:25,279
be tempted to shuffle in that back foot.
 

649
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:31,669
be tempted to shuffle in that back foot.
Better

650
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:31,679

 

651
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:39,750

crap. Oh, shuffling in.

652
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:39,760

 

653
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:53,269

Double shuffle in.

654
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:53,279

 

655
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,149

That's good.

656
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:56,159
That's good.
 

657
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:09,590
That's good.
Okay.

658
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:09,600

 

659
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,110

Okay.

660
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,120

 

661
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:39,509

Two angle jump.

662
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519

 

663
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,029

Don't you don't pay attention to your

664
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,039
Don't you don't pay attention to your
 

665
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:50,870
Don't you don't pay attention to your
hip.

666
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:50,880

 

667
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,310

Hey, couple other

668
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,320

 

669
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,990

there

670
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,000
there
 

671
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,110
there
you have to just as in the technique

672
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,120
you have to just as in the technique
 

673
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,509
you have to just as in the technique
this foot is measured for the task and

674
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:05,519
this foot is measured for the task and
 

675
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,029
this foot is measured for the task and
my natural length of stance.

676
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:09,039
my natural length of stance.
 

677
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,549
my natural length of stance.
So too is the angle of attack.

678
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:12,559
So too is the angle of attack.
 

679
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,549
So too is the angle of attack.
So if I step this foot out that way and

680
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:16,559
So if I step this foot out that way and
 

681
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,509
So if I step this foot out that way and
this foot goes in,

682
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:19,519
this foot goes in,
 

683
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,389
this foot goes in,
I'm heel weight. Okay. So to demonstrate

684
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:22,399
I'm heel weight. Okay. So to demonstrate
 

685
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,590
I'm heel weight. Okay. So to demonstrate
this, this is why I say between your two

686
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:25,600
this, this is why I say between your two
 

687
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,350
this, this is why I say between your two
feet,

688
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
feet,
 

689
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,350
feet,
the maximum that they can go is 90° to

690
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:31,360
the maximum that they can go is 90° to
 

691
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,190
the maximum that they can go is 90° to
each other.

692
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,200
each other.
 

693
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,990
each other.
If you pay attention to me,

694
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,000
If you pay attention to me,
 

695
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,549
If you pay attention to me,
the front foot is turned this way and

696
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:38,559
the front foot is turned this way and
 

697
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,509
the front foot is turned this way and
the back foot is turned this way. Okay,

698
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:41,519
the back foot is turned this way. Okay,
 

699
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,350
the back foot is turned this way. Okay,
does that make sense? Okay, so to

700
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,360
does that make sense? Okay, so to
 

701
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,789
does that make sense? Okay, so to
demonstrate how our weight will shift

702
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:46,799
demonstrate how our weight will shift
 

703
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,870
demonstrate how our weight will shift
as our toes are pointed away from each

704
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:48,880
as our toes are pointed away from each
 

705
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,950
as our toes are pointed away from each
other,

706
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:52,960

 

707
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,870

you'll just stand like this

708
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:56,880
you'll just stand like this
 

709
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,590
you'll just stand like this
and point your toes even more.

710
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:03,600

 

711
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,470

Okay, just to feel that. And if you can

712
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:08,480
Okay, just to feel that. And if you can
 

713
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,870
Okay, just to feel that. And if you can
after you get pushed, I want you to turn

714
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:10,880
after you get pushed, I want you to turn
 

715
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,669
after you get pushed, I want you to turn
your feet out and then let release. Let

716
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:13,679
your feet out and then let release. Let
 

717
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,669
your feet out and then let release. Let
all tension go. And on your own, you

718
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
all tension go. And on your own, you
 

719
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,110
all tension go. And on your own, you
should have felt it. But the reason

720
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,120
should have felt it. But the reason
 

721
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,590
should have felt it. But the reason
we're staying upright when my feet are

722
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:19,600
we're staying upright when my feet are
 

723
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,350
we're staying upright when my feet are
away is why tension is holding you in

724
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360
away is why tension is holding you in
 

725
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,669
away is why tension is holding you in
place. But if you take your feet out and

726
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:25,679
place. But if you take your feet out and
 

727
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,669
place. But if you take your feet out and
you release, you're going to immediately

728
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:27,679
you release, you're going to immediately
 

729
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,630
you release, you're going to immediately
fall backwards. Okay? So, two discovery

730
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,640
fall backwards. Okay? So, two discovery
 

731
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,750
fall backwards. Okay? So, two discovery
learnings. I'll let you kind of resist

732
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:33,760
learnings. I'll let you kind of resist
 

733
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,070
learnings. I'll let you kind of resist
so you feel the tension in your body to

734
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,080
so you feel the tension in your body to
 

735
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,830
so you feel the tension in your body to
hold the position. And we'll just go

736
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:39,840
hold the position. And we'll just go
 

737
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,470
hold the position. And we'll just go
cushion. Okay. Now, you're going to

738
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:42,480
cushion. Okay. Now, you're going to
 

739
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,990
cushion. Okay. Now, you're going to
release.

740
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,000
release.
 

741
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,470
release.
And I don't care who you are. It's just

742
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:46,480
And I don't care who you are. It's just
 

743
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,190
And I don't care who you are. It's just
physics. It's just architecture.

744
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,200
physics. It's just architecture.
 

745
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,190
physics. It's just architecture.
If you're able to stay standing and

746
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,200
If you're able to stay standing and
 

747
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,110
If you're able to stay standing and
release, you didn't release. You have

748
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,120
release, you didn't release. You have
 

749
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,909
release, you didn't release. You have
that tension in you. Okay? See if you

750
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:55,919
that tension in you. Okay? See if you
 

751
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,750
that tension in you. Okay? See if you
can feel it. You might not be able to

752
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:57,760
can feel it. You might not be able to
 

753
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,830
can feel it. You might not be able to
because you still have it unconscious

754
00:33:59,830 --> 00:33:59,840
because you still have it unconscious
 

755
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:07,509
because you still have it unconscious
tension. Feel

756
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:07,519

 

757
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,710

your urge to flex

758
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:10,720
your urge to flex
 

759
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:41,829
your urge to flex
and then try and release on your own.

760
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:41,839

 

761
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,030

Okay. So, for this reason,

762
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,040
Okay. So, for this reason,
 

763
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,389
Okay. So, for this reason,
uh, as you're going and you're trying

764
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:48,399
uh, as you're going and you're trying
 

765
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,750
uh, as you're going and you're trying
this drill,

766
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:51,760

 

767
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,909

his mass is now amplifying how much

768
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:55,919
his mass is now amplifying how much
 

769
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,510
his mass is now amplifying how much
weight on my face. That's what makes me

770
00:34:59,510 --> 00:34:59,520
weight on my face. That's what makes me
 

771
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,150
weight on my face. That's what makes me
leak energy out the back of my heels.

772
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,160
leak energy out the back of my heels.
 

773
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,310
leak energy out the back of my heels.
Okay? So, I can't do that.

774
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:06,320
Okay? So, I can't do that.
 

775
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,750
Okay? So, I can't do that.
You can see my feet are here. You could

776
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:09,760
You can see my feet are here. You could
 

777
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,990
You can see my feet are here. You could
have done that. I tend not to do that.

778
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,000
have done that. I tend not to do that.
 

779
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,030
have done that. I tend not to do that.
Okay? So,

780
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,040
Okay? So,
 

781
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,510
Okay? So,
be cognizant. At least when I tell you

782
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:17,520
be cognizant. At least when I tell you
 

783
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,870
be cognizant. At least when I tell you
you're heel weighted, your feet are

784
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:18,880
you're heel weighted, your feet are
 

785
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,790
you're heel weighted, your feet are
pointing away from each other. Okay? I

786
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:20,800
pointing away from each other. Okay? I
 

787
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,990
pointing away from each other. Okay? I
tell you, your feet are pointed away

788
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,000
tell you, your feet are pointed away
 

789
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,069
tell you, your feet are pointed away
from each other, your heel weight. But

790
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:24,079
from each other, your heel weight. But
 

791
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,349
from each other, your heel weight. But
play with it. Turn that front foot in

792
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:27,359
play with it. Turn that front foot in
 

793
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,190
play with it. Turn that front foot in
more. Make sure that this doesn't open

794
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,200
more. Make sure that this doesn't open
 

795
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,109
more. Make sure that this doesn't open
on you.

796
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:33,119
on you.
 

797
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,670
on you.
The reason why it opens is because when

798
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:35,680
The reason why it opens is because when
 

799
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,069
The reason why it opens is because when
you drag it

800
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
you drag it
 

801
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,470
you drag it
cuz you moved it, it now opens on you.

802
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
cuz you moved it, it now opens on you.
 

803
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,230
cuz you moved it, it now opens on you.
And now my feet are pointing away from

804
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:44,240
And now my feet are pointing away from
 

805
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,150
And now my feet are pointing away from
the angle that you need for the attack

806
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,160
the angle that you need for the attack
 

807
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,950
the angle that you need for the attack
here. Okay.

808
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:50,960
here. Okay.
 

809
00:35:50,960 --> 00:36:08,710
here. Okay.
Try not to guard. There you go.

810
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:08,720

 

811
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,030

Yep.

812
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,040
Yep.
 

813
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,190
Yep.
Keep your back straight. Keep your spine

814
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,200
Keep your back straight. Keep your spine
 

815
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,510
Keep your back straight. Keep your spine
extending.

816
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:17,520

 

817
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,109

Straight to me doesn't mean straight up

818
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:19,119
Straight to me doesn't mean straight up
 

819
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,630
Straight to me doesn't mean straight up
and down. It means your spine is

820
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:20,640
and down. It means your spine is
 

821
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,750
and down. It means your spine is
extending like in Zazen.

822
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:27,760

 

823
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,870

Watch it drive. Don't drag it.

824
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:34,880

 

825
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,510

Good. Shift your weight onto the front

826
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:37,520
Good. Shift your weight onto the front
 

827
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:48,630
Good. Shift your weight onto the front
foot. It's 60/40 stance.

828
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:48,640

 

829
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,430

Your foot is there first

830
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:51,440
Your foot is there first
 

831
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,470
Your foot is there first
which is not correct. Just move as a

832
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,480
which is not correct. Just move as a
 

833
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,470
which is not correct. Just move as a
unit.

834
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:56,480
unit.
 

835
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:03,270
unit.
Better up heel weight.

836
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:03,280

 

837
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:22,390

Good.

838
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,400

 

839
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,790

Your foot is

840
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:28,800

 

841
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:36,630

your foot.

842
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:36,640

 

843
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,790

That's it.

844
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:40,800

 

845
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:58,550

Your foot is going

846
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:58,560

 

847
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,109

fine tuning the contact point your

848
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:03,119
fine tuning the contact point your
 

849
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,109
fine tuning the contact point your
on your body

850
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:05,119
on your body
 

851
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,990
on your body
here. foot here on their body here.

852
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,000
here. foot here on their body here.
 

853
00:38:10,000 --> 00:39:01,589
here. foot here on their body here.
Okay, I got

854
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:01,599

 

855
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:09,109

Resist

856
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:09,119

 

857
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:19,270

the bump. Just move as a unit.

858
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:19,280

 

859
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:29,510

Good.

860
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:29,520

 

861
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,750

Foot weight. Quick weight. Not in front

862
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:31,760
Foot weight. Quick weight. Not in front
 

863
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:39,589
Foot weight. Quick weight. Not in front
of my toes, not behind my heels.

864
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:39,599

 

865
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,510

Don't shuffle the back foot or it'll

866
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:41,520
Don't shuffle the back foot or it'll
 

867
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,829
Don't shuffle the back foot or it'll
drag. It'll turn out and you'll heal

868
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
drag. It'll turn out and you'll heal
 

869
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,630
drag. It'll turn out and you'll heal
weighted.

870
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:48,640

 

871
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,270

Good.

872
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:53,280

 

873
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,750

Okay. Next detail.

874
00:39:59,750 --> 00:39:59,760

 

875
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,950

Don't use bear bears with gravity. You

876
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:02,960
Don't use bear bears with gravity. You
 

877
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,589
Don't use bear bears with gravity. You
come around here and you're up.

878
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:05,599
come around here and you're up.
 

879
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,589
come around here and you're up.
You see that

880
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:07,599
You see that
 

881
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,750
You see that
on this side.

882
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:09,760
on this side.
 

883
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,550
on this side.
So don't let your foot come up and then

884
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:12,560
So don't let your foot come up and then
 

885
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,430
So don't let your foot come up and then
do it.

886
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,440
do it.
 

887
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,270
do it.
Your your foot is sliding.

888
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:19,280
Your your foot is sliding.
 

889
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,150
Your your foot is sliding.
Foot is sliding.

890
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,160

 

891
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:31,190

But it's

892
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,200

 

893
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,270

accomplishing the same thing with the

894
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:33,280
accomplishing the same thing with the
 

895
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,790
accomplishing the same thing with the
displacement, but not by the same means.

896
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:36,800
displacement, but not by the same means.
 

897
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,630
displacement, but not by the same means.
Okay,

898
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:38,640
Okay,
 

899
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,710
Okay,
the means I want is my grounding foot

900
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:42,720
the means I want is my grounding foot
 

901
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,270
the means I want is my grounding foot
there. You might have your foot up and

902
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:45,280
there. You might have your foot up and
 

903
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,310
there. You might have your foot up and
still ground.

904
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:48,320
still ground.
 

905
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,950
still ground.
Okay. But you notice he's moving before

906
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:50,960
Okay. But you notice he's moving before
 

907
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,470
Okay. But you notice he's moving before
the foot is set. On the other one, it is

908
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:54,480
the foot is set. On the other one, it is
 

909
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,750
the foot is set. On the other one, it is
force. My mouse is forced,

910
00:40:59,750 --> 00:40:59,760

 

911
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,950

but we're moving here.

912
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:02,960
but we're moving here.
 

913
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,190
but we're moving here.
Okay.

914
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,200
Okay.
 

915
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,630
Okay.
Try to keep your foot as low as

916
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:06,640
Try to keep your foot as low as
 

917
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:23,910
Try to keep your foot as low as
possible.

918
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:23,920

 

919
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,910

Get your weight onto the front leg.

920
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:27,920
Get your weight onto the front leg.
 

921
00:41:27,920 --> 00:42:02,150
Get your weight onto the front leg.
Front leg.

922
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,160

 

923
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,109

There you go.

924
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:05,119
There you go.
 

925
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,510
There you go.
Just like my that step would be so

926
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:07,520
Just like my that step would be so
 

927
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,990
Just like my that step would be so
unnatural for me, but this short step is

928
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,000
unnatural for me, but this short step is
 

929
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:21,990
unnatural for me, but this short step is
natural for you. Okay.

930
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,000

 

931
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:31,910

Watch the hip bumping

932
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:31,920

 

933
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,309

too much angle.

934
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:38,319

 

935
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,910

You can just go there. You can just go

936
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:39,920
You can just go there. You can just go
 

937
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:53,190
You can just go there. You can just go
there.

938
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,200

 

939
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,990

Okay. So, we did um we we pointed out

940
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:58,000
Okay. So, we did um we we pointed out
 

941
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,390
Okay. So, we did um we we pointed out
that when I am going to poke you, I've

942
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:02,400
that when I am going to poke you, I've
 

943
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,750
that when I am going to poke you, I've
always poke through you through the

944
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:03,760
always poke through you through the
 

945
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,710
always poke through you through the
center. I can't poke you in front of the

946
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:06,720
center. I can't poke you in front of the
 

947
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,910
center. I can't poke you in front of the
center. There still is a range aspect.

948
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:09,920
center. There still is a range aspect.
 

949
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,150
center. There still is a range aspect.
There's still an angle of attack aspect.

950
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:12,160
There's still an angle of attack aspect.
 

951
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,109
There's still an angle of attack aspect.
So, I can't hit around the corner,

952
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:15,119
So, I can't hit around the corner,
 

953
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,750
So, I can't hit around the corner,
right? I can't aim in front. So, for

954
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:17,760
right? I can't aim in front. So, for
 

955
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,230
right? I can't aim in front. So, for
those that weren't here,

956
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:20,240
those that weren't here,
 

957
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,950
those that weren't here,
okay? And we were doing it on this

958
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:22,960
okay? And we were doing it on this
 

959
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,790
okay? And we were doing it on this
elbow. And I can't be in front of him.

960
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:26,800
elbow. And I can't be in front of him.
 

961
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,230
elbow. And I can't be in front of him.
It has to get to the center.

962
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,240

 

963
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,270

Likewise, I'm going around the center.

964
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,280
Likewise, I'm going around the center.
 

965
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,750
Likewise, I'm going around the center.
You see? So, there's an angle of attack.

966
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:37,760
You see? So, there's an angle of attack.
 

967
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,950
You see? So, there's an angle of attack.
So, when he's standing there, you have

968
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:40,960
So, when he's standing there, you have
 

969
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,710
So, when he's standing there, you have
to be careful because think about why we

970
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:44,720
to be careful because think about why we
 

971
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,670
to be careful because think about why we
did that in the first place because that

972
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:47,680
did that in the first place because that
 

973
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,030
did that in the first place because that
is where he's the lightest. He's the

974
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:51,040
is where he's the lightest. He's the
 

975
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,910
is where he's the lightest. He's the
heaviest at the center. See? So, he's

976
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:53,920
heaviest at the center. See? So, he's
 

977
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,230
heaviest at the center. See? So, he's
the lightest around the center on the

978
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:56,240
the lightest around the center on the
 

979
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,990
the lightest around the center on the
periphery. Okay? So that's where this

980
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,000
periphery. Okay? So that's where this
 

981
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,470
periphery. Okay? So that's where this
angle is coming from instead of this

982
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:02,480
angle is coming from instead of this
 

983
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,870
angle is coming from instead of this
angle is you're like

984
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:06,880
angle is you're like
 

985
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,109
angle is you're like
and but now the impact on the center is

986
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:09,119
and but now the impact on the center is
 

987
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,829
and but now the impact on the center is
less. Okay. And an exaggeration would be

988
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:11,839
less. Okay. And an exaggeration would be
 

989
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,710
less. Okay. And an exaggeration would be
this. Okay. So you got to watch that.

990
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:14,720
this. Okay. So you got to watch that.
 

991
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,470
this. Okay. So you got to watch that.
You're like I'm shave some off. You

992
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:16,480
You're like I'm shave some off. You
 

993
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,710
You're like I'm shave some off. You
missed. It's right through here.

994
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:20,720
missed. It's right through here.
 

995
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,670
missed. It's right through here.
Okay. And why can't you do that? Because

996
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:23,680
Okay. And why can't you do that? Because
 

997
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,829
Okay. And why can't you do that? Because
his young aspect is just going there. is

998
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:25,839
his young aspect is just going there. is
 

999
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,710
his young aspect is just going there. is
just making my foot heavier. Okay, try

1000
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:28,720
just making my foot heavier. Okay, try
 

1001
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:44,950
just making my foot heavier. Okay, try
it again. Don't miss the center.

1002
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,960

 

1003
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,270

Don't drag the foot.

1004
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:51,280

 

1005
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,510

Don't drag the foot. It makes your feet

1006
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:53,520
Don't drag the foot. It makes your feet
 

1007
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,670
Don't drag the foot. It makes your feet
go out.

1008
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:55,680
go out.
 

1009
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,470
go out.
The back foot. Leave it where it is.

The back foot. Leave it where it is.
Don't overiner so that it pulls that

1012
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:00,880
Don't overiner so that it pulls that
 

1013
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,030
Don't overiner so that it pulls that
back foot.

1014
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:05,040

 

1015
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,390

Better. Yes.

right foot. No. Behind your foot there.

1024
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:28,560

 

1025
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:35,030

Every once in a while

1026
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,040

 

1027
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,550

you're

1028
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:36,560
you're
 

1029
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,270
you're
you're over here and you put the foot

1030
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:39,280
you're over here and you put the foot
 

1031
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,109
you're over here and you put the foot
over there. You stay here and now you're

1032
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:43,119
over there. You stay here and now you're
 

1033
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,910
over there. You stay here and now you're
using both legs.

1034
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:45,920
using both legs.
 

1035
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:51,270
using both legs.
You don't want to do that.

1036
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:51,280

 

1037
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,870

I like this. This is what I'm driving.

1038
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:54,880
I like this. This is what I'm driving.
 

1039
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,790
I like this. This is what I'm driving.
So if he's driving at me, I'm grounding

1040
00:45:58,790 --> 00:45:58,800
So if he's driving at me, I'm grounding
 

1041
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,870
So if he's driving at me, I'm grounding
on this foot. You understand? And that

1042
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:02,880
on this foot. You understand? And that
 

1043
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,589
on this foot. You understand? And that
is what moves.

1044
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:07,599

 

1045
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,630

So as my foot moves,

1046
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:10,640
So as my foot moves,
 

1047
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,870
So as my foot moves,
my center is moving as opposed to my

1048
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:14,880
my center is moving as opposed to my
 

1049
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,870
my center is moving as opposed to my
center stay. The foot move, then my

1050
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:16,880
center stay. The foot move, then my
 

1051
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,670
center stay. The foot move, then my
center move. You see that? Okay. So

1052
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,680
center move. You see that? Okay. So
 

1053
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,670
center move. You see that? Okay. So
don't sneak that foot in there.

1054
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:21,680
don't sneak that foot in there.
 

1055
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,670
don't sneak that foot in there.
roundness this place. Okay,

1056
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:25,680
roundness this place. Okay,
 

1057
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,829
roundness this place. Okay,
that means your center has to move

1058
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:29,839
that means your center has to move
 

1059
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:34,710
that means your center has to move
moves first.

1060
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:34,720

 

1061
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:47,190

You went around

1062
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:47,200

 

1063
00:46:47,200 --> 00:47:01,030

1065
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,910

Okay. Mid foot weight. Stay midoot

1066
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:03,920
Okay. Mid foot weight. Stay midoot
 

1067
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,710
Okay. Mid foot weight. Stay midoot

1068
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:08,720

 

1069
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:16,630

Watch the gravity. All right.

1070
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:16,640

 

1071
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,349

Watch the driving.

1072
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:19,359
Watch the driving.
 

1073
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,349
Watch the driving.
If you want that extra range, just put

1074
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:21,359
If you want that extra range, just put
 

1075
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,589
If you want that extra range, just put
that foot closer. Okay. When you first

1076
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:23,599
that foot closer. Okay. When you first
 

1077
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,190
that foot closer. Okay. When you first
start.

1078
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:27,200

 

1079
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,270

Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. And watch

1080
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:29,280
Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. And watch
 

1081
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,950
Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. And watch
how your feet don't turn out from each

1082
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:30,960
how your feet don't turn out from each
 

1083
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,270
how your feet don't turn out from each
other. So, where you put that foot, if

1084
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:33,280
other. So, where you put that foot, if
 

1085
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,309
other. So, where you put that foot, if
you put it with it already out, you're

1086
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:36,319
you put it with it already out, you're
 

1087
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:37,750
you put it with it already out, you're
already going to start breaking that

1088
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:37,760
already going to start breaking that
 

1089
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,710
already going to start breaking that
rule. So, maybe just put it straight.

1090
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:40,720
rule. So, maybe just put it straight.
 

1091
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,270
rule. So, maybe just put it straight.
Put it straight and then go in. Okay.

1092
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,280
Put it straight and then go in. Okay.
 

1093
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:52,230
Put it straight and then go in. Okay.
Try it.

1094
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:52,240

 

1095
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,470

how you want to go around it. We're not

1096
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:54,480
how you want to go around it. We're not
 

1097
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,550
how you want to go around it. We're not
going around right now. Okay, we're

1098
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:56,560
going around right now. Okay, we're
 

1099
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:13,829
going around right now. Okay, we're
going through

1100
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:13,839

 

1101
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:36,950

Thank you very much.

1102
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:36,960

 

1103
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,710

Be mid-foot weight. Don't go heel

1104
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:38,720
Be mid-foot weight. Don't go heel
 

1105
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,390
Be mid-foot weight. Don't go heel
weight. Even if he falls, it doesn't

1106
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:40,400
weight. Even if he falls, it doesn't
 

1107
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:57,270
weight. Even if he falls, it doesn't
matter. You want to be mid-foot weight.

1108
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:57,280

 

1109
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,190

midfoot weight. Make sure you're midoot

1110
00:48:59,190 --> 00:48:59,200
midfoot weight. Make sure you're midoot
 

1111
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:09,430
midfoot weight. Make sure you're midoot
weight.

1112
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:09,440

 

1113
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,309

Breathe out and relax.

Breathe out and relax.
 

1115
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:35,190
Breathe out and relax.
You put a letter. You get my

1116
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,200

 

1117
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,030

Okay.

1118
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,040

 

1119
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,150

in the technique. He doesn't have his

1120
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:42,160
in the technique. He doesn't have his
 

1121
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,069
in the technique. He doesn't have his
mass here.

1122
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:44,079
mass here.
 

1123
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,630
mass here.
His mass is back here, right? And

1124
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:48,640
His mass is back here, right? And
 

1125
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,870
His mass is back here, right? And
there's a pull from the inertia on the

1126
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:50,880
there's a pull from the inertia on the
 

1127
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,030
there's a pull from the inertia on the
center. We're not going to work with the

1128
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,040
center. We're not going to work with the
 

1129
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,230
center. We're not going to work with the
inertia, but we'll take some mass off of

1130
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:56,240
inertia, but we'll take some mass off of
 

1131
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,190
inertia, but we'll take some mass off of
the legs. Got it? Not not a lot, just a

1132
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,200
the legs. Got it? Not not a lot, just a
 

1133
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,270
the legs. Got it? Not not a lot, just a
little.

1134
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:01,280
little.
 

1135
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,870
little.
And we do the same thing. But what

1136
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:02,880
And we do the same thing. But what
 

1137
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,030
And we do the same thing. But what
you're going to notice is that it got a

1138
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:05,040
you're going to notice is that it got a
 

1139
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,910
you're going to notice is that it got a
lot lighter. A lot lighter with that

1140
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:07,920
lot lighter. A lot lighter with that
 

1141
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,950
lot lighter. A lot lighter with that
little tiny tilt. Okay? If you lose your

1142
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:12,960
little tiny tilt. Okay? If you lose your
 

1143
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,150
little tiny tilt. Okay? If you lose your
balance, take the fall, but nothing's

1144
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:16,160
balance, take the fall, but nothing's
 

1145
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,309
balance, take the fall, but nothing's
really on top controlling that top part

1146
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:18,319
really on top controlling that top part
 

1147
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:26,150
really on top controlling that top part
of the lever. Okay? So, watch, please.

1148
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:26,160

 

1149
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,630

That was it. You'll see how much lighter

1150
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:28,640
That was it. You'll see how much lighter
 

1151
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,470
That was it. You'll see how much lighter
he gets.

1152
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:30,480
he gets.
 

1153
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,750
he gets.
Okay.

1154
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:31,760
Okay.
 

1155
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,710
Okay.
Um I've said many times

1156
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:34,720
Um I've said many times
 

1157
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,030
Um I've said many times
in for Nagia

1158
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:37,040
in for Nagia
 

1159
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,510
in for Nagia
that's all you need. That's it. We don't

1160
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:41,520
that's all you need. That's it. We don't
 

1161
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,109
that's all you need. That's it. We don't
need that or all the other gymnastics.

1162
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:45,119
need that or all the other gymnastics.
 

1163
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,950
need that or all the other gymnastics.
People don't do that in the street. They

1164
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:46,960
People don't do that in the street. They
 

1165
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,109
People don't do that in the street. They
don't do that. Okay. They try to stay

1166
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:49,119
don't do that. Okay. They try to stay
 

1167
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,069
don't do that. Okay. They try to stay
upright. You get that. That's all you

1168
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:52,079
upright. You get that. That's all you
 

1169
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,710
upright. You get that. That's all you
need. It's too late. Okay. So, I was

1170
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:54,720
need. It's too late. Okay. So, I was
 

1171
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,790
need. It's too late. Okay. So, I was
here and you saw all I did was that.

1172
00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:58,800
here and you saw all I did was that.
 

1173
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,670
here and you saw all I did was that.
Okay. And then notice how light that is

1174
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:01,680
Okay. And then notice how light that is
 

1175
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:23,589
Okay. And then notice how light that is
now. Okay, try it.

1176
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:23,599

 

1177
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,030

You got to keep the same

1178
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,040
You got to keep the same
 

1179
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:36,230
You got to keep the same
your back foot.

1180
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:36,240

 

1181
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:42,150

Watch your foot angle. Put back here.

1182
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:42,160

 

1183
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,349

Yep.

1184
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:47,359

 

1185
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,510

Yep. Watch out. We don't want to bounce

1186
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:49,520

01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:59,349

center has to move.

1360
01:00:59,349 --> 01:00:59,359
center has to move.
 

1361
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:04,150
center has to move.
So Kushi

1362
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:04,160

 

1363
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,870

for me like break his balance. Okay.

1364
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:06,880
for me like break his balance. Okay.
 

1365
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,829
for me like break his balance. Okay.
What what is that? What does that mean?

1366
01:01:09,829 --> 01:01:09,839
What what is that? What does that mean?
 

1367
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:12,069
What what is that? What does that mean?
It means that his line of gravity has to

1368
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:12,079
It means that his line of gravity has to
 

1369
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,870
It means that his line of gravity has to
fall outside his face.

1370
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:14,880
fall outside his face.
 

1371
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,390
fall outside his face.
The line of gravity, the top of the line

1372
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:16,400
The line of gravity, the top of the line
 

1373
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,589
The line of gravity, the top of the line
of gravity is the center of gravity.

1374
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:19,599
of gravity is the center of gravity.
 

1375
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,589
of gravity is the center of gravity.
Center of gravity is where he's the

1376
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:21,599
Center of gravity is where he's the
 

1377
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:26,390
Center of gravity is where he's the
heaviest. That's his mass. Okay.

1378
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:26,400

 

1379
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:32,950

Um

1380
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:32,960

 

1381
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,390

when the guy leans back,

1382
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:36,400
when the guy leans back,
 

1383
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,190
when the guy leans back,
all that happened in this drill is what?

1384
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:39,200
all that happened in this drill is what?
 

1385
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,950
all that happened in this drill is what?
center

1386
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:44,960

 

1387
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,430

line of gravity.

1388
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:49,440

 

1389
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,230

It moves up. It drops. It goes up.

1390
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:54,240
It moves up. It drops. It goes up.
 

1391
01:01:54,240 --> 01:02:17,109
It moves up. It drops. It goes up.
Does everyone understand that?

1392
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:17,119

 

1393
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,510

So here's a person

1394
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:21,520

 

1395
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,230

and the center of gravity on a normal

1396
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:24,240
and the center of gravity on a normal
 

1397
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,670
and the center of gravity on a normal
human being is we're taught in somewhere

1398
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:27,680
human being is we're taught in somewhere
 

1399
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,030
human being is we're taught in somewhere
around

1400
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:31,040

 

1401
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,109

understand it's not on the surface of

1402
01:02:33,109 --> 01:02:33,119
understand it's not on the surface of
 

1403
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,910
understand it's not on the surface of
your skin inside but towards the front

1404
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:35,920
your skin inside but towards the front
 

1405
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,470
your skin inside but towards the front
of the spine. Okay, so it's somewhere

1406
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:38,480
of the spine. Okay, so it's somewhere
 

1407
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,309
of the spine. Okay, so it's somewhere
around here.

1408
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:40,319
around here.
 

1409
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:43,510
around here.
The line of gravity

1410
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:43,520
The line of gravity
 

1411
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,990
The line of gravity
is always

1412
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:46,000
is always
 

1413
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,670
is always
perpendicular

1414
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:47,680
perpendicular
 

1415
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,030
perpendicular
between the center of gravity and in

1416
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:51,040
between the center of gravity and in
 

1417
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:55,510
between the center of gravity and in
this case the back. Okay, so he is

1418
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:55,520
this case the back. Okay, so he is
 

1419
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,069
this case the back. Okay, so he is
balanced right now which is why when you

1420
01:02:58,069 --> 01:02:58,079
balanced right now which is why when you
 

1421
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,950
balanced right now which is why when you
release you don't fall.

1422
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:00,960
release you don't fall.
 

1423
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,349
release you don't fall.
If you lean backwards,

1424
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:03,359
If you lean backwards,
 

1425
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:05,990
If you lean backwards,
the center of gravity is coming this

1426
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:06,000
the center of gravity is coming this
 

1427
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,150
the center of gravity is coming this
way.

1428
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:08,160
way.
 

1429
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,630
way.
Your heels about here.

1430
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:10,640
Your heels about here.
 

1431
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,150
Your heels about here.
You're just outside.

1432
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:14,160
You're just outside.
 

1433
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,549
You're just outside.
Got it? Which is why when you release

1434
01:03:16,549 --> 01:03:16,559
Got it? Which is why when you release
 

1435
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,270
Got it? Which is why when you release
tension, everything just falls to the

1436
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:19,280
tension, everything just falls to the
 

1437
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,829
tension, everything just falls to the
back. Are you with me? Okay.

1438
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:23,839
back. Are you with me? Okay.
 

1439
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,710
back. Are you with me? Okay.
As the guy

1440
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:26,720
As the guy
 

1441
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:31,510
As the guy
leans backwards,

1442
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:31,520

 

1443
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,990

that center of gravity

1444
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:34,000
that center of gravity
 

1445
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,109
that center of gravity
is going to move this way to the back

1446
01:03:39,109 --> 01:03:39,119
is going to move this way to the back
 

1447
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,349
is going to move this way to the back
and I'm sorry the line of gravity is

1448
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:41,359
and I'm sorry the line of gravity is
 

1449
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,630
and I'm sorry the line of gravity is
going to move this way which inversely

1450
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:44,640
going to move this way which inversely
 

1451
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,230
going to move this way which inversely
means that the center of gravity came up

1452
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,240
means that the center of gravity came up
 

1453
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:57,990
means that the center of gravity came up
now it's further back okay

1454
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:58,000

 

1455
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,910

then

1456
01:03:59,910 --> 01:03:59,920
then
 

1457
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,069
then
is

1458
01:04:02,069 --> 01:04:02,079
is
 

1459
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,069
is
I'm going to define it in a reverse

1460
01:04:04,069 --> 01:04:04,079
I'm going to define it in a reverse
 

1461
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:05,829
I'm going to define it in a reverse
fashion.

1462
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:05,839
fashion.
 

1463
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,950
fashion.
The line of gravity

1464
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:08,960
The line of gravity
 

1465
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,470
The line of gravity
has to be taken outside the base of

01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:19,119
If I if you bend me like I was we had
 

1471
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,230

Ta
and I said do try to push it. You've

1476
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:28,799
and I said do try to push it. You've
 

1477
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:32,470
and I said do try to push it. You've
given me a wider base. Now base support

1478
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:32,480
given me a wider base. Now base support
 

1479
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,190
given me a wider base. Now base support
is my contact with the mat and the area

1480
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:35,200
is my contact with the mat and the area
 

1481
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,870
is my contact with the mat and the area
shaded in between. One, two, three. this

the center of gravity somewhere around
 

1487
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:46,390
the center of gravity somewhere around
here deeper into a wider base that's why

1488
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:46,400
here deeper into a wider base that's why
 

1489
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,589
here deeper into a wider base that's why
you can't push okay

1490
01:04:49,589 --> 01:04:49,599
you can't push okay
 

1491
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:52,950
you can't push okay
did anyone try that experiment okay

1492
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:52,960
did anyone try that experiment okay
 

1493
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,430
did anyone try that experiment okay
usually what happens is the behavioral

1494
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:55,440
usually what happens is the behavioral
 

1495
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,470
usually what happens is the behavioral
cue goes and the person lets you go okay

1496
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:58,480
cue goes and the person lets you go okay
 

1497
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,510
cue goes and the person lets you go okay
so let's run the experiment

1498
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:01,520
so let's run the experiment
 

1499
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,029
so let's run the experiment
um

1500
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:03,039
um
 

1501
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,829
um
you're just here

1502
01:05:05,829 --> 01:05:05,839
you're just here
 

1503
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:07,670
you're just here
you're the nugget All

1504
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:07,680
you're the nugget All
 

1505
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,430
you're the nugget All
right.

1506
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
right.
 

1507
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,230
right.
There we go. And I'm there like this.

1508
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:12,240
There we go. And I'm there like this.
 

1509
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,829
There we go. And I'm there like this.
And then depending on the system,

1510
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:15,839
And then depending on the system,
 

1511
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,789
And then depending on the system,
sometimes he shuffles forward and you

1512
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:18,799
sometimes he shuffles forward and you
 

1513
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:21,109
sometimes he shuffles forward and you
take the ball.

1514
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:21,119
take the ball.
 

1515
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,270
take the ball.
Sometimes he moves forward with this

1516
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:23,280
Sometimes he moves forward with this
 

1517
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,829
Sometimes he moves forward with this
foot and you take the ball. You

1518
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:25,839
foot and you take the ball. You
 

1519
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,789
foot and you take the ball. You
understand? Okay. Um, let's do that

1520
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:28,799
understand? Okay. Um, let's do that
 

1521
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:57,190
understand? Okay. Um, let's do that
first.

1522
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:57,200

 

1523
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,589

Go ahead and take the ball. Take the

1524
01:05:59,589 --> 01:05:59,599
Go ahead and take the ball. Take the
 

1525
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:06,390
Go ahead and take the ball. Take the
ball. Let yourself go.

1526
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:06,400

 

1527
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:14,150

Let yourself

1528
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:14,160

 

1529
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:31,430

let yourself

1530
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:31,440

 

1531
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,029

Now,

1532
01:06:33,029 --> 01:06:33,039
Now,
 

1533
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:40,390
Now,
don't let yourself go.

1534
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:40,400

 

1535
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,670

Let's say he wants to step through.

1536
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:43,680
Let's say he wants to step through.
 

1537
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,270
Let's say he wants to step through.
Can

1538
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:45,280
Can
 

1539
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,950
Can
you pay attention on the step through

1540
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:46,960
you pay attention on the step through
 

1541
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,950
you pay attention on the step through
version? I always move and give him room

1542
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:50,960
version? I always move and give him room
 

1543
01:06:50,960 --> 01:07:01,190
version? I always move and give him room
and he steps. Okay.

1544
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:01,200

 

1545
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,109

Get a good pace. Bend your knees. Be

1546
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:03,119
Get a good pace. Bend your knees. Be
 

1547
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:26,950
Get a good pace. Bend your knees. Be
like a lineman on the NFL line.

1548
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:26,960

 

1549
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:34,470

Okay. Now, if you

1550
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:34,480

 

1551
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,549

Here, here you are. We're looking down

1552
01:07:36,549 --> 01:07:36,559
Here, here you are. We're looking down
 

1553
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,710
Here, here you are. We're looking down
at this from the base of support. I got

1554
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:38,720
at this from the base of support. I got
 

1555
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,109
at this from the base of support. I got
a foot. I got a foot. I have a hand.

1556
01:07:43,109 --> 01:07:43,119
a foot. I got a foot. I have a hand.
 

1557
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,270
a foot. I got a foot. I have a hand.
Somewhere in there. My line of gravity

1558
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:45,280
Somewhere in there. My line of gravity
 

1559
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,309
Somewhere in there. My line of gravity
touches the ground there. He's got to

1560
01:07:48,309 --> 01:07:48,319
touches the ground there. He's got to
 

1561
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:52,470
touches the ground there. He's got to
get all the way past that. Okay.

1562
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:52,480
get all the way past that. Okay.
 

1563
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,870
get all the way past that. Okay.
I have a lot of strength

1564
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:54,880
I have a lot of strength
 

1565
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,109
I have a lot of strength
because of the legs. They're all there.

1566
01:07:57,109 --> 01:07:57,119
because of the legs. They're all there.
 

1567
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,829
because of the legs. They're all there.
I'm perfectly balanced. Remember when we

1568
01:07:59,829 --> 01:07:59,839
I'm perfectly balanced. Remember when we
 

1569
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:01,750
I'm perfectly balanced. Remember when we
shifted the line of gravity slightly

1570
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:01,760
shifted the line of gravity slightly
 

1571
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,029
shifted the line of gravity slightly
behind the heels got really light line

1572
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:05,039
behind the heels got really light line
 

1573
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,750
behind the heels got really light line
of gravity inside. I can feel I needed

1574
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:07,760
of gravity inside. I can feel I needed
 

1575
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,910
of gravity inside. I can feel I needed
more muscle tension just to move a guy

1576
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:09,920
more muscle tension just to move a guy
 

1577
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,069
more muscle tension just to move a guy
that's standing with his feet. Now I

1578
01:08:12,069 --> 01:08:12,079
that's standing with his feet. Now I
 

1579
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:15,430
that's standing with his feet. Now I
give him a three-point stance. Okay.

1580
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:15,440
give him a three-point stance. Okay.
 

1581
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:21,269
give him a three-point stance. Okay.
So let's say he totally overpowers me.

1582
01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:21,279
So let's say he totally overpowers me.
 

1583
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:25,510
So let's say he totally overpowers me.
Would it generate a tossy turvy effect.

1584
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:25,520
Would it generate a tossy turvy effect.
 

1585
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,030
Would it generate a tossy turvy effect.
The only way it could is that he got he

1586
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:29,040
The only way it could is that he got he
 

1587
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,990
The only way it could is that he got he
gets my line of gravity way past his

1588
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:32,000
gets my line of gravity way past his
 

1589
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,149
gets my line of gravity way past his
foot. So, let's say he's strong enough

1590
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:36,159
foot. So, let's say he's strong enough
 

1591
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:40,789
foot. So, let's say he's strong enough
he can overcome that. Just hop forward.

1592
01:08:40,789 --> 01:08:40,799
he can overcome that. Just hop forward.
 

1593
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:43,910
he can overcome that. Just hop forward.
Okay, make him go to the extreme right

1594
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:43,920
Okay, make him go to the extreme right
 

1595
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,470
Okay, make him go to the extreme right
when you feel you're going to lead.

1596
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:46,480
when you feel you're going to lead.
 

1597
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:51,189
when you feel you're going to lead.
Just move forward. Okay, try it again.

1598
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:51,199

 

1599
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:52,470

Do you need to see that or you

1600
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:52,480
Do you need to see that or you
 

1601
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,950
Do you need to see that or you
understand it? Okay. Maybe go to the

1602
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:54,960
understand it? Okay. Maybe go to the
 

1603
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,789
understand it? Okay. Maybe go to the
extreme. Maybe you don't even get to do

1604
01:08:56,789 --> 01:08:56,799
extreme. Maybe you don't even get to do
 

1605
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,709
extreme. Maybe you don't even get to do
this because they can't get enough force

1606
01:08:58,709 --> 01:08:58,719
this because they can't get enough force
 

1607
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,870
this because they can't get enough force
to get you over there. Change your

1608
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:00,880
to get you over there. Change your
 

1609
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,110
to get you over there. Change your
change your your arms there for good.

1610
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:05,120
change your your arms there for good.
 

1611
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:15,269
change your your arms there for good.
There you go.

1612
01:09:15,269 --> 01:09:15,279

 

1613
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:16,950

Why? Why did you take your leg? Why

1614
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:16,960
Why? Why did you take your leg? Why
 

1615
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,910
Why? Why did you take your leg? Why
would you take your face and compromise?

1616
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:21,920
would you take your face and compromise?
 

1617
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,070
would you take your face and compromise?
kind of weird

1618
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:24,080
kind of weird
 

1619
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:48,709
kind of weird
is weird. Stop being weird.

1620
01:09:48,709 --> 01:09:48,719

 

1621
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,309

Okay. So we're here

1622
01:09:52,309 --> 01:09:52,319
Okay. So we're here
 

1623
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,870
Okay. So we're here
and I have a good base.

1624
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:56,880
and I have a good base.
 

1625
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,750
and I have a good base.
That means my spine can be stabilized.

1626
01:09:59,750 --> 01:09:59,760
That means my spine can be stabilized.
 

1627
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,430
That means my spine can be stabilized.
As my spine gets stabilized, my arms get

1628
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:03,440
As my spine gets stabilized, my arms get
 

1629
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,550
As my spine gets stabilized, my arms get
strong. That's why I want you, Rio, to

1630
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:06,560
strong. That's why I want you, Rio, to
 

1631
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,110
strong. That's why I want you, Rio, to
tighten up your spine. Okay? That's why

1632
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:09,120
tighten up your spine. Okay? That's why
 

1633
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,630
tighten up your spine. Okay? That's why
we do compound lifting. So you're going

1634
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:12,640
we do compound lifting. So you're going
 

1635
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,110
we do compound lifting. So you're going
to think, well, I'm going to I'm going

1636
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:15,120
to think, well, I'm going to I'm going
 

1637
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,510
to think, well, I'm going to I'm going
to turn. Okay? Got it? And you're like,

1638
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:17,520
to turn. Okay? Got it? And you're like,
 

1639
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,990
to turn. Okay? Got it? And you're like,
"Oh, he's he's torquing. He's doing a

1640
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:20,000
"Oh, he's he's torquing. He's doing a
 

1641
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,390
"Oh, he's he's torquing. He's doing a
shoulder lock on me." Right. So he goes,

1642
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:26,400

 

1643
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,910

"How much energy did I use to none?"

1644
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:29,920
"How much energy did I use to none?"
 

1645
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:38,310
"How much energy did I use to none?"
Okay, you got it. So try that one now.

1646
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:38,320

 

1647
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,630

We are strong when we're balanced. We're

1648
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:40,640
We are strong when we're balanced. We're
 

1649
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,630
We are strong when we're balanced. We're
weak when we're not balanced. Pull your

1650
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:42,640
weak when we're not balanced. Pull your
 

1651
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:51,830
weak when we're not balanced. Pull your
arm out.

1652
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:51,840

 

1653
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,590

like pull your arm out like you're

1654
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:53,600
like pull your arm out like you're
 

1655
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,950
like pull your arm out like you're
trying to not die. You know what I mean?

1656
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:56,960
trying to not die. You know what I mean?
 

1657
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:09,630
trying to not die. You know what I mean?
Get it back under your control.

1658
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:09,640

Hey, you got the idea? All right. So,

1664
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:21,840
Hey, you got the idea? All right. So,
 

1665
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,669
Hey, you got the idea? All right. So,
why does why why is we able to do all

1666
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:25,679
why does why why is we able to do all
 

1667
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:28,870
why does why why is we able to do all
that? Why am I not pushable? I have too

1668
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:28,880
that? Why am I not pushable? I have too
 

1669
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,110
that? Why am I not pushable? I have too
big a base of support. The line of

1670
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:31,120
big a base of support. The line of
 

1671
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,790
big a base of support. The line of
gravity has too far to go for how much

1672
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:34,800
gravity has too far to go for how much
 

1673
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,390
gravity has too far to go for how much
penetration he could actually move. So,

1674
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:38,400
penetration he could actually move. So,
 

1675
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,630
penetration he could actually move. So,
I didn't point that out, but

1676
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:42,640

 

1677
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,950

He's down. Just relax.

01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:46,960
He's down. Just relax.
 

1679
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,630
He's down. Just relax.
Okay.

01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:48,640
Okay.
 

1681
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,310
Okay.
His line of gravity has to fall. It's

1682
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:52,320
His line of gravity has to fall. It's
 

1683
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,430
His line of gravity has to fall. It's
somewhere around here. It has to go to

somewhere around here. It has to go to
here. Do you see that?

1686
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:00,320

 

1687
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:05,990

Uh, this. Watch my arms. Watch my hips.

1688
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:06,000
Uh, this. Watch my arms. Watch my hips.
 

1689
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,709
Uh, this. Watch my arms. Watch my hips.
Did I get there? You see that? You see

1690
01:12:08,709 --> 01:12:08,719
Did I get there? You see that? You see
 

1691
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:16,229
Did I get there? You see that? You see
that? So even then it's like not enough

1692
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:16,239
that? So even then it's like not enough
 

1693
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,229
that? So even then it's like not enough
to get there.

1694
01:12:18,229 --> 01:12:18,239
to get there.
 

1695
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:20,790
to get there.
He feels he's losing it. He just shifts

1696
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:20,800
He feels he's losing it. He just shifts
 

1697
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:25,189
He feels he's losing it. He just shifts
it and

1698
01:12:25,189 --> 01:12:25,199

 

1699
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:27,510

and in all that time that I'm trying to

1700
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:27,520
and in all that time that I'm trying to
 

1701
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,750
and in all that time that I'm trying to
get where I could never get. Does

1702
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:29,760
get where I could never get. Does
 

1703
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,830
get where I could never get. Does
everyone understand that I don't I don't

1704
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:31,840
everyone understand that I don't I don't
 

1705
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,350
everyone understand that I don't I don't
have the material um the architectural

1706
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:35,360
have the material um the architectural
 

1707
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,310
have the material um the architectural
design elements enough to push this part

1708
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:38,320
design elements enough to push this part
 

1709
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,390
design elements enough to push this part
past that clip.

1710
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:40,400
past that clip.
 

1711
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:46,070
past that clip.
So but in all that time he can now just

1712
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:46,080
So but in all that time he can now just
 

1713
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,950
So but in all that time he can now just
understand okay so all that has to be

1714
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:48,960
understand okay so all that has to be
 

1715
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:57,110
understand okay so all that has to be
addressed in our arts.

1716
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:57,120

 

1717
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,550

So at a minimum, kazushi means not bent

1718
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:00,560
So at a minimum, kazushi means not bent
 

1719
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,110
So at a minimum, kazushi means not bent
over,

1720
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,120
over,
 

1721
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,830
over,
not turning because you can turn and be

1722
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:05,840
not turning because you can turn and be
 

1723
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,990
not turning because you can turn and be
balanced rhythmic gymnastics. Okay? Uh

1724
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:10,000
balanced rhythmic gymnastics. Okay? Uh
 

1725
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,430
balanced rhythmic gymnastics. Okay? Uh
you could bend over and be balanced. Uh

1726
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:13,440
you could bend over and be balanced. Uh
 

1727
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,270
you could bend over and be balanced. Uh
offensive line on the NFL, you see it it

1728
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:17,280
offensive line on the NFL, you see it it
 

1729
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:21,030
offensive line on the NFL, you see it it
has to mean that the line of gravity is

1730
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:21,040
has to mean that the line of gravity is
 

1731
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,149
has to mean that the line of gravity is
now outside the base of support.

1732
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:24,159
now outside the base of support.
 

1733
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:27,750
now outside the base of support.
How far could just be a tiny bit past

1734
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:27,760
How far could just be a tiny bit past
 

1735
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,149
How far could just be a tiny bit past
the basis point. It'll work. Okay.

1736
01:13:32,149 --> 01:13:32,159
the basis point. It'll work. Okay.
 

1737
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,870
the basis point. It'll work. Okay.
To do this, the most efficient way of

1738
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:34,880
To do this, the most efficient way of
 

1739
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,390
To do this, the most efficient way of
doing it, you have a couple ways

1740
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:38,400
doing it, you have a couple ways
 

1741
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,950
doing it, you have a couple ways
you can pull the head. Okay? So, I'm

1742
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:42,960
you can pull the head. Okay? So, I'm
 

1743
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,910
you can pull the head. Okay? So, I'm
going to pull the top part of the lever

1744
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:45,920
going to pull the top part of the lever
 

1745
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,229
going to pull the top part of the lever
or push the top part of the lever. You

1746
01:13:48,229 --> 01:13:48,239
or push the top part of the lever. You
 

1747
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:51,590
or push the top part of the lever. You
understand?

1748
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:51,600

 

1749
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,030

and it will eventually get out of the

1750
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:55,040
and it will eventually get out of the
 

1751
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,189
and it will eventually get out of the
face of support. That's one way. It's

1752
01:13:57,189 --> 01:13:57,199
face of support. That's one way. It's
 

1753
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,910
face of support. That's one way. It's
totally doable. Okay? And we do do it.

1754
01:13:59,910 --> 01:13:59,920
totally doable. Okay? And we do do it.
 

1755
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,110
totally doable. Okay? And we do do it.
We do do it here. So, uh the arm drag,

1756
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:03,120
We do do it here. So, uh the arm drag,
 

1757
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,550
We do do it here. So, uh the arm drag,
for example, the arm drag, I pulled you

1758
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:06,560
for example, the arm drag, I pulled you
 

1759
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,950
for example, the arm drag, I pulled you
forward. You kept your face and I just

1760
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:08,960
forward. You kept your face and I just
 

1761
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,870
forward. You kept your face and I just
wanted you to move forward. Okay?

1762
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:10,880
wanted you to move forward. Okay?
 

1763
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,510
wanted you to move forward. Okay?
Everyone remember that technique? Okay.

1764
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:13,520
Everyone remember that technique? Okay.
 

1765
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,709
Everyone remember that technique? Okay.
the that's why I pulled on your shoulder

1766
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:16,719
the that's why I pulled on your shoulder
 

1767
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:19,750
the that's why I pulled on your shoulder
to make you move forward because you

1768
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:19,760
to make you move forward because you
 

1769
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,470
to make you move forward because you
wanted to not fall. That's what that

1770
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:22,480
wanted to not fall. That's what that
 

1771
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:28,630
wanted to not fall. That's what that
was. Okay. It's It's not a bad thing.

1772
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:28,640

 

1773
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,310

Uh, another way is

1774
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:32,320
Uh, another way is
 

1775
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:37,030
Uh, another way is
that I directly take the center

1776
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:37,040
that I directly take the center
 

1777
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:41,910
that I directly take the center
and move it out of the basis. Okay? So

1778
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:41,920
and move it out of the basis. Okay? So
 

1779
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,110
and move it out of the basis. Okay? So
as opposed to I move your head until the

1780
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:45,120
as opposed to I move your head until the
 

1781
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,189
as opposed to I move your head until the
line of gravity falls out of the base

1782
01:14:47,189 --> 01:14:47,199
line of gravity falls out of the base
 

1783
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,830
line of gravity falls out of the base
support, I take your center and I move

1784
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:49,840
support, I take your center and I move
 

1785
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,630
support, I take your center and I move
it out of your basic support.

1786
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:52,640
it out of your basic support.
 

1787
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,189
it out of your basic support.
It's more instantaneous that you're now

1788
01:14:55,189 --> 01:14:55,199
It's more instantaneous that you're now
 

1789
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:58,070
It's more instantaneous that you're now
in position. Okay.

1790
01:14:58,070 --> 01:14:58,080
in position. Okay.
 

1791
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,669
in position. Okay.
The third way of what we're doing here

1792
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:01,679
The third way of what we're doing here
 

1793
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,709
The third way of what we're doing here
is I take your center out of your base

1794
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:04,719
is I take your center out of your base
 

1795
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:06,790
is I take your center out of your base
support

1796
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:06,800
support
 

1797
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,750
support
as I take your base support in another

1798
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:09,760
as I take your base support in another
 

1799
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,229
as I take your base support in another
direction. You see that? That is the

1800
01:15:12,229 --> 01:15:12,239
direction. You see that? That is the
 

1801
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:15,510
direction. You see that? That is the
most efficient way. So

1802
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:15,520
most efficient way. So
 

1803
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,350
most efficient way. So
this person

1804
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:17,360
this person
 

1805
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:21,030
this person
who is being pulled,

1806
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:21,040
who is being pulled,
 

1807
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,189
who is being pulled,
they can move their base support back

1808
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:23,199
they can move their base support back
 

1809
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:27,510
they can move their base support back
under and we use that. But we don't do

1810
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:27,520
under and we use that. But we don't do
 

1811
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:30,709
under and we use that. But we don't do
like sumia to where we kept our feet

1812
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:30,719
like sumia to where we kept our feet
 

1813
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:33,030
like sumia to where we kept our feet
still. Remember when we did that discuss

1814
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,040
still. Remember when we did that discuss
 

1815
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,870
still. Remember when we did that discuss
keep your feet still and you let your

1816
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:34,880
keep your feet still and you let your
 

1817
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,470
keep your feet still and you let your
line of gravity eventually be pulled

1818
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:36,480
line of gravity eventually be pulled
 

1819
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,870
line of gravity eventually be pulled
out. When we did the arm drag, we're

1820
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:38,880
out. When we did the arm drag, we're
 

1821
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,510
out. When we did the arm drag, we're
like, I'm going to pull on your arm with

1822
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:41,520
like, I'm going to pull on your arm with
 

1823
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,510
like, I'm going to pull on your arm with
the expectation that you're going to try

1824
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:43,520
the expectation that you're going to try
 

1825
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:51,430
the expectation that you're going to try
to stay on balance. Okay,

1826
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:51,440

 

1827
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:55,110

it is a way. But what we are doing is

1828
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:55,120
it is a way. But what we are doing is
 

1829
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,430
it is a way. But what we are doing is
this. In this case, you got to look this

1830
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:57,440
this. In this case, you got to look this
 

1831
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:03,189
this. In this case, you got to look this
way. The center. Let me do it top down.

1832
01:16:03,189 --> 01:16:03,199
way. The center. Let me do it top down.
 

1833
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,350
way. The center. Let me do it top down.
Here's their feet.

1834
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:05,360
Here's their feet.
 

1835
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,270
Here's their feet.
Their line of gravity somewhere around

1836
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:07,280
Their line of gravity somewhere around
 

1837
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:10,550
Their line of gravity somewhere around
here going down. The center of gravity

1838
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:10,560
here going down. The center of gravity
 

1839
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,550
here going down. The center of gravity
somewhere over here. When I displace,

1840
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:14,560
somewhere over here. When I displace,
 

1841
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,030
somewhere over here. When I displace,
I'm taking the center moving it out

1842
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:19,040
I'm taking the center moving it out
 

1843
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,270
I'm taking the center moving it out
from the base of support. Okay. Does

1844
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:21,280
from the base of support. Okay. Does
 

1845
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,750
from the base of support. Okay. Does
that make sense? Okay.

1846
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:23,760
that make sense? Okay.
 

1847
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,350
that make sense? Okay.
Um

1848
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,360

 

1849
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,790

that is when

1850
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:30,800
that is when
 

1851
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,070
that is when
you now look at his center plot it in a

1852
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,080
you now look at his center plot it in a
 

1853
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,149
you now look at his center plot it in a
vertical plane

1854
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:36,159
vertical plane
 

1855
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:39,910
vertical plane
and here's where it is but I am going to

1856
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:39,920
and here's where it is but I am going to
 

1857
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,790
and here's where it is but I am going to
move it across the map. When we do that

1858
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:44,800
move it across the map. When we do that
 

1859
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,870
move it across the map. When we do that
mistake

1860
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:46,880
mistake
 

1861
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,830
mistake
didn't didn't move yet till now. Dude's

1862
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:49,840
didn't didn't move yet till now. Dude's
 

1863
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,229
didn't didn't move yet till now. Dude's
not going to be there in Tinaga. The

1864
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:52,239
not going to be there in Tinaga. The
 

1865
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:53,990
not going to be there in Tinaga. The
opening will be gone by that point.

1866
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:54,000
opening will be gone by that point.
 

1867
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,709
opening will be gone by that point.
Okay. My goal is to make this center do

1868
01:16:58,709 --> 01:16:58,719
Okay. My goal is to make this center do
 

1869
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:03,110
Okay. My goal is to make this center do
that. Okay. So,

1870
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:03,120
that. Okay. So,
 

1871
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:13,189
that. Okay. So,
let's say uh let me

1872
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:13,199

 

1873
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:14,950

do that.

1874
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:14,960
do that.
 

1875
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,630
do that.
All right. And he can kind of turn

1876
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:18,640
All right. And he can kind of turn
 

1877
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,110
All right. And he can kind of turn
any old way because his center is doing

1878
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:21,120
any old way because his center is doing
 

1879
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,149
any old way because his center is doing
what? Whatever he's doing. You see?

1880
01:17:24,149 --> 01:17:24,159
what? Whatever he's doing. You see?
 

1881
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:28,229
what? Whatever he's doing. You see?
But if I keep moving his center,

1882
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:28,239
But if I keep moving his center,
 

1883
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:31,669
But if I keep moving his center,
it traveled sagely across the map. You

1884
01:17:31,669 --> 01:17:31,679
it traveled sagely across the map. You
 

1885
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:35,030
it traveled sagely across the map. You
see that? Okay. That means his line of

1886
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:35,040
see that? Okay. That means his line of
 

1887
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,950
see that? Okay. That means his line of
gravity went outside his base of

1888
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:36,960
gravity went outside his base of
 

1889
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,350
gravity went outside his base of
support. When the line of gravity is

1890
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:39,360
support. When the line of gravity is
 

1891
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,270
support. When the line of gravity is
outside of base support, the spine is

1892
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:41,280
outside of base support, the spine is
 

1893
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,709
outside of base support, the spine is
destabilized and the limbs by which you

1894
01:17:44,709 --> 01:17:44,719
destabilized and the limbs by which you
 

1895
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:47,110
destabilized and the limbs by which you
attack. No one attacks with the spine.

1896
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:47,120
attack. No one attacks with the spine.
 

1897
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:51,110
attack. No one attacks with the spine.
Okay? It's kind of like in in uh

1898
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:51,120
Okay? It's kind of like in in uh
 

1899
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,189
Okay? It's kind of like in in uh
in law enforcement, we say watch the

1900
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:53,199
in law enforcement, we say watch the
 

1901
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,830
in law enforcement, we say watch the
hands. Okay? If you shoot me, you got to

1902
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:55,840
hands. Okay? If you shoot me, you got to
 

1903
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,470
hands. Okay? If you shoot me, you got to
use your hands. Okay? No one gets their

1904
01:17:58,470 --> 01:17:58,480
use your hands. Okay? No one gets their
 

1905
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,709
use your hands. Okay? No one gets their
tongue and pulls the trigger. Okay? So,

1906
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:00,719
tongue and pulls the trigger. Okay? So,
 

1907
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,070
tongue and pulls the trigger. Okay? So,
you always got to watch the hands. Watch

1908
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:02,080
you always got to watch the hands. Watch
 

1909
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,550
you always got to watch the hands. Watch
the hands. Okay? So, same thing. for you

1910
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:04,560
the hands. Okay? So, same thing. for you
 

1911
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,790
the hands. Okay? So, same thing. for you
to hurt me, you're going to have to use

1912
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:06,800
to hurt me, you're going to have to use
 

1913
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,830
to hurt me, you're going to have to use
your limbs. But once I destabilize your

1914
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:09,840
your limbs. But once I destabilize your
 

1915
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,550
your limbs. But once I destabilize your
base support like this, limbs get super

1916
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:12,560
base support like this, limbs get super
 

1917
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,750
base support like this, limbs get super
weak. Okay? That's why our limbs were so

1918
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:15,760
weak. Okay? That's why our limbs were so
 

1919
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,630
weak. Okay? That's why our limbs were so
strong in that kite nag because you had

1920
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:18,640
strong in that kite nag because you had
 

1921
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,870
strong in that kite nag because you had
balance, you're spanking, your spine can

1922
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:20,880
balance, you're spanking, your spine can
 

1923
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,030
balance, you're spanking, your spine can
be stabilized and you could do whatever

1924
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:23,040
be stabilized and you could do whatever
 

1925
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,510
be stabilized and you could do whatever
you want as if you're super strong.

1926
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:25,520
you want as if you're super strong.
 

1927
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,350
you want as if you're super strong.
That's where that that um that 80 pound

1928
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:29,360
That's where that that um that 80 pound
 

1929
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,189
That's where that that um that 80 pound
female, the drunk female comes from.

1930
01:18:31,189 --> 01:18:31,199
female, the drunk female comes from.
 

1931
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:32,790
female, the drunk female comes from.
They don't ever have her an actual

1932
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:32,800
They don't ever have her an actual
 

1933
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,189
They don't ever have her an actual
condition, okay? They're just pulling on

1934
01:18:35,189 --> 01:18:35,199
condition, okay? They're just pulling on
 

1935
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:37,270
condition, okay? They're just pulling on
things and she's moving back underneath

1936
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:37,280
things and she's moving back underneath
 

1937
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,430
things and she's moving back underneath
it and she's able to get some strength

1938
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:39,440
it and she's able to get some strength
 

1939
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,030
it and she's able to get some strength
in the limbs. Okay? All right. So, when

1940
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:43,040
in the limbs. Okay? All right. So, when
 

1941
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:47,270
in the limbs. Okay? All right. So, when
you're doing this drill,

1942
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:47,280

 

1943
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,189

yes, they they're not going to follow

1944
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:49,199
yes, they they're not going to follow
 

1945
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:53,350
yes, they they're not going to follow
like tension nugget because there's no

1946
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:53,360
like tension nugget because there's no
 

1947
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,990
like tension nugget because there's no
forward inertia. That force is missing

1948
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:56,000
forward inertia. That force is missing
 

1949
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,630
forward inertia. That force is missing
and we're throwing with forces. Okay?

1950
01:18:58,630 --> 01:18:58,640
and we're throwing with forces. Okay?
 

1951
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,110
and we're throwing with forces. Okay?
And the centrifugal and centrifugal

1952
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:01,120
And the centrifugal and centrifugal
 

1953
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,590
And the centrifugal and centrifugal
energy is not indetecting. But what we

1954
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:03,600
energy is not indetecting. But what we
 

1955
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,830
energy is not indetecting. But what we
should see is this center got moved

1956
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:07,840
should see is this center got moved
 

1957
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,950
should see is this center got moved
across the map. It shouldn't turn. It

1958
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:10,960
across the map. It shouldn't turn. It
 

1959
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,630
across the map. It shouldn't turn. It
can't turn. It definitely shouldn't go

1960
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:12,640
can't turn. It definitely shouldn't go
 

1961
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,590
can't turn. It definitely shouldn't go
back to me, right? It can't stay still

1962
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:15,600
back to me, right? It can't stay still
 

1963
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,550
back to me, right? It can't stay still
either. It has to go whoa like that. And

1964
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:18,560
either. It has to go whoa like that. And
 

1965
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,070
either. It has to go whoa like that. And
then what we're going to see is when we

1966
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:22,080
then what we're going to see is when we
 

1967
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,390
then what we're going to see is when we
take the center of gravity outside and

1968
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:26,400
take the center of gravity outside and
 

1969
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,870
take the center of gravity outside and
the base is deconstructed,

1970
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:28,880
the base is deconstructed,
 

1971
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,870
the base is deconstructed,
all this gets super light. That's all

1972
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:30,880
all this gets super light. That's all
 

1973
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,790
all this gets super light. That's all
our discovery. Just see how light that

1974
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:32,800
our discovery. Just see how light that
 

1975
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,510
our discovery. Just see how light that
gets. Okay, this part. All right. So,

1976
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:35,520
gets. Okay, this part. All right. So,
 

1977
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,149
gets. Okay, this part. All right. So,
make sure the way to think of it that

1978
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:38,159
make sure the way to think of it that
 

1979
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,390
make sure the way to think of it that
center of gravity needs to traverse the

1980
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:40,400
center of gravity needs to traverse the
 

1981
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,590
center of gravity needs to traverse the
mat. Okay?

1982
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:43,600
mat. Okay?
 

1983
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,669
mat. Okay?
Not like that, not across the mat. It

1984
01:19:47,669 --> 01:19:47,679
Not like that, not across the mat. It
 

1985
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:50,790
Not like that, not across the mat. It
just can't stay here. That was enough.

1986
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:50,800
just can't stay here. That was enough.
 

1987
01:19:50,800 --> 01:20:10,950
just can't stay here. That was enough.
Okay, try. Good.

1988
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:10,960

 

1989
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:21,669

Use your arm on their chest.

1990
01:20:21,669 --> 01:20:21,679

 

1991
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:22,870

Don't bring your arm forward. Don't

1992
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:22,880
Don't bring your arm forward. Don't
 

1993
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:32,310
Don't bring your arm forward. Don't
bring your arm.

1994
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:32,320

 

1995
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:38,870

You stand here.

1996
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:38,880

 

1997
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,550

Okay.

1998
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:40,560
Okay.
 

1999
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:54,870
Okay.
Here.

2000
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:54,880

 

2001
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:00,630

See, only move your foot.

2002
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:00,640

 

2003
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:05,590

Yes.

2004
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:05,600

 

2005
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,070

Go through, not around. Go through, not

2006
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:08,080
Go through, not around. Go through, not
 

2007
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,990
Go through, not around. Go through, not
around.

2008
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:10,000
around.
 

2009
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,590
around.
Make sure the center's moving.

2010
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:13,600
Make sure the center's moving.
 

2011
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:18,229
Make sure the center's moving.
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2012
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:18,239

 

2013
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:21,030

Now, Angelo, I'm going to guess that

2014
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:21,040
Now, Angelo, I'm going to guess that
 

2015
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,910
Now, Angelo, I'm going to guess that
felt like you didn't do Okay. But

2016
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:23,920
felt like you didn't do Okay. But
 

2017
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,630
felt like you didn't do Okay. But
you can see the reaction in Rio. The

2018
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:26,640
you can see the reaction in Rio. The
 

2019
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,510
you can see the reaction in Rio. The
panic set in cuz what the Okay.

2020
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:29,520
panic set in cuz what the Okay.
 

2021
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,189
panic set in cuz what the Okay.
And that's that's what it needs to feel

2022
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:31,199
And that's that's what it needs to feel
 

2023
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,390
And that's that's what it needs to feel
like. Okay. What did you do? Right. You

2024
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:34,400
like. Okay. What did you do? Right. You
 

2025
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,790
like. Okay. What did you do? Right. You
left that foot where it was. You didn't

2026
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:36,800
left that foot where it was. You didn't
 

2027
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,390
left that foot where it was. You didn't
drag it and turn it out. You made heel

2028
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:38,400
drag it and turn it out. You made heel
 

2029
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,709
drag it and turn it out. You made heel
weight. Okay. Try it again. Okay, that

2030
01:21:40,709 --> 01:21:40,719
weight. Okay. Try it again. Okay, that
 

2031
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:49,110
weight. Okay. Try it again. Okay, that
was excellent.

2032
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:49,120

 

2033
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,030

The center moves. Don't get your foot

2034
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:51,040
The center moves. Don't get your foot
 

2035
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:57,110
The center moves. Don't get your foot
back there. Leave the center still.

2036
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:57,120

 

2037
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,270

It's a little angled that way. You're

2038
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,280
It's a little angled that way. You're
 

2039
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,030
It's a little angled that way. You're
going around the center. Go through his

2040
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:01,040
going around the center. Go through his
 

2041
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,990
going around the center. Go through his
center.

2042
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:04,000
center.
 

2043
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,590
center.
Yes.

2044
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:05,600
Yes.
 

2045
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,470
Yes.
Then watch the heel weight. But that was

2046
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:08,480
Then watch the heel weight. But that was
 

2047
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,910
Then watch the heel weight. But that was
this

2048
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:11,920

 

2049
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:19,830

Watch the heel weight

2050
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:19,840

 

2051
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:25,830

this way around the center.

2052
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:25,840

 

2053
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:33,650

Make sure the center moves. Good.

2054
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:33,660

 

2055
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:34,870

[Music]

2056
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:34,880
[Music]
 

2057
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:43,850
[Music]
Good. Watch the heel.

2058
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:43,860

 

2059
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:50,870

[Music]

2060
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:50,880

 

2061
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:56,470

Two angles,

2062
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:56,480

 

2063
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:01,750

through around through

2064
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:01,760

 

2065
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,830

good. There we go. See the different

2066
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:03,840
good. There we go. See the different
 

2067
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,110
good. There we go. See the different
reaction. Okay.

2068
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:07,120
reaction. Okay.
 

2069
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:19,990
reaction. Okay.
through. Not not allow

2070
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:20,000

 

2071
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,790

better. That's fine.

2072
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:24,800

 

2073
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:29,669

So,

2074
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:29,679

 

2075
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:32,870

try to try to grip me on the on the mat

2076
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:32,880
try to try to grip me on the on the mat
 

2077
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,229
try to try to grip me on the on the mat
somewhere. Okay. So I know we normally

2078
01:23:36,229 --> 01:23:36,239
somewhere. Okay. So I know we normally
 

2079
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:38,070
somewhere. Okay. So I know we normally
go

2080
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:38,080
go
 

2081
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,910
go
some varian of that

2082
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:41,920
some varian of that
 

2083
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:46,310
some varian of that
sometimes even you see this one

2084
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:46,320
sometimes even you see this one
 

2085
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,270
sometimes even you see this one
you're going that way I'm not going

2086
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:49,280
you're going that way I'm not going
 

2087
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,750
you're going that way I'm not going
through the center going I'm pulling the

2088
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:51,760
through the center going I'm pulling the
 

2089
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,430
through the center going I'm pulling the
center okay so

2090
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:55,440
center okay so
 

2091
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,870
center okay so
let's see if this poetic works okay uh

2092
01:23:58,870 --> 01:23:58,880
let's see if this poetic works okay uh
 

2093
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:08,870
let's see if this poetic works okay uh
because I don't want to do that

2094
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:08,880

 

2095
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,709

there's a sense that I'm coming this

2096
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:10,719
there's a sense that I'm coming this
 

2097
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:18,390
there's a sense that I'm coming this
way.

2098
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:18,400

 

2099
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:22,229

This is teni nag on the torso.

2100
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:22,239
This is teni nag on the torso.
 

2101
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:25,510
This is teni nag on the torso.
Did you see it? Okay.

2102
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:25,520
Did you see it? Okay.
 

2103
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:33,750
Did you see it? Okay.
So maybe that'll help stop going around.

2104
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:33,760

 

2105
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,310

Go slow.

2106
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:36,320
Go slow.
 

2107
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,030
Go slow.
Okay, I'm here.

2108
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:39,040
Okay, I'm here.
 

2109
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,430
Okay, I'm here.
There's the leg. And go this way.

2110
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:43,440
There's the leg. And go this way.
 

2111
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,910
There's the leg. And go this way.
Okay,

2112
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:45,920
Okay,
 

2113
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,910
Okay,
stop trying to go forward because we're

2114
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:47,920
stop trying to go forward because we're
 

2115
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,310
stop trying to go forward because we're
not going to push him the opposite

2116
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:50,320
not going to push him the opposite
 

2117
01:24:50,320 --> 01:25:06,470
not going to push him the opposite
direction he's going. Okay, try that.

2118
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:06,480

 

2119
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,350

If you're if you're both getting it and

2120
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:09,360
If you're if you're both getting it and
 

2121
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:12,790
If you're if you're both getting it and
your chem is good on both parties, try

2122
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:12,800
your chem is good on both parties, try
 

2123
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:19,030
your chem is good on both parties, try
this tension on the torso.

2124
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:19,040

 

2125
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,709

Torso is like I came under his arm.

2126
01:25:22,709 --> 01:25:22,719
Torso is like I came under his arm.
 

2127
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:24,550
Torso is like I came under his arm.
if you're trying it. If not, keep doing

2128
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:24,560
if you're trying it. If not, keep doing
 

2129
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:31,030
if you're trying it. If not, keep doing
the drum.

2130
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:31,040

 

2131
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,430

I did I don't want tension on the head

2132
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:33,440
I did I don't want tension on the head
 

2133
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:37,590
I did I don't want tension on the head
though. Yes.

2134
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:37,600

 

2135
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:43,750

Better. Yeah.

2136
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:43,760

 

2137
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,870

Yeah. Just place the center. Don't go

2138
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:46,880
Yeah. Just place the center. Don't go
 

2139
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,350
Yeah. Just place the center. Don't go
around it. Don't go behind. Your foot

2140
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:49,360
around it. Don't go behind. Your foot
 

2141
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,189
around it. Don't go behind. Your foot
goes behind his foot, but your center

2142
01:25:51,189 --> 01:25:51,199
goes behind his foot, but your center
 

2143
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:52,950
goes behind his foot, but your center
doesn't center.

2144
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:52,960
doesn't center.
 

2145
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,830
doesn't center.
So you got to put that foot where it has

2146
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:55,840
So you got to put that foot where it has
 

2147
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,470
So you got to put that foot where it has
enough penetration to displace it in the

2148
01:25:58,470 --> 01:25:58,480
enough penetration to displace it in the
 

2149
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:13,910
enough penetration to displace it in the
vertical plane. Okay.

2150
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:13,920

 

2151
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,189

Good. Now we got heel weight in. Turn

2152
01:26:17,189 --> 01:26:17,199
Good. Now we got heel weight in. Turn
 

2153
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:22,149
Good. Now we got heel weight in. Turn
your toes out.

2154
01:26:22,149 --> 01:26:22,159

 

2155
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:23,750

Come underneath. We're going to go

2156
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:23,760
Come underneath. We're going to go
 

2157
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,669
Come underneath. We're going to go
there. Let's try the torso.

2158
01:26:27,669 --> 01:26:27,679
there. Let's try the torso.
 

2159
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:30,629
there. Let's try the torso.
And the more you go through the center,

2160
01:26:30,629 --> 01:26:30,639
And the more you go through the center,
 

2161
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:33,830
And the more you go through the center,
the the lighter it is.

2162
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:33,840
the the lighter it is.
 

2163
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,390
the the lighter it is.
Okay? Can you see that? Nothing. There's

2164
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:36,400
Okay? Can you see that? Nothing. There's
 

2165
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,110
Okay? Can you see that? Nothing. There's
nothing. I don't feel crap. Okay?

2166
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:39,120
nothing. I don't feel crap. Okay?
 

2167
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,950
nothing. I don't feel crap. Okay?
Because as his face goes out, everything

2168
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:42,960
Because as his face goes out, everything
 

2169
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,110
Because as his face goes out, everything
gets lighter on the top. Okay? Where do

2170
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:45,120
gets lighter on the top. Okay? Where do
 

2171
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:48,149
gets lighter on the top. Okay? Where do
I do feel it? I do feel it on the foot.

2172
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:48,159
I do feel it? I do feel it on the foot.
 

2173
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:59,430
I do feel it? I do feel it on the foot.
Okay?

2174
01:26:59,430 --> 01:26:59,440

 

2175
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,470

ground. Ground ground. Breathe out.

2176
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:02,480
ground. Ground ground. Breathe out.
 

2177
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:06,950
ground. Ground ground. Breathe out.
There's going to be you you brought up

2178
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:06,960
There's going to be you you brought up
 

2179
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,470
There's going to be you you brought up
the constant fluctuation. So when you're

2180
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:10,480
the constant fluctuation. So when you're
 

2181
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,709
the constant fluctuation. So when you're
putting pressure on him, the reactionary

2182
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:12,719
putting pressure on him, the reactionary
 

2183
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:15,189
putting pressure on him, the reactionary
force is coming. As he's moving, the

2184
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:15,199
force is coming. As he's moving, the
 

2185
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:17,350
force is coming. As he's moving, the
reactionary force is cutting at

2186
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:17,360
reactionary force is cutting at
 

2187
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,030
reactionary force is cutting at
different angles and you have to keep

2188
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:19,040
different angles and you have to keep
 

2189
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,550
different angles and you have to keep
adjusting

2190
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:20,560
adjusting
 

2191
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,070
adjusting
to keep it on the midoot. Okay? You

2192
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:22,080
to keep it on the midoot. Okay? You
 

2193
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,470
to keep it on the midoot. Okay? You
can't go now. Oh, that. That

2194
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:24,480
can't go now. Oh, that. That
 

2195
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,709
can't go now. Oh, that. That
reactionary force I didn't recognize.

2196
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:26,719
reactionary force I didn't recognize.
 

2197
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:30,070
reactionary force I didn't recognize.
Okay? Try again.

2198
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:30,080
Okay? Try again.
 

2199
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:35,510
Okay? Try again.
Hence task yourself with midfoot

2200
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:35,520

 

2201
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,629

and try and try and try for more through

2202
01:27:40,629 --> 01:27:40,639
and try and try and try for more through
 

2203
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:43,110
and try and try and try for more through
more and more through last and last this

2204
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:43,120
more and more through last and last this
 

2205
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:56,470
more and more through last and last this
more and more through. Yeah.

2206
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:56,480

 

2207
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,310

Your foot is the only way you can trip

2208
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:58,320
Your foot is the only way you can trip
 

2209
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,470
Your foot is the only way you can trip
is if your foot got there first. The

2210
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:00,480
is if your foot got there first. The
 

2211
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,070
is if your foot got there first. The
only way your foot can get there first

2212
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:02,080
only way your foot can get there first
 

2213
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:05,510
only way your foot can get there first
is you did not sagely disl

2214
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:05,520
is you did not sagely disl
 

2215
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:16,070
is you did not sagely disl
Yes.

2216
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:16,080

 

2217
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:23,350

Back foot.

2218
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:23,360

 

2219
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,750

The only way he could turn out is if

2220
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:25,760
The only way he could turn out is if
 

2221
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,750
The only way he could turn out is if
center didn't travel across the space

2222
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:27,760
center didn't travel across the space
 

2223
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:38,790
center didn't travel across the space
across the mat instantane.

2224
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:38,800

 

2225
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,189

So what I would do is I would I when I

2226
01:28:41,189 --> 01:28:41,199
So what I would do is I would I when I
 

2227
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,990
So what I would do is I would I when I
go to enter

2228
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:44,000
go to enter
 

2229
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,350
go to enter
that's your measuring step. Okay. It

2230
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:47,360
that's your measuring step. Okay. It
 

2231
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,470
that's your measuring step. Okay. It
says same thing. So, uh, I'll put that

2232
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:50,480
says same thing. So, uh, I'll put that
 

2233
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,510
says same thing. So, uh, I'll put that
foot maybe I'm measuring. Okay, I know

2234
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:53,520
foot maybe I'm measuring. Okay, I know
 

2235
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,910
foot maybe I'm measuring. Okay, I know
where his face is right now. So, I got

2236
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:55,920
where his face is right now. So, I got
 

2237
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,990
where his face is right now. So, I got
to figure out where I can get that foot

2238
01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:58,000
to figure out where I can get that foot
 

2239
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,110
to figure out where I can get that foot
to go. So, uh, that's I'm going to I'll

2240
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:01,120
to go. So, uh, that's I'm going to I'll
 

2241
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,270
to go. So, uh, that's I'm going to I'll
dance out of it, right? And then I kind

2242
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:03,280
dance out of it, right? And then I kind
 

2243
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,070
dance out of it, right? And then I kind
of make that foot there without showing

2244
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:06,080
of make that foot there without showing
 

2245
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,790
of make that foot there without showing
the chest pressure. You see? And then I

2246
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:08,800
the chest pressure. You see? And then I
 

2247
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,669
the chest pressure. You see? And then I
know from the lean and the step through,

2248
01:29:11,669 --> 01:29:11,679
know from the lean and the step through,
 

2249
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,510
know from the lean and the step through,
I'm going to take that thing solid.

2250
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:13,520
I'm going to take that thing solid.
 

2251
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,870
I'm going to take that thing solid.
Okay. So, you have measuring key all the

2252
01:29:16,870 --> 01:29:16,880
Okay. So, you have measuring key all the
 

2253
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,030
Okay. So, you have measuring key all the
time. use measuring feet all the time

2254
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:19,040
time. use measuring feet all the time
 

2255
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:22,149
time. use measuring feet all the time
and that's your measuring foot. So you

2256
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:22,159
and that's your measuring foot. So you
 

2257
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:26,390
and that's your measuring foot. So you
put it where it needs to be at the angle

2258
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:26,400
put it where it needs to be at the angle
 

2259
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,830
put it where it needs to be at the angle
it needs to be in order to displace.

2260
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:29,840
it needs to be in order to displace.
 

2261
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,590
it needs to be in order to displace.
Does that do just like in um the vulcan

2262
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:33,600
Does that do just like in um the vulcan
 

2263
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,750
Does that do just like in um the vulcan
work remember the I don't know what the

2264
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:35,760
work remember the I don't know what the
 

2265
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:36,790
work remember the I don't know what the
body's going to be. I don't know what

2266
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:36,800
body's going to be. I don't know what
 

2267
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,790
body's going to be. I don't know what
the footwork's going to be. But if you

2268
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:38,800
the footwork's going to be. But if you
 

2269
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,870
the footwork's going to be. But if you
let that chest pressure close like that

2270
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:40,880
let that chest pressure close like that
 

2271
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,550
let that chest pressure close like that
he got too close. You're not going to do

2272
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:42,560
he got too close. You're not going to do
 

2273
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,709
he got too close. You're not going to do
what you think you need to do. Okay. So

2274
01:29:44,709 --> 01:29:44,719
what you think you need to do. Okay. So
 

2275
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:48,950
what you think you need to do. Okay. So
what ended up working was I came back.

2276
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:48,960
what ended up working was I came back.
 

2277
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,590
what ended up working was I came back.
We knew I couldn't go forward. And the

2278
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:51,600
We knew I couldn't go forward. And the
 

2279
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,470
We knew I couldn't go forward. And the
caveat was don't step where the form

2280
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:54,480
caveat was don't step where the form
 

2281
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,790
caveat was don't step where the form
tells you, step where the situation is

2282
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:56,800
tells you, step where the situation is
 

2283
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,870
tells you, step where the situation is
telling you. So same thing here. Okay?

2284
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:00,880
telling you. So same thing here. Okay?
 

2285
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,590
telling you. So same thing here. Okay?
You know what you have to think reverse

2286
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:03,600
You know what you have to think reverse
 

2287
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,629
You know what you have to think reverse
like reversely. So I know that this

2288
01:30:06,629 --> 01:30:06,639
like reversely. So I know that this
 

2289
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:10,550
like reversely. So I know that this
center has to go at least like that.

2290
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:10,560
center has to go at least like that.
 

2291
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,229
center has to go at least like that.
Okay?

2292
01:30:12,229 --> 01:30:12,239
Okay?
 

2293
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:16,950
Okay?
So if I put this foot here too far out,

2294
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:16,960
So if I put this foot here too far out,
 

2295
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,910
So if I put this foot here too far out,
can't do it.

2296
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:19,920
can't do it.
 

2297
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,510
can't do it.
Likewise, if I put it here

2298
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:23,520
Likewise, if I put it here
 

2299
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:28,070
Likewise, if I put it here
and I know at the angle that I cut

2300
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:28,080
and I know at the angle that I cut
 

2301
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:31,430
and I know at the angle that I cut
and I just went ahead and did that.

2302
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:31,440
and I just went ahead and did that.
 

2303
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,750
and I just went ahead and did that.
Now when I go to this angle, my feet are

2304
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:33,760
Now when I go to this angle, my feet are
 

2305
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:36,629
Now when I go to this angle, my feet are
out. You see that? So you have to put

2306
01:30:36,629 --> 01:30:36,639
out. You see that? So you have to put
 

2307
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,629
out. You see that? So you have to put
your foot

2308
01:30:38,629 --> 01:30:38,639
your foot
 

2309
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,950
your foot
not only

2310
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:40,960
not only
 

2311
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,350
not only
at the right measuring the right range

2312
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:43,360
at the right measuring the right range
 

2313
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:47,510
at the right measuring the right range
but the right angle of the tap.

2314
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:47,520
but the right angle of the tap.
 

2315
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,830
but the right angle of the tap.
Does that make sense? Not not out of

2316
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:49,840
Does that make sense? Not not out of
 

2317
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:54,070
Does that make sense? Not not out of
habit. I like there. Okay. All right. I

2318
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:54,080
habit. I like there. Okay. All right. I
 

2319
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,669
habit. I like there. Okay. All right. I
This is where I always step on this

2320
01:30:55,669 --> 01:30:55,679
This is where I always step on this
 

2321
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:57,990
This is where I always step on this

2322
01:30:57,990 --> 01:30:58,000
technique. Okay. No, no, no. The
 

2323
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,790
technique. Okay. No, no, no. The
feeling. Go.

2324
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:00,800
feeling. Go.
 

2325
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:10,470
feeling. Go.
Chase the feeling, not the floor.

2326
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:10,480

 

2327
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:17,590

And I want more sideways

2328
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:17,600

 

2329
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,430

arm

2330
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:21,440

 

2331
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:26,470

sideways.

2332
01:31:26,470 --> 01:31:26,480

 

2333
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,790

Do that side again.

2334
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:28,800
Do that side again.
 

2335
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,030
Do that side again.
And I want you to come look over here

2336
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:31,040
And I want you to come look over here
 

2337
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:35,510
And I want you to come look over here
for me with your step.

2338
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:35,520
for me with your step.
 

2339
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,590
for me with your step.
There you go.

2340
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:37,600
There you go.
 

2341
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,990
There you go.
Okay.

2342
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:40,000
Okay.
 

2343
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,270
Okay.
See his hips, his center came up and it

2344
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:43,280
See his hips, his center came up and it
 

2345
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:46,070
See his hips, his center came up and it
went forward. There was no pulling back.

2346
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:46,080
went forward. There was no pulling back.
 

2347
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:49,350
went forward. There was no pulling back.
The legs went one way. Line of gravity

2348
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:49,360
The legs went one way. Line of gravity
 

2349
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:53,110
The legs went one way. Line of gravity
went the other way. Okay. So, I don't

2350
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:53,120
went the other way. Okay. So, I don't
 

2351
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,910
went the other way. Okay. So, I don't
know what that felt like to you.

2352
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:55,920
know what that felt like to you.
 

2353
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,830
know what that felt like to you.
I would say maybe it feels like we're

2354
01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:57,840
I would say maybe it feels like we're
 

2355
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,550
I would say maybe it feels like we're
going backwards, but it's not actually

2356
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:00,560
going backwards, but it's not actually
 

2357
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,510
going backwards, but it's not actually
backwards, but it's definitely not at an

2358
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:03,520
backwards, but it's definitely not at an
 

2359
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,470
backwards, but it's definitely not at an
angle forward. Okay, to do that, you're

2360
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:06,480
angle forward. Okay, to do that, you're
 

2361
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,709
angle forward. Okay, to do that, you're
going to go around their center, not

2362
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:08,719
going to go around their center, not
 

2363
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:10,390
going to go around their center, not
through their center. Okay, try it

2364
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:10,400
through their center. Okay, try it
 

2365
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:21,830
through their center. Okay, try it
again.

2366
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:21,840

 

2367
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:30,229

Do angle. So, put that foot more

2368
01:32:30,229 --> 01:32:30,239

You see that? But what you can't do,

01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:11,110

you can't go here. He's I There's no way

you can't go here. He's I There's no way
I'm going to have to take that angle

I'm going to have to take that angle
 

2393
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:15,430

around. Does that make sense? Okay. So,

what you do when you do the full X
pattern is the reactionary force. You

saw you you can feel it. Everyone will
feel it. You need that constant

2464
01:36:12,310 --> 01:36:12,320
feel it. You need that constant
 

2465
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,149
feel it. You need that constant
internalization that's happening this

2466
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:14,159
internalization that's happening this
 

2467
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:16,550
internalization that's happening this
constant fluctuation that Ryan was

constant fluctuation that Ryan was
talking about earlier. Okay?

these last minute tensions. It doesn't
 

2475
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,470
these last minute tensions. It doesn't
matter who it is. No one likes to go,

01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:28,480
matter who it is. No one likes to go,
 

2477
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:31,270
matter who it is. No one likes to go,
"What the fuck?" Okay, everyone's going

01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:31,280
"What the fuck?" Okay, everyone's going
 

2479

"What the fuck?" Okay, everyone's going
to tense.

01:36:49,189 --> 01:36:49,199
weaknesses in the scance such as my
 

2493
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:53,109
weaknesses in the scance such as my
fever out. Okay,

2494
01:36:53,109 --> 01:36:53,119
fever out. Okay,
 

2495
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:54,950
fever out. Okay,
but

2496
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:54,960
but
 

2497
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,870
but
remember that as they resist

2498
01:36:58,870 --> 01:36:58,880
remember that as they resist
 

2499
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,550
remember that as they resist
if I can internalize it the adhesion

2500
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:02,560
if I can internalize it the adhesion
 

2501
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,109
if I can internalize it the adhesion
value goes up because the overall yong

2502
01:37:05,109 --> 01:37:05,119
value goes up because the overall yong
 

2503
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:06,870
value goes up because the overall yong
value went up. Does everyone remember

2504
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:06,880
value went up. Does everyone remember
 

2505
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:10,629
value went up. Does everyone remember
that? Okay. So when we're now in tension

2506
01:37:10,629 --> 01:37:10,639
that? Okay. So when we're now in tension
 

2507
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:13,510
that? Okay. So when we're now in tension
on it, we saw how light it went. Well,

2508
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:13,520
on it, we saw how light it went. Well,
 

2509
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,070
on it, we saw how light it went. Well,
the two start to work on each other. So

2510
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:16,080
the two start to work on each other. So
 

2511
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,350
the two start to work on each other. So
as the base goes out, it got light here.

2512
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:19,360
as the base goes out, it got light here.
 

2513
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:23,189
as the base goes out, it got light here.
You see? And they will tense

2514
01:37:23,189 --> 01:37:23,199
You see? And they will tense
 

2515
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:26,709
You see? And they will tense
up here. That'll make the base lighter.

2516
01:37:26,709 --> 01:37:26,719
up here. That'll make the base lighter.
 

2517
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:28,950
up here. That'll make the base lighter.
And you we're fluctuating this constant

2518
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:28,960
And you we're fluctuating this constant
 

2519
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,550
And you we're fluctuating this constant
lightness that is going going on.

2520
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:32,560
lightness that is going going on.
 

2521
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,270
lightness that is going going on.
Um,

2522
01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:35,280
Um,
 

2523
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,030
Um,
we took the top part out, but we're

2524
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:37,040
we took the top part out, but we're
 

2525
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,709
we took the top part out, but we're
still you could do it without

2526
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:40,719
still you could do it without
 

2527
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:43,510
still you could do it without
any top part because you can use the

2528
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:43,520
any top part because you can use the
 

2529
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,709
any top part because you can use the
inertia that's coming forward to to be

2530
01:37:46,709 --> 01:37:46,719
inertia that's coming forward to to be
 

2531
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:49,669
inertia that's coming forward to to be
what you are fulcoming around which you

2532
01:37:49,669 --> 01:37:49,679
what you are fulcoming around which you
 

2533
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:52,229
what you are fulcoming around which you
do anyways. But here we didn't really

2534
01:37:52,229 --> 01:37:52,239
do anyways. But here we didn't really
 

2535
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:58,070
do anyways. But here we didn't really
get the energy going. Okay. But um

2536
01:37:58,070 --> 01:37:58,080
get the energy going. Okay. But um
 

2537
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,149
get the energy going. Okay. But um
when you're even on the body

2538
01:38:02,149 --> 01:38:02,159
when you're even on the body
 

2539
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:04,709
when you're even on the body
I if you think about it and how we all

2540
01:38:04,709 --> 01:38:04,719
I if you think about it and how we all
 

2541
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:08,229
I if you think about it and how we all
think about tension is it's much easier

2542
01:38:08,229 --> 01:38:08,239
think about tension is it's much easier
 

2543
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:11,270
think about tension is it's much easier
to control that head you know and pull

2544
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:11,280
to control that head you know and pull
 

2545
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,510
to control that head you know and pull
on the distal end of the lever all that

2546
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:13,520
on the distal end of the lever all that
 

2547
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,629
on the distal end of the lever all that
kind of stuff but this other way is as I

2548
01:38:16,629 --> 01:38:16,639
kind of stuff but this other way is as I
 

2549
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:20,149
kind of stuff but this other way is as I
weaken your base of support right then

2550
01:38:20,149 --> 01:38:20,159
weaken your base of support right then
 

2551
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:22,070
weaken your base of support right then
that got light you're going to you're

2552
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:22,080
that got light you're going to you're
 

2553
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,830
that got light you're going to you're
going to flex on that thank you you're

2554
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:23,840
going to flex on that thank you you're
 

2555
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,550
going to flex on that thank you you're
stuck more than ever. And now the base

2556
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:26,560
stuck more than ever. And now the base
 

2557
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,870
stuck more than ever. And now the base
and everything starts going to the point

2558
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:28,880
and everything starts going to the point
 

2559
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,590
and everything starts going to the point
where now they're just here. Okay. And

2560
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:31,600
where now they're just here. Okay. And
 

2561
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,790
where now they're just here. Okay. And
now gravity is working against them. Not

2562
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:34,800
now gravity is working against them. Not
 

2563
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:39,030
now gravity is working against them. Not
gravity's working. Okay. Um

2564
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:39,040
gravity's working. Okay. Um
 

2565
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,910
gravity's working. Okay. Um
and you can do it you could do it

2566
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:41,920
and you can do it you could do it
 

2567
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:45,189
and you can do it you could do it
anywhere. So you had some good reps. And

2568
01:38:45,189 --> 01:38:45,199
anywhere. So you had some good reps. And
 

2569
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,510
anywhere. So you had some good reps. And
how much arm pressure

2570
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:47,520
how much arm pressure
 

2571
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,149
how much arm pressure
are you doing on those good reps where I

2572
01:38:50,149 --> 01:38:50,159
are you doing on those good reps where I
 

2573
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:53,430
are you doing on those good reps where I
go? How?

2574
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:53,440
go? How?
 

2575
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,270
go? How?
There's none. There's none. You had some

2576
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:55,280
There's none. There's none. You had some
 

2577
01:38:55,280 --> 01:39:00,310
There's none. There's none. You had some
good reps. There's none. Okay.

2578
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:00,320

 

2579
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:04,070

Where the technique falls apart is I'm

2580
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:04,080
Where the technique falls apart is I'm
 

2581
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,870
Where the technique falls apart is I'm
not on the good foot. That's what

2582
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:06,880
not on the good foot. That's what
 

2583
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:10,310
not on the good foot. That's what
happened. Okay.

2584
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:10,320
happened. Okay.
 

2585
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:14,870
happened. Okay.
How that happened? Multiple ways. I had

2586
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:14,880
How that happened? Multiple ways. I had
 

2587
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,790
How that happened? Multiple ways. I had
wrong foot angle. I uh shuffled into the

2588
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:18,800
wrong foot angle. I uh shuffled into the
 

2589
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:23,270
wrong foot angle. I uh shuffled into the
wrong foot angle. I um

2590
01:39:23,270 --> 01:39:23,280
wrong foot angle. I um
 

2591
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:26,550
wrong foot angle. I um
um did not absorb internalize one of the

2592
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:26,560
um did not absorb internalize one of the
 

2593
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,950
um did not absorb internalize one of the
reactionary forces and it cut through my

2594
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:28,960
reactionary forces and it cut through my
 

2595
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:32,629
reactionary forces and it cut through my
base if I flexed against it. Okay. Um

2596
01:39:32,629 --> 01:39:32,639
base if I flexed against it. Okay. Um
 

2597
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:35,109
base if I flexed against it. Okay. Um
all those things made me not midfoot

2598
01:39:35,109 --> 01:39:35,119
all those things made me not midfoot
 

2599
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:39,350
all those things made me not midfoot
ground. But if I task myself with no

2600
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:39,360
ground. But if I task myself with no
 

2601
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,270
ground. But if I task myself with no
there's a force send back to the same

2602
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:41,280
there's a force send back to the same
 

2603
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,550
there's a force send back to the same
place. Send it back to the same place.

2604
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:42,560
place. Send it back to the same place.
 

2605
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:45,189
place. Send it back to the same place.
Send it back to

2606
01:39:45,189 --> 01:39:45,199
Send it back to
 

2607
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:47,270
Send it back to
like we did this morning. Very slow and

2608
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:47,280
like we did this morning. Very slow and
 

2609
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,270
like we did this morning. Very slow and
very subtly. is just now I hear it at

2610
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:49,280
very subtly. is just now I hear it at
 

2611
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:52,790
very subtly. is just now I hear it at
the speed of light. Okay. And it is it

2612
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:52,800
the speed of light. Okay. And it is it
 

2613
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:56,629
the speed of light. Okay. And it is it
seems daunting a task because we're

2614
01:39:56,629 --> 01:39:56,639
seems daunting a task because we're
 

2615
01:39:56,639 --> 01:39:58,550
seems daunting a task because we're
thinking it's an intellectual task and

2616
01:39:58,550 --> 01:39:58,560
thinking it's an intellectual task and
 

2617
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,550
thinking it's an intellectual task and
it's not an intellectual task. So for

2618
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:00,560
it's not an intellectual task. So for
 

2619
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,070
it's not an intellectual task. So for
example

2620
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:02,080
example
 

2621
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:06,390
example
uh if we watch a baby try to walk

2622
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:06,400
uh if we watch a baby try to walk
 

2623
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:10,390
uh if we watch a baby try to walk
right is a lot of whoa whoa but no one

2624
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:10,400
right is a lot of whoa whoa but no one
 

2625
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,709
right is a lot of whoa whoa but no one
does that anymore. homeless or drunk or

2626
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:12,719
does that anymore. homeless or drunk or
 

2627
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,950
does that anymore. homeless or drunk or
something, right? No, none of us walk

2628
01:40:14,950 --> 01:40:14,960
something, right? No, none of us walk
 

2629
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,510
something, right? No, none of us walk
like that sense of precariousness,

2630
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:17,520
like that sense of precariousness,
 

2631
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,470
like that sense of precariousness,
right? So, it's more just I got to get

2632
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:20,480
right? So, it's more just I got to get
 

2633
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:23,910
right? So, it's more just I got to get
used to the this gravity,

2634
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:23,920
used to the this gravity,
 

2635
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:27,430
used to the this gravity,
this inertia and how to always keep it

2636
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:27,440
this inertia and how to always keep it
 

2637
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:28,950
this inertia and how to always keep it
balanced.

2638
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:28,960
balanced.
 

2639
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,950
balanced.
Okay. on that part.

2640
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:32,960

 

2641
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,350

What makes it a little more difficult

2642
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:35,360
What makes it a little more difficult
 

2643
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,910
What makes it a little more difficult
than walking, but not really because a

2644
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:37,920
than walking, but not really because a
 

2645
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:40,310
than walking, but not really because a
lot of people, you know, like let's say

2646
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:40,320
lot of people, you know, like let's say
 

2647
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,990
lot of people, you know, like let's say
you get older and you have some bad

2648
01:40:41,990 --> 01:40:42,000
you get older and you have some bad
 

2649
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,070
you get older and you have some bad
falls. Walking can get scary and then

2650
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:46,080
falls. Walking can get scary and then
 

2651
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:47,750
falls. Walking can get scary and then
the tension comes in or something like

2652
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:47,760
the tension comes in or something like
 

2653
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,510
the tension comes in or something like
that. Or maybe you're younger, you had a

2654
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:49,520
that. Or maybe you're younger, you had a
 

2655
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,830
that. Or maybe you're younger, you had a
terrible crash, right? Something like

2656
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:51,840
terrible crash, right? Something like
 

2657
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,870
terrible crash, right? Something like
that. You slipped on something. So, you

2658
01:40:54,870 --> 01:40:54,880
that. You slipped on something. So, you
 

2659
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,270
that. You slipped on something. So, you
know, Mary tripped on these stairs in

2660
01:40:57,270 --> 01:40:57,280
know, Mary tripped on these stairs in
 

2661
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:00,229
know, Mary tripped on these stairs in
our house and you should see her go down

2662
01:41:00,229 --> 01:41:00,239
our house and you should see her go down
 

2663
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:01,910
our house and you should see her go down
the stairs now. She can't like a

2664
01:41:01,910 --> 01:41:01,920
the stairs now. She can't like a
 

2665
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:06,709
the stairs now. She can't like a
training floor on the on the stairs.

2666
01:41:06,709 --> 01:41:06,719
training floor on the on the stairs.
 

2667
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:09,830
training floor on the on the stairs.
It's like holding on testing the

2668
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:09,840
It's like holding on testing the
 

2669
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,950
It's like holding on testing the
friction of the floor. Okay. All that's

2670
01:41:12,950 --> 01:41:12,960
friction of the floor. Okay. All that's
 

2671
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:15,189
friction of the floor. Okay. All that's
happening though is here when we're

2672
01:41:15,189 --> 01:41:15,199
happening though is here when we're
 

2673
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:18,390
happening though is here when we're
fighting is the fear sets in, the

01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:18,400
fighting is the fear sets in, the
 

2675
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,629
fighting is the fear sets in, the
tension sets in. I'm not able to

2676
01:41:20,629 --> 01:41:20,639
tension sets in. I'm not able to
 

2677
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:23,030
tension sets in. I'm not able to
internalize or stay in the moment.

2678
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:23,040

2680
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:27,040
test. That's okay.
 

2681
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:31,189
test. That's okay.
All right. um

2682
01:41:31,189 --> 01:41:31,199

 

2683
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:33,830

01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:40,229
gaining it.
You have to be able to find it to

2690
01:41:40,229 --> 01:41:40,239
You have to be able to find it to

You have to be able to find it to
technique

2692
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:41,840
technique
 

2693
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:46,070
technique
where it is different all the time

2694
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:46,080
where it is different all the time
 

2695
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,149
where it is different all the time
because the UK does different things all

2696
01:41:48,149 --> 01:41:48,159
because the UK does different things all
 

2697
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:51,910
because the UK does different things all
the time. But conceptually,

2698
01:41:51,910 --> 01:41:51,920
the time. But conceptually,
 

2699
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:55,830
the time. But conceptually,
designwise, everything is the same.

2700
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:55,840
designwise, everything is the same.
 

2701
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:59,270
designwise, everything is the same.
Because of that, you can do a keynote no

2702
01:41:59,270 --> 01:41:59,280
Because of that, you can do a keynote no
 

2703
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:02,070
Because of that, you can do a keynote no
and you could do uh one going backwards

2704
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:02,080
and you could do uh one going backwards
 

2705
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,830
and you could do uh one going backwards
and you could do the shorter versions

2706
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:03,840
and you could do the shorter versions
 

2707
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,990
and you could do the shorter versions
where I come in but everything is the

2708
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:06,000
where I come in but everything is the
 

2709
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,830
where I come in but everything is the
same.

2710
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:07,840
same.
 

2711
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:12,470
same.
Um,

2712
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:12,480

 

2713
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,149

all right. That's all I got on that.

2714
01:42:14,149 --> 01:42:14,159
all right. That's all I got on that.
 

2715
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:21,030
all right. That's all I got on that.
Questions, comments, observations.

2716
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:21,040

 

2717
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,189

I think maybe this is just part two to

2718
01:42:23,189 --> 01:42:23,199
I think maybe this is just part two to
 

2719
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:25,189
I think maybe this is just part two to
my comment I made earlier about that I

2720
01:42:25,189 --> 01:42:25,199
my comment I made earlier about that I
 

2721
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:28,310
my comment I made earlier about that I
kind of got accommodated to or used to,

2722
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:28,320
kind of got accommodated to or used to,
 

2723
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,390
kind of got accommodated to or used to,
you know, our regular training group,

2724
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:30,400
you know, our regular training group,
 

2725
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,950
you know, our regular training group,
the dojo. And there's this over the

2726
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:32,960
the dojo. And there's this over the
 

2727
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,310
the dojo. And there's this over the
course of this, there's lots of places I

2728
01:42:34,310 --> 01:42:34,320
course of this, there's lots of places I
 

2729
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,950
course of this, there's lots of places I
find I have boxes. It's like you're

2730
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:36,960
find I have boxes. It's like you're
 

2731
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,550
find I have boxes. It's like you're
telling me over and over and over that

2732
01:42:38,550 --> 01:42:38,560
telling me over and over and over that
 

2733
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,149
telling me over and over and over that
I'm leading with the foot and I think

2734
01:42:40,149 --> 01:42:40,159
I'm leading with the foot and I think
 

2735
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:41,510
I'm leading with the foot and I think
I'm correcting it, but there are things

2736
01:42:41,510 --> 01:42:41,520
I'm correcting it, but there are things
 

2737
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,189
I'm correcting it, but there are things
I'm not checking for. I'm not they're

2738
01:42:43,189 --> 01:42:43,199
I'm not checking for. I'm not they're
 

2739
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:45,189
I'm not checking for. I'm not they're
just not on the table. It's like, oh no,

2740
01:42:45,189 --> 01:42:45,199
just not on the table. It's like, oh no,
 

2741
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:47,750
just not on the table. It's like, oh no,
I have to go back further. I thought I

2742
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:47,760
I have to go back further. I thought I
 

2743
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,550
I have to go back further. I thought I
have to do more to make that not happen

2744
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:50,560
have to do more to make that not happen
 

2745
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:53,189
have to do more to make that not happen
than I was even considering.

2746
01:42:53,189 --> 01:42:53,199
than I was even considering.
 

2747
01:42:53,199 --> 01:43:04,870
than I was even considering.
Yeah. And um

2748
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:04,880

 

2749
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,629

there's always going to be this ratio

2750
01:43:06,629 --> 01:43:06,639
there's always going to be this ratio
 

2751
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:08,550
there's always going to be this ratio
between what's my training environment

2752
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:08,560
between what's my training environment
 

2753
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,790
between what's my training environment
and what's the skill that I'm producing.

2754
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:10,800
and what's the skill that I'm producing.
 

2755
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,310
and what's the skill that I'm producing.
Okay?

2756
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:12,320
Okay?
 

2757
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:15,750
Okay?
And

2758
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:15,760

 

2759
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,229

currently right now we are in that mid

2760
01:43:18,229 --> 01:43:18,239
currently right now we are in that mid
 

2761
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:20,790
currently right now we are in that mid
tier of our edition like that upper

2762
01:43:20,790 --> 01:43:20,800
tier of our edition like that upper
 

2763
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,709
tier of our edition like that upper
middle tier.

2764
01:43:22,709 --> 01:43:22,719
middle tier.

Ron's not here. Taylor's not here. Chris
 

2767
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:25,990
Ron's not here. Taylor's not here. Chris
is not here. We're in that upper middle

2768
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:26,000
is not here. We're in that upper middle
 

2769
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,470
is not here. We're in that upper middle
tier. Okay.

2770
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:28,480
tier. Okay.
 

2771
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:32,950
tier. Okay.
Um

2772
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:32,960

 

2773
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,950

we're that Why is it the upper middle

2774
01:43:34,950 --> 01:43:34,960
we're that Why is it the upper middle
 

2775
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:37,910
we're that Why is it the upper middle
tier? Because we're

2776
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:37,920
tier? Because we're
 

2777
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,229
tier? Because we're
doing degenerations,

2778
01:43:40,229 --> 01:43:40,239
doing degenerations,
 

2779
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:44,550
doing degenerations,
things like that.

2780
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:44,560

 

2781
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,790

And those things are existing not

2782
01:43:46,790 --> 01:43:46,800
And those things are existing not
 

2783
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,750
And those things are existing not
because you're overtly and consciously

2784
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:49,760
because you're overtly and consciously
 

2785
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,950
because you're overtly and consciously
going, "Fuck D." That's that's not

2786
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:52,960
going, "Fuck D." That's that's not
 

2787
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:56,629
going, "Fuck D." That's that's not
what's happening. What's happening is

2788
01:43:56,629 --> 01:43:56,639
what's happening. What's happening is
 

2789
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:59,990
what's happening. What's happening is
those egoic tendencies are coming in and

2790
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:00,000
those egoic tendencies are coming in and
 

2791
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,870
those egoic tendencies are coming in and
we're getting fine with them.

2792
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:02,880
we're getting fine with them.
 

2793
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,709
we're getting fine with them.
And then we're making without anyone

2794
01:44:04,709 --> 01:44:04,719
And then we're making without anyone
 

2795
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:07,030
And then we're making without anyone
ever saying it. No one ever says it. No

2796
01:44:07,030 --> 01:44:07,040
ever saying it. No one ever says it. No
 

2797
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,790
ever saying it. No one ever says it. No
one ever says that deal that I mentioned

2798
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:08,800
one ever says that deal that I mentioned
 

2799
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:11,430
one ever says that deal that I mentioned
earlier today, right? I'll let you see

2800
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:11,440
earlier today, right? I'll let you see
 

2801
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,990
earlier today, right? I'll let you see
control, right? I'll let you have power

2802
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:14,000
control, right? I'll let you have power
 

2803
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,070
control, right? I'll let you have power
and then you give me my desires. No one

2804
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:16,080
and then you give me my desires. No one
 

2805
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:20,709
and then you give me my desires. No one
ever has said that once. Okay?

2806
01:44:20,709 --> 01:44:20,719
ever has said that once. Okay?
 

2807
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:23,910
ever has said that once. Okay?
So, no one says it here, but our Lucas

2808
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:23,920
So, no one says it here, but our Lucas
 

2809
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:27,030
So, no one says it here, but our Lucas
kind of go ahead and do it.

2810
01:44:27,030 --> 01:44:27,040
kind of go ahead and do it.
 

2811
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:29,990
kind of go ahead and do it.
Does that make sense?

2812
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:30,000
Does that make sense?
 

2813
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,390
Does that make sense?
That's where I was mentioning how, you

2814
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:32,400
That's where I was mentioning how, you
 

2815
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,790
That's where I was mentioning how, you
know, depending on how much sleep Taylor

2816
01:44:34,790 --> 01:44:34,800
know, depending on how much sleep Taylor
 

2817
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,910
know, depending on how much sleep Taylor
gets, it seems

2818
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:37,920
gets, it seems
 

2819
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:41,189
gets, it seems
he's going to call you on it or how I go

2820
01:44:41,189 --> 01:44:41,199
he's going to call you on it or how I go
 

2821
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:43,350
he's going to call you on it or how I go
like,

2822
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:43,360
like,
 

2823
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:47,590
like,
right? Okay. Um, but what's happening

2824
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:47,600
right? Okay. Um, but what's happening
 

2825
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,390
right? Okay. Um, but what's happening
all the other times?

2826
01:44:50,390 --> 01:44:50,400
all the other times?
 

2827
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:53,830
all the other times?
You're like, "Don't throw me. I'll fall

2828
01:44:53,830 --> 01:44:53,840
You're like, "Don't throw me. I'll fall
 

2829
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,229
You're like, "Don't throw me. I'll fall
for you." You're like, "Cool. I'll have

2830
01:44:56,229 --> 01:44:56,239
for you." You're like, "Cool. I'll have
 

2831
01:44:56,239 --> 01:45:03,350
for you." You're like, "Cool. I'll have
to throw you, but I feel like

2832
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:03,360

 

2833
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:06,310

and you just can't do that. So where

2834
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:06,320
and you just can't do that. So where
 

2835
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,990
and you just can't do that. So where
where do I hang on to? This is my

2836
01:45:07,990 --> 01:45:08,000
where do I hang on to? This is my
 

2837
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,189
where do I hang on to? This is my
natural inclination as an idea and it is

2838
01:45:11,189 --> 01:45:11,199
natural inclination as an idea and it is
 

2839
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:13,590
natural inclination as an idea and it is
for human beings is you really got to

2840
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:13,600
for human beings is you really got to
 

2841
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,229
for human beings is you really got to
stick to the to the metrics that the

2842
01:45:16,229 --> 01:45:16,239
stick to the to the metrics that the
 

2843
01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:22,310
stick to the to the metrics that the
teacher is giving. So for example,

2844
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:22,320

 

2845
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,669

you today were slipping that foot and

2846
01:45:25,669 --> 01:45:25,679
you today were slipping that foot and
 

2847
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:28,310
you today were slipping that foot and
what's that effect of slipping the foot

2848
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:28,320
what's that effect of slipping the foot
 

2849
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:32,310
what's that effect of slipping the foot
that we can't afford or don't want

2850
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:32,320
that we can't afford or don't want
 

2851
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,870
that we can't afford or don't want
to go off the center. It's missing this

2852
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:34,880
to go off the center. It's missing this
 

2853
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,990
to go off the center. It's missing this
placement. Yeah, I'm not doing position.

2854
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:38,000
placement. Yeah, I'm not doing position.
 

2855
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,830
placement. Yeah, I'm not doing position.
I'm not moving the center. Okay.

2856
01:45:41,830 --> 01:45:41,840
I'm not moving the center. Okay.
 

2857
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:46,229
I'm not moving the center. Okay.
Um,

2858
01:45:46,229 --> 01:45:46,239

 

2859
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:49,189

but your teacher says

2860
01:45:49,189 --> 01:45:49,199
but your teacher says
 

2861
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:52,229
but your teacher says
don't move the foot. The whole body goes

2862
01:45:52,229 --> 01:45:52,239
don't move the foot. The whole body goes
 

2863
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:54,629
don't move the foot. The whole body goes
in. The whole center. So, let's say

2864
01:45:54,629 --> 01:45:54,639
in. The whole center. So, let's say
 

2865
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:57,109
in. The whole center. So, let's say
you're like, I don't I don't know what

2866
01:45:57,109 --> 01:45:57,119
you're like, I don't I don't know what
 

2867
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:59,350
you're like, I don't I don't know what
that feels like. I don't I don't even

2868
01:45:59,350 --> 01:45:59,360
that feels like. I don't I don't even
 

2869
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:01,910
that feels like. I don't I don't even
want to do it. You know, my bouquet

2870
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:01,920
want to do it. You know, my bouquet
 

2871
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:03,510
want to do it. You know, my bouquet
doesn't want me to do it. They were

2872
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:03,520
doesn't want me to do it. They were
 

2873
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:05,830
doesn't want me to do it. They were
going to fall anyways. But if you just

2874
01:46:05,830 --> 01:46:05,840
going to fall anyways. But if you just
 

2875
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:09,990
going to fall anyways. But if you just
made like a rule of the teacher said

2876
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:10,000
made like a rule of the teacher said
 

2877
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,950
made like a rule of the teacher said
that their center moves right away, then

2878
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:12,960
that their center moves right away, then
 

2879
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:17,030
that their center moves right away, then
eventually you won't rely on the deal if

2880
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:17,040
eventually you won't rely on the deal if
 

2881
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:20,709
eventually you won't rely on the deal if
you task yourself with this commitment.

2882
01:46:20,709 --> 01:46:20,719
you task yourself with this commitment.
 

2883
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:27,430
you task yourself with this commitment.
Okay. Um, so if you pay attention,

2884
01:46:27,430 --> 01:46:27,440

 

2885
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:30,390

every time we take advantage of the UK

2886
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:30,400
every time we take advantage of the UK
 

2887
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:34,390
every time we take advantage of the UK
who's let me do something,

2888
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:34,400

 

2889
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:37,270

if your foot still moved first, even

2890
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:37,280
if your foot still moved first, even
 

2891
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:40,149
if your foot still moved first, even
though she went flying, I still yell at

2892
01:46:40,149 --> 01:46:40,159
though she went flying, I still yell at
 

2893
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:42,790
though she went flying, I still yell at
you. You know, you have to do that. You

2894
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:42,800
you. You know, you have to do that. You
 

2895
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:45,510
you. You know, you have to do that. You
have to be that, not not my you have to

2896
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:45,520
have to be that, not not my you have to
 

2897
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:48,310
have to be that, not not my you have to
be my voice. You don't need my voice.

2898
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:48,320
be my voice. You don't need my voice.
 

2899
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,709
be my voice. You don't need my voice.
The voice was given one time and now

2900
01:46:50,709 --> 01:46:50,719
The voice was given one time and now
 

2901
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:53,189
The voice was given one time and now
that's your voice. Okay? So every time

2902
01:46:53,189 --> 01:46:53,199
that's your voice. Okay? So every time
 

2903
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:56,470
that's your voice. Okay? So every time
you go and work on this basic, that is

2904
01:46:56,470 --> 01:46:56,480
you go and work on this basic, that is
 

2905
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,790
you go and work on this basic, that is
what you're going to do. Every time the

2906
01:46:58,790 --> 01:46:58,800
what you're going to do. Every time the
 

2907
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,790
what you're going to do. Every time the
teacher says, "We're not going to 10 or

2908
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:00,800
teacher says, "We're not going to 10 or
 

2909
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,629
teacher says, "We're not going to 10 or
two, we're going to three." You only go

2910
01:47:04,629 --> 01:47:04,639
two, we're going to three." You only go
 

2911
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:08,149
two, we're going to three." You only go
to three. Even if it doesn't work, you

2912
01:47:08,149 --> 01:47:08,159
to three. Even if it doesn't work, you
 

2913
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:11,510
to three. Even if it doesn't work, you
only go to three. Okay? Because there

2914
01:47:11,510 --> 01:47:11,520
only go to three. Okay? Because there
 

2915
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:14,390
only go to three. Okay? Because there
you go. If mine counts working, they

2916
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:14,400
you go. If mine counts working, they
 

2917
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,390
you go. If mine counts working, they
fail.

2918
01:47:16,390 --> 01:47:16,400
fail.
 

2919
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:19,830
fail.
No. working is did you go to three? Does

2920
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:19,840
No. working is did you go to three? Does
 

2921
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:21,910
No. working is did you go to three? Does
that make sense? Okay. So, that's the

2922
01:47:21,910 --> 01:47:21,920
that make sense? Okay. So, that's the
 

2923
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:30,390
that make sense? Okay. So, that's the
way around it. Um,

2924
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:30,400

 

2925
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,669

and you know, from the the basketball,

2926
01:47:33,669 --> 01:47:33,679
and you know, from the the basketball,
 

2927
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:35,270
and you know, from the the basketball,
right?

2928
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:35,280
right?
 

2929
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:38,629
right?
The good shooter just has the same form

2930
01:47:38,629 --> 01:47:38,639
The good shooter just has the same form
 

2931
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:42,629
The good shooter just has the same form
all the time. Their mind is in the form,

2932
01:47:42,629 --> 01:47:42,639
all the time. Their mind is in the form,
 

2933
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:44,870
all the time. Their mind is in the form,
right? There's going to be times I got

2934
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:44,880
right? There's going to be times I got
 

2935
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,350
right? There's going to be times I got
away with it, okay? But that's not

2936
01:47:47,350 --> 01:47:47,360
away with it, okay? But that's not
 

2937
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:52,149
away with it, okay? But that's not
The SOP the SOP is what's good form? I

2938
01:47:52,149 --> 01:47:52,159
The SOP the SOP is what's good form? I
 

2939
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:54,310
The SOP the SOP is what's good form? I
stick to good form here. Good form is

2940
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:54,320
stick to good form here. Good form is
 

2941
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,870
stick to good form here. Good form is
the teacher said good form. That's what

2942
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:56,880
the teacher said good form. That's what
 

2943
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,950
the teacher said good form. That's what
you said.

2944
01:47:58,950 --> 01:47:58,960
you said.
 

2945
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:01,669
you said.
So let's say you're like

2946
01:48:01,669 --> 01:48:01,679
So let's say you're like
 

2947
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:05,350
So let's say you're like
whatever. Uh I have never found these

2948
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:05,360
whatever. Uh I have never found these
 

2949
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:11,990
whatever. Uh I have never found these
people. They don't know what to do. And

2950
01:48:11,990 --> 01:48:12,000
people. They don't know what to do. And
 

2951
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,229
people. They don't know what to do. And
all I had to say is stop doing

2952
01:48:14,229 --> 01:48:14,239
all I had to say is stop doing
 

2953
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:16,550
all I had to say is stop doing
something. Okay.

2954
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:16,560
something. Okay.
 

2955
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,189
something. Okay.
But they look just like anyone else

2956
01:48:19,189 --> 01:48:19,199
But they look just like anyone else
 

2957
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:22,790
But they look just like anyone else
that's just like any suspect on the

2958
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:22,800
that's just like any suspect on the
 

2959
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:26,790
that's just like any suspect on the
street, just like any sparring

2960
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:26,800

this is why it's so important that you
have you have a teacher and that you

2976
01:48:50,229 --> 01:48:50,239
have you have a teacher and that you
 

2977

01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:01,920
because we're contesting it. If we
 

2987
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:03,830
because we're contesting it. If we
didn't contest it just like anything

2988
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:03,840
didn't contest it just like anything
 

2989

Why wrong? Because it won't work on him.

Why wrong? Because it won't work on him.
 

3037

01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:18,880
that is resisting. It won't work on the
 

3041
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,590

person who has a totally different

person who has a totally different
 

3043

that sucks and we're not used to it, but

3046
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:29,440
that sucks and we're not used to it, but
 

3047
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,990
that sucks and we're not used to it, but
the more you adopt it, the less it

3048
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:32,000
the more you adopt it, the less it
 

3049
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:40,790
the more you adopt it, the less it
sucks.

3050
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:40,800
