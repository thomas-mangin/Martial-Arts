00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,070
hi everyone alex jen here so i'm going
to continue in this video talking about

4
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,080
to continue in this video talking about
 

5
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,990
to continue in this video talking about
training in a confined space

6
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,000
training in a confined space
 

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,950
training in a confined space
previously i talked about the bakken and

8
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:08,960
previously i talked about the bakken and
 

9
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,990
previously i talked about the bakken and
focused mainly on

10
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,000
focused mainly on
 

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,230
focused mainly on
strikes in this video i'm going to be

12
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,240
strikes in this video i'm going to be
 

13
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,030
strikes in this video i'm going to be
looking at

14
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,040
looking at
 

15
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,990
looking at
the joe and we'll be talking about

16
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
the joe and we'll be talking about
 

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,790
the joe and we'll be talking about
thrusts

18
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
thrusts
 

19
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,349
thrusts
and looking at how a confined space can

20
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,359
and looking at how a confined space can
 

21
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,150
and looking at how a confined space can
actually

22
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,160
actually
 

23
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,520
actually
help with your training

24
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:23,530

to start with let's look at chocoski

28
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000
to start with let's look at chocoski
 

29
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,470
to start with let's look at chocoski
which is a mid-level thrust a common

30
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
which is a mid-level thrust a common
 

31
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,509
which is a mid-level thrust a common
mistake

32
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
mistake
 

33
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,350
mistake
which some people make is when they're

34
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
which some people make is when they're
 

35
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,030
which some people make is when they're
in this ready position

36
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
in this ready position
 

37
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,430
in this ready position
they would actually draw their arm back

38
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
they would actually draw their arm back
 

39
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,150
they would actually draw their arm back
before

40
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
before
 

41
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,990
before
stepping forward and thrusting and

42
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
stepping forward and thrusting and
 

43
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,830
stepping forward and thrusting and
again another problem that people might

44
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:43,840
again another problem that people might
 

45
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,990
again another problem that people might
make is they might not draw their arm

46
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
make is they might not draw their arm
 

47
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,630
make is they might not draw their arm
back

48
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
back
 

49
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,110
back
but they actually step forward and then

50
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
but they actually step forward and then
 

51
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,150
but they actually step forward and then
thrust

52
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
thrust
 

53
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,270
thrust
now why why are these issues well the

54
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
now why why are these issues well the
 

55
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,869
now why why are these issues well the
first one

56
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
first one
 

57
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,510
first one
uh when we draw our arm back we're

58
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
uh when we draw our arm back we're
 

59
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,189
uh when we draw our arm back we're
actually wasting a movement here because

60
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
actually wasting a movement here because
 

61
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,790
actually wasting a movement here because
we're actually going backwards

62
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
we're actually going backwards
 

63
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,830
we're actually going backwards
to then go forwards which is a wasted

64
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
to then go forwards which is a wasted
 

65
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,869
to then go forwards which is a wasted
move

66
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
move
 

67
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,710
move
the second one although we're not moving

68
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
the second one although we're not moving
 

69
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,789
the second one although we're not moving
our arm we're actually

70
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
our arm we're actually
 

71
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,310
our arm we're actually
stepping forward we're planting our

72
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
stepping forward we're planting our
 

73
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,710
stepping forward we're planting our
weight in front which might be good for

74
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
weight in front which might be good for
 

75
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,230
weight in front which might be good for
stability but the problem is

76
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
stability but the problem is
 

77
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,630
stability but the problem is
is we're now leaving ourselves open for

78
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
is we're now leaving ourselves open for
 

79
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,429
is we're now leaving ourselves open for
an attack

80
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
an attack
 

81
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,749
an attack
before we move forward because the joe

82
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
before we move forward because the joe
 

83
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,670
before we move forward because the joe
is has still not actually

84
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
is has still not actually
 

85
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,469
is has still not actually
gone forward yet so we've got a little

86
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
gone forward yet so we've got a little
 

87
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,230
gone forward yet so we've got a little
bit of a problem there

88
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
bit of a problem there
 

89
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,749
bit of a problem there
so let's have a look at how we can fix

90
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
so let's have a look at how we can fix
 

91
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,830
so let's have a look at how we can fix
this if i use this door behind me

92
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
this if i use this door behind me
 

93
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,350
this if i use this door behind me
it could be a wall as well it doesn't

94
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
it could be a wall as well it doesn't
 

95
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,270
it could be a wall as well it doesn't
really matter but the thing is

96
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
really matter but the thing is
 

97
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,749
really matter but the thing is
i've got this object behind me which is

98
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
i've got this object behind me which is
 

99
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,670
i've got this object behind me which is
stopping me from moving my

100
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
stopping me from moving my
 

101
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,270
stopping me from moving my
arm backwards like that

102
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
arm backwards like that
 

103
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,510
arm backwards like that
i'm stood in this ready position with my

104
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
i'm stood in this ready position with my
 

105
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,630
i'm stood in this ready position with my
hand by my hip

106
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
hand by my hip
 

107
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,310
hand by my hip
the other hand is in the center of the

108
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
the other hand is in the center of the
 

109
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,710
the other hand is in the center of the
jaw in this position i want to be able

110
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
jaw in this position i want to be able
 

111
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,230
jaw in this position i want to be able
to advance forward

112
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
to advance forward
 

113
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,789
to advance forward
but without actually dropping my weight

114
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
but without actually dropping my weight
 

115
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,389
but without actually dropping my weight
forward so it's leaving me

116
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
forward so it's leaving me
 

117
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,149
forward so it's leaving me
open and then coming up so what i can do

118
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
open and then coming up so what i can do
 

119
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,350
open and then coming up so what i can do
is actually take a bit of what i'd call

120
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
is actually take a bit of what i'd call
 

121
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,389
is actually take a bit of what i'd call
an empty step

122
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
an empty step
 

123
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,630
an empty step
where i'm stepping but not actually

124
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
where i'm stepping but not actually
 

125
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,870
where i'm stepping but not actually
bringing my whole weight forward

126
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
bringing my whole weight forward
 

127
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,510
bringing my whole weight forward
as i do that and keep my hand this hand

128
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
as i do that and keep my hand this hand
 

129
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,949
as i do that and keep my hand this hand
fixed if you like

130
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
fixed if you like
 

131
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,470
fixed if you like
i'd go forward and then follow

132
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
i'd go forward and then follow
 

133
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,510
i'd go forward and then follow
up with the thrust behind so i'll show

134
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
up with the thrust behind so i'll show
 

135
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,229
up with the thrust behind so i'll show
you again

136
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
you again
 

137
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,390
you again
so in this position so as you can see

138
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
so in this position so as you can see
 

139
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,550
so in this position so as you can see
here the door actually stops me

140
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
here the door actually stops me
 

141
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,630
here the door actually stops me
from moving my arm back and then that

142
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
from moving my arm back and then that
 

143
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,390
from moving my arm back and then that
forces me to move forward

144
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
forces me to move forward
 

145
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,630
forces me to move forward
when thrusting i just need to be mindful

146
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
when thrusting i just need to be mindful
 

147
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,990
when thrusting i just need to be mindful
of not stepping forward

148
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
of not stepping forward
 

149
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,830
of not stepping forward
and planting my weight and leaving the

150
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
and planting my weight and leaving the
 

151
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,589
and planting my weight and leaving the
thrust behind so another thrust that'll

152
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
thrust behind so another thrust that'll
 

153
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,270
thrust behind so another thrust that'll
be useful to train against the wall is

154
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
be useful to train against the wall is
 

155
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,110
be useful to train against the wall is
kaiserski this is a reverse thrust where

156
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
kaiserski this is a reverse thrust where
 

157
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,070
kaiserski this is a reverse thrust where
we draw the

158
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
we draw the
 

159
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,949
we draw the
joe and thrust in this reverse grip so

160
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
joe and thrust in this reverse grip so
 

161
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,070
joe and thrust in this reverse grip so
our other hand is

162
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
our other hand is
 

163
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,750
our other hand is
turned outwards rather than being in

164
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
turned outwards rather than being in
 

165
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,070
turned outwards rather than being in
this position

166
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
this position
 

167
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,470
this position
the reason that the wall is useful in

168
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
the reason that the wall is useful in
 

169
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,750
the reason that the wall is useful in
this circumstance

170
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
this circumstance
 

171
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,990
this circumstance

their arm moves across and what happens

182
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
their arm moves across and what happens
 

183
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,790
their arm moves across and what happens
if we do this

184
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
if we do this
 

185
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,790
if we do this
is it leaves our arm exposed

186
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
is it leaves our arm exposed
 

187
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,070
is it leaves our arm exposed
particularly your elbow

so a way to get around that is by

so a way to get around that is by
 

199
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,390
so a way to get around that is by
training against the wall

200

training against the wall
 

201
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,350
training against the wall
i'll show you what i mean so when i'm in

202
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
i'll show you what i mean so when i'm in
 

203

i'll show you what i mean so when i'm in
this position my elbow

00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
this position my elbow
 

205
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,670
this position my elbow
is pressed up against the wall and this

206
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
is pressed up against the wall and this
 

207
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,470
is pressed up against the wall and this
is stopping me

208
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
is stopping me
 

209
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,430
is stopping me
moving my elbow across i then have to it

210
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
moving my elbow across i then have to it
 

211
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,589

then forces me to move my body
 

213
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,149
then forces me to move my body
offline i draw and thrust

214
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
offline i draw and thrust
 

215
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,229

okay so this is stops it moving

216
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
okay so this is stops it moving
 

217
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,550
okay so this is stops it moving
i keep it pressed against the elbow um

218
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560

helps
 

231
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,509
helps
by stopping my elbow move across the

it stops me moving my arm out

246
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
it stops me moving my arm out
 

247
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,670
it stops me moving my arm out
in this type of motion and what i need

248
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
in this type of motion and what i need
 

249
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,949
in this type of motion and what i need
to do is actually draw

250
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
to do is actually draw
 

251
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,349
to do is actually draw
through so these restrictions can really

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
through so these restrictions can really
 

253
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,949
through so these restrictions can really
help us refine our movements

254
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
help us refine our movements
 

255
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,390
help us refine our movements
and make sure that we're using our hips

256
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
and make sure that we're using our hips

for your footwork you could either
 

277
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,270
for your footwork you could either
alternate your stance or you could also

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
alternate your stance or you could also
 

279
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,510
alternate your stance or you could also
step forward if you have enough space

280
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
step forward if you have enough space

these can be linked together by changing

282
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
these can be linked together by changing
 

283
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,830
these can be linked together by changing
direction and going from a low thrust to

284
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
direction and going from a low thrust to
 

285
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,950
direction and going from a low thrust to
a high thrust

286
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
a high thrust
 

287
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,830
a high thrust
or vice versa you can also turn over the
