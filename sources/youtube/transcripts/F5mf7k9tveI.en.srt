and you see live in this corner here

30
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:48,780
and you see live in this corner here
 

31
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,370
and you see live in this corner here
this just kind of front back corner but

32
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:52,380
this just kind of front back corner but
 

33
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,700
this just kind of front back corner but
when I start to spiral I'm starting to

34
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:55,710
when I start to spiral I'm starting to
 

35
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,580
when I start to spiral I'm starting to
get behind her and I become the center

36
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:58,590
get behind her and I become the center
 

37
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,830
get behind her and I become the center
of the spiral do you guys see that as

38
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:00,840
of the spiral do you guys see that as
 

39
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,370
of the spiral do you guys see that as
opposed to if I'm out here and I start

40
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:04,380
opposed to if I'm out here and I start
 

41
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,010
opposed to if I'm out here and I start
to spiral I'm guaranteeing that I'm not

42
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:07,020
to spiral I'm guaranteeing that I'm not
 

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,720
to spiral I'm guaranteeing that I'm not
going to be the center of that spiral

44
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:08,730
going to be the center of that spiral
 

45
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,790
going to be the center of that spiral
and I have to pull her back to that same

46
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
and I have to pull her back to that same
 

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,880
and I have to pull her back to that same
condition I was in so I'm going to step

48
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:13,890
condition I was in so I'm going to step
 

49
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,990
condition I was in so I'm going to step
into this front back corner and as I

50
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
into this front back corner and as I
 

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,860
into this front back corner and as I
spiral I'm becoming the center you guys

52
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:21,870
spiral I'm becoming the center you guys
 

53
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,250
spiral I'm becoming the center you guys
all see that okay so this is same thing

54
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,260
all see that okay so this is same thing
 

55
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,699
all see that okay so this is same thing
here I can't do it out here she's behind

56
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:28,709
here I can't do it out here she's behind
 

57
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,340
here I can't do it out here she's behind
me we're kind of rotating around each

58
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:31,350
me we're kind of rotating around each
 

59
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,720
me we're kind of rotating around each
other I have to be that Center back here

60
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:37,730
other I have to be that Center back here
 

61
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:54,970
other I have to be that Center back here
so that she goes around

62
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:54,980

 

63
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:51,689

get to that back corner

64
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:51,699

 

65
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:54,909

although the technique has a brutal

00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:54,919
although the technique has a brutal
 

67
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,179
although the technique has a brutal
geometry your inside has to be easy so

68
00:04:58,179 --> 00:04:58,189
geometry your inside has to be easy so
 

69
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:01,029
geometry your inside has to be easy so
you can't you can't come here and do

70
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
you can't you can't come here and do
 

71
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,570
you can't you can't come here and do
this all hesitantly that's not any any

72
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:04,580
this all hesitantly that's not any any
 

73
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,260
this all hesitantly that's not any any
spirit so we're not architects you're

74
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,270
spirit so we're not architects you're
 

75
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,969
spirit so we're not architects you're
going external but you have to have all

76
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:12,979
going external but you have to have all
 

77
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,409
