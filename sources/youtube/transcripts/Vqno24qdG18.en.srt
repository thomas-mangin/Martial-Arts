1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,430

okay so we have this uh concept and IO

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:08,440
okay so we have this uh concept and IO
 

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,470
okay so we have this uh concept and IO
that and just use my phrase so the

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:11,480
that and just use my phrase so the
 

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,910
that and just use my phrase so the
spiral rotating

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
spiral rotating
 

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,310
spiral rotating
cross sometimes they just say rotating

8
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:16,320
cross sometimes they just say rotating
 

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,029
cross sometimes they just say rotating
cross but uh spiral rotating is is the

10
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
cross but uh spiral rotating is is the
 

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,550
cross but uh spiral rotating is is the
best way of understanding spiral

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:23,560
best way of understanding spiral
 

13
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,910
best way of understanding spiral
rotation um of course this will have

14
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:26,920
rotation um of course this will have
 

15
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,950
rotation um of course this will have
some physical properties but it is not

16
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
some physical properties but it is not
 

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,990
some physical properties but it is not
entirely a physical statement about

18
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
entirely a physical statement about
 

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,709
entirely a physical statement about
reality okay um this is a metaphysical

20
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
reality okay um this is a metaphysical
 

21
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,430
reality okay um this is a metaphysical
concept um and you should know that from

22
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
concept um and you should know that from
 

23
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,510
concept um and you should know that from
the simple fact that what you're

24
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:42,520
the simple fact that what you're
 

25
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,189
the simple fact that what you're
rotating is uh Yin and yangong and Yin

26
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:46,199
rotating is uh Yin and yangong and Yin
 

27
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:48,510
rotating is uh Yin and yangong and Yin
and yangong does not exist in physical

28
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:48,520
and yangong does not exist in physical
 

29
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,069
and yangong does not exist in physical
reality Yin and yangong has uh physical

30
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:53,079
reality Yin and yangong has uh physical
 

31
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,510
reality Yin and yangong has uh physical
manifestations but the yin and yang

32
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
manifestations but the yin and yang
 

33
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,590
manifestations but the yin and yang
itself does not exist in reality it is a

34
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:58,600
itself does not exist in reality it is a
 

35
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,670
itself does not exist in reality it is a
metaphysical concept

36
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:00,680
metaphysical concept
 

37
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,429
metaphysical concept
okay um so we have to keep that in mind

38
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:04,439
okay um so we have to keep that in mind
 

39
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,230
okay um so we have to keep that in mind
and they're just representatives of Yin

40
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:07,240
and they're just representatives of Yin
 

41
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,870
and they're just representatives of Yin
and Y in a simple form you you have this

42
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:11,880
and Y in a simple form you you have this
 

43
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,870
and Y in a simple form you you have this
okay and as I've mentioned before this

44
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
okay and as I've mentioned before this
 

45
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,230
okay and as I've mentioned before this
pattern or some variation of this

46
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:17,240
pattern or some variation of this
 

47
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,950
pattern or some variation of this
pattern that there's one side of reality

48
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:21,960
pattern that there's one side of reality
 

49
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,350
pattern that there's one side of reality
or the cosmos and another side of the

50
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,360
or the cosmos and another side of the
 

51
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,910
or the cosmos and another side of the
cosmos is just Universal along the Silk

52
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
cosmos is just Universal along the Silk

materiality uh so on the west side of

92
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
materiality uh so on the west side of
 

93
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,550
materiality uh so on the west side of
the Silk Road you would have for example

94
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
the Silk Road you would have for example
 

95
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,430
the Silk Road you would have for example
uh God the god concept uh on the east

96
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:48,440
uh God the god concept uh on the east
 

97
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,550
uh God the god concept uh on the east
side of the Silk Road you would have

98
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
side of the Silk Road you would have
 

99
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,750
side of the Silk Road you would have
heaven or you would have Dow um even a

100
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
heaven or you would have Dow um even a
 

101
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,270

described um sequentially so the Dow

110
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
described um sequentially so the Dow
 

111
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,350
described um sequentially so the Dow
existed first and then yin and yang came

112
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:10,360
existed first and then yin and yang came
 

113
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,470

from the doubt for example but the

from the doubt for example but the

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,789
from the doubt for example but the
understanding is more like a a kind of

understanding is more like a a kind of
 

117
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,110
understanding is more like a a kind of
pulsating so the da manifest the yin and

118
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,120
pulsating so the da manifest the yin and
 

119
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,190

ritual is that process of undoing Yin

136
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
ritual is that process of undoing Yin
 

137
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,550
ritual is that process of undoing Yin
and yangong returning to the Dow State

138
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
and yangong returning to the Dow State
 

139
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,390
and yangong returning to the Dow State
and then REM manifesting Yin and yangong

140

universe is split up into dichotomy so

164
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:29,800
universe is split up into dichotomy so
 

165
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,510
universe is split up into dichotomy so
the purest state is the god State the

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:32,520
the purest state is the god State the

the purest state is the god State the
Dow State the heaven State hence for

168
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,280
Dow State the heaven State hence for
 

169
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,749
Dow State the heaven State hence for
Sensei these are misogi which is

170
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:38,759
Sensei these are misogi which is
 

171
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,029
Sensei these are misogi which is
purification rituals

172
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:41,039
purification rituals
 

173
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,990
purification rituals
okay uh and the way that you you undo

174
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,000
okay uh and the way that you you undo
 

175
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,469
okay uh and the way that you you undo
this is in essence you destabilize them

176
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:49,479
this is in essence you destabilize them
 

177
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:52,310
this is in essence you destabilize them
by spiral rotating them that in their

178
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
by spiral rotating them that in their
 

179
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,790
by spiral rotating them that in their
purest ideal State they want to act in

180
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:55,800
purest ideal State they want to act in
 

181
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,909
purest ideal State they want to act in
this dichotomous relationship so they're

182
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
this dichotomous relationship so they're
 

183
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,189
this dichotomous relationship so they're
kind of two things one's horizontal

184
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:02,199
kind of two things one's horizontal
 

185
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,070
kind of two things one's horizontal
one's vertical and the way to

186
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
one's vertical and the way to
 

187
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,790
one's vertical and the way to
destabilize the dichotomy here is you're

188
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
destabilize the dichotomy here is you're
 

189
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,749
destabilize the dichotomy here is you're
going to spiral rotate and as you spiral

190
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
going to spiral rotate and as you spiral
 

191
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,310
going to spiral rotate and as you spiral
rotate uh it's hard for them to remain

192
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
rotate uh it's hard for them to remain
 

193
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,950
rotate uh it's hard for them to remain
in their pure dichotomous State and

194
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
in their pure dichotomous State and
 

195
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,189
in their pure dichotomous State and
eventually uh they break apart okay and

196
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:18,199
eventually uh they break apart okay and
 

197
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,350
eventually uh they break apart okay and
you return to a dow state or a zero

198
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,360
you return to a dow state or a zero
 

199
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,469
you return to a dow state or a zero
state or however you want to describe

200
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:23,479
state or however you want to describe
 

201
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:27,029
state or however you want to describe
that okay

202
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039

 

203
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,830

so when we look at keto

204
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:30,840
so when we look at keto
 

205
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,629
so when we look at keto
keaza and we're going to look from above

211
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,830
capacity here so any of you uh patrons
you have any access to 3D modeling on a

212
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
you have any access to 3D modeling on a
 

213
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,150
you have any access to 3D modeling on a
computer yeah go for it okay uh your

214
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:49,160
computer yeah go for it okay uh your
 

215
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,189
computer yeah go for it okay uh your
iido geometry your iido

216
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:52,199
iido geometry your iido
 

217
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,110
iido geometry your iido
Kona tactical geometry is is going to be

218
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
Kona tactical geometry is is going to be
 

219
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,390
Kona tactical geometry is is going to be
taking this shape you you and uh UK take

220
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:01,400
taking this shape you you and uh UK take
 

221
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,029
taking this shape you you and uh UK take
on this shape you you have this kind of

222
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:04,039
on this shape you you have this kind of
 

223
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:05,469
on this shape you you have this kind of
spiral

224
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:05,479
spiral
 

225
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,350
spiral
okay and uh on that spiral so we're

226
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
okay and uh on that spiral so we're
 

227
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,390
okay and uh on that spiral so we're
going to just look

228
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:13,400

 

229
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,629

at will you throw that in

230
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639

 

231
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,629

the we'll just take a section of that

232
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:21,639
the we'll just take a section of that
 

233
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,469
the we'll just take a section of that
line

234
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
line
 

235
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:34,350
line
okay on this shape here here's that line

236
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:34,360

 

237
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,830

aside from both UK and N doing this

238
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:36,840
aside from both UK and N doing this
 

239
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,390
aside from both UK and N doing this
we're now going to take a section of

240
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
we're now going to take a section of
 

241
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,990
we're now going to take a section of
that line and we're only going to look

242
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,000
that line and we're only going to look
 

243
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,309
that line and we're only going to look
at uh UK's body on that line okay so

244
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
at uh UK's body on that line okay so
 

245
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,270
at uh UK's body on that line okay so
here's that section on the line and

246
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:48,280
here's that section on the line and
 

247
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,550
here's that section on the line and
we're going to look at UK's body on that

248
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
we're going to look at UK's body on that
 

249
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,589
we're going to look at UK's body on that
line we'll represent his his

250
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
line we'll represent his his
 

251
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,790
line we'll represent his his
spine uh with another line and here we

252
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
spine uh with another line and here we
 

253
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,029
spine uh with another line and here we
see that we have that cross position

254
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:00,039
see that we have that cross position
 

255
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:05,909
see that we have that cross position
so here's UK's head and here's UK's feet

256
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
so here's UK's head and here's UK's feet
 

257
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,589
so here's UK's head and here's UK's feet
okay and here is UK's center of

258
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
okay and here is UK's center of
 

259
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,230
okay and here is UK's center of
gravity and we do want to understand it

260
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
gravity and we do want to understand it
 

261
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,110
gravity and we do want to understand it
that way at this level at this point it

262
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
that way at this level at this point it
 

263
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,790
that way at this level at this point it
it is the physical center of gravity

264
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:19,800
it is the physical center of gravity
 

265
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,390
it is the physical center of gravity
don't get all crazy with is it the Hara

266
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
don't get all crazy with is it the Hara
 

267
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,270
don't get all crazy with is it the Hara
is it the tonden don't it it does not

268
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
is it the tonden don't it it does not
 

269
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,189
is it the tonden don't it it does not
make sense to talk about the lower

270
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:28,199
make sense to talk about the lower
 

271
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,110
make sense to talk about the lower
tonden and as if the actual physical

272
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
tonden and as if the actual physical
 

273
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,350
tonden and as if the actual physical
center of gravity is not contained

274
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
center of gravity is not contained
 

275
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,990
center of gravity is not contained
therein when we're talking about

276
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
therein when we're talking about
 

277
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,790
therein when we're talking about
throwing architectures it is so we're

278
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
throwing architectures it is so we're
 

279
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,550
throwing architectures it is so we're
talking about the physical center of

280
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:43,560
talking about the physical center of
 

281
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,950
talking about the physical center of
gravity

282
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:45,960
gravity
 

283
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,950
gravity
okay UK's

284
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
okay UK's
 

285
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,670
okay UK's
posture is as you can see a microcosmic

286
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
posture is as you can see a microcosmic
 

287
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,629
posture is as you can see a microcosmic
representation of the dichotomous

288
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:57,639
representation of the dichotomous
 

289
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,869
representation of the dichotomous
manifestation of the Dow meaning I have

290
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
manifestation of the Dow meaning I have
 

291
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,749
manifestation of the Dow meaning I have
uh a center but the center only exists

292
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:06,759
uh a center but the center only exists
 

293
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,149
uh a center but the center only exists
because the two ends exist okay and that

294
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:11,159
because the two ends exist okay and that
 

295
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,350
because the two ends exist okay and that
makes up ukas

296
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
makes up ukas
 

297
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,710
makes up ukas
posture and what we're going to do along

298
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
posture and what we're going to do along
 

299
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,629
posture and what we're going to do along
the

300
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:17,639
the
 

301
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,469
the
technique is start to tilt ukas posture

302
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:23,479
technique is start to tilt ukas posture
 

303
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,149
technique is start to tilt ukas posture
so this is that line This is that line

304
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:28,159
so this is that line This is that line
 

305
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,310
so this is that line This is that line
in a moment in time when UK's

306
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:31,320
in a moment in time when UK's
 

307
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,709
in a moment in time when UK's
posture is in perfect Triune alignment

308
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:35,719
posture is in perfect Triune alignment
 

309
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,709
posture is in perfect Triune alignment
so the head is in a relationship with

310
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
so the head is in a relationship with
 

311
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,509
so the head is in a relationship with
the

312
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
the
 

313
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,269
the
feet and over the feet on the other side

314
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
feet and over the feet on the other side
 

315
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,670
feet and over the feet on the other side
of the center of gravity but at

316
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
of the center of gravity but at
 

317
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,430
of the center of gravity but at
different points this

318
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:48,440
different points this
 

319
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,310
different points this
line starts to look like this this

320
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
line starts to look like this this
 

321
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,470
line starts to look like this this
relationship okay and you were just

322
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:55,480
relationship okay and you were just
 

323
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,910
relationship okay and you were just
turning

324
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
turning
 

325
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,509
turning
it over

326
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:00,519
it over
 

327
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,389
it over
as you're going

328
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:02,399
as you're going
 

329
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,470
as you're going
okay so that that is why it's not just a

330
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
okay so that that is why it's not just a
 

331
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,030
okay so that that is why it's not just a
spiral it's on the spiral UK is rotating

332
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,040
spiral it's on the spiral UK is rotating
 

333
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,389
spiral it's on the spiral UK is rotating
you

334
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:13,399
you
 

335
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,910
you
see um that's why I use spiral rotation

336
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:18,920
see um that's why I use spiral rotation
 

337
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,670
see um that's why I use spiral rotation
okay at a certain

338
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
okay at a certain
 

339
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,190
okay at a certain
point on this now we go back onto this

340
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
point on this now we go back onto this
 

341
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,949
point on this now we go back onto this
spiral and you can't imagine that uh UK

342
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
spiral and you can't imagine that uh UK
 

343
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,829
spiral and you can't imagine that uh UK
is UK's lever is starting to change

344
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
is UK's lever is starting to change
 

345
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,470
is UK's lever is starting to change

relationship with this thing as it's
 

347
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,069

okay at a certain point because of

350
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:42,440
okay at a certain point because of
 

351
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,150
okay at a certain point because of
especially because of the centrifugal

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,160
especially because of the centrifugal
 

353
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,110
especially because of the centrifugal
and centripetal forces so you have Force

354
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,120
and centripetal forces so you have Force
 

355
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,790
and centripetal forces so you have Force
going out and you have Force going in

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
going out and you have Force going in
 

357
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,110
going out and you have Force going in
because we're guiding them on the

this structure of UK what I mean by is

362
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,200
this structure of UK what I mean by is
 

363
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,190
this structure of UK what I mean by is
the relationship between the head and

364
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
the relationship between the head and
 

365
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,910
the relationship between the head and
the feet being a center becomes

366
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
the feet being a center becomes
 

367
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,030
the feet being a center becomes
radically or radically

368
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
radically or radically
 

369
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,710
radically or radically
destabilized okay and they start to go

370
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
destabilized okay and they start to go
 

371
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,509
destabilized okay and they start to go
in different directions this one goes

372
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
in different directions this one goes
 

373
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,710
in different directions this one goes
there this one goes there this one goes

374
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:23,720
there this one goes there this one goes
 

375
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,550
there this one goes there this one goes
there for example because the the makeup

376
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
there for example because the the makeup
 

377
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,310
there for example because the the makeup
of this thing

378
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
of this thing
 

379
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,910
of this thing
disassembles in this ritual you

380
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
disassembles in this ritual you
 

381
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,389
disassembles in this ritual you
see and

382
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
see and
 

383
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,430
see and
uh this means UK's head is going in one

384
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
uh this means UK's head is going in one
 

385
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,670
uh this means UK's head is going in one
vector UK's Center is going in a to

386
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:44,680
vector UK's Center is going in a to
 

387
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,990
vector UK's Center is going in a to
entirely different vector and UK's feet

388
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
entirely different vector and UK's feet
 

389
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,629
entirely different vector and UK's feet
is going in an entirely different Vector

390
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:50,639
is going in an entirely different Vector
 

391
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,110
is going in an entirely different Vector
altoe okay and this is when finally a

392
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
altoe okay and this is when finally a
 

393
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,750
altoe okay and this is when finally a
actual human body is being

394
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
actual human body is being
 

395
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,629
actual human body is being
thrown as opposed to a choreographed UK

396
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:02,639
thrown as opposed to a choreographed UK
 

397
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,230
thrown as opposed to a choreographed UK
so a choreographed UK never loses this

398
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,240
so a choreographed UK never loses this
 

399
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,710
so a choreographed UK never loses this
relationship but anytime UK has this

400
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
relationship but anytime UK has this
 

401
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,389
relationship but anytime UK has this
relationship UK is in control UK has

402
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
relationship UK is in control UK has
 

403
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,190
relationship UK is in control UK has
form we want to undo it we want to

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
form we want to undo it we want to
 

405
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,750
form we want to undo it we want to
return it back to its pre-form state

406
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:20,760
return it back to its pre-form state
 

407
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,150
return it back to its pre-form state
okay and this is where you actually have

408
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
okay and this is where you actually have
 

409
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,590
okay and this is where you actually have
a full-on deconstruction of hookus

410
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:26,600
a full-on deconstruction of hookus
 

411
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,230
a full-on deconstruction of hookus

413
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,670
posture they're being physically thrown
uh some of you have noted how our

414
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
uh some of you have noted how our
 

415
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,110
uh some of you have noted how our
UK uh can't take the regular ukami some

416
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
UK uh can't take the regular ukami some
 

417
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,870
UK uh can't take the regular ukami some
of you are working uh or don't take the

418
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:39,880
of you are working uh or don't take the
 

419
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,870
of you are working uh or don't take the
regular ukami some of you are working

420
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:41,880
regular ukami some of you are working
 

421
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,670
regular ukami some of you are working
with your

422
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
with your
 

423
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,509
with your
UK without training them in this kind of

424
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
UK without training them in this kind of
 

425
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,389
UK without training them in this kind of
ukemi I'm about to show you and you

426
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:49,399
ukemi I'm about to show you and you
 

427
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,310
ukemi I'm about to show you and you
realize they can't do the fall um and

428
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:53,320
realize they can't do the fall um and
 

429
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,150
realize they can't do the fall um and
they know they can't do the fall so they

430
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,160
they know they can't do the fall so they
 

431
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,310
they know they can't do the fall so they
try to pull out of the technique all

432
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:57,320
try to pull out of the technique all
 

433
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,870
try to pull out of the technique all
kinds of things like that happen okay

434
00:11:59,870 --> 00:11:59,880
kinds of things like that happen okay
 

435
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,190
kinds of things like that happen okay
uh in short the modern UK is just

436
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,200
uh in short the modern UK is just
 

437
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,829
uh in short the modern UK is just
not familiar with a dismantling of this

438
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839
not familiar with a dismantling of this

not familiar with a dismantling of this
Yin Yong makeup between the head the

440
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:12,839
Yin Yong makeup between the head the
 

441
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,230
Yin Yong makeup between the head the
center and the feet okay but we want to

442
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
center and the feet okay but we want to
 

443
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,389
center and the feet okay but we want to
we want to understand that so uh that's

444
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
we want to understand that so uh that's
 

445
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,509
we want to understand that so uh that's
what we're going to do today this is how

446
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:22,519
what we're going to do today this is how
 

447
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,189
what we're going to do today this is how
everyone should be

448
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:24,199
everyone should be
 

449
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:26,750
everyone should be
rolling and uh we'll just work at the

450
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:26,760
rolling and uh we'll just work at the
 

451
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,870
rolling and uh we'll just work at the
forward roll if again we have a a a

452
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:31,880
forward roll if again we have a a a
 

453
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,189
forward roll if again we have a a a
member board with a ranking and you

454
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:35,199
member board with a ranking and you
 

455
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,110
member board with a ranking and you
could plot for who rolls this

456
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
could plot for who rolls this
 

457
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,110
could plot for who rolls this
way and who does not roll This Way those

458
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
way and who does not roll This Way those
 

459
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,110
way and who does not roll This Way those
who roll this way are at the higher uh

460
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,120
who roll this way are at the higher uh
 

461
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,990
who roll this way are at the higher uh
Rank and those who do not roll this way

462
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,000
Rank and those who do not roll this way
 

463
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,590
Rank and those who do not roll this way
are at the lower rank that is um the way

464
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
are at the lower rank that is um the way
 

465
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,790
are at the lower rank that is um the way
it works out because rank here is

466
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:55,800
it works out because rank here is
 

467
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,750
it works out because rank here is
dependent upon who can take who can me

468
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:58,760
dependent upon who can take who can me
 

469
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,069
dependent upon who can take who can me
and who cannot take a kemy because you

470
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
and who cannot take a kemy because you
 

471
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,389
and who cannot take a kemy because you
can only

472
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:03,399
can only
 

473
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,509
can only
receive what you can receive so

474
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:06,519
receive what you can receive so
 

475
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,990
receive what you can receive so
transmission is entirely dependent upon

476
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,000
transmission is entirely dependent upon
 

477
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,310
transmission is entirely dependent upon
your ability to receive and so skill is

478
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
your ability to receive and so skill is
 

479
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,030
your ability to receive and so skill is
dependent upon transmission hence rank

480
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,040
dependent upon transmission hence rank
 

481
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,189
dependent upon transmission hence rank
as we understand it here okay so this

482
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:19,199
as we understand it here okay so this
 

483
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,470
as we understand it here okay so this
gives us opportunity for our people to

484
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
gives us opportunity for our people to
 

485
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,030
gives us opportunity for our people to
go back over on how to roll and this

486
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,040
go back over on how to roll and this
 

487
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,230
go back over on how to roll and this
gives you opportunity a very important

488
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:29,240
gives you opportunity a very important
 

489
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,629
gives you opportunity a very important
one that if you're going to take our

490
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
one that if you're going to take our
 

491
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,829
one that if you're going to take our
throwing

492
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
throwing
 

493

the purification ritual uh that comes

510
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:54,199
the purification ritual uh that comes
 

511
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:57,389
the purification ritual uh that comes
from this ritual of eternal return where

512
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:57,399
from this ritual of eternal return where
 

513
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,269
from this ritual of eternal return where
you have Yin and y you undo yin and

514
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
you have Yin and y you undo yin and
 

515
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,910
you have Yin and y you undo yin and
yangong and then you end up back with

516
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
yangong and then you end up back with
 

517
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,150
yangong and then you end up back with
yin and yangong okay all

518
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
yin and yangong okay all
 

519
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,069

right okay here we have his uh we'll

520
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:13,079
right okay here we have his uh we'll
 

521
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,910
right okay here we have his uh we'll
just call it Jong in this case and then

522
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
just call it Jong in this case and then
 

523
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,629
just call it Jong in this case and then
we have the center and then we have the

524
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
we have the center and then we have the
 

525
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,749
we have the center and then we have the
yin his feet and this gives an order

526
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:21,759
yin his feet and this gives an order
 

527
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,269
yin his feet and this gives an order
this is a order a concentric order of

528
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:24,279
this is a order a concentric order of
 

529
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,790
this is a order a concentric order of
the whole manifestation of the universe

the whole manifestation of the universe
 

531
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,470
the whole manifestation of the universe
and what we want to do is undo this

532
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:29,480
and what we want to do is undo this
 

533
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,150
and what we want to do is undo this
order okay and he's going to experience

534
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,160
order okay and he's going to experience
 

535
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,990
order okay and he's going to experience
that through his body mind he he's going

536
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
that through his body mind he he's going
 

537
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,949
that through his body mind he he's going
to feel the order of his body and then

538
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
to feel the order of his body and then
 

539
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,710
to feel the order of his body and then
of his body mind and then he's going to

540
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
of his body mind and then he's going to
 

541
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,350
of his body mind and then he's going to
feel the the the disorder of it okay so

542
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:44,360
feel the the the disorder of it okay so
 

543
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,790
feel the the the disorder of it okay so
he experiences this ritual of eternal

544
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
he experiences this ritual of eternal
 

545
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,269
he experiences this ritual of eternal
return from that point of view okay um

546
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
return from that point of view okay um
 

547
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,030
return from that point of view okay um
and this is why true KY as I just

548
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,040
and this is why true KY as I just
 

549
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,949
and this is why true KY as I just
defined it is terrifying because he has

550
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
defined it is terrifying because he has
 

551
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,870
defined it is terrifying because he has
to undo himself uh it's a kind of little

552
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
to undo himself uh it's a kind of little
 

553
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,509
to undo himself uh it's a kind of little
death there the kind of death that

554
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:02,519
death there the kind of death that
 

555
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,710
death there the kind of death that
happens for UK every single time they're

556
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:05,720
happens for UK every single time they're
 

557
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,509
happens for UK every single time they're
thrown uh This Way um and that's the

558
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:09,519
thrown uh This Way um and that's the
 

559
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,710
thrown uh This Way um and that's the
ritual you see it's a ritual of freedom

560
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:11,720
ritual you see it's a ritual of freedom
 

561
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,670
ritual you see it's a ritual of freedom
from self there a kind of death that

562
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
from self there a kind of death that
 

563
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,910
from self there a kind of death that
happens okay and at the physical level

564
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:16,920
happens okay and at the physical level
 

565
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,470
happens okay and at the physical level
it happens because this order is going

566
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:19,480
it happens because this order is going
 

567
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,990
it happens because this order is going
to reach that destabilization state

568
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
to reach that destabilization state
 

569
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,910
to reach that destabilization state
where these things these three things go

570
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
where these things these three things go
 

571
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,550
where these things these three things go
in different directions okay um so

572
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:31,560

 

573
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,150

when what we're going to end up doing

574
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
when what we're going to end up doing
 

575
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,949
when what we're going to end up doing
I'll kind of demonstrate this is he we

576
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
I'll kind of demonstrate this is he we
 

577
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,829
I'll kind of demonstrate this is he we
would be on that spiral shape any

578
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:39,839
would be on that spiral shape any
 

579
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,550
would be on that spiral shape any
portion of it okay and we're just

580
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,560
portion of it okay and we're just
 

581
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,389
portion of it okay and we're just
working with the forward Emi that the

582
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:45,399
working with the forward Emi that the
 

583
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,509
working with the forward Emi that the
head is moving uh

584
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:48,519
head is moving uh
 

585
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:51,550
head is moving uh
along and with the inward D the inward

586
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:51,560
along and with the inward D the inward
 

587
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,670
along and with the inward D the inward
Force the um cental Force okay on that

588
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
Force the um cental Force okay on that
 

589
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,629
Force the um cental Force okay on that
spiral

590
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
spiral
 

591
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,550
spiral
shape the leg is moving

592
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:01,560
shape the leg is moving
 

593
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,430
shape the leg is moving
outwardly this way

594
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:06,440

 

595
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,990

okay so there is this kind of spin here

596
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
okay so there is this kind of spin here
 

597
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,030
okay so there is this kind of spin here
that's happening on his

598
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,040
that's happening on his
 

599
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,430
that's happening on his
body and if we just look at his

600
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
body and if we just look at his
 

601
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,509
body and if we just look at his
body the way it is eventually that

602
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
body the way it is eventually that
 

603
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,910
body the way it is eventually that
rotation is going to take his line of

604
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
rotation is going to take his line of
 

605
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,230
rotation is going to take his line of
gravity outside the Bas of support of

606
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
gravity outside the Bas of support of
 

607
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,150
gravity outside the Bas of support of
that

608
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
that
 

609
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,749
that
foot but what the technique does also

610
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:29,759
foot but what the technique does also
 

611
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,189
foot but what the technique does also
differently is it's going to take the

612
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:32,199
differently is it's going to take the
 

613
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,949
differently is it's going to take the
line of gravity and cut it usually we

614
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
line of gravity and cut it usually we
 

615
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,269
line of gravity and cut it usually we
have this angle I'm sorry the center

616
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:40,279
have this angle I'm sorry the center
 

617
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,910
have this angle I'm sorry the center
gravity usually this angle or this angle

618
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
gravity usually this angle or this angle
 

619
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,870
gravity usually this angle or this angle
okay uh is what you end up doing so his

620
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:47,880
okay uh is what you end up doing so his
 

621
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,710
okay uh is what you end up doing so his
Center gravity is going to go that way

622
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
Center gravity is going to go that way
 

623
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,590
Center gravity is going to go that way
on a line his foot is on a

624
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:54,600
on a line his foot is on a
 

625
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,629
on a line his foot is on a
curve going that way and his head is on

626
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
curve going that way and his head is on
 

627
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,029
curve going that way and his head is on
a curve going this way okay so

628
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:04,039
a curve going this way okay so
 

629
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:06,549
a curve going this way okay so
uh you're just going to push his foot on

630
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
uh you're just going to push his foot on
 

631
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,789
uh you're just going to push his foot on
the curve when I say go

632
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:09,799
the curve when I say go
 

633
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:13,669
the curve when I say go
go that's what we're doing okay you

634
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
go that's what we're doing okay you
 

635
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,350
go that's what we're doing okay you
increase the momentum you increase the

636
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:16,360
increase the momentum you increase the
 

637
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,470
increase the momentum you increase the
inertia and it's impossible for someone

638
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:19,480
inertia and it's impossible for someone
 

639
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,189
inertia and it's impossible for someone
to stand okay that's what we're doing

640
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:22,199
to stand okay that's what we're doing
 

641
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,390
to stand okay that's what we're doing
there um what we have to do differently

642
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
there um what we have to do differently
 

643
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,590
there um what we have to do differently
in the

644
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
in the
 

645
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,549
in the
end is is he will be dismantled in his

646
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
end is is he will be dismantled in his
 

647
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,230
end is is he will be dismantled in his
posture but he will refine his posture

648
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
posture but he will refine his posture
 

649
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,310
posture but he will refine his posture
and imp particular he's going to find it

650
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:39,320
and imp particular he's going to find it
 

651
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,150
and imp particular he's going to find it
on this arm for the forward roll but

652
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:43,160
on this arm for the forward roll but
 

653
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,390
on this arm for the forward roll but
different from the normal roll is this

654
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
different from the normal roll is this
 

655
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,909
different from the normal roll is this
hand touches the the mat on the other

656
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:50,919
hand touches the the mat on the other
 

657
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,510
hand touches the the mat on the other
side of the circle of the forward roll

658
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
side of the circle of the forward roll
 

659
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,630
side of the circle of the forward roll
okay so I'll demonstrate that so uh if

660
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:57,640
okay so I'll demonstrate that so uh if
 

661
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,830
okay so I'll demonstrate that so uh if
you have a forward roll

662
00:17:59,830 --> 00:17:59,840
you have a forward roll
 

663
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,470
you have a forward roll
a lot of people will touch the mat on

664
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,480
a lot of people will touch the mat on
 

665
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,110
a lot of people will touch the mat on
the positive side of the forward roll

666
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
the positive side of the forward roll
 

667
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,789
the positive side of the forward roll
and it looks something like

668
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799

 

669
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,430

this what we have to do is touch the mat

670
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:14,440
this what we have to do is touch the mat
 

671
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,149
this what we have to do is touch the mat
on the negative side of the forward

672
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:17,159
on the negative side of the forward
 

673
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:20,510
on the negative side of the forward
R I'm on the other side of the circle

674
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:20,520
R I'm on the other side of the circle
 

675
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,950
R I'm on the other side of the circle
that is when I start to restructure the

676
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:22,960
that is when I start to restructure the
 

677
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,110
that is when I start to restructure the
relationship between my head my center

678
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
relationship between my head my center
 

679
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,830
relationship between my head my center
and my feet okay so if you watch my UK

680
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:28,840
and my feet okay so if you watch my UK
 

681
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,230
and my feet okay so if you watch my UK
that I'm legitimately

682
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:31,240
that I'm legitimately
 

683
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,430
that I'm legitimately
throwing they kind of have to let these

684
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:34,440
throwing they kind of have to let these
 

685
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,950
throwing they kind of have to let these
things pull

686
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:35,960
things pull
 

687
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,909
things pull
apart and they'll find that arm on the

688
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
apart and they'll find that arm on the
 

689
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,190
apart and they'll find that arm on the
negative side of the circle take it back

690
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
negative side of the circle take it back
 

691
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,029
negative side of the circle take it back
into that unyong relationship through

692
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:46,039
into that unyong relationship through
 

693
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,110
into that unyong relationship through
the center so we have to roll a certain

694
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,120
the center so we have to roll a certain
 

695
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,870
the center so we have to roll a certain
way to be able to find the arm on the

696
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
way to be able to find the arm on the
 

697
00:18:50,880 --> 00:19:13,870
way to be able to find the arm on the
negative side of the circle okay

698
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:13,880

 

699
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,510

so here's drill

700
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
so here's drill
 

701
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,230
so here's drill
one in drill one we're going to organize

702
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:19,240
one in drill one we're going to organize
 

703
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,630
one in drill one we're going to organize
the body and we start out with this

704
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:21,640
the body and we start out with this
 

705
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,630
the body and we start out with this
right angle with our

706
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:23,640
right angle with our
 

707
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,789
right angle with our
legs your lead leg is pointed exactly

708
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:27,799
legs your lead leg is pointed exactly
 

709
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,230
legs your lead leg is pointed exactly
straight this is incorrect this kind of

710
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:31,240
straight this is incorrect this kind of
 

711
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,750
straight this is incorrect this kind of
tilt that you have there

712
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
tilt that you have there
 

713
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,710
tilt that you have there
straight this leg no 90° you want these

714
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:39,720
straight this leg no 90° you want these
 

715
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,470
straight this leg no 90° you want these
strict um XY AIS going okay and on drill

716
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
strict um XY AIS going okay and on drill
 

717
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,909
strict um XY AIS going okay and on drill
one I start to get used to building the

718
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:46,919
one I start to get used to building the
 

719
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,549
one I start to get used to building the
relationship between the head the center

720
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:50,559
relationship between the head the center
 

721
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,549
relationship between the head the center
and the feet okay my hand comes down

722
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
and the feet okay my hand comes down
 

723
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,029
and the feet okay my hand comes down
usually your heel Palm straight

724
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
usually your heel Palm straight
 

725
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,070
usually your heel Palm straight
underneath your shoulder or near

726
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,080
underneath your shoulder or near
 

727
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,669
underneath your shoulder or near
thereabouts I don't know where you have

728
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:00,679
thereabouts I don't know where you have
 

729
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:02,430
thereabouts I don't know where you have
to move to show that

730
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:02,440
to move to show that
 

731
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,830
to move to show that
camera and your

732
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:05,840
camera and your
 

733
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,750
camera and your
knee is in alignment with your heel Palm

734
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
knee is in alignment with your heel Palm
 

735
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,909
knee is in alignment with your heel Palm
but is what's important is that your

736
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
but is what's important is that your
 

737
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,669
but is what's important is that your
this is a natural position for your hand

738
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:14,679
this is a natural position for your hand
 

739
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,190
this is a natural position for your hand
because the only thing this hand is

740
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:16,200
because the only thing this hand is
 

741
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,830
because the only thing this hand is
doing is creating a kind of training

742
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
doing is creating a kind of training
 

743
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,270
doing is creating a kind of training
balance like training wheels so we don't

744
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
balance like training wheels so we don't
 

745
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,950
balance like training wheels so we don't
want it out here we don't want it out

746
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:22,960
want it out here we don't want it out
 

747
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,029
want it out here we don't want it out
here we don't want it out here it's just

748
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:25,039
here we don't want it out here it's just
 

749
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,149
here we don't want it out here it's just
so you can have some sort of guide rail

750
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:29,159
so you can have some sort of guide rail
 

751
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,110
so you can have some sort of guide rail
stair rail where you can now balance on

752
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
stair rail where you can now balance on
 

753
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,270
stair rail where you can now balance on
this leg okay and here you start to

754
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,280
this leg okay and here you start to
 

755
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,390
this leg okay and here you start to
develop that relationship between your

756
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
develop that relationship between your
 

757
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,789
develop that relationship between your
head and feet which means your every

758
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:43,799
head and feet which means your every
 

759
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:47,510
head and feet which means your every
time your foot moves your head goes down

760
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
time your foot moves your head goes down
 

761
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,190
time your foot moves your head goes down
head moves foot goes down so foot up

762
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,200
head moves foot goes down so foot up
 

763
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,149
head moves foot goes down so foot up
head down head up foot down what you

764
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:54,159
head down head up foot down what you
 

765
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,149
head down head up foot down what you
don't want is this this is incorrect

766
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:58,159
don't want is this this is incorrect
 

767
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,510
don't want is this this is incorrect
this this is has no Center to it because

768
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:01,520
this this is has no Center to it because
 

769
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,549
this this is has no Center to it because
the extremities are acting independently

770
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
the extremities are acting independently
 

771
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,510
the extremities are acting independently
so drill one just hang out

772
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:08,520
so drill one just hang out
 

773
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:20,549
so drill one just hang out
here back

774
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:20,559

 

775
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,710

down okay we'll try drill one some uh

776
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:24,720
down okay we'll try drill one some uh
 

777
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,590
down okay we'll try drill one some uh
common mistakes at this point already is

778
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:28,600
common mistakes at this point already is
 

779
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,230
common mistakes at this point already is
to use the support hand as if it's going

780
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:31,240
to use the support hand as if it's going
 

781
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,350
to use the support hand as if it's going
to be there in the technique it will not

782
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
to be there in the technique it will not
 

783
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,950
to be there in the technique it will not
be there in the technique okay um

784
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
be there in the technique okay um
 

785
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,310
be there in the technique okay um
relatedly is a will for control that's

786
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,320
relatedly is a will for control that's
 

787
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,630
relatedly is a will for control that's
why they want to use that hand okay

788
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:43,640
why they want to use that hand okay
 

789
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,430
why they want to use that hand okay
they're not going to find that control

790
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:46,440
they're not going to find that control
 

791
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,430
they're not going to find that control
and relatedly to this will for control

792
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
and relatedly to this will for control
 

793
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,230
and relatedly to this will for control
is that they're going to try to touch

794
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:51,240
is that they're going to try to touch
 

795
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,350
is that they're going to try to touch
the ground on the positive side of the

796
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
the ground on the positive side of the
 

797
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,990
the ground on the positive side of the
circle but they they won't be there at

798
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
circle but they they won't be there at
 

799
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,830
circle but they they won't be there at
that point on the positive side of the

800
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:57,840
that point on the positive side of the
 

801
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,630
that point on the positive side of the
circle which is the throwing part of the

802
00:21:59,630 --> 00:21:59,640
circle which is the throwing part of the
 

803
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,310
circle which is the throwing part of the
circle there are

804
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,320
circle there are
 

805
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,149
circle there are
disassembled this is why you my lesser

806
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:06,159
disassembled this is why you my lesser
 

807
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,390
disassembled this is why you my lesser
skilled ukas can't take this is they're

808
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
skilled ukas can't take this is they're
 

809
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,669
skilled ukas can't take this is they're
trying to look for the contact with the

810
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:10,679
trying to look for the contact with the
 

811
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,390
trying to look for the contact with the
mat on the positive side of the circle

812
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:13,400
mat on the positive side of the circle
 

813
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,510
mat on the positive side of the circle
which means they're trying to not be

814
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:15,520
which means they're trying to not be
 

815
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,310
which means they're trying to not be
disassembled okay why because of the

816
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,320
disassembled okay why because of the
 

817
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,510
disassembled okay why because of the
fear attachment that comes to the the

818
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:20,520
fear attachment that comes to the the
 

819
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,029
fear attachment that comes to the the
self being dis disassembled okay so

820
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:24,039
self being dis disassembled okay so
 

821
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:27,110
self being dis disassembled okay so
sometimes that's going to make um

822
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,120
sometimes that's going to make um
 

823
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,710
sometimes that's going to make um

837
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,830
to touch anything in fact okay just just
that you're trying to work on this

838

that you're trying to work on this
 

839
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,470
that you're trying to work on this
relationship trying to balance here okay

840
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:51,480
relationship trying to balance here okay

so careful that you're trying to widen

842
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,440
so careful that you're trying to widen
 

843
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,830
so careful that you're trying to widen
your base because that's the positive

844
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
your base because that's the positive
 

845
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,070
your base because that's the positive
side of the circle relatedly let's say

846
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
side of the circle relatedly let's say
 

847
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,549
side of the circle relatedly let's say
you do put your hand here but you put

848
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:00,559
you do put your hand here but you put
 

849
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,950
you do put your hand here but you put
this shoulder down so you're actually

this shoulder down so you're actually
 

851
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,710
this shoulder down so you're actually
using it the shoulders down when I'm

852
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:05,720
using it the shoulders down when I'm
 

853
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,669
using it the shoulders down when I'm
doing it you can see that shoulder goes

854
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
doing it you can see that shoulder goes
 

855
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,830
doing it you can see that shoulder goes
up so I'm not here like this the

856
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:09,840
up so I'm not here like this the
 

857
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,350
up so I'm not here like this the
shoulder is up I'm more sideways as I'm

858
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:12,360
shoulder is up I'm more sideways as I'm
 

859
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,350
shoulder is up I'm more sideways as I'm
doing this more sideways so you can be

860
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
doing this more sideways so you can be
 

861
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,350
doing this more sideways so you can be
light light and your balance is more on

be able to see on this drill is of
 

927
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,750
be able to see on this drill is of
course no head on the mat uh you don't

928
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:10,760
course no head on the mat uh you don't
 

929
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,510
course no head on the mat uh you don't
want to have your head on the mat uh but

two is you're going to have to emphasize
 

933
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,029
two is you're going to have to emphasize
the opening of that of that rear

934
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:19,039
the opening of that of that rear
 

935
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,430
the opening of that of that rear
shoulder um and not keep it down and as

936

shoulder um and not keep it down and as
 

937
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,590
shoulder um and not keep it down and as
a result you're going to end up looking

938
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:26,600
a result you're going to end up looking
 

939
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,789
a result you're going to end up looking
around that balance a guide rail arm so

940
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
around that balance a guide rail arm so
 

941
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,830
around that balance a guide rail arm so
my head doesn't doesn't look through

942

my head doesn't doesn't look through
 

943
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,750
my head doesn't doesn't look through
here I'm going to end up looking around

944
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:36,760
here I'm going to end up looking around
 

945
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,230
here I'm going to end up looking around
that arm so I'm looking around that

946

arm looking around the
 

949
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,269
arm looking around the
arm okay because my feet and my head and

950
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
arm okay because my feet and my head and
 

951
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,230

um what we are accomplishing already at

954
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,360
um what we are accomplishing already at
 

955
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,590
um what we are accomplishing already at
this point is that my head my my head

956
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:58,600
this point is that my head my my head
 

957
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,389
this point is that my head my my head
shoulder area is no longer in the same

958
00:26:02,389 --> 00:26:02,399
shoulder area is no longer in the same
 

959
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:05,269
shoulder area is no longer in the same
plane as my hips and that is very

960
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:05,279
plane as my hips and that is very
 

961
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,710
plane as my hips and that is very
important okay so as I'm doing drill two

962
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:08,720
important okay so as I'm doing drill two
 

963
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,510
important okay so as I'm doing drill two
and if I do a normal fedorite forward

964
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,520
and if I do a normal fedorite forward
 

965
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,070
and if I do a normal fedorite forward
roll when I'm here like this do this

966
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,080
roll when I'm here like this do this
 

967
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,310
roll when I'm here like this do this
kind of stuff there's the positive uh

968
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,320
kind of stuff there's the positive uh
 

969
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,269
kind of stuff there's the positive uh
aspect of the circle where I'm putting

970
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:19,279
aspect of the circle where I'm putting
 

971
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,630

weight and I have weight here uh my hips
are following my shoulders even if I

974
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:25,279
are following my shoulders even if I
 

975
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,389
are following my shoulders even if I
have a slight diagonal they're basically

976
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:28,399

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,430
the front foot and then we complete
it being ready to do it again okay try

1142
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:25,440
it being ready to do it again okay try
 

1143
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,950
it being ready to do it again okay try
it uh there's a lot of L problems right

1144
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:28,960
it uh there's a lot of L problems right
 

1145
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,190
it uh there's a lot of L problems right
now and this is the the dangerous part

1146
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,200
now and this is the the dangerous part
 

1147
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,470
now and this is the the dangerous part
or the the the the inefficient part of

1148
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:34,480
or the the the the inefficient part of
 

1149
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,549
or the the the the inefficient part of
teaching

1150
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:35,559
teaching
 

1151
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:40,590
teaching
this um one for example is that we have

1152
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:40,600
this um one for example is that we have
 

1153
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,669
this um one for example is that we have
that guard rail but that this and you're

1154
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:42,679
that guard rail but that this and you're
 

1155
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:45,269
that guard rail but that this and you're
going to put weight on it that's a false

1156
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279
going to put weight on it that's a false
 

1157
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,950
going to put weight on it that's a false
problem because you're not going to have

1158
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:46,960
problem because you're not going to have
 

1159
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,669
problem because you're not going to have
that arm in the throat um the other

1160
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:50,679
that arm in the throat um the other
 

1161
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:51,990
that arm in the throat um the other
problem

1162
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,000
problem
 

1163
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,950
problem
is this uh this closing of the knees

1164
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:55,960
is this uh this closing of the knees
 

1165
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,470
is this uh this closing of the knees
like kind of thing that's a false

1166
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:57,480
like kind of thing that's a false
 

1167
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,350
like kind of thing that's a false
problem to you won't be able to close

1168
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,360
problem to you won't be able to close
 

1169
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,950
problem to you won't be able to close
your knees that will only affect how

1170
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:00,960
your knees that will only affect how
 

1171
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,710
your knees that will only affect how
well you are at coming back together at

1172
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:02,720
well you are at coming back together at
 

1173
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,549
well you are at coming back together at
the end okay uh so basically you crash

1174
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:06,559
the end okay uh so basically you crash
 

1175
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,310
the end okay uh so basically you crash
it's a false

1176
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320
it's a false
 

1177
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,149
it's a false
problem uh also your your

1178
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:12,159
problem uh also your your
 

1179
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,789
problem uh also your your
uh the uh the positive side of the

1180
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:15,799
uh the uh the positive side of the
 

1181
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,590
uh the uh the positive side of the
circle your your beginner is going to

1182
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:17,600
circle your your beginner is going to
 

1183
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,269
circle your your beginner is going to
want to do that no matter how much you

1184
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:20,279
want to do that no matter how much you
 

1185

want to do that no matter how much you
tell them they are balancing with the

1186
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:23,440
tell them they are balancing with the
 

1187
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,909
tell them they are balancing with the
two hands as opposed to with the head

1188
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:26,919
two hands as opposed to with the head
 

1189
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,430
two hands as opposed to with the head
Center foot relationship okay and so

1190
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:30,440
Center foot relationship okay and so
 

1191
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,710
Center foot relationship okay and so
they kind of put pressure on that arm or

1192
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:34,720
they kind of put pressure on that arm or
 

1193
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,470
they kind of put pressure on that arm or
they uh put pressure on the shoulder

1194
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:37,480
they uh put pressure on the shoulder
 

1195
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,629
they uh put pressure on the shoulder
they use the shoulder uh as the positive

1196
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:40,639
they use the shoulder uh as the positive
 

1197
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,549
they use the shoulder uh as the positive
side of the circle to replace the arm

1198
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:42,559
side of the circle to replace the arm
 

1199
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,269
side of the circle to replace the arm
but that is also a false problem okay

1200
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:45,279
but that is also a false problem okay
 

1201
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,750
but that is also a false problem okay
you have to make sure that you're doing

1202

might seem like to some people that well

1208
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,320
might seem like to some people that well
 

1209
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,310

I'd rather put weight on the arm so I

1210
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:01,320
I'd rather put weight on the arm so I
 

1211
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,549
I'd rather put weight on the arm so I
could roll over that and not the

could roll over that and not the
 

1213
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,310
could roll over that and not the
shoulder and this is what I mean by it's

1214

shoulder and this is what I mean by it's
 

1215
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,549
shoulder and this is what I mean by it's
a false problem you're not going to have

1216
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:07,559
a false problem you're not going to have
 

1217
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,149
a false problem you're not going to have
your shoulder your shoulder is going to

1218
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:09,159
your shoulder your shoulder is going to
 

1219
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:12,269
your shoulder your shoulder is going to
be underneath when we throw you which is

1220
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:12,279
be underneath when we throw you which is
 

1221
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,990
be underneath when we throw you which is
why you can only touch the mat on the

1222
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,000
why you can only touch the mat on the
 

1223
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,110
why you can only touch the mat on the
negative side of the circle you have no

1224
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,120
negative side of the circle you have no
 

1225
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,990
negative side of the circle you have no
chance of crashing on your shoulder when

1226
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,000
chance of crashing on your shoulder when
 

1227
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,950
chance of crashing on your shoulder when
we throw you okay it's just a matter of

1228
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:21,960
we throw you okay it's just a matter of
 

1229
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,389
we throw you okay it's just a matter of
how you will land is the diff is the

1230
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
how you will land is the diff is the
 

1231
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,590
how you will land is the diff is the
question if you're going through the air

1232
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:26,600
question if you're going through the air
 

1233
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,629
question if you're going through the air
and it's not on your shoulder okay

you're you get Whiplash and your head
 

1239
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:39,149
you're you get Whiplash and your head
hits the M okay um so and make sure that

1240
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:39,159
hits the M okay um so and make sure that
 

1241
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:41,269
hits the M okay um so and make sure that
you're going to lower that shoulder and

not crash on that shoulder that's
 

1245
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,070
not crash on that shoulder that's

doing it correctly will actually find
 

1381
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,150
doing it correctly will actually find
this easier to do because there's no uh

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,109
there for you in the throw uh which will
have you crash and land

1414
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:51,119
have you crash and land
 

1415
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,630
have you crash and land
improperly uh then you can't take Camy

1416
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:53,640
improperly uh then you can't take Camy
 

1417
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,950
improperly uh then you can't take Camy
then the art can't be transmitted to you

1418
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:55,960
then the art can't be transmitted to you
 

1419
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,990
then the art can't be transmitted to you
and you are where you are okay uh what

1420
00:39:58,990 --> 00:39:59,000
and you are where you are okay uh what
 

1421
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,430
and you are where you are okay uh what
they will find is this is even this is

1422
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:01,440
they will find is this is even this is
 

1423
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,230
they will find is this is even this is
scarier okay because you won't have that

1424
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,240
scarier okay because you won't have that
 

1425
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,270
scarier okay because you won't have that
so um it looks something like this

1426
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:07,280
so um it looks something like this
 

1427
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,430
so um it looks something like this
everything's exactly the

00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:28,200
because my hips keep going to the
 

1439
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,990
because my hips keep going to the
outside of each line you should be doing

1440
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:31,000
outside of each line you should be doing
 

1441
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,550
outside of each line you should be doing
that anyone who's rolling straight East

1442
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:34,560
that anyone who's rolling straight East
 

1443
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,510
that anyone who's rolling straight East
West the entire time wasn't doing this

1444
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:37,520
West the entire time wasn't doing this
 

1445
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,589
West the entire time wasn't doing this
correctly okay all right let's try that

1446
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:40,599
correctly okay all right let's try that
 

1447
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:42,589
correctly okay all right let's try that
all right here's a drill

1448
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:42,599
all right here's a drill
 

1449
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,190
all right here's a drill
5.1 okay because at this point you can

1450
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,200
5.1 okay because at this point you can
 

1451
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,870
5.1 okay because at this point you can
stick in the arm finding and using the

1452
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:49,880
stick in the arm finding and using the
 

1453
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,670
stick in the arm finding and using the
negative side of the circle so he's

1454
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:52,680
negative side of the circle so he's
 

1455
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,309
negative side of the circle so he's
going to do drill five but not put that

1456
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:55,319
going to do drill five but not put that
 

1457
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,470
going to do drill five but not put that
shoulder down

1458
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:57,480
shoulder down
 

1459
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,430
shoulder down
okay and he'll hit the mat on the
