understand energy transfers we're
 

311
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,470
understand energy transfers we're
now just doing energy transfer still

312
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
now just doing energy transfer still
 

313
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,829
now just doing energy transfer still
okay

314
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839

then when you you feel it because it

536
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
then when you you feel it because it
 

537
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,230
then when you you feel it because it
doesn't look like it when you feel it

538
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
doesn't look like it when you feel it
 

539
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,389
doesn't look like it when you feel it
you're like okay that he wasn't bracing

540
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399
you're like okay that he wasn't bracing
 

541
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,430
you're like okay that he wasn't bracing
i'm just grabbing air there's a place

non-contestation functions okay

548
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
non-contestation functions okay
 

549
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,509
non-contestation functions okay
so

550
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519

okay so you can reverse engineer if the

782
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
okay so you can reverse engineer if the
 

783
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,789
okay so you can reverse engineer if the
guy is doing cookie noggin

784
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:06,799
guy is doing cookie noggin
 

785
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,350
guy is doing cookie noggin
then the has to do what

786
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
then the has to do what
 

787
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,750
then the has to do what
he has to keep coming in so when you go

788
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:11,760
he has to keep coming in so when you go
 

789
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,510
he has to keep coming in so when you go
scaredy can't you get

790
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,520
scaredy can't you get
 

791
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,750
scaredy can't you get
and you're not coming in anymore

792
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:15,760
and you're not coming in anymore
 

793
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,430
and you're not coming in anymore
then he's not doing a technique that

794
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,440
then he's not doing a technique that
 

795
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,789
then he's not doing a technique that
makes sense

796
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
makes sense
 

797
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,149
makes sense
do you understand

798
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:20,159
do you understand
 

799
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,789
do you understand
so uke has to come in

800
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:22,799
so uke has to come in
 

801
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,350
so uke has to come in
just like we can have to pull down and

802
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
just like we can have to pull down and
 

803
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,270
just like we can have to pull down and
you're gonna have to stay still

804
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,280
you're gonna have to stay still
 

805
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,590
you're gonna have to stay still
because we're doing energy transfer so

806
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
because we're doing energy transfer so
 

807
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,909
because we're doing energy transfer so
you have to give the energy

808
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:31,919
you have to give the energy
 

809
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,590
you have to give the energy
so we transfer it

810
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:34,600
so we transfer it
 

811
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,870
so we transfer it
logically okay

812
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
logically okay
 

813
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,789
logically okay
you can't be afraid

814
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:38,799
you can't be afraid
 

815
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,110
you can't be afraid
you can't go slow

816
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
you can't go slow
 

817
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,669
you can't go slow
but you have to move in

818
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
but you have to move in
 

819
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,950
but you have to move in
got it

820
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:44,960

do you see that
 

829
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,510
do you see that
because of what he did not do so for to

830
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
because of what he did not do so for to
 

831
