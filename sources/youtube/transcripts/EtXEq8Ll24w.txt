we never don't go around there they
force you about
[Music]
you can feel under here
hi
[Music]
down inside down
[Music]
we don't picture you take the bus
they're coming in my opening which meant
you weren't responding last time who are
dancing there were 40 brats
don't be choreographed you don't do
anything but penetrate the targets with
the required grip go
[Music]
don't go to the fight at all
[Music]
make your comment inside a little of
life see it's here
should it corrected it back you're going
to still do this same fade opening right
let's go
like you cross the line right
[Music]
all these guess what why don't we keep
this nasal opening we keep working on
that so I can show here right you see
but not for rude ah I'm gonna have to do
it quicker oh I could fade more little
then around
Lucille tempo let's do it quick wide
oh let's do that oh let's try that to go
I'll shed on the hill yo somos control
[Music]
so the less skin you have in the group
town let's slow down elbow tunicate
under your control
[Music]
that's a lot of young
[Music]
around the energy so once this door
opens that's why we hated it
so I neutralize the risk and I step to
them
now I'm gonna bring the elbow to me then
I go make sure that it comes to me by
going it going to it but that elbow
parts this thing will comes in almost it
elbow comes in and it goes around we're
up
[Music]

it slows you down
