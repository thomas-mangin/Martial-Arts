and what footwork is in height up there

10
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:24,269
and what footwork is in height up there
 

11
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,210
and what footwork is in height up there
are just a few basic steps we use in

12
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:26,220
are just a few basic steps we use in
 

13
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,830
are just a few basic steps we use in
Aikido and if you memorize those basic

00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:39,719
kamae or on me stance we're either going
 

27
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,139
kamae or on me stance we're either going
to be or Tsuyoshi so that's a sliding

28
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:42,149
to be or Tsuyoshi so that's a sliding
 

29

walking step forward or tin con and
 

33
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,340
walking step forward or tin con and
that's turning around there's also a chi

34
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:49,350
that's turning around there's also a chi
 

35
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,840
that's turning around there's also a chi
co shoe which is kind of an about-face

36
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:50,850
co shoe which is kind of an about-face
 

37
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,340
co shoe which is kind of an about-face
and we're gonna talk about Chi she a

38
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:52,350
and we're gonna talk about Chi she a
 

39
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,990
and we're gonna talk about Chi she a
little bit too but other than that

00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
little bit too but other than that
 

41
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,850
little bit too but other than that
everything is just a combination of

42
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:55,860
everything is just a combination of
 

43
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,069
everything is just a combination of
those footwork steps so I can't really

44
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
those footwork steps so I can't really
 

45
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,349
those footwork steps so I can't really
has a small set of footwork and once you

46
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:00,359
has a small set of footwork and once you
 

47
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,549
has a small set of footwork and once you
master that small set of footwork you

48
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:01,559
master that small set of footwork you
 

49
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,529
master that small set of footwork you
can apply it to absolutely anything you

50
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:03,539
can apply it to absolutely anything you
 

51
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,570
can apply it to absolutely anything you
can do so we're gonna cover those right

52
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:05,580
can do so we're gonna cover those right
 

53
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,250
can do so we're gonna cover those right

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,310
if those the basic thought patterns he's
going to use all the time pretty much no

84
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
going to use all the time pretty much no

foot now when I first learned Aikido the

90
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:52,649
foot now when I first learned Aikido the
 

91
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:55,850
foot now when I first learned Aikido the
style we used we didn't have a word for

92
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:55,860

93
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,100
style we used we didn't have a word for
Tsuyoshi so when I first came across

94
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,110
Tsuyoshi so when I first came across
 

95
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,690
Tsuyoshi so when I first came across
like Peter Sal's using the word tsuki ah

96
00:01:59,690 --> 00:01:59,700
like Peter Sal's using the word tsuki ah
 

97

98
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:01,649
she was like that's a godsend because I
 

99
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,020
she was like that's a godsend because I
always had a hard time telling my

100
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,030
always had a hard time telling my
 

101
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,940
always had a hard time telling my
students to go like this instead of like

102
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:04,950
students to go like this instead of like
 

103
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,859
students to go like this instead of like
this so we'd be doing some technique and

104
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:06,869
this so we'd be doing some technique and
 

105
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,300
this so we'd be doing some technique and
I would say step forward and they'd go

106
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,310
I would say step forward and they'd go
 

107
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,570
I would say step forward and they'd go
like this oh not that one do it

108
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:10,580
like this oh not that one do it
 

109
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,760
like this oh not that one do it
sliding step portals so if you have

110
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:12,770
sliding step portals so if you have
 

111
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,770
sliding step portals so if you have
terminology for most sukiyaki and they

112
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:14,780
terminology for most sukiyaki and they
 

113
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,540
terminology for most sukiyaki and they
you mean Oishi it makes like a lot

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:16,550
you mean Oishi it makes like a lot
 

115
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,860
you mean Oishi it makes like a lot
easier when you're explain to your

116
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:17,870
easier when you're explain to your
 

117
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,210
easier when you're explain to your
students or as a student when you're

118
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:19,220
students or as a student when you're
 

119
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,130
students or as a student when you're
conveying to your since a what it is you

120
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:21,140
conveying to your since a what it is you
 

121
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,480
conveying to your since a what it is you
want to talk about so sudhi ash's

122
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,490
want to talk about so sudhi ash's
 

123
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,540
want to talk about so sudhi ash's
sliding step a you me ah she is walking

124
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:25,550
sliding step a you me ah she is walking
 

125
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,610
sliding step a you me ah she is walking
step 10 Kahn is a turn so Josh turns

126
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:30,620
step 10 Kahn is a turn so Josh turns
 

127
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,880
step 10 Kahn is a turn so Josh turns
around perfect and of course he could do

128
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:33,890
around perfect and of course he could do
 

129
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,800
around perfect and of course he could do
those from either side and Acacia she is

130
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:35,810
those from either side and Acacia she is
 

131
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,560
those from either side and Acacia she is
an about-face just like that right so

132
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:38,570
an about-face just like that right so
 

133
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,360
an about-face just like that right so
he's just flipping his feet over now we

134
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,370
he's just flipping his feet over now we
 

135
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,950
he's just flipping his feet over now we
can put these in any series of

136
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:41,960
can put these in any series of
 

137
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,260
can put these in any series of
combination we want so for example josh

138
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,270
combination we want so for example josh
 

139
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,560
combination we want so for example josh
can do a city ahi followed by a ten Khan

140
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:46,570
can do a city ahi followed by a ten Khan
 

141
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,000
can do a city ahi followed by a ten Khan
so his front foot slides in and they

142
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,010
so his front foot slides in and they
 

143
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,530
so his front foot slides in and they
just attend Khan he can also do an A you

144
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:50,540
just attend Khan he can also do an A you
 

145
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,210
just attend Khan he can also do an A you
mean ah she followed by ten Khan and

146
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:52,220
mean ah she followed by ten Khan and
 

147
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,980
mean ah she followed by ten Khan and
that's really common for IQ to work

148
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:53,990
that's really common for IQ to work
 

149
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,540
that's really common for IQ to work
we'll talk about that one later that's a

150
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:55,550
we'll talk about that one later that's a
 

151
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,980
we'll talk about that one later that's a
very special step it's called the

152
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:56,990
very special step it's called the
 

153
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,330
very special step it's called the
two-step in a lot of schools or the

154
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:58,340
two-step in a lot of schools or the
 

155
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,949
two-step in a lot of schools or the
eating meat in Khan it's a very very

156
00:02:59,949 --> 00:02:59,959
eating meat in Khan it's a very very
 

157
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,810
eating meat in Khan it's a very very
