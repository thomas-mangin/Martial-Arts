work two points of a
lever it is

186
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,000
lever it is
 

187
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,830
lever it is
incorrect there's only one single pivot

incorrect there's only one single pivot
 

189
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,990
incorrect there's only one single pivot
point and it is his

190
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
point and it is his
 

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,950
point and it is his
spine okay so I he comes in oh you're

192
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
spine okay so I he comes in oh you're
 

193
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,670
spine okay so I he comes in oh you're
not going to hook here do you see that

194
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:36,680
not going to hook here do you see that
 

195
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,749
not going to hook here do you see that
not going to hook here and use these two

not going to hook here and use these two
 

197
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,070
not going to hook here and use these two
points to turn

198
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080

 

199
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,270

them you will not do I'm On Top I'm

200

I'm on top or maybe I'm grabbing and you

204
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:55,560
I'm on top or maybe I'm grabbing and you
 

205
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,309
I'm on top or maybe I'm grabbing and you
come around

00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319

 

207
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,430

here the only way you can do that is you

208
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
here the only way you can do that is you
 

209
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,710
here the only way you can do that is you
start breaking all kinds of other

210
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:03,720
start breaking all kinds of other
 

211
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,469
start breaking all kinds of other
correct forms so if I here and I can use

212
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
correct forms so if I here and I can use
 

213
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,029
correct forms so if I here and I can use
this lever then my Center is in the

214
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:12,039
this lever then my Center is in the
 

215
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,830
this lever then my Center is in the
middle of my hands and I am not in back

216
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:14,840
middle of my hands and I am not in back
 

217
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,230
middle of my hands and I am not in back
of him I'm on the side of

show you how he goes by
 

223
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,749
show you how he goes by
me okay so you have the first yield but

224
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
me okay so you have the first yield but
 

225
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,230
me okay so you have the first yield but
he's trying to grab we're stuck okay and

226
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
he's trying to grab we're stuck okay and
 

227
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,829
he's trying to grab we're stuck okay and
when I do the kazushi it's moving him

228
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:40,839
when I do the kazushi it's moving him
 

229
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,590
when I do the kazushi it's moving him
with the adhesion

230
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:44,600

 

231
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,790

boom then the other hand picks it up the

232
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:47,800
boom then the other hand picks it up the
 

233
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,470
boom then the other hand picks it up the
other hand is going to pick up that

234
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
other hand is going to pick up that
 

235
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,990
other hand is going to pick up that
adhesion uh on the turn so I am going to

236
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,000
adhesion uh on the turn so I am going to
 

237
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,190
adhesion uh on the turn so I am going to
add to it and that turn

238
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,200
add to it and that turn
 

239
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,630
add to it and that turn
that so one I'm bringing him in I'm

also what I'm doing here
is

274
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
is
 

275
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,110
is
uh you you you would smell he's so close

uh you you you would smell he's so close
 

277
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,389
uh you you you would smell he's so close
he's so

278
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:07,399
he's so
 

279
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,590
he's so
close so if I just go here this

280
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
close so if I just go here this
 

281
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,870
close so if I just go here this
superficial surface contest a contact he

282
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
superficial surface contest a contact he
 

283
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,310
superficial surface contest a contact he
can go over and

284
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:17,320
can go over and
 

285
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,350
can go over and
grab but if I have the

286
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:20,360
grab but if I have the
 

287
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,389
grab but if I have the
adhesion he he will not find that easy

288
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:23,399
adhesion he he will not find that easy
 

289
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,590
adhesion he he will not find that easy
he can't get off of that

290
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
he can't get off of that
 

291
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,030
he can't get off of that
friction he

292
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,040
friction he
 

293
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,509
friction he
goes I'm just passing it same thing he

294
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
goes I'm just passing it same thing he
 

295
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,470
goes I'm just passing it same thing he
can't go out either oh he's stuck into

296
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
can't go out either oh he's stuck into
 

297
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,230
can't go out either oh he's stuck into
it

298
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,240

 

299
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,470

oh so when you see the contact on his

300
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:43,480
oh so when you see the contact on his
 

301
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,790
oh so when you see the contact on his
arm when I come around here it's the

302
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
arm when I come around here it's the
 

303
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,069
arm when I come around here it's the
same thing I'm not just here touching

304
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:51,079
same thing I'm not just here touching
 

305
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:55,030
same thing I'm not just here touching
him here it's stuck so as he goes

306
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
him here it's stuck so as he goes
 

307
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,710
him here it's stuck so as he goes
forward he's feeling huge friction

308
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:57,720
forward he's feeling huge friction
 

309
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,350
forward he's feeling huge friction
that's why we're stuck together and as I

310
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:00,360
that's why we're stuck together and as I
 

311
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,269
that's why we're stuck together and as I
move around we're going to see that this

312
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:05,279
move around we're going to see that this
 

313
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,710
move around we're going to see that this
hand picks up that Ike

314
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
hand picks up that Ike
 

315
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,389
hand picks up that Ike
adhesion just like this hand has

316
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
adhesion just like this hand has
 

317
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,509
adhesion just like this hand has
adhesion and it starts to go and now

318
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
adhesion and it starts to go and now
 

319
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,069
adhesion and it starts to go and now
it's going to go off you see that's why

320
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:19,079
it's going to go off you see that's why
 

321
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,910
it's going to go off you see that's why
Kitty gash works like that over here but

322
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
Kitty gash works like that over here but
 

323
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,150
Kitty gash works like that over here but
now this hand is going to pick it up

324
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
now this hand is going to pick it up
 

325
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,710
now this hand is going to pick it up
before that happens now this hand is

326
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
before that happens now this hand is
 

327
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,829
before that happens now this hand is
sticking here okay and now as you go

328
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
sticking here okay and now as you go
 

329
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,030
sticking here okay and now as you go
around and you enter behind him you're

330
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
around and you enter behind him you're
 

331
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,949
around and you enter behind him you're
going to find that it's hard to do the

332
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:35,959
going to find that it's hard to do the
 

333
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:38,829
going to find that it's hard to do the
adhesion there it went past its Yin

334
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:38,839
adhesion there it went past its Yin
 

335
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,350
adhesion there it went past its Yin
phase that's where this hand comes in so

336
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:42,360
phase that's where this hand comes in so
 

337
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,990
phase that's where this hand comes in so
he tries to go forward and he can't go

338
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,000
he tries to go forward and he can't go
 

339
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,590
he tries to go forward and he can't go
forward you're just bringing that

340
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:48,600

 

341
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,190

around which means this hand can't be

342
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
around which means this hand can't be
 

343
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,910
around which means this hand can't be
used for your little pulling and things

344
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:54,920
