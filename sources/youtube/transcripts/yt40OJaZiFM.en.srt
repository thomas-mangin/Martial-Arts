tactically they
 

109
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,910
tactically they
function just like any other physical

110
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
function just like any other physical
 

111
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,110
function just like any other physical
force would

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,550
force would
function because Chi is not a substance

function because Chi is not a substance

function because Chi is not a substance
and she is not magical it does not do

116
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:21,319
and she is not magical it does not do
 

117
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,350
and she is not magical it does not do
something that other physical forces do

118
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:24,360
something that other physical forces do
 

119
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,470
something that other physical forces do
not

120
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
not
 

121
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,789
not
do the difference is how are they

122
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
do the difference is how are they
 

123
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,470
do the difference is how are they
manifested they are not manifested by

124
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
manifested they are not manifested by
 

125
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,949
manifested they are not manifested by
the physical processes by which other

126
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:37,959
the physical processes by which other
 

127
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,350
the physical processes by which other
physical forces are

128
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
physical forces are
 

129
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,429
physical forces are
manifested they are

130
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:43,439
manifested they are
 

131
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,750
manifested they are
manifested yes

132
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
manifested yes
 

133
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,509
manifested yes
physically but the means is

134
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
physically but the means is
 

135
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,630
physically but the means is
metaphysically and that's the difference

136
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
metaphysically and that's the difference
 

137
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,750
metaphysically and that's the difference
so this is where I don't agree with

138
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:56,760
so this is where I don't agree with
 

139
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,990
so this is where I don't agree with
other proponents I have put before you

140
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
other proponents I have put before you
 

141
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,309
other proponents I have put before you
such as uh Adam misner or DMO Mitchell

142
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
such as uh Adam misner or DMO Mitchell
 

143
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,030
such as uh Adam misner or DMO Mitchell
they're playing around with physical

144
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,040
they're playing around with physical
 

145
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,949
they're playing around with physical
substances uh I did a analysis of D

146
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
substances uh I did a analysis of D
 

147
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,749
substances uh I did a analysis of D
Mitchell's physicality and it's just

148
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
Mitchell's physicality and it's just
 

149
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,390
Mitchell's physicality and it's just
stupid

150
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:21,400

 

151
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,350

okay and anyone should see that it makes

152
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:24,360
okay and anyone should see that it makes
 

153
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,350
okay and anyone should see that it makes
no

154
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
no
 

155
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,469
no
sense but anybody who knows the cultural

156
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
sense but anybody who knows the cultural
 

157
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,390
sense but anybody who knows the cultural
history as I do do and as they

158
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:31,400
history as I do do and as they
 

159
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,390
history as I do do and as they
don't you would know that's inconsistent

160
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
don't you would know that's inconsistent
 

161
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,230
don't you would know that's inconsistent
with the historical

162
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,240
with the historical
 

163
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,590
with the historical
record that's not what they mean at

164
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:42,600

 

165
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,310

all so now question was raise uh how do

166
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:47,320
all so now question was raise uh how do
 

167
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,350
all so now question was raise uh how do
you do iy with the Joe as in Joe

168
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360

 

169
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,909

doie as my first response is you do it

170
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:56,919
doie as my first response is you do it
 

171
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:59,749
doie as my first response is you do it
the same way you do iy all the time I

172
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
the same way you do iy all the time I
 

173
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,830
the same way you do iy all the time I
just a physical it's going to manifest

174
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:02,840
just a physical it's going to manifest
 

175
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,510
just a physical it's going to manifest
physically but it's going to be

176

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
angle and move her
 

289
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,390

291
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,990

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,350
then I get that adhesion right there
she'll feel it first before you see it

00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,030
another type of friction it's just
friction is what it is okay so the

00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,040
friction is what it is okay so the
 

311
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,910
friction is what it is okay so the
friction is going to manifest in in the

315
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:03,670

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
um especially if you're not quite at the
 

317
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,269
um especially if you're not quite at the
perfect Yang value um so I will not do a

318
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:08,279
perfect Yang value um so I will not do a
 

319
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,509
perfect Yang value um so I will not do a
perfect yangong value and you will see

320
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
perfect yangong value and you will see
 

321
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,030

uh there is that skin right there do you
 

329
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,430
uh there is that skin right there do you
see so I'm moving her skin and then I

330
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
see so I'm moving her skin and then I
 

331
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,509
see so I'm moving her skin and then I

teaching my people is that's a reaction

344
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:45,240
teaching my people is that's a reaction
 

345
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,470
teaching my people is that's a reaction
to the pool but the UK does not seek

346
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
to the pool but the UK does not seek
 

347
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,550
to the pool but the UK does not seek
control okay so what happened was um as

348
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:53,560
control okay so what happened was um as
 

349
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,030
control okay so what happened was um as
she starts to lift and I generate that

350
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
she starts to lift and I generate that
 

351
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,829
she starts to lift and I generate that
friction she felt herself go off balance

352
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
friction she felt herself go off balance
 

353
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,350
friction she felt herself go off balance
and she shifted her weight to the back

354
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:02,360
and she shifted her weight to the back
 

355
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,470
and she shifted her weight to the back
and you see that increases the Yong

356
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
and you see that increases the Yong
 

357
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,350
and you see that increases the Yong
value when she's doing that if I don't

358
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
value when she's doing that if I don't
 

359
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,670
value when she's doing that if I don't
stay up with it and I try to pull I'll

360
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
stay up with it and I try to pull I'll
 

361
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,350
stay up with it and I try to pull I'll
slip off okay so and and she'll fall

362
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:14,360
slip off okay so and and she'll fall
 

363
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,350
slip off okay so and and she'll fall
backwards okay but as she goes and I'll

364
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
backwards okay but as she goes and I'll
 

365
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,590
backwards okay but as she goes and I'll
have her do it again and I just keep

366
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:20,600
have her do it again and I just keep
 

367
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,350
have her do it again and I just keep
matching it and there's more pull on her

368
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
matching it and there's more pull on her
 

369
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,269
matching it and there's more pull on her
skin do you see and then eventually I

370
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:26,279
skin do you see and then eventually I
 

371
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,710
skin do you see and then eventually I
can pull her without slipping off got it

372
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:29,720
can pull her without slipping off got it
 

373
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,670
can pull her without slipping off got it
okay but you I don't want you to do that

374
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
okay but you I don't want you to do that
 

375
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,550
okay but you I don't want you to do that
stuff okay all right so you have to be

376
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
stuff okay all right so you have to be
 

377
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,030
stuff okay all right so you have to be
fine with losing control of what's going

378
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
fine with losing control of what's going
 

379
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,230
fine with losing control of what's going
on all

380
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,240
on all
 

381
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,550
on all
right some people will find this very

382
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:43,560
right some people will find this very
 

383
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,750
right some people will find this very
easy um and some people

384
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
easy um and some people
 

385
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,190
easy um and some people
won't the people that can ground vector

386
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,200
won't the people that can ground vector
 

387
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,310
won't the people that can ground vector
and take all of this young

388
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:55,320
and take all of this young
 

389
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,470
and take all of this young
aspect and Orient it towards the ground

390
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
aspect and Orient it towards the ground
 

391
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,750
aspect and Orient it towards the ground
they can do this at lighter

392
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:02,760
they can do this at lighter
 

393
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,550
they can do this at lighter
levels lighter levels of young

394
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,560
levels lighter levels of young
 

395
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,790

aspect the people that can't they

396
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:09,800
aspect the people that can't they
 

397
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,550
aspect the people that can't they
require higher levels of young aspect

398
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
require higher levels of young aspect
 

399
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,190
require higher levels of young aspect
grosser levels okay so uh I'm not going

400
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,200
grosser levels okay so uh I'm not going
 

401
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,550
grosser levels okay so uh I'm not going
to ground ground at all I'm just

402
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
to ground ground at all I'm just
 

403
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,590
to ground ground at all I'm just
standing here and uh as she goes really

404
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:22,600
standing here and uh as she goes really
 

405
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,829
standing here and uh as she goes really
slowly I'm never going to

406
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
slowly I'm never going to
 

407
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,750
slowly I'm never going to
get I'm never going to get that you'll

408
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:28,760
get I'm never going to get that you'll
 

409
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,269
get I'm never going to get that you'll
see that a

410
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
see that a
 

411
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,710
see that a
lot if she goes and I don't ground I

412
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:35,720
lot if she goes and I don't ground I
 

413
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,150
lot if she goes and I don't ground I
can't internalize and she goes up I can

414
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,160
can't internalize and she goes up I can
 

415
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,910
can't internalize and she goes up I can
generate higher levels of of uh Yang in

416
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
generate higher levels of of uh Yang in
 

417
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,230
generate higher levels of of uh Yang in
mine you see and uh she's tries to lift

418
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
mine you see and uh she's tries to lift
 

419
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,990
mine you see and uh she's tries to lift
up and I push down and now I can move

420
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,000
up and I push down and now I can move
 

421
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,949
up and I push down and now I can move
that thing forward do you see that um

422
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
that thing forward do you see that um
 

423
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,350
that thing forward do you see that um
but if I can internalize everything we

424
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:58,360
but if I can internalize everything we
 

425
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,069
but if I can internalize everything we
won't even use use this

426
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:01,079
won't even use use this
 

427
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,430
won't even use use this
movement okay there's enough young

428
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:04,440
movement okay there's enough young
 

429
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,389
movement okay there's enough young
aspect here and you could see the

430
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
aspect here and you could see the
 

431
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,110
aspect here and you could see the
the the you you got to I don't know talk

432
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,120
the the you you got to I don't know talk
 

433
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,470
the the you you got to I don't know talk
on how light My Touch is very light okay

434
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:15,480
on how light My Touch is very light okay
 

435
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,629
on how light My Touch is very light okay
it's very light but you can see that you

436
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
it's very light but you can see that you
 

437
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,829
it's very light but you can see that you
can get it to go okay uh does that make

438
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839
can get it to go okay uh does that make
 

439
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,990
can get it to go okay uh does that make
sense okay it's crazy okay and that is

440
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,000
sense okay it's crazy okay and that is
 

441
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,150
sense okay it's crazy okay and that is
possible because I can internalize this

442
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
possible because I can internalize this
 

443
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,189
possible because I can internalize this
Yang aspect and get this third Point

444
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:33,199
Yang aspect and get this third Point
 

445
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:37,389
Yang aspect and get this third Point
into the equation of her her Yang aspect

446
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:37,399
into the equation of her her Yang aspect
 

447
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,350
into the equation of her her Yang aspect
my young aspect and then there's this

448
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
my young aspect and then there's this
 

449
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,670
my young aspect and then there's this
third Point through the internal through

450
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:42,680
third Point through the internal through
 

451
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,310
third Point through the internal through
grounding through me okay and that is

452
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:45,320
grounding through me okay and that is
 

453
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,389
grounding through me okay and that is
what I call uh alchemically treated Yong

454
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,399
what I call uh alchemically treated Yong
 

455
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,910
what I call uh alchemically treated Yong
this is this is just yon me shoving down

456
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:52,920
this is this is just yon me shoving down
 

457
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,110
this is this is just yon me shoving down
and trying to bring it forward but

458
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
and trying to bring it forward but
 

459
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,230
and trying to bring it forward but
alchemically treated

460
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:57,240
alchemically treated
 

461
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,949
alchemically treated
Yan uh is y that is bounced back off the

462
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
Yan uh is y that is bounced back off the
 

463
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,629
Yan uh is y that is bounced back off the
ground and then this this could be so

464
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:03,639
ground and then this this could be so
 

465
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,150
ground and then this this could be so
light so light and you could get it to

466
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,160
light so light and you could get it to
 

467
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,430
light so light and you could get it to
work um even in weird places okay now um

468
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
work um even in weird places okay now um
 

469
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,069
work um even in weird places okay now um
here there's no there's no there's not

470
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
here there's no there's no there's not
 

471
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,470
here there's no there's no there's not
really a ledge there anyways if you

472
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
really a ledge there anyways if you
 

473
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,310
really a ledge there anyways if you
think about it I'm not on the inside

474
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:21,320
think about it I'm not on the inside
 

475
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,790
think about it I'm not on the inside
okay but you can you can do it on places

476
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
okay but you can you can do it on places
 

477
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,710
okay but you can you can do it on places
where you you can't even really think

478
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:27,720
where you you can't even really think
 

479
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,470
where you you can't even really think
that you can do it so I'll

480
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
that you can do it so I'll
 

481
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,530
that you can do it so I'll
release don't lean back on

482

me and you can get it to go so if you
 

487
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,910
me and you can get it to go so if you
pay attention you still will see the

488

pay attention you still will see the
 

489
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,990
pay attention you still will see the
friction I'll generate the friction

490
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,000
friction I'll generate the friction
 

491
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,910
friction I'll generate the friction
okay and you'll feel it okay what you're

492
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:48,920
okay and you'll feel it okay what you're
 

493

and I pull this there is the up do you
 

501
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,030
and I pull this there is the up do you
feel it right there okay so you can make

502
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
feel it right there okay so you can make
 

503
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,749
feel it right there okay so you can make
it go back we're just making it go

504
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:05,759
it go back we're just making it go
 

505
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,189
it go back we're just making it go
forward so now I have it and then we go

506
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:08,199
forward so now I have it and then we go
 

507
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:10,790
forward so now I have it and then we go
forward with the up again it always

508
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
forward with the up again it always
 

509
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,790
forward with the up again it always

um let's stop there all right so I asked

516
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:23,639
um let's stop there all right so I asked
 

517
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,949
um let's stop there all right so I asked
my Desi here cuz you know I'm teaching

518
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:25,959
my Desi here cuz you know I'm teaching
 

519
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:31,509
my Desi here cuz you know I'm teaching
them to um tell me something that the uh

520
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
them to um tell me something that the uh
 

521
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,949
them to um tell me something that the uh
alchemically treated Yong can do that

522
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
alchemically treated Yong can do that
 

523
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,230
alchemically treated Yong can do that
just straight Yong can't do um and

524
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,240
just straight Yong can't do um and
 

525
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,470
just straight Yong can't do um and
Virginia noted something I did not say

526
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:41,480
Virginia noted something I did not say
 

527
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,430
Virginia noted something I did not say
which is very true but she feels it is

528
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
which is very true but she feels it is
 

529
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,230
which is very true but she feels it is
the straight blast young is really uh

it's like I I just shov this down down

538
00:14:59,310 --> 00:14:59,320
it's like I I just shov this down down
 

539
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,470
it's like I I just shov this down down
and then I can then I can move her um

540
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
and then I can then I can move her um
 

541
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,990

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:19,160
to move move her arms kind of thing okay
 

555
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,590
to move move her arms kind of thing okay
uh very very true and that's how you

556
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
uh very very true and that's how you
 

557
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,430
uh very very true and that's how you
seize the center so even even even when

00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:24,440
seize the center so even even even when
 

559

00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
I'm here and I do this then I'm already

in her Center at that point you're in

562
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
in her Center at that point you're in
 

563
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,629
in her Center at that point you're in
her Center uh which you cannot be when

564
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:31,639
her Center uh which you cannot be when
 

565
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,629
her Center uh which you cannot be when
you just kind of shove and generate

566
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:33,639
you just kind of shove and generate
 

567
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,350
you just kind of shove and generate
friction through this contestation and

568
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:36,360
friction through this contestation and
 

569
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,749
friction through this contestation and
then you move them you don't really have

570
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:38,759
then you move them you don't really have
 

571
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,829
then you move them you don't really have
their Center in that seizure sense okay

572
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:42,839
their Center in that seizure sense okay
 

573
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,790
their Center in that seizure sense okay
but the second thing that you can do is

574
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800
but the second thing that you can do is
 

575
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,790
but the second thing that you can do is
you can work with extremely light levels

576
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:49,800
you can work with extremely light levels
 

577
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,590
you can work with extremely light levels
of Y okay which means tactically you

578
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
of Y okay which means tactically you
 

579
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,949

could Now

580
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
could Now
 

581
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,590
could Now
respond um through seizure much earlier

582
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
respond um through seizure much earlier
 

583
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,670
respond um through seizure much earlier
in the person's offense uh which is much

584
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:02,680
in the person's offense uh which is much
 

585
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,590
in the person's offense uh which is much
better to do okay that was my point uh

586
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:06,600
better to do okay that was my point uh
 

587
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,790
better to do okay that was my point uh
that you could work with lower y values

588
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:09,800
that you could work with lower y values
 

589
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,550
that you could work with lower y values
extremely low to the point where you are

00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
another tool in the
 

613
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,910
another tool in the
toolkit uh Chris asked the

614
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:52,920
toolkit uh Chris asked the
 

615
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,350
toolkit uh Chris asked the
question um wh why does it do that why

616
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
question um wh why does it do that why
 

617
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,629
question um wh why does it do that why
does it allow you to

618
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
does it allow you to
 

619
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,669
does it allow you to
generate uh

620
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:03,679
generate uh
 

621
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,870
generate uh
either a contact point an adhesion point

622
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
either a contact point an adhesion point
 

623
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,750
either a contact point an adhesion point

625
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,750
where there's no ledge or at extremely
low values of Y uh why does it let you

626
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:12,760
low values of Y uh why does it let you
 

627
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,069
low values of Y uh why does it let you
do that why does alchemically treated y

628
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,079
do that why does alchemically treated y
 

629
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,909
do that why does alchemically treated y
let you do that and to tell you the

630
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:16,919
let you do that and to tell you the
 

631
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,270
let you do that and to tell you the
honest truth I don't know I have no

632
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:20,280
honest truth I don't know I have no
 

633
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,630
honest truth I don't know I have no
idea um if I were to theorize I think it

634
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
idea um if I were to theorize I think it
 

635
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,350
idea um if I were to theorize I think it
has something to

636
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:26,360
has something to
 

637
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,909
has something to

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
part with just the
 

641
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,230
part with just the
physiological aspect of having a

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
physiological aspect of having a
 

643
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,270
physiological aspect of having a
third um Force value in the equation I

644
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,280
third um Force value in the equation I
 

645
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,669
third um Force value in the equation I
think it radically Alters the equation

646
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:46,679
think it radically Alters the equation
 

647
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,270

mathematical possibilities well we're
 

659
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,470
mathematical possibilities well we're
missing the huge portion that's also

missing the huge portion that's also
 

661
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,909
missing the huge portion that's also
involved in the equation I think that's

662
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:10,919
involved in the equation I think that's
 

663
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,430
involved in the equation I think that's
there I also think um that there's a

664
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,440
there I also think um that there's a
 

665
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,549
there I also think um that there's a
spiritual aspect to it that I can feel

666
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:19,559
spiritual aspect to it that I can feel
 

667
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,830
spiritual aspect to it that I can feel
more um what she's doing uh where is

668
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:23,840
more um what she's doing uh where is
 

669
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,590
more um what she's doing uh where is
this y value where is her y value I'm

670
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
this y value where is her y value I'm
 

671
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,870
this y value where is her y value I'm
more sensitive to that information and

672
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:30,880
more sensitive to that information and
 

673
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,549
more sensitive to that information and
so I can respond

674
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:33,559
so I can respond
 

675
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:36,909
so I can respond
accordingly uh as described uh much

676
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:36,919
accordingly uh as described uh much
 

677
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:39,190
accordingly uh as described uh much
earlier much lighter just because I'm

678
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
earlier much lighter just because I'm
 

679
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,110
earlier much lighter just because I'm
more aware of what she's actually doing

680
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,120
more aware of what she's actually doing
 

681
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,149
more aware of what she's actually doing
where where her body is where her Center

682
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:45,159
where where her body is where her Center
 

683
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,750
where where her body is where her Center
is I'm actually aware of of all of that

684
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760
is I'm actually aware of of all of that
 

685
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,669
is I'm actually aware of of all of that
kind of stuff so part of it is I think

686
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:51,679
kind of stuff so part of it is I think
 

687
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,950
kind of stuff so part of it is I think
there's a third equation point in there

688
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:53,960
there's a third equation point in there
 

689
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,830
there's a third equation point in there
that goes from the feed all the way

690
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
that goes from the feed all the way
 

691
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,270
that goes from the feed all the way
through the tomen that is producing

692
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
through the tomen that is producing
 

693
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,310
through the tomen that is producing
other kind of force values into this

694
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:01,320
other kind of force values into this
 

695
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,230
other kind of force values into this
equation but too I think my awareness of

696
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,240
equation but too I think my awareness of
 

697
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,870
equation but too I think my awareness of
what her information is what's her y

698
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
what her information is what's her y
 

699
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,149
what her information is what's her y
value where is it located is much higher

700
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:12,159
value where is it located is much higher
 

701
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:14,549
value where is it located is much higher
in terms of its readability its

702
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
in terms of its readability its
 

703
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,430
in terms of its readability its
sensitivity and so I can do things at

704
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:17,440
sensitivity and so I can do things at
 

705
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,190
sensitivity and so I can do things at
more subtle levels not requiring gross

706
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:20,200
more subtle levels not requiring gross
 

707
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,909
more subtle levels not requiring gross
amplification of her young value to do

708
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:22,919
amplification of her young value to do
 

709
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,510
amplification of her young value to do
things okay here's one more thing the

710
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:26,520
things okay here's one more thing the
 

711
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,510
things okay here's one more thing the
alchemically treated y does

712
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
alchemically treated y does
 

713
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,830
alchemically treated y does
um and it's related to this increase in

714
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:34,840

 

715
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,390

Awareness it drops that ego tripartite

716
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
Awareness it drops that ego tripartite
 

717
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,590
Awareness it drops that ego tripartite
mind which is always issuing a kind of

718
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
mind which is always issuing a kind of
 

719
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,950
mind which is always issuing a kind of
blindness because it always filters

720
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:43,960
blindness because it always filters
 

721
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,990
blindness because it always filters
everything through through the

722
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000
everything through through the
 

723
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,830
everything through through the
reification of the self where the other

724
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:48,840
reification of the self where the other
 

725
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,390
reification of the self where the other
is experienced as threat or no threat

726
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:52,400
is experienced as threat or no threat
 

727
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,990
is experienced as threat or no threat
and that leads to

728
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
and that leads to
 

729
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,990
and that leads to
blindness so as you are doing the energy

730
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,000
blindness so as you are doing the energy
 

731
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,070
blindness so as you are doing the energy
so as she has her her value there um as

732
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,080
so as she has her her value there um as
 

733
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,590
so as she has her her value there um as
I just not even moving her and I get

734
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
I just not even moving her and I get
 

735
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,669
I just not even moving her and I get
into that I can feel that whole threat

736
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:09,679
into that I can feel that whole threat
 

737
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,310
into that I can feel that whole threat
experience just drop in into my mind and

738
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:13,320
experience just drop in into my mind and
 

739
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,990
experience just drop in into my mind and
it does feel like a drop which is the

740
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
it does feel like a drop which is the
 

741
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,190
it does feel like a drop which is the
old expression it just feels like it's

742
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
old expression it just feels like it's
 

743
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,510
old expression it just feels like it's
going

744
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:20,520
going
 

745
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,950
going
down um and that's what you're playing

746
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:23,960
down um and that's what you're playing
 

747
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,350
down um and that's what you're playing
with in this exercise so to me this

748
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:28,360
with in this exercise so to me this
 

749
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,470
with in this exercise so to me this
could be the drill this could be the

750
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
could be the drill this could be the
 

751
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,590
could be the drill this could be the
drill like I already felt the Mind drop

752
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:33,600
drill like I already felt the Mind drop
 

753
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,590
drill like I already felt the Mind drop
which is also why I can do that with my

754
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:36,600
which is also why I can do that with my
 

755
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,230
which is also why I can do that with my
own young aspect I can do the standing

756
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
own young aspect I can do the standing
 

757
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,630
own young aspect I can do the standing
release drills and you'll feel the Mind

758
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:44,640
release drills and you'll feel the Mind
 

759
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,430
release drills and you'll feel the Mind
drop um and that does not happen with

760
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:48,440
drop um and that does not happen with
 

761
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,029
drop um and that does not happen with
trying to shove her down to generate

762
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,039
trying to shove her down to generate
 

763
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,789
trying to shove her down to generate
enough contestation that these two

764
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:53,799
enough contestation that these two
 

765
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,909
enough contestation that these two
things get stuck together in fact the

766
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:56,919
things get stuck together in fact the
 

767
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:59,270
things get stuck together in fact the
opposite happens okay

768
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
opposite happens okay
 

769
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,029
opposite happens okay
that's why big man iido is antithetical

770
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:02,039
that's why big man iido is antithetical
 

771
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:05,430
that's why big man iido is antithetical
to true iido true iido drops the ego

772
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:05,440
to true iido true iido drops the ego
 

773
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,390
to true iido true iido drops the ego
tripartite mind big man aido uh Rises it

774
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
tripartite mind big man aido uh Rises it
 

775
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,430
tripartite mind big man aido uh Rises it
okay all right so if she has now uh the

776
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
okay all right so if she has now uh the
 

777
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,950
okay all right so if she has now uh the
same drill okay and we start at the

778
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
same drill okay and we start at the
 

779
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,430
same drill okay and we start at the
bottom it's the same principle okay um

780
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:24,440
bottom it's the same principle okay um
 

781
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,830
bottom it's the same principle okay um
her skin is going to give a little more

782
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:27,840
her skin is going to give a little more
 

783
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,430
her skin is going to give a little more
uh friction than her Kee do you feel the

784
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:30,440
uh friction than her Kee do you feel the
 

785
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,669
uh friction than her Kee do you feel the
difference okay but not much not it's

786
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
difference okay but not much not it's
 

787
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,750
difference okay but not much not it's
not

788
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:34,760
not
 

789
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,669
not
much right so you can see that her skin

790
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
much right so you can see that her skin
 

791
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,350
much right so you can see that her skin
kind of moves a little just a little

792
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:40,360
kind of moves a little just a little
 

793
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,909
kind of moves a little just a little
with the weight of the weapon and then

794
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:42,919
with the weight of the weapon and then
 

795
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:45,870
with the weight of the weapon and then
there's no there's a little but it's

796
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:45,880
there's no there's a little but it's
 

797
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,950
there's no there's a little but it's
less and it is sliding over her skin so

798
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:49,960
less and it is sliding over her skin so
 

799
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,590
less and it is sliding over her skin so
there's less friction on her physical

800
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:52,600
there's less friction on her physical
 

801
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,029
there's less friction on her physical
there's more friction here do you see

802
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:55,039
there's more friction here do you see
 

803
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,149
there's more friction here do you see
with the weight of my hand because

804
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:57,159
with the weight of my hand because
 

805
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,269
with the weight of my hand because
there's more ition in these two surfaces

806
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:00,279
there's more ition in these two surfaces
 

807
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,950
there's more ition in these two surfaces
then over here but it doesn't change in

808
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
then over here but it doesn't change in
 

809
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,430
then over here but it doesn't change in
terms of what's it's doing okay um that

810
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:06,440
terms of what's it's doing okay um that
 

811
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,510
terms of what's it's doing okay um that
just means there's going to be less Yong

812
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520
just means there's going to be less Yong
 

813
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,190
just means there's going to be less Yong
value at the contact point because

814
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,200
value at the contact point because
 

815
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,430
value at the contact point because
there's less friction friction is a Yong

816
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:14,440
there's less friction friction is a Yong
 

817
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,230
there's less friction friction is a Yong
value so but the principle is the same

818
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:17,240
value so but the principle is the same
 

819
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,789
value so but the principle is the same
so I have to um internalize all of this

820
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:21,799
so I have to um internalize all of this
 

821
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,470
so I have to um internalize all of this
let it all sink and as she lifts up I

822
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:25,480
let it all sink and as she lifts up I
 

823
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:31,310
let it all sink and as she lifts up I
just am kind of matching it

824
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:31,320

 

825
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,430

she doesn't lift up there'll be less yog

826
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:34,440
she doesn't lift up there'll be less yog
 

827
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,830
she doesn't lift up there'll be less yog
value which just means I have to match

828
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:36,840
value which just means I have to match
 

829
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:43,950
value which just means I have to match
it at a lower

830
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:43,960

 

831
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,549

value okay and nothing changes except

832
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559
value okay and nothing changes except
 

833
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,190
value okay and nothing changes except
right what you can do and can't do does

834
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,200
right what you can do and can't do does
 

835
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,390
right what you can do and can't do does
that does that make sense of course you

836
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:53,400
that does that make sense of course you
 

837
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,110
that does that make sense of course you
you could do the same thing I shove it

838
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,120
you could do the same thing I shove it
 

839
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,710
you could do the same thing I shove it
way down here and then I pull it but

840
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:57,720
way down here and then I pull it but
 

841
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,390
way down here and then I pull it but
because I'm only and the arms you

842
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
because I'm only and the arms you
 

843
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,390
because I'm only and the arms you
eventually lose control of the center as

844
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:03,400
eventually lose control of the center as
 

845
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,789
eventually lose control of the center as
the SK skin suit adjusts okay um but you

846
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:07,799
the SK skin suit adjusts okay um but you
 

847
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,870
the SK skin suit adjusts okay um but you
can make them move that way okay and in

848
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
can make them move that way okay and in
 

849
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,909
can make them move that way okay and in
this sense you want her to move that way

850
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:13,919
this sense you want her to move that way
 

851
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,149
this sense you want her to move that way
it's a physical

852
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159
it's a physical
 

853
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,950
it's a physical
property just like this is a physical

but I would say if you wanted to make

862
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,120
but I would say if you wanted to make
 

863
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,549
but I would say if you wanted to make
this purely physical

this purely physical
 

865
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:35,029
this purely physical

00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:37,159
friction that's what you're doing you're
 

869
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:40,350
friction that's what you're doing you're
generating friction between two objects

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:40,360
generating friction between two objects
 

871
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,190
generating friction between two objects
it's very it's not uncommon the way that

that is pretty much what I'm doing here

880
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,120
that is pretty much what I'm doing here
 

881
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,669
that is pretty much what I'm doing here
okay if I if I go faster than her y

882
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:01,679
okay if I if I go faster than her y
 

883
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,950
okay if I if I go faster than her y
value I'll never stick if I'm underneath

884
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:04,960
value I'll never stick if I'm underneath
 

885
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,110
value I'll never stick if I'm underneath
it we're not going to go anywhere either

886
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,120
it we're not going to go anywhere either
 

887
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,669
it we're not going to go anywhere either
I have to match it perfectly okay the

888
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:09,679
I have to match it perfectly okay the
 

889
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,909
I have to match it perfectly okay the
way launch control is working in terms

890
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
way launch control is working in terms
 

891
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,390
way launch control is working in terms
of adhesion go in terms of CQ projection

892
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:17,400
of adhesion go in terms of CQ projection
 

893
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,710
of adhesion go in terms of CQ projection
okay so cooku projection is the

894
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
okay so cooku projection is the
 

895
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,909
okay so cooku projection is the
alchemically treated y that I admit out

896
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:24,919
alchemically treated y that I admit out
 

897
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,430
alchemically treated y that I admit out
is greater than the Y value at the

898
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:28,440
is greater than the Y value at the
 

899
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,630
is greater than the Y value at the
contact point then she gets separated

900
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:31,640
contact point then she gets separated
 

901
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,870
contact point then she gets separated
she gets displaced okay so um when I'm

902
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:36,880
she gets displaced okay so um when I'm
 

903
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,590
she gets displaced okay so um when I'm
when I'm here like this and I have equal

904
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:40,600
when I'm here like this and I have equal
 

905
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,149
when I'm here like this and I have equal
value so you can see her her her skin

906
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:45,159
value so you can see her her her skin
 

907
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:47,669
value so you can see her her her skin
her skin is being moved okay I'm holding

908
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
her skin is being moved okay I'm holding
 

909
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,230
her skin is being moved okay I'm holding
it right at the edge of her Center and

910
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
it right at the edge of her Center and
 

911
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,710
it right at the edge of her Center and
for me to project I just have to

912
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,720
for me to project I just have to
 

913
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,310
for me to project I just have to
increase the Y value

914
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
increase the Y value
 

915
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,950
increase the Y value
boom okay that's all doing there so if

916
00:24:59,950 --> 00:24:59,960
boom okay that's all doing there so if
 

917
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,190
boom okay that's all doing there so if
she is holding the

918
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:02,200
she is holding the
 

919
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,350
she is holding the
Joe yeah okay you have to feel where

920
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:06,360
Joe yeah okay you have to feel where
 

921
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,470
Joe yeah okay you have to feel where
that Yong value is and then you have to

922
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:09,480
that Yong value is and then you have to
 

923
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,070
that Yong value is and then you have to
do higher yangong value so it's not

924
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,080
do higher yangong value so it's not
 

925
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,029
do higher yangong value so it's not
going to be going this way in that elbow

926
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:16,039
going to be going this way in that elbow
 

927
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:19,029
going to be going this way in that elbow
joint where her elbow joint can move do

928
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:19,039
joint where her elbow joint can move do
 

929
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,350
joint where her elbow joint can move do
you see you have to figure out where it

930
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,360
you see you have to figure out where it
 

931
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,870
you see you have to figure out where it
is I kind of went into that joint she

932
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:23,880
is I kind of went into that joint she
 

933
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,830
is I kind of went into that joint she
can feel that and then from in that

934
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:26,840
can feel that and then from in that
 

935
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,909
can feel that and then from in that
joint once I'm in that joint then I can

936
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:28,919
joint once I'm in that joint then I can
 

937
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,230
joint once I'm in that joint then I can
come around towards your Center and get

938
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,240
come around towards your Center and get
 

939
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,029
come around towards your Center and get
her to move okay so if I

940
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:36,039
her to move okay so if I
 

941
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:39,389
her to move okay so if I
go that way you see you're in the

942
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:39,399
go that way you see you're in the
 

943
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:42,430
go that way you see you're in the
joint and what the first thing I did was

944
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:42,440
joint and what the first thing I did was
 

945
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,510
joint and what the first thing I did was
I feel the Y the that her y value okay

946
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:46,520
I feel the Y the that her y value okay
 

947
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,990
I feel the Y the that her y value okay
there's that thing is locked now okay so

948
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,000
there's that thing is locked now okay so
 

949
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,789
there's that thing is locked now okay so
for example uh stay there I'm going to

950
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:53,799
for example uh stay there I'm going to
 

951
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:57,190
for example uh stay there I'm going to
change my angle and keep it there okay I

952
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,200
change my angle and keep it there okay I
 

953
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,549
change my angle and keep it there okay I
keep that same thing and I'm in her

954
00:25:59,549 --> 00:25:59,559
keep that same thing and I'm in her
 

955
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:02,230
keep that same thing and I'm in her
Center and you can kind of just keep it

956
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,240
Center and you can kind of just keep it
 

957
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,269
Center and you can kind of just keep it
going and you'll move her with the I

958
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:06,279
going and you'll move her with the I
 

959
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:10,789
going and you'll move her with the I
key okay you increase it boom you'll get

960
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:10,799
key okay you increase it boom you'll get
 

961
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,389
key okay you increase it boom you'll get
the projection that's going there okay

962
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:13,399
the projection that's going there okay
 

963
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:14,510
the projection that's going there okay
it doesn't

964
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:14,520
it doesn't
 

965
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,470
it doesn't
change we're

966
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,480
change we're
 

967
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,230
change we're
here

968
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
here
 

969
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,830
here
pop keep it in there and you can move

970
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:20,840
pop keep it in there and you can move
 

971
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,990
pop keep it in there and you can move
her

972
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,000

 

973
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,789

around okay doesn't change nothing

974
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:26,799
around okay doesn't change nothing
 

975
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,230
around okay doesn't change nothing
changes okay

976
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,240
changes okay
 

977
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,230
changes okay
um keep that in mind and then we'll

978
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:33,240
um keep that in mind and then we'll
 

979
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,110
um keep that in mind and then we'll
we'll do something else let me hear your

980
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,120
we'll do something else let me hear your
 

981
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,149
we'll do something else let me hear your
