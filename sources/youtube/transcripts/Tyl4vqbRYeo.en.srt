got three different kinds of knives here

38
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
got three different kinds of knives here

ideas of what's going on so this is a

42
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
ideas of what's going on so this is a
 

43
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,430
ideas of what's going on so this is a
knife that i use i actually i bought one

44
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
knife that i use i actually i bought one
 

45
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,150
knife that i use i actually i bought one
of these years ago and then i made a

46
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
of these years ago and then i made a
 

47
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,910
of these years ago and then i made a
whole bunch more myself because i think

48
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
whole bunch more myself because i think
 

49
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,430
whole bunch more myself because i think
they're really good for training some

50
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
they're really good for training some
 

51
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,469
they're really good for training some
aspects of knife stuff so let's get a

52
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
aspects of knife stuff so let's get a
 

53
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,910
aspects of knife stuff so let's get a
close-up here

54
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
close-up here
 

55
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,390
close-up here
so um this knife has a really big one

56
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:10,400
so um this knife has a really big one
 

57
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,230
so um this knife has a really big one
close your hand around it this knife has

58
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
close your hand around it this knife has
 

59
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,310
close your hand around it this knife has
a really big pommel and what's nice

60
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
a really big pommel and what's nice
 

61
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,749
a really big pommel and what's nice
about it is when you're just training

62
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
about it is when you're just training
 

63
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,990
about it is when you're just training
this stuff it pretty much will always

64
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
this stuff it pretty much will always
 

65
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,149
this stuff it pretty much will always
give you a grip on this side of the

66
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159

69
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,590
knife right so it's good to kind of get
guys working initially with it even if

70
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
guys working initially with it even if
 

71
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,310
guys working initially with it even if
he chokes up quite a bit on that sucker

72
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
he chokes up quite a bit on that sucker

about here which gives this guy a lot of
 

85
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,270
about here which gives this guy a lot of
room to work with here and we'll talk

86
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
room to work with here and we'll talk
 

87
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,550
room to work with here and we'll talk
about when that disappears here in a

88
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
about when that disappears here in a
 

89
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,630
about when that disappears here in a
second okay so when i'm in code guy's

90
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
second okay so when i'm in code guy's
 

91
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,069
second okay so when i'm in code guy's
position i'm over here and i have my

92
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
position i'm over here and i have my
 

93
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,830
position i'm over here and i have my
basic grip lock going on by placing my

94
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
basic grip lock going on by placing my
 

95

disarm this hand is going to mimic his

124
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
disarm this hand is going to mimic his
 

125
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,589
disarm this hand is going to mimic his
hand as much as i can right so i'm going

126
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
hand as much as i can right so i'm going
 

127
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,670
hand as much as i can right so i'm going
to slide it in here just like his hand

128
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
to slide it in here just like his hand
 

129
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,030
to slide it in here just like his hand
is i want him to be the same right so

130
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
is i want him to be the same right so
 

131
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,430
is i want him to be the same right so
it's identical to his hand this hand is

132
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
it's identical to his hand this hand is
 

133
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,589
it's identical to his hand this hand is
going to be opposite his hand like a

134
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
going to be opposite his hand like a
 

135
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,350

and pinky finger over this uh pommel as
 

145
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,150
and pinky finger over this uh pommel as
i possibly can so i'm really grabbing

146
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
i possibly can so i'm really grabbing
 

147
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,790
i possibly can so i'm really grabbing
down there okay and then i'm gonna pull

148
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
down there okay and then i'm gonna pull
 

149
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,190
down there okay and then i'm gonna pull
this side and push this side and what's

150
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
this side and push this side and what's
 

151
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,390
this side and push this side and what's
happening here and i don't know how

152
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
happening here and i don't know how
 

153
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,509
happening here and i don't know how
close this is but um i'm i'm literally

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,830
opening of his hand is is where i'm
working so i'm not really worried about

162
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
working so i'm not really worried about
 

163
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,990
working so i'm not really worried about
trying to apply a coat of guys we know

164
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
trying to apply a coat of guys we know
 

165
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,750
trying to apply a coat of guys we know
it to hurt the wrist but i'm just

166
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
it to hurt the wrist but i'm just
 

167
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,190
it to hurt the wrist but i'm just
worried about turning the hand this way

168
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
worried about turning the hand this way
 

169
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,430
worried about turning the hand this way
and this will automatically turn the

170
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
and this will automatically turn the
 

171
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,949
and this will automatically turn the
wrist to that position

172
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
wrist to that position
 

173
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,150
wrist to that position
anyways right so i don't have to worry

174
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
anyways right so i don't have to worry
 

175
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,430
anyways right so i don't have to worry
about that but a lot of times when i

176
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
about that but a lot of times when i
 

177
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,710
about that but a lot of times when i
tend to think about just doing the coat

178
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
tend to think about just doing the coat
 

179
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,470
tend to think about just doing the coat
of gosh what happens is i lock his hand

180
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
of gosh what happens is i lock his hand
 

181
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,830
of gosh what happens is i lock his hand
onto the knife better and it's hard for

182
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
onto the knife better and it's hard for
 

183
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,190
onto the knife better and it's hard for
him to let go and that's not what i want

184
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
him to let go and that's not what i want
 

185
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,949
him to let go and that's not what i want
i want him to give up the knife

186
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
i want him to give up the knife
 

187
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,550
i want him to give up the knife
so with this knife here i'm going to

188
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
so with this knife here i'm going to
 

189
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,070
so with this knife here i'm going to
grab as much here as i can as much here

190
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
grab as much here as i can as much here
 

191
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,229
grab as much here as i can as much here
as i can i'm pulling on this side and

192
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
as i can i'm pulling on this side and
 

193
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,990
as i can i'm pulling on this side and
i'm pushing on this side and you get a

194
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
i'm pushing on this side and you get a
 

195
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,430
i'm pushing on this side and you get a
super sweet disarm with that it comes

196
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
super sweet disarm with that it comes
 

197
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,270
super sweet disarm with that it comes
out really really well okay so that's

198
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
out really really well okay so that's
 

199
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,030
out really really well okay so that's
with this knife all right let's go to

200
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
with this knife all right let's go to
 

201
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,030
with this knife all right let's go to
the kind of knives you guys are using so

202
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
the kind of knives you guys are using so
 

203
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,550
the kind of knives you guys are using so
paul's group's using these quan nines

204
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
paul's group's using these quan nines
 

205
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,470
paul's group's using these quan nines
which i use here i like them

206
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
which i use here i like them
 

207
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,229
which i use here i like them
they have a very very small handle here

208
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
they have a very very small handle here
 

209
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,309
they have a very very small handle here
right so it's not a lot of handle to get

210
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
right so it's not a lot of handle to get
 

211
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,949
right so it's not a lot of handle to get
but still i can get in here on this side

212
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
but still i can get in here on this side
 

213
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,030
but still i can get in here on this side
and instead of relying as much on this

214
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
and instead of relying as much on this
 

215
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,390
and instead of relying as much on this
part of the pull which feels really

216
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
part of the pull which feels really
 

217
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,309
part of the pull which feels really
really good i'm going to rely a lot on

218
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
really good i'm going to rely a lot on
 

219
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,550
really good i'm going to rely a lot on
this part which is the push so as i get

220
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
this part which is the push so as i get
 

221
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,070
this part which is the push so as i get
the hand into the good position i'm

222
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
the hand into the good position i'm
 

223
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,509
the hand into the good position i'm
really going to drive that knife back

224
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
really going to drive that knife back
 

225
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,670
really going to drive that knife back
towards him with this now on a single

226
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
towards him with this now on a single
 

227
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,270
towards him with this now on a single
edge knife this is perfectly fine

228
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
edge knife this is perfectly fine
 

229
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,350
edge knife this is perfectly fine
because this whole thing's flat and if i

230
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
because this whole thing's flat and if i
 

231
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,630
because this whole thing's flat and if i
needed a little more force i could even

232
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
needed a little more force i could even
 

233
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,149
needed a little more force i could even
come out here right and so it depends on

234
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
come out here right and so it depends on
 

235
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,990
come out here right and so it depends on
how risky you want to be right but i

236
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
how risky you want to be right but i
 

237
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,110
how risky you want to be right but i
could come out all the way here if i

238
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
could come out all the way here if i
 

239
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,710
could come out all the way here if i
want and there's japanese techniques

240
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
want and there's japanese techniques
 

241
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,309
want and there's japanese techniques
that show pinching the blade like this

242
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
that show pinching the blade like this
 

243
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,990
that show pinching the blade like this
so that way nothing could cut me but i

244
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
so that way nothing could cut me but i
 

245
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,670
so that way nothing could cut me but i
get a longer lever and the longer level

246
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
get a longer lever and the longer level
 

247
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,030
get a longer lever and the longer level
i have the better it's going to be of

248
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
i have the better it's going to be of
 

249
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,630
i have the better it's going to be of
course if the knife was like this long

250
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
course if the knife was like this long
 

251
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,070
course if the knife was like this long
it'd be fantastic because i get a full

252
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
it'd be fantastic because i get a full
 

253
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,350
it'd be fantastic because i get a full
hand here and a full hand here and i can

254
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
hand here and a full hand here and i can
 

255
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,589
hand here and a full hand here and i can
pull that sucker free but i can't right

256
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
pull that sucker free but i can't right
 

257
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,670
pull that sucker free but i can't right
so so i'm limited by this so i get as

258
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
so so i'm limited by this so i get as
 

259
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,670
so so i'm limited by this so i get as
much as i possibly can in here even if i

260
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
much as i possibly can in here even if i
 

261
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,589
much as i possibly can in here even if i
need to slide my fingers in between his

262
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
need to slide my fingers in between his
 

263
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,270
need to slide my fingers in between his
hand like that and i've done this many

264
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
hand like that and i've done this many
 

265
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,110
hand like that and i've done this many
times or you just shoot those fingers

266
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
times or you just shoot those fingers
 

267
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,789
times or you just shoot those fingers
inside there and i can get more purchase

268
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
inside there and i can get more purchase
 

269
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,390
inside there and i can get more purchase
on this and then i make a lot of this

270
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
on this and then i make a lot of this
 

271
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,909
on this and then i make a lot of this
because the handle's so short about

272
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
because the handle's so short about
 

273
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,909
because the handle's so short about
driving this side back towards him so

274
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
driving this side back towards him so
 

275
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,509
driving this side back towards him so
i'm really working that okay then a

276
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
i'm really working that okay then a
 

277
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,110
i'm really working that okay then a
knife that i made

278
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
knife that i made
 

279
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,629
knife that i made
so i made this knife and i made it with

280
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
so i made this knife and i made it with
 

281
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,430
so i made this knife and i made it with
a really tiny handle so josh got tiny

282
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
a really tiny handle so josh got tiny
 

283
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,110
a really tiny handle so josh got tiny
hands but still you can see how there's

284
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
hands but still you can see how there's
 

285
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,110
hands but still you can see how there's
almost nothing back here and there's no

286
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
almost nothing back here and there's no
 

287
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,270
almost nothing back here and there's no
pommel protrusions right so there's no

288
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
pommel protrusions right so there's no
 

289
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,790
pommel protrusions right so there's no
nothing for me to get a hold of here so

290
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
nothing for me to get a hold of here so
 

291
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,550
nothing for me to get a hold of here so
now i've really got to work another way

292
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
now i've really got to work another way
 

293
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,990
now i've really got to work another way
with the technique so i get in here now

294
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
with the technique so i get in here now
 

295
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,350
with the technique so i get in here now
look i can't get my fingers in at all

296
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
look i can't get my fingers in at all
 

297
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,189
look i can't get my fingers in at all
now i've still pinched them in there as

298
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
now i've still pinched them in there as
 

299
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,870
now i've still pinched them in there as
much as i can possibly get but i'm not

300
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
much as i can possibly get but i'm not
 

301
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,390
much as i can possibly get but i'm not
really going to rely too much on these

302
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
really going to rely too much on these
 

303
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,670
really going to rely too much on these
to pull the knife free what i'm going to

304
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
to pull the knife free what i'm going to
 

305
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,990
to pull the knife free what i'm going to
rely i'm doing is anchoring my hand to

306
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
rely i'm doing is anchoring my hand to
 

307
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,310
rely i'm doing is anchoring my hand to
his hand and then i'm going to drive

308
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
his hand and then i'm going to drive
 

309
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,909
his hand and then i'm going to drive
this into him as hard as i possibly can

310
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
this into him as hard as i possibly can
 

311
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,670
this into him as hard as i possibly can
so i'm here and i'm using this knife and

312
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
so i'm here and i'm using this knife and
 

313
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,670
so i'm here and i'm using this knife and
i drive that into him right now look i

314
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
i drive that into him right now look i
 

315
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,510
i drive that into him right now look i
had no purchase on this side so i had

316

are running into which is you can't pull
it out this way right now if i had a

322
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
it out this way right now if i had a
 

323
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,469
it out this way right now if i had a
knife like this probably with just this

324
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
knife like this probably with just this
 

325
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,390
knife like this probably with just this
hand i could i could pull it out of his

326
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
hand i could i could pull it out of his
 

327
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,310
hand i could i could pull it out of his

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
all i'm doing is locking into it and
 

333
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,150
all i'm doing is locking into it and
then i'm driving the blade from here

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
then i'm driving the blade from here
 

335
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,909
then i'm driving the blade from here

if i cannot get it and this is one thing
that paul's group did is they worked

370
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
that paul's group did is they worked
 

371
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,950
that paul's group did is they worked
this idea of rolling the hand now that

372
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
this idea of rolling the hand now that
 

373
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,870
this idea of rolling the hand now that
hurts like hell right so josh definitely

374
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
hurts like hell right so josh definitely
 

375
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,550
hurts like hell right so josh definitely
had a big reaction the problem with it

376
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
had a big reaction the problem with it
 

377
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,189
had a big reaction the problem with it
is it hurts while his hand is locked

378
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
is it hurts while his hand is locked
 

379
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,990
is it hurts while his hand is locked
onto the knife and then when i let up so

380
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
onto the knife and then when i let up so
 

381
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,350
onto the knife and then when i let up so
he could open his hand to let go of the

382
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
he could open his hand to let go of the
 

383
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,110
he could open his hand to let go of the
knife he locks back down on it because

384
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
knife he locks back down on it because
 

385
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,950
knife he locks back down on it because
now it doesn't hurt right so then i got

386
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
now it doesn't hurt right so then i got
 

387
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,790
now it doesn't hurt right so then i got
to crank into it again so you have a

388
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
to crank into it again so you have a
 

389
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,790
to crank into it again so you have a
real hard time making a clean disarm

390
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
real hard time making a clean disarm
 

391
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,790
real hard time making a clean disarm
with that so a lot of times if i can't

392
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
with that so a lot of times if i can't
 

393
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,150
with that so a lot of times if i can't
get it out i want to give them enough

394
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
get it out i want to give them enough
 

395
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,150
get it out i want to give them enough
trouble that they lock their arm out so

396
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
trouble that they lock their arm out so
 

397
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,909
trouble that they lock their arm out so
let's say i'm working this and he's

398
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
let's say i'm working this and he's
 

399
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,749
let's say i'm working this and he's
resisting me he's going to start

400
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
resisting me he's going to start
 

401
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,950
resisting me he's going to start
straightening his arm more and more and

402
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
straightening his arm more and more and
 

403
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,070
straightening his arm more and more and
more because this gives him more

404
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
more because this gives him more
 

405
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,430
more because this gives him more
strength at the wrist now that's great

406
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
strength at the wrist now that's great
 

407
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,430
strength at the wrist now that's great
for me because that leads into chondron

408
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
for me because that leads into chondron
 

409
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,029
for me because that leads into chondron
right here where i can go into that

410
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
right here where i can go into that
 

411
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,710
right here where i can go into that
elbow now from this he's probably going

412
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
elbow now from this he's probably going
 

413
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,830
elbow now from this he's probably going
to do one of two things either he's

414
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
to do one of two things either he's
 

415
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,110
to do one of two things either he's
going to jerk his arm down because he

416
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
going to jerk his arm down because he
 

417
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,629
going to jerk his arm down because he
doesn't want to get rokued and i drive

418
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
doesn't want to get rokued and i drive
 

419
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,749
doesn't want to get rokued and i drive
in here boom and i get that disarm or

420
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
in here boom and i get that disarm or
 

421
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,469
in here boom and i get that disarm or
as i do that he won't give me that so i

422
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
as i do that he won't give me that so i
 

423
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,830
as i do that he won't give me that so i
just worked the rokyo now so i just

424
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
just worked the rokyo now so i just
 

425
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,909
just worked the rokyo now so i just
conrad it into the rokyo right so the

426
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
conrad it into the rokyo right so the
 

427
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,830
conrad it into the rokyo right so the
idea here is to drive as much in this

428
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
idea here is to drive as much in this
 

429
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,110
idea here is to drive as much in this
way as possible right you see i'm

430
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
way as possible right you see i'm
 

431
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,230
way as possible right you see i'm
hitting that same problem you guys are

432
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
hitting that same problem you guys are
 

433
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,749
hitting that same problem you guys are
hitting right that's a sticky point

434
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
hitting right that's a sticky point
 

435
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,430
hitting right that's a sticky point
every time but when i hit that sticky

436
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
every time but when i hit that sticky
 

437
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,189
every time but when i hit that sticky
point i drive this side right back in

438
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
point i drive this side right back in
 

439
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,710
point i drive this side right back in
towards him and that's what i'm working

440
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
towards him and that's what i'm working
 

441
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,589
towards him and that's what i'm working
so

442
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
so
 

443
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,029
so
does the shorter if the handle gets

444
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
does the shorter if the handle gets
 

445
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,070
does the shorter if the handle gets
shorter it's going to be harder as the

446
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
shorter it's going to be harder as the
 

447
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,670
shorter it's going to be harder as the
guy's grip gets stronger it's going to

448
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
guy's grip gets stronger it's going to
 

449
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,350
guy's grip gets stronger it's going to
be harder but what you really want to do

450
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
be harder but what you really want to do
 

451
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,189
be harder but what you really want to do
is work the blade side as much as you

452
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
is work the blade side as much as you
 

453
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,550
is work the blade side as much as you
possibly can if you keep your hand

454
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
possibly can if you keep your hand
 

455
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,150
possibly can if you keep your hand
tucked tight to his it's going to make
