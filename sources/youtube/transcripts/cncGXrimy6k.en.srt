from showman part two last time we
 

7
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,230
from showman part two last time we
talked about transitioning showman into

8
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
talked about transitioning showman into
 

9
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,190
talked about transitioning showman into
the heoi position and what if they come

10
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
the heoi position and what if they come
 

11
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,310
the heoi position and what if they come
around uh now we'll talk about uh

12
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:16,320
around uh now we'll talk about uh
 

13
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,950
around uh now we'll talk about uh
transitioning to the EDI position and

14
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
transitioning to the EDI position and
 

15
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,910
transitioning to the EDI position and
what comes off of the EDI position and

16
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:20,920
what comes off of the EDI position and
 

17
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,630
what comes off of the EDI position and
why that is um this is probably not

18
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
why that is um this is probably not
 

19
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,710
why that is um this is probably not
going to be a tragically long video um

series though um talking about all the
different parts but I'm going to get

26
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:30,279
different parts but I'm going to get
 

27
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,230
different parts but I'm going to get

don't know it's also going to be jarring

38
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:44,360
don't know it's also going to be jarring
 

39
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,990
don't know it's also going to be jarring
from the beginning because in the I

comes from shanci and we'll talk about

50
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:57,480
comes from shanci and we'll talk about
 

51
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,110
comes from shanci and we'll talk about
the eating me position so just to recap

52
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,120
the eating me position so just to recap
 

53
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,069
the eating me position so just to recap
real quick in the last video series we

54
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:02,079
real quick in the last video series we
 

55
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,429
real quick in the last video series we
talked about using sore and getting the

56
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:04,439
talked about using sore and getting the
 

57
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,469
talked about using sore and getting the
heo me position and then his natural

58
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
heo me position and then his natural
 

59
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,950
heo me position and then his natural
tendency to want to come around and get

60
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:07,960
tendency to want to come around and get
 

61
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,870
tendency to want to come around and get
me and then how I can atim in that and

62
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:09,880
me and then how I can atim in that and
 

63
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,710
me and then how I can atim in that and
that leads us to G nag and all kinds of

64
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:11,720
that leads us to G nag and all kinds of
 

65
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,550
that leads us to G nag and all kinds of
other stuff uh can come from that so

66
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:13,560
other stuff uh can come from that so
 

67
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,950
other stuff uh can come from that so
that video is the first part of this

68
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
that video is the first part of this
 

69
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,830
that video is the first part of this
okay second part is EDI which is going

70
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:16,840
okay second part is EDI which is going
 

71
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,870
okay second part is EDI which is going
to be my next major go-to in this right

72
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:19,880
to be my next major go-to in this right
 

73
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,149
to be my next major go-to in this right
so meaning that I'm like this and I want

74
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
so meaning that I'm like this and I want
 

75
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,510
so meaning that I'm like this and I want
to shoot EDI right so two real ideas I'm

76
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
to shoot EDI right so two real ideas I'm
 

77
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,670
to shoot EDI right so two real ideas I'm
going to have from this is I'm going to

78
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:26,680
going to have from this is I'm going to
 

79
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,950
going to have from this is I'm going to
want to either continue to drive forward

80
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
want to either continue to drive forward
 

81
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,350
want to either continue to drive forward
or to sweep so the moari and see what's

82
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
or to sweep so the moari and see what's
 

83
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,030
or to sweep so the moari and see what's
behind me and and whatever different

84
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
behind me and and whatever different
 

85
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,950
behind me and and whatever different
actions I'm taking right okay now my

86
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:35,960
actions I'm taking right okay now my
 

87
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,069
actions I'm taking right okay now my
basic idea is simply the EDI tyoo which

88
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:39,079
basic idea is simply the EDI tyoo which
 

89
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,190
basic idea is simply the EDI tyoo which
is this I check check and I come in now

90
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
is this I check check and I come in now
 

91
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,109
is this I check check and I come in now
an interesting thing about this is let's

92
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
an interesting thing about this is let's
 

93
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,190
an interesting thing about this is let's
go to this side so we can get the front

94
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,200
go to this side so we can get the front
 

95
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,429
go to this side so we can get the front
camera if I don't check that elbow and I

96
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:46,439
camera if I don't check that elbow and I
 

97
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,630
camera if I don't check that elbow and I
come in and Josh just bends his arm I

98
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
come in and Josh just bends his arm I
 

99
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,709
come in and Josh just bends his arm I
walk into his elbow essentially right so

100
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:50,719
walk into his elbow essentially right so
 

101
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,109
walk into his elbow essentially right so
meaning if he just tried just a little

102
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:52,119
meaning if he just tried just a little
 

103
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:54,030
meaning if he just tried just a little
bit as I just walk through here CL he's

104
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,040
bit as I just walk through here CL he's
 

105
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,870
bit as I just walk through here CL he's
going to clock me in the head so I have

106
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:55,880
going to clock me in the head so I have
 

107
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,109
going to clock me in the head so I have
to check that elbow as I come through

108
00:01:58,109 --> 00:01:58,119
to check that elbow as I come through
 

109
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,350
to check that elbow as I come through
right now when I check that elbow here

110
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
right now when I check that elbow here
 

111
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,789
right now when I check that elbow here
this gives me the potential for EO right

112
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:03,799
this gives me the potential for EO right
 

113
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,350
this gives me the potential for EO right
so all of our EOS now it's switch back

114
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
so all of our EOS now it's switch back
 

115
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,069
so all of our EOS now it's switch back
so so I come in here and he bends that

116
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:07,079
so so I come in here and he bends that
 

117
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,309
so so I come in here and he bends that
elbow and I come here and I I've got the

118
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
elbow and I come here and I I've got the
 

119
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,790
elbow and I come here and I I've got the
elbow up here like this if he wants to

120
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
elbow up here like this if he wants to
 

121
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,190
elbow up here like this if he wants to
keep that elbow high and I can feel that

122
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,200
keep that elbow high and I can feel that
 

123
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,309
keep that elbow high and I can feel that
I kind of taking his balance a little

124
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:13,319
I kind of taking his balance a little
 

125
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,430
I kind of taking his balance a little
bit I get eek mul right so e mult comes

126
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:16,440
bit I get eek mul right so e mult comes
 

127
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,990
bit I get eek mul right so e mult comes
from that attempting to get EDI and the

128
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,000
from that attempting to get EDI and the
 

129
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,430
from that attempting to get EDI and the
EDI doesn't come off CU he's bending his

130
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:20,440
EDI doesn't come off CU he's bending his
 

131
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,509
EDI doesn't come off CU he's bending his
elbow to try and catch me and then when

132
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:22,519
elbow to try and catch me and then when
 

133
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,790
elbow to try and catch me and then when
he does that I shoot through and I can

134
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
he does that I shoot through and I can
 

135
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,790
he does that I shoot through and I can
get the uh EO multe all right now if I

136
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:27,800
get the uh EO multe all right now if I
 

137
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,589
get the uh EO multe all right now if I
stop that elbow from bending here or I

138
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
stop that elbow from bending here or I
 

139
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,509
stop that elbow from bending here or I
can't EO ult him then I can shoot

140
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:32,519
can't EO ult him then I can shoot
 

141
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,390
can't EO ult him then I can shoot
through here and get the true EDI all

142
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
through here and get the true EDI all
 

143
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,869
through here and get the true EDI all
right now if I wanted to just do

144
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879
right now if I wanted to just do
 

145
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,790
right now if I wanted to just do
something right so and and I think this

146
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
something right so and and I think this
 

147
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,589
something right so and and I think this
is kind of outside the regular context

148
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:40,599
is kind of outside the regular context
 

149
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,509
is kind of outside the regular context
of iido not that it's wrong but it's

150
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:42,519
of iido not that it's wrong but it's
 

151
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,390
of iido not that it's wrong but it's
just I just want to get him so after I

152
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
just I just want to get him so after I
 

153
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,190
just I just want to get him so after I
shoot that I can do a really basic kind

154
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,200
shoot that I can do a really basic kind
 

155
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,869
shoot that I can do a really basic kind
of Ed Minag which is to grab him here

156
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:47,879
of Ed Minag which is to grab him here
 

157
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,990
of Ed Minag which is to grab him here
and pull him off and why I say that's

158
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
and pull him off and why I say that's
 

159
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,990
and pull him off and why I say that's
not really in the iido context that I

160
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,000
not really in the iido context that I
 

161
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,350
not really in the iido context that I
believe exists is because it's doing

162
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
believe exists is because it's doing
 

163
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,589
believe exists is because it's doing
something extra that you maybe don't

164
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:56,599
something extra that you maybe don't
 

165
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,190
something extra that you maybe don't
have to do however I'll would also say

166
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,200
have to do however I'll would also say
 

167
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,509
have to do however I'll would also say
that it's not truly out of the context

168
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
that it's not truly out of the context
 

169
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,550
that it's not truly out of the context
because the there could be a reason I

170
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
because the there could be a reason I
 

171
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,910
because the there could be a reason I
need to pull him down there multiple

172
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
need to pull him down there multiple
 

173
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,430
need to pull him down there multiple
attackers if this guy hits the ground

174
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
attackers if this guy hits the ground
 

175
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,990
attackers if this guy hits the ground
then that gives me more autonomy with

176
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,000
then that gives me more autonomy with
 

177
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,350
then that gives me more autonomy with
other people so there there are reasons

178
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:06,360
other people so there there are reasons
 

179
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,630
other people so there there are reasons
that it could could exist but I'm I'm

180
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
that it could could exist but I'm I'm
 

181
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,830
that it could could exist but I'm I'm
I'm saying that that would just be a

182
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
I'm saying that that would just be a
 

183
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,710
I'm saying that that would just be a
choice I made so I came back here and I

184
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:11,720
choice I made so I came back here and I
 

185
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,350
choice I made so I came back here and I

see it and then I do my technique right
 

219
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,390
see it and then I do my technique right
and that's that's a big thing that

220
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
and that's that's a big thing that

it's not my my jam but I understand why

224
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
it's not my my jam but I understand why
 

225
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,949
it's not my my jam but I understand why
people do like to talk about it but all

people do like to talk about it but all
 

227
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,830
people do like to talk about it but all
that's happening is as I go back here

228
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
that's happening is as I go back here
 

229
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,949
that's happening is as I go back here
he's chasing me and so I want to keep

230
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:55,959
he's chasing me and so I want to keep
 

231
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,149
he's chasing me and so I want to keep
staying behind him so I move towards him

232
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
staying behind him so I move towards him
 

233
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,949
staying behind him so I move towards him
and keep my arm up and that locks his p

234
00:03:59,949 --> 00:03:59,959
and keep my arm up and that locks his p
 

235
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,390
and keep my arm up and that locks his p
in place and it makes it real real hard

236
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:01,400
in place and it makes it real real hard
 

237
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,390
in place and it makes it real real hard
for him to come to get me and that's

238
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,400
for him to come to get me and that's
 

239
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,509
for him to come to get me and that's
like the really katti flowy eag that

240
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:06,519
like the really katti flowy eag that
 

241
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,910
like the really katti flowy eag that
comes because he's chasing me back there

242
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:08,920
comes because he's chasing me back there
 

243
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,869
comes because he's chasing me back there
right now that to me is distinguished

244
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:11,879
right now that to me is distinguished
 

245
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,190
right now that to me is distinguished
from something where I just go here and

246
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
from something where I just go here and
 

247
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,710
from something where I just go here and
I break his balance because I want to

248
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
I break his balance because I want to
 

249
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,990
I break his balance because I want to
pull him down and I come through and I

250
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
pull him down and I come through and I
 

251
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,749
pull him down and I come through and I
do the edim Minag so I'm trying to

252
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
do the edim Minag so I'm trying to
 

253
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,789
do the edim Minag so I'm trying to
explain a situational reason for the

254
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:19,799
explain a situational reason for the
 

255
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,069
explain a situational reason for the
idim Minag as opposed to I just choose

256
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
idim Minag as opposed to I just choose
 

257
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,870
idim Minag as opposed to I just choose
to inflict a technique upon him okay now

258
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:25,880
to inflict a technique upon him okay now
 

259
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,510
to inflict a technique upon him okay now
understand that when I'm going this way

260
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:28,520
understand that when I'm going this way
 

261
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,390
understand that when I'm going this way
he will try to stop me Me by either

262
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
he will try to stop me Me by either
 

263
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,909
he will try to stop me Me by either
shooting his arm high like this to come

264
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:32,919
shooting his arm high like this to come
 

265
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,790
shooting his arm high like this to come
around and catch me or shooting his arm

266
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
around and catch me or shooting his arm
 

267
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,710
around and catch me or shooting his arm
low like this to come around and catch

268
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
low like this to come around and catch
 

269
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,230
low like this to come around and catch
me right so his arm's either going to go

270
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
me right so his arm's either going to go
 

271
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,590
me right so his arm's either going to go
here or here if he can't bend it in the

272
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
here or here if he can't bend it in the
 

273
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,629
here or here if he can't bend it in the
middle right he can't bend it in the

274
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
middle right he can't bend it in the
 

275
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,350
middle right he can't bend it in the
middle because we get that EO so he's

276
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,360
middle because we get that EO so he's
 

277
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,550
middle because we get that EO so he's
going to sweep around either high or low

278
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
going to sweep around either high or low
 

279
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,230
going to sweep around either high or low
if I stay connected to him and he sweeps

280
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
if I stay connected to him and he sweeps
 

281
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,749
if I stay connected to him and he sweeps
High then I still get my eek mot in fact

282
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:48,759
High then I still get my eek mot in fact
 

283
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,710
High then I still get my eek mot in fact
I get it even better because he's really

284
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
I get it even better because he's really
 

285
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,629
I get it even better because he's really
lifting his arm up so I'll get it most

286
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
lifting his arm up so I'll get it most
 

287
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,590
lifting his arm up so I'll get it most
of the time so again why shanu Iko is so

288
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
of the time so again why shanu Iko is so
 

289
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,390
of the time so again why shanu Iko is so
important is because that situation

290
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:57,400
important is because that situation
 

291
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,670
important is because that situation
it'll come up again and again and again

292
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:58,680
it'll come up again and again and again
 

293
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,310
it'll come up again and again and again
in a lot of different little ways

294
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
in a lot of different little ways
 

295
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,070
in a lot of different little ways
okay if he sweeps it low we transition

296
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,080
okay if he sweeps it low we transition
 

297
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,790
okay if he sweeps it low we transition
into a whole new set of techniques and

298
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
into a whole new set of techniques and
 

299
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,390
into a whole new set of techniques and
so that will have to be our next video

300
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
so that will have to be our next video
 

301
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,070
so that will have to be our next video
is where he's stopping me from making

302
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
is where he's stopping me from making
 

303
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,469
is where he's stopping me from making
the EDI but you can see that my choice

304
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
the EDI but you can see that my choice
 

305
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,670
the EDI but you can see that my choice
to try to make EDI leads us to edag and

306
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
to try to make EDI leads us to edag and
 

307
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,950
to try to make EDI leads us to edag and
EOS multes again and again and again

308
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:15,960
EOS multes again and again and again
 

309
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,430
EOS multes again and again and again
because of what he's doing as a response

310
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:18,440
because of what he's doing as a response
 

311
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,430
because of what he's doing as a response
to my action if he didn't do anything

312
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:20,440
to my action if he didn't do anything
 

313
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,950
to my action if he didn't do anything
then I would just shoot through right so

314
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:21,960
