1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,470

all

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:01,480
all
 

3
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,749
all
right uh let's just work with

4
00:00:04,749 --> 00:00:04,759
right uh let's just work with
 

5
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,270
right uh let's just work with
katata so he's going to grab cool all

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,280
katata so he's going to grab cool all
 

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,589
katata so he's going to grab cool all
right and do it again watch his grip

8
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:14,599
right and do it again watch his grip
 

9
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,189
right and do it again watch his grip
cool and one more

10
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:17,199
cool and one more
 

11
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,070
cool and one more
time cool all right uh let's do this

12
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,080
time cool all right uh let's do this
 

13
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,189
time cool all right uh let's do this
side now so you can see on the back side

14
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:24,199
side now so you can see on the back side
 

15
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,950
side now so you can see on the back side
cool a little

16
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:25,960
cool a little
 

17
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,790
cool a little
slower slow cool and again

18
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:31,800
slower slow cool and again
 

19
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,830
slower slow cool and again
all

20
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:32,840
all
 

21
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,150
all
right A lot of times what we do

22
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,160
right A lot of times what we do
 

23
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,830
right A lot of times what we do
is uh we might recognize his spinal

24
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:40,840
is uh we might recognize his spinal
 

25
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,590
is uh we might recognize his spinal
displacement so you're going to see I

26
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
displacement so you're going to see I
 

27
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,229
displacement so you're going to see I
won't ground it this time as he goes you

28
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
won't ground it this time as he goes you
 

29
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,750
won't ground it this time as he goes you
could see it in the tilt of his torso

30
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
could see it in the tilt of his torso
 

31
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,910
could see it in the tilt of his torso
okay do it one more time I won't ground

32
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
okay do it one more time I won't ground
 

33
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,830
okay do it one more time I won't ground
it so you see the effect on me

34
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
it so you see the effect on me
 

35
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,310
it so you see the effect on me
okay um and so we P we think he's going

36
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
okay um and so we P we think he's going
 

37
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,270
okay um and so we P we think he's going
this way and so as long as

38
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:04,280
this way and so as long as
 

39
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,230
this way and so as long as
I um have my motion going in a in a

40
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
I um have my motion going in a in a
 

41
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,310
I um have my motion going in a in a
harmonious Direction with that we think

42
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,320
harmonious Direction with that we think
 

43
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,149
harmonious Direction with that we think
we have not

44
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:15,159
we have not
 

45
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,069
we have not
contested okay but if we just slow

46
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:19,079
contested okay but if we just slow
 

47
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,630
contested okay but if we just slow
motion uh pretend my arm is

48
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
motion uh pretend my arm is
 

49
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,350
motion uh pretend my arm is
there okay and if you pay attention the

50
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
there okay and if you pay attention the
 

51
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,950
there okay and if you pay attention the
fingers are going the other way so yes

52
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:29,960
fingers are going the other way so yes
 

53
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,910
fingers are going the other way so yes
his spine he's doing spinal displacement

54
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:32,920
his spine he's doing spinal displacement
 

55
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,270
his spine he's doing spinal displacement
but the fingers are going back the other

56
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:36,280
but the fingers are going back the other
 

57
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,510
but the fingers are going back the other
way do you see that so if I actually go

58
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:40,520
way do you see that so if I actually go
 

59
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,630
way do you see that so if I actually go
this way I'm actually contesting the

60
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
this way I'm actually contesting the
 

61
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,670
this way I'm actually contesting the
fingers

62
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:46,680
fingers
 

63
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,670
fingers
okay your choreograph ID they were going

64
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
okay your choreograph ID they were going
 

65
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,990
okay your choreograph ID they were going
to fly that way anyway so you don't

66
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
to fly that way anyway so you don't
 

67
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,389
to fly that way anyway so you don't
really feel it but your scaredy cat ukes

68
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:55,399
really feel it but your scaredy cat ukes
 

69
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:57,550
really feel it but your scaredy cat ukes
or the ukes who are just grounding

70
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:57,560
or the ukes who are just grounding
 

71
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,069
or the ukes who are just grounding
you'll feel the fingers okay and and

72
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
you'll feel the fingers okay and and
 

73
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,069
you'll feel the fingers okay and and
you'll feel the Yong of the fingers

74
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
you'll feel the Yong of the fingers
 

75
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,630
you'll feel the Yong of the fingers
because you're yanging on the fingers

76
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,640
because you're yanging on the fingers
 

77

because you're yanging on the fingers
okay um that is another reason why the

78
00:02:10,749 --> 00:02:10,759
okay um that is another reason why the
 

79
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,190
okay um that is another reason why the
hand workk that we use isn't for example

80
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
hand workk that we use isn't for example
 

81
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,110
hand workk that we use isn't for example
like this

82
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
like this
 

83
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,430

it reconciles the spinal displacement so
 

113
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,350
it reconciles the spinal displacement so

this fake ass world of Kon waza okay try

330
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
this fake ass world of Kon waza okay try
 

331

this fake ass world of Kon waza okay try
it again all right progression two when

332
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:25,399
it again all right progression two when
 

333
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,870
it again all right progression two when
when I am inside his fingers

334
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:29,880
when I am inside his fingers
 

335
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,710
when I am inside his fingers
and not contesting the backward pulling

336
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:32,720
and not contesting the backward pulling
 

337
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,269
and not contesting the backward pulling
of

338
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:34,279
of
 

339
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,949
of
them what's moving him it's the adhesion

340
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:37,959
them what's moving him it's the adhesion
 

341
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,150
them what's moving him it's the adhesion
on his

342
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160

347
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,110

him instead of where I use the pull and

348
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
him instead of where I use the pull and
 

349
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,509
him instead of where I use the pull and
I pull against it

350
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:00,519
I pull against it
 

351
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,710
I pull against it

movement so again you can I'll try to

376
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:40,680
movement so again you can I'll try to
 

377
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,829
movement so again you can I'll try to
play with the

378
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:42,839
play with the
 

379
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,030
play with the
iy so that you see my skin

380
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,040
iy so that you see my skin
 

381
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,150
iy so that you see my skin
move okay which is telling you there's

382
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:49,160
move okay which is telling you there's
 

383
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,030
move okay which is telling you there's
friction there okay so just

384
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
friction there okay so just
 

385
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,590
friction there okay so just
relax okay so stay still stay still I'll

386
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:56,600
relax okay so stay still stay still I'll
 

387
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,069
relax okay so stay still stay still I'll
do it do you see see my skin

388
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
do it do you see see my skin
 

389
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,190
do it do you see see my skin
okay there's friction there

390
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,200

 

391
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,230

versus okay so I keep that

392
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
versus okay so I keep that
 

393
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,629
versus okay so I keep that
adhesion I work the

394
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:11,639
adhesion I work the
 

395
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,710
adhesion I work the
Palm I keep

396
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
Palm I keep
 

397
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,870
Palm I keep
it work

398
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:17,880
it work
 

399
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,389
it work
get

400
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:19,399
get
 

401
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,829
get
technique then you saw me slip it just

402
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:22,839
technique then you saw me slip it just
 

403
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,949
technique then you saw me slip it just
like in the ground fighting I don't want

404
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
like in the ground fighting I don't want
 

405
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,310
like in the ground fighting I don't want
the adhesion

406
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
the adhesion
 

407
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,590
the adhesion
anymore so I have to relax

408
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:30,600
anymore so I have to relax
 

409
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,509
anymore so I have to relax
my arm right here there's lots of

410
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:32,519
my arm right here there's lots of
 

411
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,430
my arm right here there's lots of
friction I'm he has his fingers right

412
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
friction I'm he has his fingers right
 

413
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,750
friction I'm he has his fingers right
and I'll keep the friction going but I

414
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
and I'll keep the friction going but I
 

415
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,509
and I'll keep the friction going but I
want it to slip now you see I relax the

416
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
want it to slip now you see I relax the
 

417
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,750
want it to slip now you see I relax the
arm I change the Y output

418
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:46,760

 

419
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,230

value if we doing this the other

420
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:49,240
value if we doing this the other
 

421
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,990
value if we doing this the other
techniques right should you're just

422
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
techniques right should you're just
 

423
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,230
techniques right should you're just
moving that Palm there it

424
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240

 

425
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,670

is

426
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680

 

427
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:10,710

keep it open

428
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720

 

429
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,150

right C keep it open I move it

430
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,160
right C keep it open I move it
 

431
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,150
right C keep it open I move it
inside you're going to feel

432
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,160

 

433
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,590

it hold the last technique keep it open

434
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:26,600
it hold the last technique keep it open
 

435
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,389
it hold the last technique keep it open
I'll make contact with you boom boom

436
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399

 

437
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,790

boom okay let's try so inside his grab

438
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:37,800
boom okay let's try so inside his grab
 

439
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,790
boom okay let's try so inside his grab
that's what I'm doing every time so

440
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:39,800
that's what I'm doing every time so
 

441
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,350
that's what I'm doing every time so
inside is grab you're not relying on the

442
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
inside is grab you're not relying on the
 

443
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,509
inside is grab you're not relying on the
pulling of the fingers to give you your

444
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
pulling of the fingers to give you your
 

445
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,189
pulling of the fingers to give you your
leverage points so inside your grab

446
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:49,199
leverage points so inside your grab
 

447
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:52,150
leverage points so inside your grab
you're doing the same thing okay and you

448
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
you're doing the same thing okay and you
 

449
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,670
you're doing the same thing okay and you
have to not rely on the fingers and then

450
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
have to not rely on the fingers and then
 

451
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,750
have to not rely on the fingers and then
try to overpower the finger pull okay

452
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:00,760
try to overpower the finger pull okay
 

453
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,110
try to overpower the finger pull okay
um in that last drill it looks like he's

454
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
um in that last drill it looks like he's
 

455
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,189
um in that last drill it looks like he's
like pushing on me but I just had his

456
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:09,199
like pushing on me but I just had his
 

457
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,790
like pushing on me but I just had his
hand there it's

458
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:11,800
hand there it's
 

459
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,790
hand there it's
loose okay he's not pushing on me I'm

loose okay he's not pushing on me I'm
 

461
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,710
loose okay he's not pushing on me I'm
just matching it okay it's not that he

462
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
just matching it okay it's not that he
 

463
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,949
just matching it okay it's not that he
pushes on me so the same thing here it's

464
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:21,959
pushes on me so the same thing here it's
 

465
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,910
pushes on me so the same thing here it's
not that he's pushing on me and I'm just

466
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
not that he's pushing on me and I'm just
 

467
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,110
not that he's pushing on me and I'm just
getting out of the way I'm stuck on the

468
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,120
getting out of the way I'm stuck on the
 

469
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,750
getting out of the way I'm stuck on the
inside I move him okay

470
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
inside I move him okay
 

471
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,110
inside I move him okay
I've demonstrated several times like um

472
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:34,120
I've demonstrated several times like um
 

473
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,910
I've demonstrated several times like um
he tries to pull back I'll stick to him

474
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
he tries to pull back I'll stick to him
 

475
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,310
he tries to pull back I'll stick to him
you could open it's sticky it's stickier

476
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
you could open it's sticky it's stickier
 

477
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,350
you could open it's sticky it's stickier
you

478
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:42,360
you
 

479
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,550
you
see or even in this last technique as as

480
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:45,560
see or even in this last technique as as
 

481
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,710
see or even in this last technique as as
we did the uh e

482
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
we did the uh e
 

483
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,189
we did the uh e
Minag you watch his try to get this hand

484
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:52,199
Minag you watch his try to get this hand
 

485
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:55,710
Minag you watch his try to get this hand
okay and you see that I'm pulling the

486
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:55,720
okay and you see that I'm pulling the
 

487
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,310
okay and you see that I'm pulling the
skin come

488
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:57,320
skin come
 

489
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,069
skin come
back pulling the skin his skin but I'm

490
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:01,079
back pulling the skin his skin but I'm
 

491
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,870
back pulling the skin his skin but I'm
not grabbing it I'm just pulling it and

492
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
not grabbing it I'm just pulling it and
 

493
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,629
not grabbing it I'm just pulling it and
he tries to pull away more it get there

494
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:07,639
he tries to pull away more it get there
 

495
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,790
he tries to pull away more it get there
more skin right there's more friction

496
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
more skin right there's more friction
 

497
