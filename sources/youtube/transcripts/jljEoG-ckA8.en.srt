00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:11,759
posture okay this is very important when
 

49
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:14,310
posture okay this is very important when
it comes to a throwing art because we're

50
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
it comes to a throwing art because we're
 

51
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,030
it comes to a throwing art because we're
trying to throw people uh from their

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
trying to throw people uh from their
 

53
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,030

so to speak okay a couple things here

58
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
so to speak okay a couple things here
 

59
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,630
so to speak okay a couple things here
that we have to remember aside from

60
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:27,640
that we have to remember aside from
 

61
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,390
that we have to remember aside from
equilibrium means balance um um is that

62
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:31,400
equilibrium means balance um um is that
 

63
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,550
equilibrium means balance um um is that
equilibrium is always dynamic in the

64
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
equilibrium is always dynamic in the
 

65
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,870
equilibrium is always dynamic in the
human body and especially in the human

66
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:37,880
human body and especially in the human
 

67
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,310
human body and especially in the human
body martially speaking so I'm going to

68
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,320
body martially speaking so I'm going to
 

69
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,670
body martially speaking so I'm going to
give it to you here static so that we

70
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:44,680
give it to you here static so that we
 

71
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,429
give it to you here static so that we
understand the elements but we must

72
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:46,439
understand the elements but we must
 

73
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,350
understand the elements but we must
never forget that it is always Dynamic

74
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:50,360
never forget that it is always Dynamic
 

75
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,270
never forget that it is always Dynamic
that really plays a role when it comes

76
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:52,280
that really plays a role when it comes
 

77
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,950
that really plays a role when it comes
to fight applications okay so the

78
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:55,960
to fight applications okay so the
 

79
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,950
to fight applications okay so the
elements of posture or upright position

80
00:01:59,950 --> 00:01:59,960
elements of posture or upright position
 

81
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,950
elements of posture or upright position
balanced person um are three fold uh one

82
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
balanced person um are three fold uh one
 

83
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,029
balanced person um are three fold uh one
you have the center of

84
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:07,039
you have the center of
 

85
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,910
you have the center of
gravity and two you have the Bas of

86
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
gravity and two you have the Bas of
 

87
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,150
gravity and two you have the Bas of
support so the Bas of support are the

88
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,160
support so the Bas of support are the
 

89
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,750

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
points um in this case let's say the
 

93
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,869
points um in this case let's say the
feet so one foot and the other foot the

106
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:35,720
support then you have a theoretical line
 

107
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,869

any movement at all right at touch so if

204
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:19,400
any movement at all right at touch so if
 

205
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,909
any movement at all right at touch so if
you what you would look for I guess is

206
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:22,919
you what you would look for I guess is
 

207
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,790
you what you would look for I guess is
as soon as you see my ukas either touch

208
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:25,800
as soon as you see my ukas either touch
 

209
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,590
as soon as you see my ukas either touch
me here or I touch them you kind of see

210
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:28,600
me here or I touch them you kind of see
 

211
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,430
me here or I touch them you kind of see
them experience this kind of contraction

212
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
them experience this kind of contraction
 

213
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,230
them experience this kind of contraction
that's happening um it's also what you

214
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
that's happening um it's also what you
 

215
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,590
that's happening um it's also what you
see when I share the taiichi videos

216
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
see when I share the taiichi videos

00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,670
energetic level you always see that kind
of happening okay and I'm sorry it's

226
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:54,680
of happening okay and I'm sorry it's
 

227
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,710
of happening okay and I'm sorry it's
just not in iido it's not in iido after

just not in iido it's not in iido after
after ensei you just don't see it

230
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:00,680
after ensei you just don't see it
 

231
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,469
after ensei you just don't see it

okay um but that is what we do at touch

234
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:09,639
okay um but that is what we do at touch
 

235
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,350
okay um but that is what we do at touch
so it looks on the surface that

236
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:14,360
so it looks on the surface that
 

237
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,469
so it looks on the surface that
everything is still in place and the

238
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:17,479
everything is still in place and the
 

239
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,270
everything is still in place and the
body remains upright but something has

240
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,280
body remains upright but something has
 

241
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,909
body remains upright but something has
changed in the seizure of the center in

242
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
changed in the seizure of the center in
 

243
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,749
changed in the seizure of the center in
this model where the person is upright

244
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:26,759
this model where the person is upright
 

245
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,469
this model where the person is upright
the person has control of their Center

246
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:31,479
the person has control of their Center
 

247
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,029
the person has control of their Center
and they position it within their base

248
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:34,039
and they position it within their base
 

249
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,749
and they position it within their base
of support and they remain

250
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:36,759
of support and they remain
 

251
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,909
of support and they remain
upright here they don't have control of

252
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
upright here they don't have control of
 

253
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,990
upright here they don't have control of
their Center but for the time being it

254
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,000
their Center but for the time being it
 

255
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,110
their Center but for the time being it
is left within the base of support and

256
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,120
is left within the base of support and
 

257
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,710
is left within the base of support and
so they remain upright but they don't

258
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
so they remain upright but they don't
 

259
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,469
so they remain upright but they don't
have control of their center that is

260
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
have control of their center that is
 

261
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,830
have control of their center that is
very very important okay because we're

262
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
very very important okay because we're
 

263
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,270
very very important okay because we're
going to do something with

264
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,280
going to do something with
 

265
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,670
going to do something with
that we are going to take this control

266
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
that we are going to take this control
 

267
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,390
that we are going to take this control
of the center as the seed as aiten is

268
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:03,400
of the center as the seed as aiten is
 

269
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,430
of the center as the seed as aiten is
the seed of

270
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440

 

271
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,710

kazushi and then we want to understand

272
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
kazushi and then we want to understand
 

273
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,990
kazushi and then we want to understand
something uh and this is the important

274
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,000
something uh and this is the important
 

275
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,189
something uh and this is the important
part on what makes sensin iido martially

276
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
part on what makes sensin iido martially
 

277
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,390
part on what makes sensin iido martially
viable and what makes ferite iido modern

278
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:21,400
viable and what makes ferite iido modern
 

279
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,589
viable and what makes ferite iido modern
iido not martially viable

280
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:24,599
iido not martially viable
 

281
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,230
iido not martially viable
okay so we are going to generate

282
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
okay so we are going to generate
 

283
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,670
okay so we are going to generate

kazushi but we do it in the following

288
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759
kazushi but we do it in the following
 

289
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,469
kazushi but we do it in the following
way we take the C's Center

290
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:39,479
way we take the C's Center
 

291
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,110
way we take the C's Center
gravity and we move

292
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,120
gravity and we move
 

293
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,550
gravity and we move
it out from on top of the basis support

294
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
it out from on top of the basis support
 

295
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,029
it out from on top of the basis support
so the line of gravity the theoretical

296
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
so the line of gravity the theoretical
 

297
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,230
so the line of gravity the theoretical
line from the center of gravity to the

298
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,240
line from the center of gravity to the
 

299
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,749
line from the center of gravity to the

300
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
surface on upon which the base support
 

301
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,469
surface on upon which the base support
rest is going to fall outside of the

00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:57,479
rest is going to fall outside of the
 

303
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,510
rest is going to fall outside of the
basis support here are my feet and the

basis support here are my feet and the
 

305
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,909
basis support here are my feet and the
area between my feet and as we move this

306
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:02,919
area between my feet and as we move this
 

307
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,430

gravity one way we always move the Bas

310
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
gravity one way we always move the Bas
 

311
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,749

of support another way the opposite way
 

313
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,710
of support another way the opposite way
okay that way as we mentioned in the

314
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:17,720
okay that way as we mentioned in the
 

315
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,950
okay that way as we mentioned in the
last video when we generate the Topsy

316
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:19,960
last video when we generate the Topsy
 

317
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,909
last video when we generate the Topsy
Turvy effect we kicked out the legs one

318
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
Turvy effect we kicked out the legs one
 

319
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,070
Turvy effect we kicked out the legs one
way and we made the head go the other

320
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,080
way and we made the head go the other
 

321
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,309
way and we made the head go the other
way okay and as we did that is we tilt

322
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
way okay and as we did that is we tilt
 

323
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,110
way okay and as we did that is we tilt
the

324

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,000
the difference is they accelerate UK so
 

349
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,910
the difference is they accelerate UK so
what they do is they

350
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
what they do is they
 

351
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,350
what they do is they
leave this basis support under here and

352
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:16,360
leave this basis support under here and
 

353
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,550
leave this basis support under here and
they attempt to by linking or pulling on

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:19,560
they attempt to by linking or pulling on
 

355
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,550
they attempt to by linking or pulling on

move the center of gravity outside of

358
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:25,880
move the center of gravity outside of
 

359
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,590
move the center of gravity outside of
the Bas of

360
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
the Bas of
 

361
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:36,910
the Bas of
support that would look like

362
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:36,920

 

363
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,190

this let's say here's the Bas of

364
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
this let's say here's the Bas of
 

365
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,310
this let's say here's the Bas of
support the area in

366
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320

 

367
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,310

between they don't have a c

368
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:51,320

 

369
00:09:51,320 --> 00:10:07,150

Center they just have a center gravity

370
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,160

 

371
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,030

and then they

372
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040

 

373
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,230

try to move

374
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:13,240
try to move
 

375
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,190
try to move
it this

376
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200

 

377
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,350

way until

378
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360

 

379
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,590

eventually they get

380
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:24,600
eventually they get
 

381
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,509
eventually they get
it somewhere over

382
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
it somewhere over
 

383
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,430
it somewhere over
here outside of the Bas B support so the

384
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:30,440
here outside of the Bas B support so the
 

385
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,190
here outside of the Bas B support so the
line is

386
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200

 

387
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,310

here line of

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:35,320
here line of
 

389
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,990
here line of

always just moves their base of support

398
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,000
always just moves their base of support
 

399
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,829
always just moves their base of support
with you moving their line of gravity

400
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
with you moving their line of gravity
 

401
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,030
with you moving their line of gravity
and they don't

402
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
and they don't
 

403
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,870
and they don't
fall they reposition they change levels

404
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
fall they reposition they change levels
 

405
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,949
fall they reposition they change levels
they Counterattack okay and so

406
00:10:59,949 --> 00:10:59,959
they Counterattack okay and so
 

407
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,870
they Counterattack okay and so
acceleration or passive generation of

acceleration or passive generation of
 

409
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,350

dise equilibrium just does not function

410
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:06,360
dise equilibrium just does not function
 

411
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,870
dise equilibrium just does not function
martially it doesn't Okay so hence

412
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
martially it doesn't Okay so hence
 

413
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,750
martially it doesn't Okay so hence
why I'm opposed to acceleration throws

414
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:14,760
why I'm opposed to acceleration throws
 

415
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,430
why I'm opposed to acceleration throws
and I want to see x pattern throws I

416
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
and I want to see x pattern throws I
 

417
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,910
and I want to see x pattern throws I
want to see the two main elements of

418
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
want to see the two main elements of
 

419
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,949
want to see the two main elements of
equilibrium move apart from each other

420
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
equilibrium move apart from each other
 

421
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,310
equilibrium move apart from each other
and unable to move back towards each

422
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:27,320
and unable to move back towards each
 

423
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,629
and unable to move back towards each
other okay so let's get into that in

424
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:31,639
other okay so let's get into that in
 

425
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:36,790
other okay so let's get into that in
this ushida kiten net now all right um a

426
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
this ushida kiten net now all right um a
 

427
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,430
this ushida kiten net now all right um a
couple things to bring into the

428
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
couple things to bring into the
 

429
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,030
couple things to bring into the
technique uh because I have to move the

430
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,040
technique uh because I have to move the
 

431
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,269
technique uh because I have to move the
center of

432
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
center of
 

433
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,949
center of
gravity and the line of gravity outside

gravity and the line of gravity outside
 

435
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,310
gravity and the line of gravity outside
the base of support I I have to do that

436
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
the base of support I I have to do that
 

437
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,150
the base of support I I have to do that
directly I have to do it I have to move

438
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,160
directly I have to do it I have to move
 

439
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,430
directly I have to do it I have to move
it until it's out of the base of support

440
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:58,440
it until it's out of the base of support
 

441
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,670
it until it's out of the base of support
I don't want to to push it in the

442
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:00,680
I don't want to to push it in the
 

443
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,190
I don't want to to push it in the
direction of going

444
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:02,200
direction of going
 

445
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,829
direction of going
outside and then inertia or acceleration

446
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:06,839
outside and then inertia or acceleration
 

447
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,910
outside and then inertia or acceleration
continues it past the Bas of support

448
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:09,920
continues it past the Bas of support
 

449
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,870
continues it past the Bas of support
okay so let me we we bend them over in

450
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:13,880
okay so let me we we bend them over in
 

451
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,150
okay so let me we we bend them over in
kiten n and so right now her center of

452
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,160
kiten n and so right now her center of
 

453
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,949
kiten n and so right now her center of
gravity is in her

454
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
gravity is in her
 

455
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,670
gravity is in her
hot but as she starts to lean over the

456
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:22,680
hot but as she starts to lean over the
 

457
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,790
hot but as she starts to lean over the
center of gravity travels up the body

458
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:25,800
center of gravity travels up the body
 

459
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,509
center of gravity travels up the body
and the line of gravity moves forward

460
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:28,519
and the line of gravity moves forward
 

461
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,829
and the line of gravity moves forward
see

462
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
see
 

463
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,430
see
okay and we keep going and that line of

464
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
okay and we keep going and that line of
 

465
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,189
okay and we keep going and that line of
gravity is now somewhere around here now

466
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:38,199
gravity is now somewhere around here now
 

467
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:39,829
gravity is now somewhere around here now
if I

468
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
if I
 

469
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,430
if I
keep taking her this way eventually it

470
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
keep taking her this way eventually it
 

471
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,430
keep taking her this way eventually it
will pass outside her toes and it'll

472
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:46,440
will pass outside her toes and it'll
 

473
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,189
will pass outside her toes and it'll
generate the loss of balance

474
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:50,199
generate the loss of balance
 

475
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:55,829
generate the loss of balance
okay now if that's all I do so let's say

476
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
okay now if that's all I do so let's say
 

477
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,829
okay now if that's all I do so let's say
I directly take the line of gravity so

478
00:12:58,829 --> 00:12:58,839
I directly take the line of gravity so
 

479
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:01,990
I directly take the line of gravity so
I'm going to push so that my hand passes

480
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm going to push so that my hand passes
 

481
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,269
I'm going to push so that my hand passes
her toes my hand will pass her toes

482
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
her toes my hand will pass her toes
 

483
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,870
her toes my hand will pass her toes
okay that's an example of me directly

484
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:11,880
okay that's an example of me directly
 

485
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,389
okay that's an example of me directly
causing that to

486
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
causing that to
 

487
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,750
causing that to
happen an

488
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:16,760
happen an
 

489
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,949
happen an
acceleration is

490
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
acceleration is
 

491
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,350
acceleration is
me pushing to her toes or towards her

492
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
me pushing to her toes or towards her
 

493
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,030
me pushing to her toes or towards her
toes but not directly going past it this

494
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,040
toes but not directly going past it this
 

495
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,910
toes but not directly going past it this
is what I'm trying to do

496
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:32,920

 

497
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,030

and you can generate a little more and

498
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,040
and you can generate a little more and
 

499
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,310
and you can generate a little more and
it'll work okay but as you can see in

500
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
it'll work okay but as you can see in
 

501
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,269
it'll work okay but as you can see in
each case she didn't do a forward roll

502
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:44,279
each case she didn't do a forward roll
 

503
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,150
each case she didn't do a forward roll
because she can reposition her basic

504
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
because she can reposition her basic
 

505
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,150
because she can reposition her basic
support back under so I will do the

506
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
support back under so I will do the
 

507
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,430
support back under so I will do the
direct method where my hand itself

508
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
direct method where my hand itself
 

509
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,189
direct method where my hand itself
passes her basis support and you can

510
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:56,199
passes her basis support and you can
 

511
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:59,350
passes her basis support and you can
watch that she's just stepping under it

512
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
watch that she's just stepping under it
 

513
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,870
watch that she's just stepping under it
and regains her

514
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:01,880
and regains her
 

515
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,749
and regains her
balance even on the acceleration one she

516
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:05,759
balance even on the acceleration one she
 

517
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,949
balance even on the acceleration one she
can do the

518
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:07,959
can do the
 

519
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,790
can do the
same they don't do forward rolls

520
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:11,800
same they don't do forward rolls
 

521
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:18,110
same they don't do forward rolls
okay now if I stop her body from moving

522
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,120
okay now if I stop her body from moving
 

523
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,550
okay now if I stop her body from moving
forward and I do the

524
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
forward and I do the
 

525
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,069
forward and I do the
same moving her

526
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:23,079
same moving her
 

527
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,790
same moving her
forward she will eventually fall out

528
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:27,800
forward she will eventually fall out
 

529
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,870
forward she will eventually fall out
okay if if I take her legs in the

530
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
okay if if I take her legs in the
 

531
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,230
okay if if I take her legs in the
opposite

532
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
opposite
 

533
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,350
opposite
direction so here I'm still trying to

534
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
direction so here I'm still trying to
 

535
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,389
direction so here I'm still trying to
bring her Center gravity upper body line

536
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:39,399
bring her Center gravity upper body line
 

537
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,749
bring her Center gravity upper body line
of gravity outside her base support if I

538
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:41,759
of gravity outside her base support if I
 

539
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,389
of gravity outside her base support if I
take her legs like a reow so that her

540
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:45,399
take her legs like a reow so that her
 

541
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,509
take her legs like a reow so that her
legs are going I won't do the top part

542
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
legs are going I won't do the top part
 

543
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,389
legs are going I won't do the top part
but her legs are going

544
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:49,399
but her legs are going
 

545
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:52,829
but her legs are going
by now she's going to fall every time so

546
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:52,839
by now she's going to fall every time so
 

547
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,629
by now she's going to fall every time so
you doing the same thing she's going to

548
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:55,639
you doing the same thing she's going to
 

549
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,790
you doing the same thing she's going to
fall every time no athleticism is going

550
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
fall every time no athleticism is going
 

551
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,069
fall every time no athleticism is going
to let her bring her legs back

552
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:01,079
to let her bring her legs back
 

553
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,829
to let her bring her legs back
underneath her okay so that's a kind of

554
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
underneath her okay so that's a kind of
 

555
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,910
underneath her okay so that's a kind of
understanding of what we're talking

556
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:04,920
understanding of what we're talking
 

557
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,430
understanding of what we're talking
about so let's focus in on the

558
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:08,440
about so let's focus in on the
 

559
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,110
about so let's focus in on the
arm we're kind of in this

560
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,120
arm we're kind of in this
 

561
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,470
arm we're kind of in this
position and we have this arm in Kaiten

562
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
position and we have this arm in Kaiten
 

563
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,910
position and we have this arm in Kaiten
nag and this is very very common

564
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:20,920
nag and this is very very common
 

565
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,230
nag and this is very very common
that I just

566
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,240
that I just
 

567
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,590
that I just
accelerate the arm let's have it more

568
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:26,600
accelerate the arm let's have it more
 

569
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,269
accelerate the arm let's have it more
like the technique so let's bring your

570
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:29,279
like the technique so let's bring your
 

571
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,949
like the technique so let's bring your
right foot forward there you go okay we

572
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
right foot forward there you go okay we
 

573
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,030
right foot forward there you go okay we
here like

574
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,040
here like
 

575
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,150
here like
this and you kind of give that cue to

576
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,160
this and you kind of give that cue to
 

577
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,269
this and you kind of give that cue to
the

578
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:38,279
the
 

579
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,670
the
UK

580
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:40,680
UK
 

581
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,590
UK
okay there's something to notice here

582
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:44,600
okay there's something to notice here
 

583
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,309
okay there's something to notice here
this this is the shoulder

584
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:46,319
this this is the shoulder
 

585
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:49,629
this this is the shoulder
joint and there's a lot of

586
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:49,639
joint and there's a lot of
 

587
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:53,790
joint and there's a lot of
slack as the contact point at the wrist

588
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:53,800
slack as the contact point at the wrist
 

589
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,710
slack as the contact point at the wrist
travels without manipulating the center

590
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
travels without manipulating the center
 

591
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,350
travels without manipulating the center
of gravity and that's the line of

592
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:58,360
of gravity and that's the line of
 

593
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,949
of gravity and that's the line of
gravity so I'm here like this and the

594
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:01,959
gravity so I'm here like this and the
 

595
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,790
gravity so I'm here like this and the
joint is

596
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
joint is
 

597
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,870
joint is
absorbing all of the

598
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:07,880
absorbing all of the
 

599
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,389
absorbing all of the
force and I have not affected the line

600
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:11,399
force and I have not affected the line
 

601
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,790
force and I have not affected the line
of gravity at all and you will not

602
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:13,800
of gravity at all and you will not
 

603
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,309
of gravity at all and you will not
affect it until on this on this path

604
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:18,319
affect it until on this on this path
 

605
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:21,269
affect it until on this on this path
that all the ferides take you will not

606
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
that all the ferides take you will not
 

607
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,230
that all the ferides take you will not
affect it and I'll just have her tell me

608
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:25,240
affect it and I'll just have her tell me
 

609
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,829
affect it and I'll just have her tell me
when it gets tight so the viewer on the

610
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
when it gets tight so the viewer on the
 

611
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:39,150
when it gets tight so the viewer on the
camera can feel it

612
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:39,160

 

613
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,269

okay so now it's running out of slack

614
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:42,279
okay so now it's running out of slack
 

615
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,910
okay so now it's running out of slack
and now at this point as I go you can

616
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
and now at this point as I go you can
 

617
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,629
and now at this point as I go you can
see that it will start to manipulate the

618
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:48,639
see that it will start to manipulate the
 

619
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,590
see that it will start to manipulate the
center of her

620
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:50,600
center of her
 

621
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,470
center of her
body

622
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
body
 

623
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,269
body
okay but as I said equilibrium is

624
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:56,279
okay but as I said equilibrium is
 

625
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,870
okay but as I said equilibrium is
dynamic and so what if I stay on this

626
00:16:59,870 --> 00:16:59,880
dynamic and so what if I stay on this
 

627
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,629
dynamic and so what if I stay on this
fedorite

628
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:01,639
fedorite
 

629
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,549
fedorite
trajectory as she starts to turn I got

630
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:05,559
trajectory as she starts to turn I got
 

631
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,189
trajectory as she starts to turn I got
to hold her and she's got to tell us so

632
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:08,199
to hold her and she's got to tell us so
 

633
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,350
to hold her and she's got to tell us so
here's where that tension is that she

634
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:10,360
here's where that tension is that she
 

635
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,990
here's where that tension is that she
felt but as she starts to turn her body

636
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,000
felt but as she starts to turn her body
 

637
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,710
felt but as she starts to turn her body
you can see that the relationship

638
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
you can see that the relationship
 

639
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,150
you can see that the relationship
changed on the shoulder so come back

640
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
changed on the shoulder so come back
 

641
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,110
changed on the shoulder so come back
look where I am to her shoulder joint

642
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,120
look where I am to her shoulder joint
 

643
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,470
look where I am to her shoulder joint
but as she starts to roll I'm not in

644
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:27,480
but as she starts to roll I'm not in
 

645
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,470
but as she starts to roll I'm not in
that anymore stay where you are right

646
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:29,480
that anymore stay where you are right
 

647
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,710
that anymore stay where you are right
now here's where that tension is do you

648
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
now here's where that tension is do you
 

649
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,990
now here's where that tension is do you
see it's so you

650
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
see it's so you
 

651
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,390
see it's so you
can't here no direct effect on the line

652
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,400
can't here no direct effect on the line
 

653
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,470
can't here no direct effect on the line
of gravity till about here and as she

654
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
of gravity till about here and as she
 

655
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,870
of gravity till about here and as she
starts to roll it starts to go off do

656
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:47,880
starts to roll it starts to go off do
 

657
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,669
starts to roll it starts to go off do
you see so now I'm not directly causing

658
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:51,679
you see so now I'm not directly causing
 

659
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,510
you see so now I'm not directly causing
equilibrium it's passive equilibrium

660
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:54,520
equilibrium it's passive equilibrium
 

661
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,830
equilibrium it's passive equilibrium
okay but usually what happens is the

662
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
okay but usually what happens is the
 

663
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,310
okay but usually what happens is the
she's going to roll so scoop back the

664
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
she's going to roll so scoop back the
 

665
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,830
she's going to roll so scoop back the
the D Pony UK feels that and that's

666
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:04,840
the D Pony UK feels that and that's
 

667
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,510
the D Pony UK feels that and that's
their cute to go but no one does that in

668
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,520
their cute to go but no one does that in
 

669
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,230
their cute to go but no one does that in
a fight okay so as she's trying to turn

670
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:11,240
a fight okay so as she's trying to turn
 

671
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,270
a fight okay so as she's trying to turn
my my hand around and she's trying to do

672
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:14,280
my my hand around and she's trying to do
 

673
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,590
my my hand around and she's trying to do
that and I feel my balance and I regain

674
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
that and I feel my balance and I regain
 

675
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,710
that and I feel my balance and I regain
my

676
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:18,720
my
 

677
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,549
my
posture as that as that slack goes off

678
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:21,559
posture as that as that slack goes off
 

679
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,430
posture as that as that slack goes off
so here she is let's control my head

680
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:24,440
so here she is let's control my head
 

681
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,669
so here she is let's control my head
here let's change feet okay so as she

682
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
here let's change feet okay so as she
 

683
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,789
here let's change feet okay so as she
starts to go there's no tension there go

684
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
starts to go there's no tension there go
 

685
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,270
starts to go there's no tension there go
back so from here to there there's no

686
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:36,280
back so from here to there there's no
 

687
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,190
back so from here to there there's no
effect on my center of gravity until she

688
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
effect on my center of gravity until she
 

689
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,310
effect on my center of gravity until she
hits the joint tension there it is and

690
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,320
hits the joint tension there it is and
 

691
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,510
hits the joint tension there it is and
as I start to turn it comes off again

692
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
as I start to turn it comes off again
 

693
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,230
as I start to turn it comes off again
and I'm back in to

694
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:47,240
and I'm back in to
 

695
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,390
and I'm back in to
fight that's what everyone will do

696
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:49,400
fight that's what everyone will do
 

697
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,870
fight that's what everyone will do
that's

698
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880

 

699
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,750

fighting

700
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
fighting
 

701
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,510
fighting
so there is a couple ways is where you

702
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
so there is a couple ways is where you
 

703
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,950
so there is a couple ways is where you
get the arm

704
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
get the arm
 

705
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,669
get the arm
tension it's not

706
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
tension it's not
 

707
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,270
tension it's not
here there's too much slack there you

708
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
here there's too much slack there you
 

709
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,789
here there's too much slack there you
have to figure out where that

710
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:11,799
have to figure out where that
 

711
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,590
have to figure out where that
is so if you pay attention when I'm back

712
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600
is so if you pay attention when I'm back
 

713
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,390
is so if you pay attention when I'm back
here no arm tension in the shoulder no

714
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:19,400
here no arm tension in the shoulder no
 

715
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,430
here no arm tension in the shoulder no
direct manipulation of the

716
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,440
direct manipulation of the
 

717
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,630
direct manipulation of the
center if I come out here you can see

718
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:25,640
center if I come out here you can see
 

719
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,390
center if I come out here you can see
how more readily that is

720
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:29,400
how more readily that is
 

721
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,149
how more readily that is
okay and usually we do this technique

722
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:33,159
okay and usually we do this technique
 

723
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:36,149
okay and usually we do this technique
because I'm going to turn her so for

724
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:36,159
because I'm going to turn her so for
 

725
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,029
because I'm going to turn her so for
example I'm bring her head this way and

726
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:40,039
example I'm bring her head this way and
 

727
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,390
example I'm bring her head this way and
that generates more arm tension as we're

728
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:43,400
that generates more arm tension as we're
 

729
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,230
that generates more arm tension as we're
coming along and then I move

730
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:47,240
coming along and then I move
 

731
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,430
coming along and then I move
into that Yin spot where she gets it

732
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:50,440
into that Yin spot where she gets it
 

733
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,750
into that Yin spot where she gets it
back so I would be moving this way okay

734
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:54,760
back so I would be moving this way okay
 

735
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,710
back so I would be moving this way okay
and I stay there as best you can and now

736
00:19:59,710 --> 00:19:59,720
and I stay there as best you can and now
 

737
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,190
and I stay there as best you can and now
there's arm tension here affecting her

738
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,200
there's arm tension here affecting her
 

739
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,270
there's arm tension here affecting her
Center this

740
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:04,280
Center this
 

741
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,430
Center this
way we'll do it one more

742
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:08,440

 

743
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,510

time so to get that arm tension The

744
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:12,520
time so to get that arm tension The
 

745
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,149
time so to get that arm tension The
Joint has to the hand has to be above

746
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:16,159
Joint has to the hand has to be above
 

747
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,390
Joint has to the hand has to be above
forward of the shoulder when the hand is

748
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:19,400
forward of the shoulder when the hand is
 

749
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,190
forward of the shoulder when the hand is
back of the shoulder there's no arm

750
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
back of the shoulder there's no arm
 

751
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,630
back of the shoulder there's no arm
tension when the hand is above the

752
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
tension when the hand is above the
 

753
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,149
tension when the hand is above the
shoulder towards the head side of the

754
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:28,159
shoulder towards the head side of the
 

755
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,710
shoulder towards the head side of the
shoulder you will get the arm

756
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:31,720
shoulder you will get the arm
 

757
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,750
shoulder you will get the arm
tension more readily okay and in the

758
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
tension more readily okay and in the
 

759
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,510
tension more readily okay and in the
technique that I did when we do this I

760
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:38,520
technique that I did when we do this I
 

761
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,149
technique that I did when we do this I
try to always keep the hand north of the

762
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
try to always keep the hand north of the
 

763
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,630
try to always keep the hand north of the
shoulder and then that joint will not

764
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:47,640
shoulder and then that joint will not
 

765
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,590
shoulder and then that joint will not
take the slack out of the control of her

766
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:50,600
take the slack out of the control of her
 

767
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,470
take the slack out of the control of her
Center but that is not kit knet okay but

768
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:55,480
Center but that is not kit knet okay but
 

769
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,950
Center but that is not kit knet okay but
that's the only time I ever used a hand

770
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960
that's the only time I ever used a hand
 

771
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,950
that's the only time I ever used a hand
to manipulate the

772
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
to manipulate the
 

773
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,990
to manipulate the
center in the

774
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,000

 

775
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,549

technique we uh let's move

776
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
technique we uh let's move
 

777
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,470
technique we uh let's move
for in the

778
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:11,480
for in the
 

779
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,390
for in the
technique we

780
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:13,400
technique we
 

781
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,430
technique we
use this fact that she is uh step back

782
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:18,440
use this fact that she is uh step back
 

783
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,070
use this fact that she is uh step back
with your right foot that she's coming

784
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,080
with your right foot that she's coming
 

785
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:29,990
with your right foot that she's coming
around this way

786
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000

 

787
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,029

and we use up the

788
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:34,039
and we use up the
 

789
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:39,990
and we use up the
joint to

790
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000

 

791
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,029

project this way

792
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039

 

793
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,510

boom and so that is right

794
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
boom and so that is right
 

795
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,830
boom and so that is right
here and just to do it

796
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:52,840
here and just to do it
 

797
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,909
here and just to do it
externally it is

798
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
externally it is
 

799
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:06,590
externally it is
a direct app ation of displacing

800
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:06,600

 

801
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,350

them this to there change feet

802
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
them this to there change feet
 

803
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,070
them this to there change feet
okay and you have to displace her past

804
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
okay and you have to displace her past
 

805
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,750
okay and you have to displace her past
her Bas of support so if I only go like

806
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:20,760
her Bas of support so if I only go like
 

807
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,909
her Bas of support so if I only go like
that her line of gravity never traveled

808
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:23,919
that her line of gravity never traveled
 

809
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,909
that her line of gravity never traveled
outside her Bas of support your

810
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:26,919
outside her Bas of support your
 

811
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:31,950
outside her Bas of support your
projection must move her Center outside

812
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:31,960
projection must move her Center outside
 

813
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,830
projection must move her Center outside
that

814
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
that
 

815
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,920
that
foot okay so when you're doing the

816
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:37,930
foot okay so when you're doing the
 

817
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,710
foot okay so when you're doing the

throw and this is why my ukas don't

820
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
throw and this is why my ukas don't
 

821
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,750
throw and this is why my ukas don't
roll right where they're

822
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
roll right where they're
 

823
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,870
roll right where they're
at they find their roll somewhere out

824
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
at they find their roll somewhere out
 

825
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,350
at they find their roll somewhere out
there because the center got projected

826
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,360
there because the center got projected
 

827
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,470
there because the center got projected
past the Bas of support

828
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,480
past the Bas of support
 

829
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,350
past the Bas of support

being used
 

969
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,590
being used
to displace an opponent even to throw

970
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:44,600
to displace an opponent even to throw
 

971
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,830
to displace an opponent even to throw
them okay it's not actually being used

972
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:47,840
them okay it's not actually being used
 

973
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,070
them okay it's not actually being used
so common ones and myid don't know this

974
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,080
so common ones and myid don't know this
 

975
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,110
so common ones and myid don't know this
so uh just kind of understand that so

976
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
so uh just kind of understand that so
 

977
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,350
so uh just kind of understand that so
common ones for example is is I do K

978
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:00,360
common ones for example is is I do K

okay and so as she let's say she wants

988
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:18,600
okay and so as she let's say she wants
 

989
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,669
okay and so as she let's say she wants
to go that way you want to resist and

990
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:21,679
to go that way you want to resist and
 

991
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,470
to go that way you want to resist and
pull that way okay she feels the power

992
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480
pull that way okay she feels the power
 

993
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,110
pull that way okay she feels the power
of the clo okay that's what she feels

994
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,120
of the clo okay that's what she feels
 

995
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,350
of the clo okay that's what she feels
like I'm very strong there okay very

996
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,360
like I'm very strong there okay very
 

997
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,669
like I'm very strong there okay very
powerful she also

998
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:35,679
powerful she also
 

999
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,630
powerful she also
feels the grounding foot so as she tries

1000
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
feels the grounding foot so as she tries
 

1001
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,549
feels the grounding foot so as she tries
to resist the throw she she feels that

1002
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:43,559
to resist the throw she she feels that
 

1003
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,669
to resist the throw she she feels that
leg

1004
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:44,679
leg
 

1005
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,190
leg
grounding then the qua

1006
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:48,200
grounding then the qua
 

1007
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,509
grounding then the qua
moves and you have the

1008
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:51,519
moves and you have the
 

1009
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,549
moves and you have the
power in feride iido start

1010
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:55,559
power in feride iido start
 

1011
00:27:55,559 --> 00:28:02,310
power in feride iido start
over you you're going to do a ten con

1012
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:02,320

 

1013
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,870

there okay get something here and I ten

1014
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:07,880
there okay get something here and I ten
 

1015
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,190
there okay get something here and I ten
con into the

1016
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,200
con into the
 

1017
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,070
con into the
Thro and we'll go kind of slow so you

1018
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,080
Thro and we'll go kind of slow so you
 

1019
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,870
Thro and we'll go kind of slow so you
can see where I will lose my my power so

1020
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:18,880
can see where I will lose my my power so
 

1021
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,549
can see where I will lose my my power so
she's going to again resist she's trying

1022
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:21,559
she's going to again resist she's trying
 

1023
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,110
she's going to again resist she's trying
to go straight ahead fighting the throat

1024
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,120
to go straight ahead fighting the throat
 

1025
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,909
to go straight ahead fighting the throat
okay and so here she's going to feel

1026
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:26,919
okay and so here she's going to feel
 

1027
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:29,870
okay and so here she's going to feel
that front foot but as I start to turn

1028
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:29,880
that front foot but as I start to turn
 

1029
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,269
that front foot but as I start to turn
around she's still trying to go that way

1030
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:33,279
around she's still trying to go that way
 

1031
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,909
around she's still trying to go that way
then I start to lose the Integrity of it

1032
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:36,919
then I start to lose the Integrity of it
 

1033
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:38,630
then I start to lose the Integrity of it
I I think you could just walk forward

1034
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:38,640
I I think you could just walk forward
 

1035
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,710
I I think you could just walk forward
right about

1036
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:41,720

 

1037
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,029

now but no one experiences that because

1038
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:46,039
now but no one experiences that because
 

1039
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:50,509
now but no one experiences that because
the UK always has the CU here's the que

1040
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:50,519
the UK always has the CU here's the que
 

1041
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:52,750
the UK always has the CU here's the que
and then they go they go ahead and throw

1042
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:52,760
and then they go they go ahead and throw
 

1043
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,710
and then they go they go ahead and throw
themselves okay so same thing here on

1044
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:56,720
themselves okay so same thing here on
 

1045
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,950
themselves okay so same thing here on
this technique

1046
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:58,960
this technique
 

1047
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,430
this technique
we came

1048
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:01,440
we came
 

1049
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,190
we came
under that's my que you see I

1050
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:06,200
under that's my que you see I
 

1051
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,870
under that's my que you see I
can do the

1052
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:09,880

 

1053
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,710

10 okay so let's put the other foot

1054
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:14,720
10 okay so let's put the other foot
 

1055
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,029
10 okay so let's put the other foot
back okay and I have

1056
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:18,039
back okay and I have
 

1057
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:23,750
back okay and I have
to bring her forward into the throwing

1058
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:23,760
to bring her forward into the throwing
 

1059
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,750
to bring her forward into the throwing
angle okay so she's going to

1060
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:29,760
angle okay so she's going to
 

1061
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,269
angle okay so she's going to
resist what she's going to feel first is

1062
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:33,279
resist what she's going to feel first is
 

1063
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,630
resist what she's going to feel first is
my grounding

1064
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:35,640
my grounding
 

1065
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,029
my grounding
here where I do this onto this foot and

1066
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:39,039
here where I do this onto this foot and
 

1067
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,190
here where I do this onto this foot and
now when I'm on this foot then this foot

1068
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,200
now when I'm on this foot then this foot
 

1069
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,630
now when I'm on this foot then this foot
can move so I'm on that foot okay and

1070
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:45,640
can move so I'm on that foot okay and
 

1071
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,190
can move so I'm on that foot okay and
now we're here she's still trying to

1072
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,200
now we're here she's still trying to
 

1073
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:55,350
now we're here she's still trying to
pull that way she will feel the quaw

1074
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,360

 

1075
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,710

power when I'm here like this and she

1076
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:58,720
power when I'm here like this and she
 

1077
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,470
power when I'm here like this and she
doesn't want to come forward and I do

1078
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:01,480
doesn't want to come forward and I do
 

1079
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,710
doesn't want to come forward and I do
that ten con I cannot pull her forward

1080
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:05,720
that ten con I cannot pull her forward
 

1081
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,590
that ten con I cannot pull her forward
I'm not in position so she's trying to

1082
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:08,600
I'm not in position so she's trying to
 

1083
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,909
I'm not in position so she's trying to
walk away that way walk

1084
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:12,919

 

1085
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:17,389

away okay and as I start to ten con I'm

1086
00:30:17,389 --> 00:30:17,399
away okay and as I start to ten con I'm
 

1087
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:22,190
away okay and as I start to ten con I'm
going to lose some power

1088
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:22,200

 

1089
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,430

okay that is demonstrating that I can't

1090
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:26,440
okay that is demonstrating that I can't
 

1091
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,470
okay that is demonstrating that I can't
throw bigger people I can't throw

1092
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:28,480
throw bigger people I can't throw
 

1093
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,190
throw bigger people I can't throw
resisting people I can't throw stronger

1094
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,200
resisting people I can't throw stronger
 

1095
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,350
resisting people I can't throw stronger
people this why it doesn't function

1096
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,360
people this why it doesn't function
 

1097
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,389
people this why it doesn't function
martially okay what usually

1098
00:30:37,389 --> 00:30:37,399
martially okay what usually
 

1099
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:41,190
martially okay what usually
happens here when you see the ten conon

1100
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,200
happens here when you see the ten conon
 

1101
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,470
happens here when you see the ten conon
is this just the cube so she gets the

1102
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:47,480

 

1103
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,750

CU and so I can

1104
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:50,760
CU and so I can
 

1105
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,029
CU and so I can
go and do that tank con but you could

1106
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,039
go and do that tank con but you could
 

1107
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,269
go and do that tank con but you could
have done

1108
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:56,279
have done
 

1109
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:00,350
have done
anything right so here like this you're

1110
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:00,360
anything right so here like this you're
 

1111
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,190
anything right so here like this you're
going to roll take the

1112
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,200
going to roll take the
 

1113
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,750
going to roll take the
CU you could have done that it had as

1114
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:09,760

 

1115
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,870

much you could have done that none of

1116
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:12,880
much you could have done that none of
 

1117
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,310
much you could have done that none of
those function

1118
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:15,320
those function
 

1119
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,830
those function
kinesiologic okay so when we do the

1120
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:20,840

 

1121
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,990

technique boom

1122
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,000
technique boom
 

1123
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,870
technique boom
it's leg and glute power boom

1124
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:28,880
it's leg and glute power boom
 

1125
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,909
it's leg and glute power boom
and qua power that's all I can go don't

1126
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:34,919
and qua power that's all I can go don't
 

1127
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:41,950
and qua power that's all I can go don't
rotate don't

1128
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:41,960

 

1129
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,389

rotate

1130
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
rotate
 

1131
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,830
rotate
boom this is it that's all you

1132
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:47,840
boom this is it that's all you
 

1133
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,470
boom this is it that's all you
get okay to put the

1134
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:50,480
get okay to put the
 

1135
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,029
get okay to put the
power of

1136
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,039
power of
 

1137
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,470
power of
rotation in L claw M that's

1138
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:58,480
rotation in L claw M that's
 

1139
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,830
rotation in L claw M that's
what is

1140
00:31:59,830 --> 00:31:59,840
what is
 

1141
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:06,070
what is
that it's in C hole so when I do c hole

1142
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,080
that it's in C hole so when I do c hole
 

1143
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,909
that it's in C hole so when I do c hole
my

1144
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:06,919
my
 

1145
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:09,990
my
quaw

1146
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,000

 

1147
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,909

turns that's where the throw is that's

1148
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:12,919
turns that's where the throw is that's
 

1149
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:14,549
turns that's where the throw is that's
as far as I can

1150
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:14,559
as far as I can
 

1151
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:35,470
as far as I can
go don't turn your waist this is it

1152
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:35,480

 

1153
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,909

got to get the head you got to think

1154
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:36,919
got to get the head you got to think
 

1155
00:32:36,919 --> 00:33:06,950
got to get the head you got to think
ahead

1156
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:06,960

 

1157
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,269

got to control the

1158
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:12,279

 

1159
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:17,909

head watch your

1160
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:17,919

 

1161
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,549

foot and then don't don't push the head

1162
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:20,559
foot and then don't don't push the head
