po um let's look at the common way of

22
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:34,840
po um let's look at the common way of
 

23
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,750
po um let's look at the common way of
doing this technique the common way of

24
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:36,760
doing this technique the common way of
 

25
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,470
doing this technique the common way of
doing this technique generates a

26
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
doing this technique generates a
 

27
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,630
doing this technique generates a
yongyong clash energetically so that

28
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:41,640
yongyong clash energetically so that
 

29
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,389
yongyong clash energetically so that
means it's not going to function

30
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
means it's not going to function
 

31
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,229
means it's not going to function
alchemically and it is not going to

32
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:47,239
alchemically and it is not going to
 

33
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:49,950
alchemically and it is not going to
function spiritually then does it

34
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:49,960
function spiritually then does it
 

35
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,349
function spiritually then does it
function martially and I would say if

36
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:52,359
function martially and I would say if
 

37
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,069
function martially and I would say if
you're bigger and stronger than that

38
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
you're bigger and stronger than that
 

39
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,189
you're bigger and stronger than that
person then it'll function but to set

40
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
person then it'll function but to set
 

41
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,470
person then it'll function but to set
out with a technique that requires you

42
00:00:59,470 --> 00:00:59,480
out with a technique that requires you
 

43
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,310
out with a technique that requires you
to be bigger and stronger than your

44
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:01,320
to be bigger and stronger than your
 

45
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,709
to be bigger and stronger than your
opponent I don't think that's martially

46
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:03,719
opponent I don't think that's martially
 

47
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,630
opponent I don't think that's martially
viable that's the that would be the

48
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:05,640
viable that's the that would be the
 

49
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,550
viable that's the that would be the
definition of not Marshal viable like

50
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:09,560
definition of not Marshal viable like
 

51
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,390
definition of not Marshal viable like
you know hey come do our art it works on

00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
that's a a way you can understand it

uh and the
 

67
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,550
uh and the
founders uh UK would be let's say this

68
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560

we're going to have a sign here okay and

70
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:39,399
we're going to have a sign here okay and
 

71
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,149
we're going to have a sign here okay and
this is n sign and we just want to

72
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:43,159
this is n sign and we just want to
 

73
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,590
this is n sign and we just want to
look at some

74
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
look at some
 

75
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,149
look at some
forces

76
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:47,159
forces
 

77
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,550
forces
okay in the kold waza UK has forward

78
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:51,560
okay in the kold waza UK has forward
 

79
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,910
okay in the kold waza UK has forward
inertia and momentum going this way

80
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:54,920
inertia and momentum going this way
 

81
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,190
inertia and momentum going this way
towards noget

82
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,200
towards noget
 

83
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,230
towards noget
okay if we

84
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,240
okay if we
 

85
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,270
okay if we
stop that energy in any way right there

86
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
stop that energy in any way right there
 

87
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,790
stop that energy in any way right there
and then you're going to have a young

88
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
and then you're going to have a young
 

89
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,589
and then you're going to have a young
young Clash cuz they're coming this way

90
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
young Clash cuz they're coming this way
 

91
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,150
young Clash cuz they're coming this way
and if you they're going da and you go

92
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,160
and if you they're going da and you go
 

93
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,270
and if you they're going da and you go
stop

94
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,280
stop
 

95
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,990
stop
here Clash you have to let their energy

96
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
here Clash you have to let their energy
 

97
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,430
here Clash you have to let their energy
go forward if we and often is the case

98
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
go forward if we and often is the case
 

99
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,550
go forward if we and often is the case
for example in I

100
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:25,560
for example in I
 

101
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,190
for example in I
you you have UK stop there

102
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
you you have UK stop there
 

103
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,910
you you have UK stop there
and a lot of people do

104
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:32,920
and a lot of people do
 

105
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,589
and a lot of people do
this UK stops at the

106
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:36,599
this UK stops at the
 

107
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,949
this UK stops at the
line such that there's no Clash at

108
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:39,959
line such that there's no Clash at
 

109
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,229
line such that there's no Clash at
contact well then you have no spinal

110
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:43,239
contact well then you have no spinal
 

111
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,149
contact well then you have no spinal
displacement and then the Marshal sense

112
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:46,159
displacement and then the Marshal sense
 

113
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,390
displacement and then the Marshal sense
for this technique is not there it's

114
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:49,400
for this technique is not there it's
 

115
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,710
for this technique is not there it's
just not there and so it would not

116
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:51,720
just not there and so it would not
 

117
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,229
just not there and so it would not
function martially again we're only

118
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
function martially again we're only
 

119
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,949
function martially again we're only
dealing with the Marshall question

120
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:55,959
dealing with the Marshall question
 

121
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,430
dealing with the Marshall question
because we already it's not going to

122
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
because we already it's not going to
 

123
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,270
because we already it's not going to
work spiritually and it's not going to

124
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
work spiritually and it's not going to
 

125
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,589
work spiritually and it's not going to
work energetically it's the Marshal

126
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
work energetically it's the Marshal
 

127
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,070
work energetically it's the Marshal
question so for anyone who does not have

128
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,080
question so for anyone who does not have
 

129
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,390
question so for anyone who does not have
spinal displacement stops themselves at

130
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
spinal displacement stops themselves at
 

131
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,350
spinal displacement stops themselves at
the ukan Naga meeting

132
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
the ukan Naga meeting
 

133
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,110
the ukan Naga meeting
point such that I'm not actually

134
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,120
point such that I'm not actually
 

135
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,789
point such that I'm not actually
clashing with them then I don't have

136
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:16,799
clashing with them then I don't have
 

137
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,910
clashing with them then I don't have
spinal displacement and now I have no

138
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:18,920
spinal displacement and now I have no
 

139
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,430
spinal displacement and now I have no
Marshall sense for not one of aikido's

140
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:24,440
Marshall sense for not one of aikido's
 

141
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,350
Marshall sense for not one of aikido's
kona so if you try to do this technique

142
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
kona so if you try to do this technique
 

143
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,949
kona so if you try to do this technique
on somebody who is stopped you're in the

144
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
on somebody who is stopped you're in the
 

145
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,910
on somebody who is stopped you're in the
street or in a sparring you're not going

146
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
street or in a sparring you're not going
 

147
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,270
street or in a sparring you're not going
to get what you think you're going to

148
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
to get what you think you're going to
 

149
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,750
to get what you think you're going to
get they're going to beat the out

150
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:36,760
get they're going to beat the out
 

151
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,190
get they're going to beat the out
of you okay so this is this is wrong too

152
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,200
of you okay so this is this is wrong too
 

153
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,190
of you okay so this is this is wrong too
from a marshall point of view so we

154
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
from a marshall point of view so we
 

155
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,190
from a marshall point of view so we
can't have Uka stop and we cannot stop

156
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
can't have Uka stop and we cannot stop
 

157
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,949
can't have Uka stop and we cannot stop
UK that's the first thing okay so get

158
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
UK that's the first thing okay so get
 

159
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,710
UK that's the first thing okay so get

00:03:59,869 --> 00:03:59,879

 

165
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,149

and I'm going to come in I have an

166
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
and I'm going to come in I have an
 

167
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,470
and I'm going to come in I have an
forward

168
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
forward
 

169
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,030
forward
inertia and that inertia is going to do

170
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
inertia and that inertia is going to do
 

171
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,069
inertia and that inertia is going to do
spinal displacement so he's not he's

172
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:10,079
spinal displacement so he's not he's
 

173
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,069
spinal displacement so he's not he's
going to stop me okay he's clashing with

174
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:13,079
going to stop me okay he's clashing with
 

175
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,069
going to stop me okay he's clashing with
me right now he's sto he's going against

176
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:17,079
me right now he's sto he's going against
 

177
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,990
me right now he's sto he's going against
my forward inertia because he stopped me

178
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000
my forward inertia because he stopped me
 

179
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,030
my forward inertia because he stopped me
my inertia was going

180
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,040
my inertia was going
 

181
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,430
my inertia was going
forward if I have more masks I can

182
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
forward if I have more masks I can
 

183
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,710
forward if I have more masks I can
generate more mask which I will be able

184
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:27,720
generate more mask which I will be able
 

185
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,870
generate more mask which I will be able
to do cuz I'm going to incorporate the

186
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:29,880
to do cuz I'm going to incorporate the
 

187
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,710
to do cuz I'm going to incorporate the
earth into my mass and that's going to

188
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:31,720
earth into my mass and that's going to
 

189
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,790
earth into my mass and that's going to
be more mass than him I will override

190
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
be more mass than him I will override
 

191
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,830
be more mass than him I will override
The yyong Clash so he come in and he's

192
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
The yyong Clash so he come in and he's
 

193
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,070
The yyong Clash so he come in and he's
not going to be able to stop me

194
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:41,080
not going to be able to stop me
 

195
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,029
not going to be able to stop me
okay the example of me stopping myself

196
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:45,039
okay the example of me stopping myself
 

197
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:48,670
okay the example of me stopping myself
he offers his hand is me auk I take that

198
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:48,680
he offers his hand is me auk I take that
 

199
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,430
he offers his hand is me auk I take that
forward inertia momentum and then I stop

200
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
forward inertia momentum and then I stop
 

201
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,350
forward inertia momentum and then I stop
right here that is what a lot of people

202
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:54,360
right here that is what a lot of people
 

203
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,150
right here that is what a lot of people
do okay and so as

204
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
do okay and so as
 

205
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,430
do okay and so as
he uh would come forward he has to come

206
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
he uh would come forward he has to come
 

207
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,029
he uh would come forward he has to come
forward to me do you see he does

208
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
forward to me do you see he does
 

209
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,510
forward to me do you see he does
that what happens in in a fight is as he

210
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:10,520
that what happens in in a fight is as he
 

211
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,390
that what happens in in a fight is as he
starts to take my balance here and I

212
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
starts to take my balance here and I
 

213
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,230
starts to take my balance here and I
feel that pressure there go

214
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,240
feel that pressure there go
 

215
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,350
feel that pressure there go
back I just adapt to it and I keep my

216
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
back I just adapt to it and I keep my
 

217
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,629
back I just adapt to it and I keep my
same base you see I just adapt to it I

218
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
same base you see I just adapt to it I
 

219
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,029
same base you see I just adapt to it I
feel the pressure on the hand starting

220
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
feel the pressure on the hand starting
 

221
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,469
feel the pressure on the hand starting
to check my weight so I would let go of

222
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:27,479
to check my weight so I would let go of
 

223
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,469
to check my weight so I would let go of
your control point I still have my base

224
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
your control point I still have my base
 

225
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,710
your control point I still have my base
and then this gives me different things

226
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
and then this gives me different things
 

227
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,469
and then this gives me different things
that I can

228
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
that I can
 

229
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,390
that I can
do there will be no time where you'll be

230
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:37,400
do there will be no time where you'll be
 

231
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,550
do there will be no time where you'll be
able to get there in any kind of Marshal

232
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:39,560
able to get there in any kind of Marshal
 

233
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,990
able to get there in any kind of Marshal
situation so for example here I am

234
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,000
situation so for example here I am
 

235
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,430
situation so for example here I am
standing straight up I don't have any

236
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
standing straight up I don't have any
 

237
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,110
standing straight up I don't have any
forward inertia acting on my Center

238
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,120
forward inertia acting on my Center
 

239
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,670
forward inertia acting on my Center
gravity and any kind of uh assault I

240
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:52,680
gravity and any kind of uh assault I
 

241
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,790

don't care what what he does go he has

242
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:55,800
don't care what what he does go he has
 

243
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,550
don't care what what he does go he has
no control over me so he can't get it to

244
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
no control over me so he can't get it to
 

245
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,430
no control over me so he can't get it to
go okay

246
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:00,440
go okay
 

247
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,510
go okay
this is all Marshal

248
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,520
this is all Marshal
 

249
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,670
this is all Marshal
 so we are not going to stop UK

250
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:06,680
so we are not going to stop UK
 

251
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,589
so we are not going to stop UK
and we're not going to do anything that

252
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:08,599
and we're not going to do anything that
 

253
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:12,830
and we're not going to do anything that
stops UK and when we say stop UK we're

254
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:12,840
stops UK and when we say stop UK we're
 

255
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,629
stops UK and when we say stop UK we're
really talking about their center of

256
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:15,639
really talking about their center of
 

257
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,430
really talking about their center of
gravity we don't we want the center of

258
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:18,440
gravity we don't we want the center of
 

259
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,790
gravity we don't we want the center of
gravity to keep going

260
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:23,800

 

261
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,510

forward usually what happens is here's

262
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,520
forward usually what happens is here's
 

263
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,870
forward usually what happens is here's

spine there's our head

266
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,080
spine there's our head
 

267
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,710
spine there's our head
and this is bodies moving

268
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:33,720
and this is bodies moving
 

269
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,309
and this is bodies moving
forward and what the modern noget does

270
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
forward and what the modern noget does
 

271
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,430
forward and what the modern noget does
is they create a break

272
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:42,440

 

273
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,469

here and then they bring the top of the

274
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:45,479
here and then they bring the top of the
 

275
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,350
here and then they bring the top of the
spine down and forward see

276
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
spine down and forward see
 

277
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,589
spine down and forward see
that so when this UK gets over here

278
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
that so when this UK gets over here
 

279
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,589
that so when this UK gets over here
they're going to look

280
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
they're going to look
 

281
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,350
they're going to look
for this

282
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,360
for this
 

283
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,309
for this
position and and here it is

284
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:01,319
position and and here it is
 

285
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,350
position and and here it is
true the head came forward of that line

286
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
true the head came forward of that line
 

287
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,270
true the head came forward of that line
but the center did not and that's what

288
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:08,280
but the center did not and that's what
 

289
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,909
but the center did not and that's what
we that's what's

290
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
we that's what's
 

291
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,749
we that's what's
determining uh whether we y Yang Clash

292
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:12,759
determining uh whether we y Yang Clash
 

293
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,589
determining uh whether we y Yang Clash
or not okay why is that because most of

294
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:16,599
or not okay why is that because most of
 

295
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:18,589
or not okay why is that because most of
the Yang energy is in the center of

296
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:18,599
the Yang energy is in the center of
 

297
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,350
the Yang energy is in the center of
gravity because that's where the most

298
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:20,360
gravity because that's where the most
 

299
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,270
gravity because that's where the most
inertia is the most Mass the most weight

300
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
inertia is the most Mass the most weight
 

301
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,749
inertia is the most Mass the most weight
Etc and so when you do bring the head

302
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:26,759
Etc and so when you do bring the head
 

303
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,990
Etc and so when you do bring the head
forward you actually stop the center

304
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
forward you actually stop the center
 

305
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,469
forward you actually stop the center
from coming forward and now you still

306
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
from coming forward and now you still
 

307
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,070
from coming forward and now you still
have a young young Clash okay and I'll

308
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
have a young young Clash okay and I'll
 

309
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,710
have a young young Clash okay and I'll
show you why you stop the center from

310
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
show you why you stop the center from
 

311
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,469
show you why you stop the center from
coming forward what's going to happen is

312
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:41,479
coming forward what's going to happen is
 

313
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,350
coming forward what's going to happen is
when you bring the head down you're

314
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:44,360
when you bring the head down you're
 

315
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,390
when you bring the head down you're
going to inhibit the center to come

316
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:47,400
going to inhibit the center to come
 

317
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,990
going to inhibit the center to come
forward because the feet will get

318
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
forward because the feet will get
 

319
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,869
forward because the feet will get

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,189
going to pin the feet in
place

biomechanically and hence the center

330
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
biomechanically and hence the center
 

331
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,830
biomechanically and hence the center
cannot come forward we often use this

332
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
cannot come forward we often use this
 

333
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,309
cannot come forward we often use this
strategy uh in

334
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
strategy uh in
 

335
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,350
strategy uh in
infighting when we want to make sure

336
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
infighting when we want to make sure
 

337
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,309
infighting when we want to make sure
that the person can't kick us or knee us

338
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
that the person can't kick us or knee us
 

339
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,070
that the person can't kick us or knee us
we'll pull the head down forward and it

340
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,080
we'll pull the head down forward and it
 

341
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,469
we'll pull the head down forward and it
pins the feet in place I'll show you

342
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:25,479
pins the feet in place I'll show you
 

343
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,670
pins the feet in place I'll show you
that now all right so if we're here

344
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:28,680
that now all right so if we're here
 

345
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,830
that now all right so if we're here
we're fighting and I don't want him to

346
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
we're fighting and I don't want him to
 

347
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,909
we're fighting and I don't want him to
KNE

348

me I can come up and pull his head down

350
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:36,680
me I can come up and pull his head down
 

351
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,469
me I can come up and pull his head down
and now in this

352
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:39,479
and now in this
 

353
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,149
and now in this
angle this L shape

354
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
angle this L shape
 

355
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,670
angle this L shape
here with especially with weight on it

356
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
here with especially with weight on it
 

357
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,509
here with especially with weight on it
his feet are inhibited from coming up

358
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:48,519
his feet are inhibited from coming up
 

359
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,829
his feet are inhibited from coming up
off the ground and getting that knees

360
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:50,839
off the ground and getting that knees
 

361
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:53,470
off the ground and getting that knees
hence if we're in the front and there's

362
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:53,480
hence if we're in the front and there's
 

363
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,310
hence if we're in the front and there's
no forward inertia you do want to make

364
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
no forward inertia you do want to make
 

365
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,110
no forward inertia you do want to make
sure the head is towards you down so you

366
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,120
sure the head is towards you down so you
 

367
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,910
sure the head is towards you down so you
can check those leg

368
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
can check those leg
 

369
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,750
can check those leg
weapons inversely while we're here if if

370
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
weapons inversely while we're here if if
 

371
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,310
weapons inversely while we're here if if
we're in the

372
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:07,320
we're in the
 

373
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,509
we're in the
back and there's no forward inertia and

374
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:10,519
back and there's no forward inertia and
 

375
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,190
back and there's no forward inertia and
this has a lot to do with where we

376
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:12,200
this has a lot to do with where we
 

377
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,310
this has a lot to do with where we
ultimately go we want it the other way

378
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:15,320
ultimately go we want it the other way
 

379
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,670
ultimately go we want it the other way
meaning uh if I was here his feet can

380
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:20,680
meaning uh if I was here his feet can
 

381
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,550
meaning uh if I was here his feet can
move back they can okay uh they just

382
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
move back they can okay uh they just
 

383
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,990
move back they can okay uh they just
can't go

384
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
can't go
 

385
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,590
can't go
forward if I'm here his feet can go go

386
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
forward if I'm here his feet can go go
 

387
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,310
forward if I'm here his feet can go go
forward and kick but you can't kick

388
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:33,320
forward and kick but you can't kick
 

389
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,870
forward and kick but you can't kick
backwards okay so whenever for example

390
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
backwards okay so whenever for example
 

391
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,150
backwards okay so whenever for example
we're arresting someone we're going to

392
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
we're arresting someone we're going to
 

393
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,389
we're arresting someone we're going to
separate his

394
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:41,399
separate his
 

395
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,310
separate his
feet more turn his toes

396
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:45,320
feet more turn his toes
 

397
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,110
feet more turn his toes
outward place his hands behind his

398
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
outward place his hands behind his
 

399
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,990
outward place his hands behind his
back and we're back

400
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
back and we're back
 

401
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,590
back and we're back
here having weight on the heels and even

402
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
here having weight on the heels and even
 

403
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,389
here having weight on the heels and even
this is enough to protect him from

404
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
this is enough to protect him from
 

405
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,750
this is enough to protect him from
kicking at us

406
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:00,760
kicking at us
 

407
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,710
kicking at us
okay versus like in the movies where you

408
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:03,720
okay versus like in the movies where you
 

409
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,590
okay versus like in the movies where you
see hey put your hands on the wall

410
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
see hey put your hands on the wall
 

411
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,190
see hey put your hands on the wall
separate your

412
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
separate your
 

413
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,870
separate your
feet right FIS this guy he can kick me

414
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
feet right FIS this guy he can kick me
 

415
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,590
feet right FIS this guy he can kick me
all he wants at that point

416
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
all he wants at that point
 

417
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,710
all he wants at that point
okay so if we Bend his head forward

418
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
okay so if we Bend his head forward
 

419
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,829
okay so if we Bend his head forward
consequentially you're going to stop

420
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
consequentially you're going to stop
 

421
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,389
consequentially you're going to stop
that forward

422
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:25,399
that forward
 

423
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,470
that forward
inertia you're going to stop that by

424
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
inertia you're going to stop that by
 

425
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,310
inertia you're going to stop that by
checking his feet he's not going to come

426
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:31,320
checking his feet he's not going to come
 

427
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,910
checking his feet he's not going to come
forward anymore and if you pay attention

428
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
forward anymore and if you pay attention
 

429
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,550
forward anymore and if you pay attention
the center gets stuck in place and this

430
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
the center gets stuck in place and this
 

431
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,310
the center gets stuck in place and this
is why the UK who do this he didn't get

432
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:41,320
is why the UK who do this he didn't get
 

433
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,590
is why the UK who do this he didn't get
over here they have to enter they have

434
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:44,600
over here they have to enter they have
 

435
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,949
over here they have to enter they have
to close they have to move towards him

436
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
to close they have to move towards him
 

437
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,470
to close they have to move towards him
okay that's the second point we're

438
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480

 

439
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,110

showing okay continuing with the

440
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120

 

441
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,629

modern stupidity

442
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:01,639

 

443
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,030

what the modern

444
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,040
what the modern
 

445
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,590
what the modern
ioka

446
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
ioka
 

447
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,629
ioka
assumes is something like

448
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:08,639
assumes is something like
 

449
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,110
assumes is something like
this uh they're going to make this

450
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
this uh they're going to make this
 

451
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,350
this uh they're going to make this
two-dimensional circular

452
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
two-dimensional circular
 

453
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,110
two-dimensional circular
action okay so the the movement of their

454
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,120
action okay so the the movement of their
 

455
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,910
action okay so the the movement of their
tabaki is going to uh use this part here

456
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:22,920
tabaki is going to uh use this part here
 

457
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,470
tabaki is going to uh use this part here
this part on the circumference this is

458
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:25,480
this part on the circumference this is
 

459
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,750
this part on the circumference this is
where we stop UK If there's a y energy

460
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:28,760
where we stop UK If there's a y energy
 

461
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,470
where we stop UK If there's a y energy
going that that way it then takes them

462
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480

 

463
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,590

down okay and that's where we bend them

464
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
down okay and that's where we bend them
 

465
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,750
down okay and that's where we bend them
over at their at their head and stop

466
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
over at their at their head and stop
 

467
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,069
over at their at their head and stop
their keep their Center stop and then

468
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:43,079
their keep their Center stop and then
 

469
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,790
their keep their Center stop and then
it's going to come all the way around

470
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
it's going to come all the way around
 

471
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,230
it's going to come all the way around
and here's where we're going to take

472
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
and here's where we're going to take
 

473
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,030
and here's where we're going to take
this head and bring it back to

474
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,040
this head and bring it back to
 

475
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,750
this head and bring it back to
here we come up to this Apex here okay

476
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:56,760
here we come up to this Apex here okay
 

477
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,990
here we come up to this Apex here okay
and then it's going to continue around

478
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
and then it's going to continue around
 

479
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,990
and then it's going to continue around
and start bringing them sorry this is

480
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,000
and start bringing them sorry this is
 

481
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,430
and start bringing them sorry this is
where we think we brought it back up

482
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:06,440
where we think we brought it back up
 

483
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,910
where we think we brought it back up
okay and then it's going to take them

484
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:10,920
okay and then it's going to take them
 

485
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,470
okay and then it's going to take them
back and this is where we're doing that

486
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:13,480
back and this is where we're doing that
 

487
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,910
back and this is where we're doing that
part okay this is what they're imagining

488
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:16,920
part okay this is what they're imagining
 

489
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,350
part okay this is what they're imagining
and because this arm movement is in

490
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:20,360
and because this arm movement is in
 

491
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,670
and because this arm movement is in
their mind continuous and circular they

492
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
their mind continuous and circular they
 

493
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,629
their mind continuous and circular they
think that's iido but as we saw here at

494
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:27,639
think that's iido but as we saw here at
 

495
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,910
think that's iido but as we saw here at
this point we we have the Yong Yong

496
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:30,920
this point we we have the Yong Yong
 

497
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,670
this point we we have the Yong Yong

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,590
how does it function then like I've seen
it function well you haven't seen it

way keep the Y Yong clashing so what the

582
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
way keep the Y Yong clashing so what the
 

583
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,310
way keep the Y Yong clashing so what the
UK will do is at this

584
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:45,320
UK will do is at this
 

585
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,749
UK will do is at this
point they will reduce their inertia

586
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:49,759
point they will reduce their inertia
 

587
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,710
point they will reduce their inertia
through

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
through
 

589
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,990
through
choreography to be able to come up and

590
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
choreography to be able to come up and
 

591
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,870
choreography to be able to come up and
at this point then they'll come up and

592
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
at this point then they'll come up and
 

593
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,430
at this point then they'll come up and
then at this point they'll reduce ruce

594
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,440
then at this point they'll reduce ruce
 

595
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,629
then at this point they'll reduce ruce
their uh Yong Yong energy they'll reduce

596
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
their uh Yong Yong energy they'll reduce
 

597
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,870
their uh Yong Yong energy they'll reduce
the yangong energy Again by reducing

598
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
the yangong energy Again by reducing
 

599
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,910
the yangong energy Again by reducing
their inertia by going backwards with it

600
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
their inertia by going backwards with it
 

601
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,550
their inertia by going backwards with it
and this all has the guys that uh well

602
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
and this all has the guys that uh well
 

603
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,069
and this all has the guys that uh well
that's iido you're not supposed to fight

604
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:15,079
that's iido you're not supposed to fight
 

605
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:18,430
that's iido you're not supposed to fight
and struggle do you see um the

606
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:18,440
and struggle do you see um the
 

607
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,350
and struggle do you see um the
difference here is that the UK is

608
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
difference here is that the UK is
 

609
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,189
difference here is that the UK is
consciously reducing

610
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:24,199
consciously reducing
 

611
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:27,670
consciously reducing
inertia that's

612
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
inertia that's
 

613
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,670
inertia that's
different I am not supposed to as UK

614
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
different I am not supposed to as UK
 

615
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,910
different I am not supposed to as UK
contest and struggle yes because it's a

616
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:34,920
contest and struggle yes because it's a
 

617
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,230
contest and struggle yes because it's a
form but what makes it choreography is

618
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
form but what makes it choreography is
 

619
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,590
form but what makes it choreography is
that I have

620
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:40,600
that I have
 

621
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,069
that I have
artificially uh generated inertia levels

622
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:45,079
artificially uh generated inertia levels
 

623
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:47,629
artificially uh generated inertia levels
that's that we don't do you don't do

624
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:47,639
that's that we don't do you don't do
 

625
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,590
that's that we don't do you don't do
that okay you keep the inertia levels

626
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:50,600
that okay you keep the inertia levels
 

627
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,550
that okay you keep the inertia levels
that you have and that's it's up to

628
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:53,560
that you have and that's it's up to
 

629
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,309
that you have and that's it's up to
nogin to figure out how to work with

630
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:56,319
nogin to figure out how to work with
 

631
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:59,509
nogin to figure out how to work with
these given inertia levels okay

632
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
these given inertia levels okay
 

633
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,710
these given inertia levels okay
so here is a a

634
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:01,720
so here is a a
 

635
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,430
so here is a a
clear scientific way of understanding

636
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,440
clear scientific way of understanding
 

637
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,829
clear scientific way of understanding
what is choreography falsified inertial

638
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
what is choreography falsified inertial
 

639
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,389
what is choreography falsified inertial
levels okay that's what it is what is

640
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:13,399
levels okay that's what it is what is
 

641
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,309
levels okay that's what it is what is
it's not it's not compliance because in

642
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:16,319
it's not it's not compliance because in
 

643
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:18,670
it's not it's not compliance because in
all kho and waza you're going to have

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:18,680
all kho and waza you're going to have
 

645
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,710
all kho and waza you're going to have
you what I mean is it's not it's not the

00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:21,720
you what I mean is it's not it's not the
 

647
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,749
you what I mean is it's not it's not the
uh lack of struggling is not the lack of

648
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:24,759
uh lack of struggling is not the lack of
 

649
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:27,389
uh lack of struggling is not the lack of
contestation because in all kihon you

00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:29,639
don't have struggle you don't have non-c
 

653
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,030
don't have struggle you don't have non-c
contestation but what you don't do in

true kihon is artificially
 

657
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,110
true kihon is artificially
generate pseudo inertia levels that you

658
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
generate pseudo inertia levels that you
 

659
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,269
generate pseudo inertia levels that you
don't do that okay um that's wrong so

660
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:44,279
don't do that okay um that's wrong so
 

661
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,110
don't do that okay um that's wrong so
let's

662
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
let's
 

663
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,829
let's
demonstrate uh these falsified inertia

664
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:47,839
demonstrate uh these falsified inertia
 

665
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,110
demonstrate uh these falsified inertia
levels okay and I'm going to have to

666
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,120
levels okay and I'm going to have to
 

667
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,749
levels okay and I'm going to have to
coach my my uh Desi into this because

668
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:54,759
coach my my uh Desi into this because
 

669
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:57,629
coach my my uh Desi into this because
they just don't know this okay we

670
00:16:57,629 --> 00:16:57,639
they just don't know this okay we
 

671
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,389
they just don't know this okay we
don't do this stuff so

672
00:16:59,389 --> 00:16:59,399
don't do this stuff so
 

673
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,150
don't do this stuff so
I'll get us there first a lot of times

674
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
I'll get us there first a lot of times
 

675
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,069
I'll get us there first a lot of times
like I look probably bigger and stronger

676
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:05,079

big a man you're like a normalized man I
 

683
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,029

would say right and the guy is

684
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:18,039
would say right and the guy is
 

685

um so I'm not I'm not like if I were
 

689
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,110
um so I'm not I'm not like if I were
your

690
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,120
your
 

691
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,789
your
size everything I'm about to show would

692
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
size everything I'm about to show would
 

693
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,909
size everything I'm about to show would
be even more detrimental if I was bigger

694
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
be even more detrimental if I was bigger
 

695
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,950
be even more detrimental if I was bigger
than you it would be even more

696
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
than you it would be even more
 

697
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,510
than you it would be even more
detrimental okay so

698
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:42,520
detrimental okay so
 

699

so let let's say he's he's bracing again

736
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:36,799
so let let's say he's he's bracing again
 

737
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,310
so let let's say he's he's bracing again
okay he's bracing like that my goal

738
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
okay he's bracing like that my goal
 

739
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,990
okay he's bracing like that my goal
marshy is not to just push you right so

to stop the effects of the Yong Yong
Clash because you can over out y me

762
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:15,640
Clash because you can over out y me
 

763
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,470
Clash because you can over out y me
there's ways that it's just not right to

764
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,480
there's ways that it's just not right to
 

765
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,350
there's ways that it's just not right to
do you want to keep the inertia moving

766
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
do you want to keep the inertia moving
 

767
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,230
do you want to keep the inertia moving
okay all right

768
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:23,240
okay all right
 

769
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,029
okay all right
so um I'm going to stop the clashing

770
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:28,039
so um I'm going to stop the clashing
 

771
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,990
so um I'm going to stop the clashing
here or maybe I have it and then you try

772
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,000
here or maybe I have it and then you try
 

773
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,750
here or maybe I have it and then you try
to bend me straight down with that that

774
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
to bend me straight down with that that
 

775
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,909
to bend me straight down with that that
arm Circle do you get it okay so here I

776
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:36,919
arm Circle do you get it okay so here I
 

777
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:42,310
arm Circle do you get it okay so here I
am like that okay so again I'm I am

778
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
am like that okay so again I'm I am
 

779
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,270
am like that okay so again I'm I am
pushing

780
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:44,280
pushing
 

781
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:50,710
pushing
and this is just leveraged you

782
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720

 

783
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,350

see okay and it it didn't go so smooth

784
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:54,360
see okay and it it didn't go so smooth
 

785
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,510
see okay and it it didn't go so smooth
right so your I people are going hey

786
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,520
right so your I people are going hey
 

787
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,230
right so your I people are going hey
increase your mass step a little so this

788
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:01,240
increase your mass step a little so this
 

789
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,430
increase your mass step a little so this
hand is under your Center you see that

790
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:04,440
hand is under your Center you see that
 

791

hand is under your Center you see that
okay so here we

792
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:07,320
okay so here we
 

793
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,990
okay so here we
go it's still not that smooth is it did

794
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,000
go it's still not that smooth is it did
 

795
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,789
go it's still not that smooth is it did
he get it

796
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
he get it

have no thumbs and that's what he's

800
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:17,919
have no thumbs and that's what he's
 

801
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,230
have no thumbs and that's what he's
doing so this is without thumbs he

802
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
doing so this is without thumbs he
 

803
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,669
doing so this is without thumbs he
goes you see and then again I'm checked

804
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:26,679
goes you see and then again I'm checked
 

805
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,230
goes you see and then again I'm checked
and I'm stopped but get my off

806
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240
and I'm stopped but get my off
 

807
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,510
and I'm stopped but get my off
balance no I have all my legs again

808

balance no I have all my legs again
 

809
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,270
balance no I have all my legs again
still

810
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
still
 

811
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,029
still
okay so we're seeing the weaknesses of

812
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:38,039
okay so we're seeing the weaknesses of
 

813
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,190
okay so we're seeing the weaknesses of
the Yong Yong clashing what usually

814
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,200
the Yong Yong clashing what usually
 

815
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,230
the Yong Yong clashing what usually
happens is I reduce my

816
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
happens is I reduce my
 

817
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,270
happens is I reduce my
inertia you see that difference right

818
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
inertia you see that difference right
 

819
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,310
inertia you see that difference right
here's where you see me doing this go

820
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:49,320
here's where you see me doing this go
 

821
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,270
here's where you see me doing this go
you got to go really slow okay

822
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
you got to go really slow okay
 

823
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,310
you got to go really slow okay
one I'm going to start putting my butt

824
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,320
one I'm going to start putting my butt
 

825
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,549
one I'm going to start putting my butt
out I know where you want me to go go

826
00:20:59,549 --> 00:20:59,559
out I know where you want me to go go
 

827
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,430
out I know where you want me to go go
and I make my butt go out go back and

828
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
and I make my butt go out go back and
 

829
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,470
and I make my butt go out go back and
you will feel let's reverse it I won't

830
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,480
you will feel let's reverse it I won't
 

831
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,230
you will feel let's reverse it I won't
make my butt go out I make you bend my

832
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:09,240
make my butt go out I make you bend my
 

833
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,470
make my butt go out I make you bend my
head over you're going to feel a lot of

834
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:11,480
head over you're going to feel a lot of
 

835
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,590
head over you're going to feel a lot of
the inertia of me standing go right

836
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:14,600
the inertia of me standing go right
 

837
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,390
the inertia of me standing go right
there you see how it's increasing

838
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
there you see how it's increasing
 

839
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,269
there you see how it's increasing
there's a lot of pressure here not going

840
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:19,279
there's a lot of pressure here not going
 

841
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,430
there's a lot of pressure here not going
down as he goes you're going to feel

842
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,440
down as he goes you're going to feel
 

843
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,830
down as he goes you're going to feel
that you can overpower it but you still

844
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:24,840
that you can overpower it but you still
 

845
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,390
that you can overpower it but you still
feel the pressure right yes and it goes

846
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:27,400
feel the pressure right yes and it goes
 

847
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,390
feel the pressure right yes and it goes
off when my butt goes out and I bend you

848
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:31,400
off when my butt goes out and I bend you
 

849
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,789
off when my butt goes out and I bend you
see how it's off yes

850
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:33,799
see how it's off yes
 

851
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:37,390
see how it's off yes
okay watch what the UK does you're going

852
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:37,400
okay watch what the UK does you're going
 

853
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,230
okay watch what the UK does you're going
to not feel the pressure you

854
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
to not feel the pressure you
 

855
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,630
to not feel the pressure you
see I take my butt

856
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
see I take my butt
 

857
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,430
see I take my butt
out there's no pressure you see that

858
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,440
out there's no pressure you see that
 

859
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,669
out there's no pressure you see that
while stay where you are put my butt

860
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
while stay where you are put my butt
 

861
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,669
while stay where you are put my butt
back in pressure you see okay so the Uka

862
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
back in pressure you see okay so the Uka
 

863
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,990
back in pressure you see okay so the Uka
is reducing the inertia in by first

864
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:55,000
is reducing the inertia in by first
 

865
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,149
is reducing the inertia in by first
making their butt go backwards and when

866
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:57,159
making their butt go backwards and when
 

867
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:59,990
making their butt go backwards and when
their butt goes backwards they now stop

868
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,000
their butt goes backwards they now stop
 

869
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,470
their butt goes backwards they now stop
their forward progress this technique

870
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
their forward progress this technique
 

871
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,230
their forward progress this technique
makes no more sense okay and then the

872
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:05,240
makes no more sense okay and then the
 

873
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,750
makes no more sense okay and then the
second thing they'll do is they'll

874
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760
second thing they'll do is they'll
 

875
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,669
second thing they'll do is they'll
either let out the pressure at the grip

876
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:10,679
either let out the pressure at the grip
 

877
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,230
either let out the pressure at the grip
like that so here I am watch go slow I'm

878
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,240
like that so here I am watch go slow I'm
 

879
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,950
like that so here I am watch go slow I'm
going to make my butt go out to take

880
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:15,960
going to make my butt go out to take
 

881
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,070
going to make my butt go out to take
that grip pressure off okay if I stay

882
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,080
that grip pressure off okay if I stay
 

883
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,590
that grip pressure off okay if I stay
here and you continue you'll feel

884
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,600
here and you continue you'll feel
 

885
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,310
here and you continue you'll feel
there's the grip pressure increasing you

886
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,320
there's the grip pressure increasing you
 

887
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,830
there's the grip pressure increasing you
see that so what they'll do is they go

888
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:25,840
see that so what they'll do is they go
 

889
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,789
see that so what they'll do is they go
like that the pressure is not on there

890
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:27,799
like that the pressure is not on there
 

891
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,390
like that the pressure is not on there
do you see that and so you always see

892
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:29,400
do you see that and so you always see
 

893
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,269
do you see that and so you always see
this in the in all all the UK okay or

894
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:35,279
this in the in all all the UK okay or
 

895
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:37,669
this in the in all all the UK okay or
I'll step so I'll keep my grip there

896
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:37,679
I'll step so I'll keep my grip there
 

897
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,750
I'll step so I'll keep my grip there
goes my

898
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:38,760
goes my
 

899
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,950
goes my
butt and then I stepped underneath you

900
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:41,960
butt and then I stepped underneath you
 

901
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,390
butt and then I stepped underneath you
you see that that means I'm in control

902
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,400
you see that that means I'm in control
 

903
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,310
you see that that means I'm in control
of my center and that's why for example

904
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,320
of my center and that's why for example
 

905
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,870
of my center and that's why for example
you don't really have me I have to stay

906
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:49,880
you don't really have me I have to stay
 

907
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,830
you don't really have me I have to stay
there okay and I staying there I'm

908
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:52,840
there okay and I staying there I'm
 

909
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,789
there okay and I staying there I'm
changing the inertial values okay so

910
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:55,799
changing the inertial values okay so
 

911
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,350
changing the inertial values okay so
here we go again boom boom

912
00:22:59,350 --> 00:22:59,360
here we go again boom boom
 

913
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,510
here we go again boom boom
boom all right now we have the next one

914
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:02,520
boom all right now we have the next one
 

915
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,909
boom all right now we have the next one
he brought me down let's say he's over

916
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:04,919
he brought me down let's say he's over
 

917
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,190
he brought me down let's say he's over
able to overpower me he brought me down

918
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:08,200
able to overpower me he brought me down
 

919
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,830
able to overpower me he brought me down
okay and he's going to continue to make

920
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:10,840
okay and he's going to continue to make
 

921
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,070
okay and he's going to continue to make
that Circle this is what he's picturing

922
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,080
that Circle this is what he's picturing
 

923
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,669
that Circle this is what he's picturing
he's making that Circle okay at some

924
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:17,679
he's making that Circle okay at some
 

925
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,070
he's making that Circle okay at some
point he steps with that Circle well

926
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,080
point he steps with that Circle well
 

927
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,630
point he steps with that Circle well
when you go back he steps there it is

928
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:23,640
when you go back he steps there it is
 

929
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,909
when you go back he steps there it is
like that so we'll demonstrate it get my

930
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
like that so we'll demonstrate it get my
 

931
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,750
like that so we'll demonstrate it get my
dishy in the right what do you think

932
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,760
dishy in the right what do you think
 

933
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,990
dishy in the right what do you think
what we're trying to so he goes here he

934
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,000
what we're trying to so he goes here he
 

935
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,350
what we're trying to so he goes here he
goes up and then he goes

936
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360
goes up and then he goes
 

937
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,830
goes up and then he goes
down okay but as I said there's the Y

938
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:36,840
down okay but as I said there's the Y
 

939
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,870
down okay but as I said there's the Y
Yong clashes let's say we're here

940
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:39,880
Yong clashes let's say we're here
 

941
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:46,470
Yong clashes let's say we're here
okay he's got to bring me up

942
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:46,480

 

943
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,990

now he's trying to bring me forward on

944
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,000
now he's trying to bring me forward on
 

945
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,470
now he's trying to bring me forward on
that Circle no he's not going to ever do

946
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:51,480
that Circle no he's not going to ever do
 

947
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,669
that Circle no he's not going to ever do
it he brought me down okay but I have to

948
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:55,679
it he brought me down okay but I have to
 

949
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,269
it he brought me down okay but I have to
now change the inertial values do I do

950
00:23:58,269 --> 00:23:58,279
now change the inertial values do I do
 

951
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:00,950
now change the inertial values do I do
that to see how I'm doing that okay and

952
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
that to see how I'm doing that okay and
 

953
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,149
that to see how I'm doing that okay and
it all goes under well you got you're

954
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:03,159
it all goes under well you got you're
 

955
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:04,870
it all goes under well you got you're
not supposed to contest you're supposed

956
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:04,880
not supposed to contest you're supposed
 

957
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,510
not supposed to contest you're supposed
to go away but what I'm doing is

958
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:06,520
to go away but what I'm doing is
 

959
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,430
to go away but what I'm doing is
changing the inertial values okay

960
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:10,440
changing the inertial values okay
 

961
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,750
changing the inertial values okay
again we're here I'll change it I took

962
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:13,760
again we're here I'll change it I took
 

963
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,390
again we're here I'll change it I took
those little baby steps forward for him

964
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
those little baby steps forward for him
 

965
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,549
those little baby steps forward for him
okay and now as you see at a certain

966
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
okay and now as you see at a certain
 

967
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,310
okay and now as you see at a certain
point I'm just here in perfect balance

968
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,320
point I'm just here in perfect balance
 

969
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,190
point I'm just here in perfect balance
of course in the fight this is where all

970
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:26,200
of course in the fight this is where all
 

971
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,190
of course in the fight this is where all
this stuff happens

972
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
this stuff happens
 

973
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,510
this stuff happens
right all this stuff

974
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520

 

975
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,870

happens you can't take balance then give

976
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:36,880
happens you can't take balance then give
 

977
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,029
happens you can't take balance then give
it back never makes sense we're back

978
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:40,039
it back never makes sense we're back
 

979
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,669
it back never makes sense we're back
where we were here I am right now in

980
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:42,679
where we were here I am right now in
 

981
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,750
where we were here I am right now in
perfect balance and now you have the

982
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:44,760
perfect balance and now you have the
 

983
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,269
perfect balance and now you have the
inertia of that plus the mobility you

984
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:49,279
inertia of that plus the mobility you
 

985
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,149
inertia of that plus the mobility you
afforded me so for example let's say he

986
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:52,159
afforded me so for example let's say he
 

987
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,350
afforded me so for example let's say he
is able to overpower me and he can't

988
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:54,360
is able to overpower me and he can't
 

989
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,310
is able to overpower me and he can't
make me go

990
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
make me go
 

991
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,549
make me go
back what at this point stops me from

992
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
back what at this point stops me from
 

993
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,230
back what at this point stops me from
stepping regaining the balance you see

994
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,240
stepping regaining the balance you see
 

995
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,990
stepping regaining the balance you see
the UK changes the inertial

996
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,000
the UK changes the inertial
 

997
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,190
the UK changes the inertial

value by doing
 

999
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,789
value by doing
this you have no capacity no matter what

1000
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:13,799
this you have no capacity no matter what
 

1001
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,350

up over that
 

1069
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,510
up over that
position so this is what I'm trying to

1070
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520
position so this is what I'm trying to
 

1071
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,750
position so this is what I'm trying to
say here you see that we call

1072
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:21,760
say here you see that we call
 

1073
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,549
say here you see that we call
balance here it looks exactly the same

1074
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:24,559
balance here it looks exactly the same
 

1075
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,230
balance here it looks exactly the same
and modern aikidoka call it kazushi it's

1076
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,240
and modern aikidoka call it kazushi it's
 

1077
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,950
and modern aikidoka call it kazushi it's
not kition okay it's actually balance

1078
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:32,960
not kition okay it's actually balance
 

1079
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,269
not kition okay it's actually balance
okay

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,710
geometry is linear I'm just going like
this do you see and the fact that I went

1108
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:27,720
this do you see and the fact that I went
 

1109
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,590
this do you see and the fact that I went
for forward and then

1110
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:30,600
for forward and then
 

1111
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,110
for forward and then
back is where you again have that YY

1112
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
back is where you again have that YY
 

1113
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,789

1115
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,909
Clash that bouchain could not overpower
at that point okay at the top at the top

1116
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:40,919
at that point okay at the top at the top
 

1117
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,990
at that point okay at the top at the top

of the of the
 

1119
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,630
of the of the
circle okay and you can see I clashed

1120
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640
circle okay and you can see I clashed
 

1121
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,430
circle okay and you can see I clashed
with them when I stopped here and now

1122
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:49,440
with them when I stopped here and now
 

1123
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,590
with them when I stopped here and now
I'm clashing with them when I'm trying

1124
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
I'm clashing with them when I'm trying
 

1125
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,909
I'm clashing with them when I'm trying
to make them go back from there okay

1126
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:54,919
to make them go back from there okay
 

1127
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:57,430
to make them go back from there okay
that's so then again this is not

1128
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:57,440
that's so then again this is not
 

1129
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,590
that's so then again this is not

not function martially because it will
only function on someone that you're

1136
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:05,640
only function on someone that you're
 

1137
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,070
only function on someone that you're
bigger than right and we know from the

1138
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,080
bigger than right and we know from the
 

1139
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,830
bigger than right and we know from the
art that the art is not linear this

1140
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:11,840
art that the art is not linear this
 

1141
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,149
art that the art is not linear this
circle this two-dimensional circle is

1142
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:14,159
circle this two-dimensional circle is
 

1143
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,470
circle this two-dimensional circle is
the self- delusion that we are not being

1144
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,480
the self- delusion that we are not being
 

1145
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,950
the self- delusion that we are not being
linear but you actually are being linear

1146
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:21,960

 

1147
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,149

okay what we want instead is to actually

1148
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:25,159
okay what we want instead is to actually
 

1149
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:27,710
okay what we want instead is to actually
do what the art says we want to have a

1150
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:27,720
do what the art says we want to have a
 

1151
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,669
do what the art says we want to have a
spiral

1152
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:30,679

 

1153
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:32,950

geometry we don't want to have energy

1154
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
geometry we don't want to have energy
 

1155
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,070
geometry we don't want to have energy
going back on itself because energy that

1156
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,080
going back on itself because energy that
 

1157
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,310
going back on itself because energy that
stops or energy that reverses is going

1158
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:39,320
stops or energy that reverses is going
 

1159
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,990
stops or energy that reverses is going
to generate a yongyong clash with the

1160
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,000
to generate a yongyong clash with the
 

1161
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,990
to generate a yongyong clash with the
inertia at that given contact point it's

1162
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,000
inertia at that given contact point it's
 

1163
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,350
inertia at that given contact point it's
just what it does okay so

1164
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:49,360
just what it does okay so
 

1165
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,590
just what it does okay so
UK's uh center of gravity we'll just

1166
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:52,600
UK's uh center of gravity we'll just
 

1167
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,909
UK's uh center of gravity we'll just
look at that is going to go

1168
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
look at that is going to go
 

1169
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,669
look at that is going to go
forward past the nogget line

1170
00:29:59,669 --> 00:29:59,679
forward past the nogget line
 

1171
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,710
forward past the nogget line
that's going to be spinal displacement

1172
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:01,720
that's going to be spinal displacement
 

1173
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,990
that's going to be spinal displacement
which gives Marshall sense to the

1174
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
which gives Marshall sense to the
 

1175
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,230
which gives Marshall sense to the
technique and we're not going to stop it

1176
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:07,240
technique and we're not going to stop it
 

1177
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,710
technique and we're not going to stop it
there we're going to turn it on a circle

1178
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:10,720
there we're going to turn it on a circle
 

1179
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,590
there we're going to turn it on a circle
cuz we cannot turn it back on

1180
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:13,600
cuz we cannot turn it back on
 

1181
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,549
cuz we cannot turn it back on
itself it's going to go on a

1182
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
itself it's going to go on a
 

1183
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,549
itself it's going to go on a
circle like

1184
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:19,559
circle like
 

1185
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:23,269
circle like
this and then like

1186
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:23,279
this and then like
 

1187
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,950
this and then like
this

1188
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:26,960

 

1189
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,269

okay if you pay

1190
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:30,279
okay if you pay
 

1191
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,470
okay if you pay
attention this is why this is called

1192
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:33,480
attention this is why this is called
 

1193
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,710
attention this is why this is called
coku

1194
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:37,720

 

1195
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,549

hole same with the coku is

1196
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:41,559
hole same with the coku is
 

1197
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:44,909
hole same with the coku is
but all of my techniques do this for the

1198
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:44,919
but all of my techniques do this for the
 

1199
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:47,389
but all of my techniques do this for the
for the most part all of my kihon do

1200
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:47,399
for the most part all of my kihon do
 

1201
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,310
for the most part all of my kihon do
this thing which means I'm going to

1202
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,320
this thing which means I'm going to
 

1203
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,549
this thing which means I'm going to
spiral

1204
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:51,559
spiral
 

1205

rotate in One Direction fulfilling
half of the Genesis act and then I'm

1208
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:00,600
half of the Genesis act and then I'm
 

1209
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,830
half of the Genesis act and then I'm
going to spiral rotate on the other

1210
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:02,840
going to spiral rotate on the other
 

1211
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,389
going to spiral rotate on the other
direction completing the other half so

Creation according to Silk Road culture
 

1223
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:23,549
Creation according to Silk Road culture
what is the Act of

1224
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:23,559
what is the Act of
 

1225
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:26,990
what is the Act of
Creation uh the the let's just use the

1226
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,000
Creation uh the the let's just use the
 

1227
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,629
Creation uh the the let's just use the
Chinese

uh Triune you have a dow that's prior to

1230
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:32,679
uh Triune you have a dow that's prior to
 

1231
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:35,629
uh Triune you have a dow that's prior to
all dichotomy it manifests in

1232
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:35,639
all dichotomy it manifests in
 

1233
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:39,190
all dichotomy it manifests in
dichotomy uh and then and so to reverse

1234
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,200
dichotomy uh and then and so to reverse
 

1235
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,629
dichotomy uh and then and so to reverse
this I start with dichotomy and I

1236
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:41,639
this I start with dichotomy and I
 

1237
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:44,590
this I start with dichotomy and I
reverse it back to this pre- dichotomous

1238
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:44,600
reverse it back to this pre- dichotomous
 

1239
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,590
reverse it back to this pre- dichotomous
State okay and in order to do this I

1240
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:47,600
State okay and in order to do this I
 

1241
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,549
State okay and in order to do this I
have to spiral rotate Yin and yangong

1242
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:50,559
have to spiral rotate Yin and yangong
 

1243
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,430
have to spiral rotate Yin and yangong
you can if I only spiral rotate in One

1244
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,440
you can if I only spiral rotate in One
 

1245
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,149
you can if I only spiral rotate in One
Direction I still have dichotomy so I

1246
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:56,159
Direction I still have dichotomy so I
 

1247
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,029
Direction I still have dichotomy so I
have to spiral rotate in the other

1248
00:31:59,029 --> 00:31:59,039
have to spiral rotate in the other
 

1249
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,470
have to spiral rotate in the other
direction as you can

1250
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:01,480
direction as you can
 

1251
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,269
direction as you can
see you have continuous motion which and

1252
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:06,279
see you have continuous motion which and
 

1253
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:09,070
see you have continuous motion which and
continuous ongoing whatever you know

1254
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,080
continuous ongoing whatever you know
 

1255
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,750
continuous ongoing whatever you know
whatever it is and this is our infinity

1256
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:12,760
whatever it is and this is our infinity
 

1257
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,350
whatever it is and this is our infinity
symbol across the globe today okay and

00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:16,360
symbol across the globe today okay and
 

1259
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,710
symbol across the globe today okay and
so you could see it here okay um this is

1260
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
so you could see it here okay um this is
 

1261
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,350
so you could see it here okay um this is
what ukis Center is

1262
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,360
what ukis Center is
 

1263
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,710
what ukis Center is
doing it's not what I'm doing though I

1264
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:26,720
doing it's not what I'm doing though I
 

1265
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,230
doing it's not what I'm doing though I
cannot achieve this shape of their

1266

okay so for
 

1271
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:42,710
okay so for
example at this point in this turn do

1272
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:42,720
example at this point in this turn do
 

1273
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,710
example at this point in this turn do
you

you
 

1275
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,110
you
see I am

1276
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,120
see I am
 

1277
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,110
see I am
still I am not moving

1278
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,120

 

1279
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,990

okay at this point in this turn

00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,000
okay at this point in this turn
 

1281
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,789
okay at this point in this turn
and I'm on the inside of UK's inertia at

as this shape is going around you see

1300
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:32,720
as this shape is going around you see
 

1301
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,230
as this shape is going around you see
what I am doing I am constantly on the

1302
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:35,240
what I am doing I am constantly on the
 

1303
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,070
what I am doing I am constantly on the
inside of the circumference whatever

1304
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,080
inside of the circumference whatever
 

1305
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,509
inside of the circumference whatever
circumference I'm making I'm constantly

1306
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
circumference I'm making I'm constantly
 

1307
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,710
circumference I'm making I'm constantly
on the inside and here for example I

1308
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:45,720
on the inside and here for example I
 

1309
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,590
on the inside and here for example I
will be on the

1310
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:47,600
will be on the
 

1311
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,549
will be on the
inside with two feet side by

1312
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:52,559
inside with two feet side by
 

1313
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,590
inside with two feet side by
side on this one I will have two feet

1314
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:56,600
side on this one I will have two feet
 

1315
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,110
side on this one I will have two feet
side by side

1316
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,120
side by side
 

1317
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,190
side by side
where you have your your Yin half of the

1318
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,200
where you have your your Yin half of the
 

1319
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,909
where you have your your Yin half of the
universe I'm in she anti she's anai

1320
00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:06,919
universe I'm in she anti she's anai
 

1321
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,149
universe I'm in she anti she's anai
she's zai and when I get over here I'm

1322
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:10,159
she's zai and when I get over here I'm
 

1323
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,470
she's zai and when I get over here I'm
in

1324
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:11,480
in
 

1325
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,669
in
kamay so again half of the Universe I

1326
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:15,679
kamay so again half of the Universe I
 

1327
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,669
kamay so again half of the Universe I
have shisen no stance do you see that no

1328
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:18,679
have shisen no stance do you see that no
 

1329
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,069
have shisen no stance do you see that no
stance is a way to think about it uh and

1330
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:22,079
stance is a way to think about it uh and
 

1331
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,629
stance is a way to think about it uh and
so I'm in the yin

1332
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:23,639
so I'm in the yin
 

1333
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,430
so I'm in the yin
phase they're going around me it's kind

00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:28,919
of a Ura variation they're going around
 

1337
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:33,149
of a Ura variation they're going around
me at this point and this is feminine

1338

me at this point and this is feminine
 

1339
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:38,430
me at this point and this is feminine
and at this point I have a stance Comm I

1340
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:38,440
and at this point I have a stance Comm I

00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,040
have EDI do you see and my feet are
 

1343
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,550
have EDI do you see and my feet are
apart and I'm on the other side of the

00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
apart and I'm on the other side of the
 

1345
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,629
apart and I'm on the other side of the
creation act and this is masculine and

1346
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:47,639
creation act and this is masculine and
 

1347
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,310
creation act and this is masculine and
this is water and this is fire and now

1348
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,320
this is water and this is fire and now
 

1349
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,149
this is water and this is fire and now
you've completed this act that we've

1350
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:55,159
you've completed this act that we've
 

1351
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,550
you've completed this act that we've
done okay at no no point in any of this

1352
00:34:59,550 --> 00:34:59,560
done okay at no no point in any of this
 

1353
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:05,790
done okay at no no point in any of this
pattern do I make a UK Center here and

1354
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:05,800
pattern do I make a UK Center here and
 

1355
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,870
pattern do I make a UK Center here and
their head over here on a

1356
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:07,880
their head over here on a
 

1357
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,550
their head over here on a
two-dimensional plane okay what I do

1358
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:12,560
two-dimensional plane okay what I do
 

1359
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,790
two-dimensional plane okay what I do
instead is they turn like

1360
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
instead is they turn like
 

1361
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,430
instead is they turn like
this it doesn't break in half because

1362
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:20,440
this it doesn't break in half because
 

1363
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,230
this it doesn't break in half because
when you break it in half and you have

1364
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,240
when you break it in half and you have
 

1365
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,109
when you break it in half and you have
this L

1366
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:24,119
this L
 

1367
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,190
this L
shape the center stops moving the feet

1368
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
shape the center stops moving the feet
 

1369
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,430
shape the center stops moving the feet
get pinned and and it won't work okay

1370
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:30,440
get pinned and and it won't work okay
 

1371
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,750
get pinned and and it won't work okay
what I'm going to do instead is they're

1372
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:32,760
what I'm going to do instead is they're
 

1373
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,710
what I'm going to do instead is they're
going to go this way the head's going to

1374
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:35,720
going to go this way the head's going to
 

1375
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,069
going to go this way the head's going to
turn this way allowing the center to

1376
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
turn this way allowing the center to
 

1377
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,470
turn this way allowing the center to
keep going forward the head's going to

1378
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
keep going forward the head's going to
 

1379
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,510
keep going forward the head's going to
be brought

1380
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:41,520
be brought
 

1381
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,870
be brought
around back this

1382
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:43,880
around back this
 

1383
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,510
around back this
way and then it's going to go this way

1384
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:47,520
way and then it's going to go this way
 

1385
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,349
way and then it's going to go this way
okay and this does something very

1386
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:50,359
okay and this does something very
 

1387
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:52,670
okay and this does something very
important and this is where I want to

1388
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:52,680
important and this is where I want to
 

1389
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,950
important and this is where I want to
focus on because as we get to the

1390
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:54,960
focus on because as we get to the
 

1391
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,630
focus on because as we get to the
tabaki we have to make sure

1392
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:58,640
tabaki we have to make sure
 

1393
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:05,790
tabaki we have to make sure
that the outside foot does not is not

1394
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:05,800
that the outside foot does not is not
 

1395
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,150

ultimate falling geometry and I'll show
 

1399
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,510
ultimate falling geometry and I'll show
you what I mean there okay so again

1400
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520
you what I mean there okay so again

bring the head around now the feet are

1406
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:22,960
bring the head around now the feet are
 

1407
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,710
bring the head around now the feet are
forward do you see that then I bring the

1408
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:26,720
forward do you see that then I bring the
 

1409
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,069

head this way
and it's too late they don't have a foot

1412
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:31,119
and it's too late they don't have a foot
 

1413
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,390
and it's too late they don't have a foot
on the back and they're going to fall

1414
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:33,400
on the back and they're going to fall
 

1415
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:39,109

okay we in in my art and uh I think if

1416
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:39,119
okay we in in my art and uh I think if
 

1417
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,990
okay we in in my art and uh I think if
you were a sociologist I would do the

1418
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,000
you were a sociologist I would do the
 

1419
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,390
you were a sociologist I would do the
following

taken out the leg on coku hole for my UK
 

1437
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,309
taken out the leg on coku hole for my UK
that can do it but it's getting popular

1438
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:06,319
that can do it but it's getting popular
 

1439
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:08,950
that can do it but it's getting popular
now and everyone's taking out the leg

1440
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:08,960
now and everyone's taking out the leg
 

1441
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,870
now and everyone's taking out the leg
it's popular because they're watching my

doing it wrong they don't quite
 

1447
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,829
doing it wrong they don't quite
understand it okay um and that is more

1448
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:18,839
understand it okay um and that is more
 

1449
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:20,950
understand it okay um and that is more
indicative of you watch the video

1450
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:20,960
indicative of you watch the video
 

1451
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,790
indicative of you watch the video
without understanding it and you haven't

1452

geometry okay uh all right so I'm going

1456
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:28,040
geometry okay uh all right so I'm going
 

1457
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,589
geometry okay uh all right so I'm going
to show you what we're trying to solve

1458
00:37:30,589 --> 00:37:30,599
to show you what we're trying to solve
 

1459
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,790
to show you what we're trying to solve
martially with this problem we're going

1460
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:32,800
martially with this problem we're going
 

1461
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,030
martially with this problem we're going
to solve all those no need for inertia

1462
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,040
to solve all those no need for inertia
 

1463
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,390
to solve all those no need for inertia
uh modification by UK and we're going to

1464
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,400
uh modification by UK and we're going to
 

1465
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,030
uh modification by UK and we're going to
make sure that they can actually

1466
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,040
make sure that they can actually
 

1467
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,910
make sure that they can actually
fall all right so as I did it with Bou

1468
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:46,920
fall all right so as I did it with Bou
 

1469
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,950
fall all right so as I did it with Bou
when she got me

1470
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:48,960
when she got me
 

1471
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,030
when she got me
here because I'm here and he goes to

1472
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,040
here because I'm here and he goes to
 

1473
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,069
here because I'm here and he goes to
push me if I did not want to bend in the

1474
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:55,079
push me if I did not want to bend in the
 

1475
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,550
push me if I did not want to bend in the
waist changing the inertia value as

1476
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:57,560
waist changing the inertia value as
 

1477
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,790
waist changing the inertia value as
again now

1478
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:58,800
again now
 

1479
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,550
again now
choreograph I could very well as any

1480
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:01,560
choreograph I could very well as any
 

1481
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,670
choreograph I could very well as any
fighter would would move away from the

1482
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:05,680
fighter would would move away from the
 

1483
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,109
fighter would would move away from the
force acting on their body and regain a

1484
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:09,119
force acting on their body and regain a
 

1485
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,270
force acting on their body and regain a
structural Integrity so this foot is now

1486
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:12,280
structural Integrity so this foot is now
 

1487
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,670
structural Integrity so this foot is now
movable okay that's the part that when I

1488
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:16,680
movable okay that's the part that when I
 

1489
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,550
movable okay that's the part that when I
did my move here for the throw there or

1490
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:19,560
did my move here for the throw there or
 

1491
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,750
did my move here for the throw there or
I did my move here to come in right that

1492
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:22,760
I did my move here to come in right that
 

1493
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,109
I did my move here to come in right that
foot was relevant to it so we don't want

1494
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:26,119
foot was relevant to it so we don't want
 

1495
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:28,950
foot was relevant to it so we don't want
UK to have control of that

1496
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:28,960
UK to have control of that
 

1497
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,109
UK to have control of that
foot so we want to preoccupy the foot

1498
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:32,119
foot so we want to preoccupy the foot
 

1499
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:35,750
foot so we want to preoccupy the foot
with the forward progress okay so we'll

1500
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:35,760
with the forward progress okay so we'll
 

1501
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,990
with the forward progress okay so we'll
start with katate I know your question

1502
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,000
start with katate I know your question
 

1503
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,950
start with katate I know your question
was on monot but when we go to monot we

1504
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:41,960
was on monot but when we go to monot we
 

1505
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,790
was on monot but when we go to monot we
have to ensure that we understand this

1506
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:43,800
have to ensure that we understand this
 

1507
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,710
have to ensure that we understand this
concept okay so right here in this

1508
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:46,720
concept okay so right here in this
 

1509
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,390
concept okay so right here in this
progression I'm going to show you that

1510
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:49,400
progression I'm going to show you that
 

1511
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,670
progression I'm going to show you that
pattern and we'll get to that foot okay

1512
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:52,680
pattern and we'll get to that foot okay
 

1513
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,190
pattern and we'll get to that foot okay
so he's got spinal

1514
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:56,200
so he's got spinal
 

1515
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,430
so he's got spinal
displacement on I don't contest I go

1516
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,440
displacement on I don't contest I go
 

1517
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,309
displacement on I don't contest I go
with it you see I make him go around me

1518
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:04,319
with it you see I make him go around me
 

1519
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:06,950
with it you see I make him go around me
but he's tilting do you see like the

1520
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:06,960
but he's tilting do you see like the
 

1521
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,550
but he's tilting do you see like the
marker was I step inside the arc that

1522
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:11,560
marker was I step inside the arc that
 

1523
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,270
marker was I step inside the arc that
I'm going to make we already know this

1524
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:14,280
I'm going to make we already know this
 

1525
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,069
I'm going to make we already know this
is now qua and my goal martially is to

1526
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:18,079
is now qua and my goal martially is to
 

1527
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,390
is now qua and my goal martially is to
get rid of the grip in terms of it it's

1528
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:21,400
get rid of the grip in terms of it it's
 

1529
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,069
get rid of the grip in terms of it it's
not I don't pull the hand like in that

1530
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:23,079
not I don't pull the hand like in that
 

1531
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:25,790
not I don't pull the hand like in that
other technique I'm looking for his head

1532
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:25,800
other technique I'm looking for his head
 

1533
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,710
other technique I'm looking for his head
to come and touch my shoulder ug could

1534
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:29,720
to come and touch my shoulder ug could
 

1535
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,190
to come and touch my shoulder ug could
let go all he wants but because of the

1536
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
let go all he wants but because of the
 

1537
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,950
let go all he wants but because of the
inertia going forward the centrifical

1538
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:35,960
inertia going forward the centrifical
 

1539
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,150
inertia going forward the centrifical
energy and his contrast to cental energy

1540
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,160
energy and his contrast to cental energy
 

1541
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,589
energy and his contrast to cental energy
plus my internal skills I can manipulate

1542
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:42,599
plus my internal skills I can manipulate
 

1543
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,829
plus my internal skills I can manipulate
him here okay and he's starting to go

1544
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:45,839
him here okay and he's starting to go
 

1545
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,790
him here okay and he's starting to go
around and that is what we

1546
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,800

 

1547
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,670

want we walk that foot preoccupied with

1548
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:53,680
want we walk that foot preoccupied with
 

1549
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,990
want we walk that foot preoccupied with
the forward

1550
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,000
the forward
 

1551
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,910
the forward
inertia we're going really slow when you

1552
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:57,920
inertia we're going really slow when you
 

1553
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,790
inertia we're going really slow when you
go faster everything gets easier and

1554
00:39:59,790 --> 00:39:59,800
go faster everything gets easier and
 

1555
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,550
go faster everything gets easier and
better okay so I don't contest here I go

1556
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:04,560
better okay so I don't contest here I go
 

1557
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,190
better okay so I don't contest here I go
around I step inside the arc that I'm

1558
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,200
around I step inside the arc that I'm
 

1559
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,069
around I step inside the arc that I'm
going to make I tilt his body I get his

1560
00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:11,079
going to make I tilt his body I get his
 

1561
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:17,349
going to make I tilt his body I get his
head and I get that foot going

1562
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:17,359

 

1563
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:23,990

forward room

1564
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,000

 

1565
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,829

inside that's what we're trying to do

1566
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:26,839
inside that's what we're trying to do
 

1567
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:30,950
inside that's what we're trying to do
here he will a good your good athlete is

1568
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:30,960
here he will a good your good athlete is
 

1569
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,390
here he will a good your good athlete is
going to at some point get that foot

1570
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
going to at some point get that foot
 

1571
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,550
going to at some point get that foot
back you see and offer I have inertia

1572
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:37,560
back you see and offer I have inertia
 

1573
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,470
back you see and offer I have inertia
here again if that ever happen I don't

1574
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:40,480
here again if that ever happen I don't
 

1575
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,829
here again if that ever happen I don't
try to bend him or throw him you have to

1576
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:42,839
try to bend him or throw him you have to
 

1577
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,829
try to bend him or throw him you have to
go to something else that then that

1578
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:44,839
go to something else that then that
 

1579
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:47,470
go to something else that then that
technique didn't work cuz you jacked it

1580
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:47,480
technique didn't work cuz you jacked it
 

1581
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,910
technique didn't work cuz you jacked it
up but this is why in the technique

1582
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:49,920
up but this is why in the technique
 

1583
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,430
up but this is why in the technique
we're going to try to go slow but before

1584
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:52,440
we're going to try to go slow but before
 

1585
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,630
we're going to try to go slow but before
he gets that foot back I'm in and

1586
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:55,640
he gets that foot back I'm in and
 

1587
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,550
he gets that foot back I'm in and
attacking the other leg so

1588
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:58,560
attacking the other leg so
 

1589
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,230
attacking the other leg so
you do see some UK when I go slow and

1590
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:01,240
you do see some UK when I go slow and
 

1591
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,910
you do see some UK when I go slow and
light they get it there but they're not

1592
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:04,920
light they get it there but they're not
 

1593
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,190
light they get it there but they're not
they're not here nor here they're like

1594
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,200
they're not here nor here they're like
 

1595
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,790
they're not here nor here they're like
toe and the other leg is being buckled

1596
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:12,800
toe and the other leg is being buckled
 

1597
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,990
toe and the other leg is being buckled
okay and then the throw is still viable

1598
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:19,000

 

1599
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,069

okay okay now let's get into your

1600
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:23,079
okay okay now let's get into your
 

1601
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,750
okay okay now let's get into your
question about uh katate versus m okay

1602
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:27,760
question about uh katate versus m okay
 

1603
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,790
question about uh katate versus m okay
so if you pay

1604
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:29,800
so if you pay
 

1605
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,349
so if you pay
attention you can come closer to this

1606
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:32,359
attention you can come closer to this
 

1607
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:35,670
attention you can come closer to this
and you can stand up so you can see

1608
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:35,680
and you can stand up so you can see
 

1609
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,230
and you can stand up so you can see
okay

1610
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:37,240
okay
 

1611
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:43,069
okay
B is a combination of

1612
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:43,079

 

1613
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:48,670

Kate and II kador

1614
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:48,680
Kate and II kador
 

1615
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,589
Kate and II kador
okay what is doing

1616
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:51,599
okay what is doing
 

1617
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,550
okay what is doing
alchemically is it's increased the

1618
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:54,560
alchemically is it's increased the
 

1619
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,309
alchemically is it's increased the
katate weight okay in this technique

1620
00:41:59,309 --> 00:41:59,319
katate weight okay in this technique
 

1621
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:02,710
katate weight okay in this technique
so he has so much

1622
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:02,720
so he has so much
 

1623
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,790
so he has so much
mass he has more mass okay but what I'm

1624
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:06,800
mass he has more mass okay but what I'm
 

1625
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,230
mass he has more mass okay but what I'm
doing is exactly the

1626
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:09,240
doing is exactly the
 

1627
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,870
doing is exactly the
same the second hand only becomes a

1628
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:13,880
same the second hand only becomes a
 

1629
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,510
same the second hand only becomes a
problem when I'm trying to overpower you

1630
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:16,520
problem when I'm trying to overpower you
 

1631
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,470
problem when I'm trying to overpower you
you see so for example don't let me do

1632
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
you see so for example don't let me do
 

1633
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,430
you see so for example don't let me do
that crazy okay

1634
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,440

 

1635
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,030

so okay cool

1636
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,040
so okay cool
 

1637
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,790
so okay cool
again not martially functional cuz

1638
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:29,800
again not martially functional cuz
 

1639
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,870
again not martially functional cuz
nothing travels at that slow pace okay

1640
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:32,880
nothing travels at that slow pace okay
 

1641
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,589
nothing travels at that slow pace okay
now due to his size I'm not going to he

1642
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:36,599
now due to his size I'm not going to he
 

1643
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,710
now due to his size I'm not going to he
can you can offer way more resistance do

1644
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:38,720
can you can offer way more resistance do
 

1645
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,910
can you can offer way more resistance do
you see I can't even I can't step there

1646
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:41,920
you see I can't even I can't step there
 

1647
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,150
you see I can't even I can't step there
due to that his ability uh his physical

1648
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:45,160
due to that his ability uh his physical
 

1649
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,109
due to that his ability uh his physical
ability so it's not Marshall okay but

1650
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:48,119
ability so it's not Marshall okay but
 

1651
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,349
ability so it's not Marshall okay but
here as he comes in do you see I don't

1652
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:51,359
here as he comes in do you see I don't
 

1653
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,870
here as he comes in do you see I don't
contest there and I don't try to do any

1654
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:53,880
contest there and I don't try to do any
 

1655
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,270
contest there and I don't try to do any
kind of joint locks on you okay so

1656
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:56,280
kind of joint locks on you okay so
 

1657
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,950
kind of joint locks on you okay so
instead I turn this so what do I mean

1658
00:42:59,950 --> 00:42:59,960
instead I turn this so what do I mean
 

1659
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,390
instead I turn this so what do I mean
let's look at

1660
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:02,400
let's look at
 

1661
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,829
let's look at
katate I don't try to use open your

1662
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:05,839
katate I don't try to use open your
 

1663
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,870
katate I don't try to use open your
fingers I don't try to use my forearm

1664
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:09,880
fingers I don't try to use my forearm
 

1665
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,589
fingers I don't try to use my forearm
bone as a leverage on that thumb joint

1666
00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:14,599
bone as a leverage on that thumb joint
 

1667
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:16,270
bone as a leverage on that thumb joint
I'm not trying to do that stay there

1668
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:16,280
I'm not trying to do that stay there
 

1669
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,270
I'm not trying to do that stay there
please stay there I'm not trying to do

1670
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:20,280
please stay there I'm not trying to do
 

1671
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,950
please stay there I'm not trying to do
this and that's what happens pretend I

1672
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:22,960
this and that's what happens pretend I
 

1673
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,069
this and that's what happens pretend I
can do it that's what you're doing here

1674
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:26,079
can do it that's what you're doing here
 

1675
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,190
can do it that's what you're doing here
you see

1676
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:28,200
you see
 

1677
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,349
you see
it's still an external Force engine of

1678
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:30,359
it's still an external Force engine of
 

1679
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,109
it's still an external Force engine of
Leverage if my lever and my for my

1680
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:33,119
Leverage if my lever and my for my
 

1681
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,349
Leverage if my lever and my for my
leverage engine is not able to do the

1682
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:35,359
leverage engine is not able to do the
 

1683
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,589
leverage engine is not able to do the
work capacity to overcome your

1684
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:37,599
work capacity to overcome your
 

1685
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,710
work capacity to overcome your
resistance and it's not going to work

1686
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:39,720
resistance and it's not going to work
 

1687
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,309
resistance and it's not going to work
okay what I'm doing instead is turning

1688
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:43,319
okay what I'm doing instead is turning
 

1689
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:46,750
okay what I'm doing instead is turning
inside his grip I don't go against the

1690
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:46,760
inside his grip I don't go against the
 

1691
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,150
inside his grip I don't go against the
joints and you can see that that starts

1692
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:49,160
joints and you can see that that starts
 

1693
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,309
joints and you can see that that starts
to

1694
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:50,319
to
 

1695
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,750
to
tilt and that doesn't change whether he

1696
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:52,760
tilt and that doesn't change whether he
 

1697
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,349
tilt and that doesn't change whether he
has the other hand on

1698
00:43:54,349 --> 00:43:54,359
has the other hand on
 

1699
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:57,829
has the other hand on
it I'm not going to pull this hand

1700
00:43:57,829 --> 00:43:57,839
it I'm not going to pull this hand
 

1701
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,710
it I'm not going to pull this hand
I'm going to go inside the

1702
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:00,720
I'm going to go inside the
 

1703
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,230
I'm going to go inside the
grips okay and when I go inside the

1704
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:04,240
grips okay and when I go inside the
 

1705
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,549
grips okay and when I go inside the
grips I'm using my quaw so it's not my

1706
00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:08,559
grips I'm using my quaw so it's not my
 

1707
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:11,309
grips I'm using my quaw so it's not my
arm my quaw is doing

1708
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:11,319
arm my quaw is doing
 

1709
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:15,790
arm my quaw is doing
it and I'm taking it between his legs

1710
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:15,800
it and I'm taking it between his legs
 

1711
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,630
it and I'm taking it between his legs
where he has no base into the sh into

1712
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:18,640
where he has no base into the sh into
 

1713
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,309
where he has no base into the sh into
the

the
shikaku not into the Lead

1716
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:23,280
shikaku not into the Lead

Foot
 

1719
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,710
Foot
here and it blends with his

1720
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:28,720
here and it blends with his
 

1721
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,190

inertia forward inertia comes in thank

1722
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:32,200
inertia forward inertia comes in thank
 

1723

you don't

1724
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:35,359
you don't
 

1725
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,069
you don't
contest and then the pattern is exactly

1726
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:38,079
contest and then the pattern is exactly
 

1727
00:44:38,079 --> 00:45:08,309
contest and then the pattern is exactly
the same

1728
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:08,319

 

1729
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,270

I never had to bend his body so I don't

1730
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:11,280
I never had to bend his body so I don't
 

1731
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,150
I never had to bend his body so I don't
need to overpower his grip strength the

1732
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,160
need to overpower his grip strength the
 

1733
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,829
need to overpower his grip strength the
pattern is exactly the same he doesn't

1734
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:16,839
pattern is exactly the same he doesn't
 

1735
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,230
pattern is exactly the same he doesn't
get his foot in the back so the kadori

1736
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:20,240
get his foot in the back so the kadori
 

1737
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,870
get his foot in the back so the kadori
grip never gains power okay uh it

1738
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:23,880
grip never gains power okay uh it
 

1739
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,349
grip never gains power okay uh it
doesn't change a single thing

1740
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:27,359
doesn't change a single thing
 

1741
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,470
doesn't change a single thing

K with the grid the COA hand will only

1744
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:33,480
K with the grid the COA hand will only
 

1745
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,309
K with the grid the COA hand will only
cause problems in the other one again

1746
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:37,319
cause problems in the other one again
 

1747
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:40,670
cause problems in the other one again
assume I can do this part when you get

1748
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:40,680
assume I can do this part when you get
 

1749
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,510
assume I can do this part when you get
here if you pay attention katata D

1750
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:44,520
here if you pay attention katata D
 

1751
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,910
here if you pay attention katata D
you're fine is on the other side so he

1752
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:48,920
you're fine is on the other side so he
 

1753
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,750
you're fine is on the other side so he
can't really stop me I mean he probably

1754
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:51,760
can't really stop me I mean he probably
 

1755
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,910
can't really stop me I mean he probably
could cuz he can pull me more than I

1756
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:53,920
could cuz he can pull me more than I
 

1757
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,630
could cuz he can pull me more than I
could here okay but the other hand

1758
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:57,640
could here okay but the other hand
 

1759
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,349
could here okay but the other hand
is engaged on the back foot do you see

1760
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:01,359
is engaged on the back foot do you see
 

1761
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,430
is engaged on the back foot do you see
the kosa hand is now able to add to

1762
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:05,440
the kosa hand is now able to add to
 

1763
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,069
the kosa hand is now able to add to
whatever that back foot could have done

1764
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:08,079
whatever that back foot could have done
 

1765
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,030
whatever that back foot could have done
on his body so now you made that hand

1766
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,040
on his body so now you made that hand
 

1767
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,790
on his body so now you made that hand
push push able you g gave it and so why

1768
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:16,800
push push able you g gave it and so why
 

1769
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,630
push push able you g gave it and so why
is it a problem it's in a problem in the

1770
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:20,640

00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:32,119
that L shape they bend them over you see
 

1931
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:33,309
that L shape they bend them over you see
and then we know eventually they're

1932
00:50:33,309 --> 00:50:33,319
and then we know eventually they're
 

1933
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:34,670
and then we know eventually they're
going to bring them up and then they're

1934
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:34,680
going to bring them up and then they're
 

1935
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,750
going to bring them up and then they're
going to bring them down like that okay

1936
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:37,760
going to bring them down like that okay
 

1937
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,390
going to bring them down like that okay
So eventually this comes back here the

1938
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:41,400
So eventually this comes back here the
 

1939
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,670
So eventually this comes back here the
head comes back over and then the head

1940
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:43,680
head comes back over and then the head
 

1941
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,230
head comes back over and then the head
goes behind the spine they're now going

1942
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:46,240
goes behind the spine they're now going
 

1943
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,470
goes behind the spine they're now going
backwards so let's let's look at that

1944
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:48,480
backwards so let's let's look at that
 

1945
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,990
backwards so let's let's look at that
point right there okay so we're now

1946
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:52,000
point right there okay so we're now
 

1947
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,990
point right there okay so we're now
two-dimensional here's the lower part of

1951
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,349

and here's the upper part of the body

1952
00:50:59,349 --> 00:50:59,359
and here's the upper part of the body
 

1953
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,910
and here's the upper part of the body
going

1954
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:02,920

 

1955
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,349
