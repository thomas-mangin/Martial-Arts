00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,749
around you're going to go through those
mechanics okay and that's all you have

170
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:48,759
mechanics okay and that's all you have
 

171
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,710
mechanics okay and that's all you have
don't get greedy and start like using

172
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:51,720
don't get greedy and start like using
 

173
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,310
don't get greedy and start like using
your waist and stuff if this thing if

00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:56,680
this thing is not here with the
 

177
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,950
this thing is not here with the
imperceptible Motion in an admin it's

178
00:04:59,950 --> 00:04:59,960
imperceptible Motion in an admin it's
 

179
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,749
imperceptible Motion in an admin it's
don't go for it okay so let's say I'll

180
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:02,759
don't go for it okay so let's say I'll
 

181
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,430
don't go for it okay so let's say I'll
take all the slack out there I am and

182
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:06,440
take all the slack out there I am and
 

183
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,430
take all the slack out there I am and
now what I'll do is I'll change this to

184
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:08,440
now what I'll do is I'll change this to
 

185
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,430
now what I'll do is I'll change this to
and you didn't tap I'll change it to an

186
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:10,440
and you didn't tap I'll change it to an
 

187
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,830
and you didn't tap I'll change it to an
elbow attack so I'll just come back a

188
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:12,840
elbow attack so I'll just come back a
 

189
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,110
elbow attack so I'll just come back a
little bit and I'm going to crank the

190
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
little bit and I'm going to crank the
 

191
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,029
little bit and I'm going to crank the
wrist around the elbow and the elbow

192
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
wrist around the elbow and the elbow
 

193
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,150
wrist around the elbow and the elbow
around the

194
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
around the
 

195
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,189
around the
wrist okay so the first one is katame

196
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:22,199
wrist okay so the first one is katame
 

197
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,710
wrist okay so the first one is katame
you're doing you're doing that thing and

198
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
you're doing you're doing that thing and
 

199
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,990
you're doing you're doing that thing and
this one you're turning

200
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,000
this one you're turning
 

201
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,749
this one you're turning
here so first though take it all all the

202
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,350
kame without you violating good form and
then from there change it and now you do

208
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
then from there change it and now you do
 

209
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,629
then from there change it and now you do
the elbow

210
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:39,639
the elbow
 

211
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,749

226
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
mechanic iCal Advantage okay but
 

227
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,870
