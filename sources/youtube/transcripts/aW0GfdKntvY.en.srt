00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
when you're a beginner
 

67
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,030
when you're a beginner
you struggle with another person of your

68
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,040
you struggle with another person of your
 

69
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,889
you struggle with another person of your
own level perhaps

70
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:51,899
own level perhaps
 

71
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,950
own level perhaps
and that doesn't bother you because

72
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
and that doesn't bother you because
 

73
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,690
and that doesn't bother you because
you're trying to do it they're trying to

74
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:56,700
you're trying to do it they're trying to
 

75
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,749
you're trying to do it they're trying to
do you're both struggling

76
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
do you're both struggling
 

77
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,410
do you're both struggling
as the years go by

78
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:03,420

 

79
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,929

you will get better

80
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:05,939
you will get better
 

81
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,190
you will get better
and you'll find that the beginners can

82
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,200
and you'll find that the beginners can
 

83
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,470
and you'll find that the beginners can
not do exactly what

84
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
not do exactly what
 

85
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,930
not do exactly what
you want them to do with their body

86
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:14,940
you want them to do with their body
 

87
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,070
you want them to do with their body
and they mess up your shinagi because

88
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,080
and they mess up your shinagi because
 

89
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,890
and they mess up your shinagi because
they move they move wrongly you know

90
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:21,900
they move they move wrongly you know
 

91
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,949
they move they move wrongly you know
they don't they don't move how it's

92
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:23,959
they don't they don't move how it's
 

93
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,250
they don't they don't move how it's
programmed as planned

94
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,260

 

95
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,530

so you start telling them how they got a

96
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:30,540
so you start telling them how they got a
 

97
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,330
so you start telling them how they got a
hole and how they got to stand how

98
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:32,340
hole and how they got to stand how
 

99
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,630
hole and how they got to stand how
they've got to blend

100
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:35,640

 

101
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,150

so they're not really the best people to

102
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
so they're not really the best people to
 

103
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,070
so they're not really the best people to
train with

104
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
train with
 

105
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,830
train with
this is what your mind is thinking

106
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:42,840
this is what your mind is thinking
 

107
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,550
this is what your mind is thinking
so so you can either train with someone

108
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
so so you can either train with someone
 

109
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,729
so so you can either train with someone
of your own level your own grade

110
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:49,739
of your own level your own grade
 

111
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,390
of your own level your own grade
and that's always enjoyable

112
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:53,400

 

113
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,070

because you may have really good

114
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,080
because you may have really good
 

115
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,690
because you may have really good
training together you may be really

116
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:56,700
training together you may be really
 

117
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,290
training together you may be really
finely balanced but really this is on a

118
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:00,300
finely balanced but really this is on a
 

119
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,710
finely balanced but really this is on a
technical level

120
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:03,720

 

121
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,710

if you go into the black belts once you

122
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
if you go into the black belts once you
 

123
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,530
if you go into the black belts once you
get to the black belts and you can then

124
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:09,540
get to the black belts and you can then

and it's it's like starting all over
 

163
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,350
and it's it's like starting all over
again

164
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
again
 

165
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,030
again
so you can

166
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
so you can
 

167
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,430
so you can
for a little bit of confidence go back

168
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:01,440
for a little bit of confidence go back
 

169
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,130
for a little bit of confidence go back
and train with the lower grades know

170
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:04,140
and train with the lower grades know
 

171
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,570
and train with the lower grades know
that you can do this here and I guess

172
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:05,580
