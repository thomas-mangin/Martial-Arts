it it was to tamy there so I thought
 

667
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,069
it it was to tamy there so I thought
right take shoes off leave them there

Ginger and I had to guess roughly where
 

675
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,029
Ginger and I had to guess roughly where
the center would be but of course I knew

of night I closed the door as I come
 

689
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,669
of night I closed the door as I come
in and it was so black I can remember

00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:06,679
in and it was so black I can remember
 

691
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,350
in and it was so black I can remember
now that when it's that black that you

692
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
now that when it's that black that you
 

693
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,149
now that when it's that black that you
cannot even see your hand if you put it

694
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:14,159
cannot even see your hand if you put it
 

695
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,390
cannot even see your hand if you put it
up in front of your

and that didn't deter me because I just

700
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
and that didn't deter me because I just
 

701
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,789
and that didn't deter me because I just
wanted to be in O

00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
started and all I can tell you is
 

715
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,070
started and all I can tell you is
whether I have a vivid imagination

716
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,080
whether I have a vivid imagination
 

717
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,990
whether I have a vivid imagination
perhaps I do but it sounded like all the

00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:34,480
before and I've tried to replicate them
 

747
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,830
before and I've tried to replicate them
on one of the films

748
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
on one of the films
 

749
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,430
on one of the films
but not with great success but they were

different directions the voices were so
 

781
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,029
different directions the voices were so
turbulent

782
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,039
turbulent
 

783
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,750
turbulent
that the only thing I could think of and

784
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:39,760
that the only thing I could think of and
 

785
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,549
that the only thing I could think of and
it must have been a natural reaction was

786
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:41,559
it must have been a natural reaction was
 

787
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:45,470
it must have been a natural reaction was
to cling on to the tatami and hope that

788
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:45,480
to cling on to the tatami and hope that
 

789
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,630
to cling on to the tatami and hope that
they wouldn't take me somewhere or do

790
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:48,640
they wouldn't take me somewhere or do
 

791
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,870
they wouldn't take me somewhere or do
something with

792
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:49,880
something with
 

793
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,710
something with
me um perhaps that was one of the few

794
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
me um perhaps that was one of the few
 

795
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,870
me um perhaps that was one of the few
times in life where I actually

796
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:55,880
times in life where I actually
 

797
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,350
times in life where I actually
feared the unknown

798
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360

 

799
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,909

I came after it calmed down it did calm

800
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:04,919
I came after it calmed down it did calm
 

801
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,390
I came after it calmed down it did calm
down the sounds and it I'm sure it

802
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:07,400
down the sounds and it I'm sure it
 

803
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,510
down the sounds and it I'm sure it
wasn't there only for a few perhaps

804
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
wasn't there only for a few perhaps
 

805
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,029
wasn't there only for a few perhaps
seconds it might have been there longer

806
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:12,039
seconds it might have been there longer
 

807
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,149
seconds it might have been there longer
but I don't know but I I just hung on

808
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,159
but I don't know but I I just hung on
 

809
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,029
but I don't know but I I just hung on
and hung on and when it all went still

810
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:18,039
and hung on and when it all went still
 

811
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,350
and hung on and when it all went still
again I slowly choed backwards to the

812
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:22,360
again I slowly choed backwards to the
 

813
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,549
again I slowly choed backwards to the
door or where I guess the door was I

814
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:25,559
door or where I guess the door was I

now by telling you

904
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:48,720

 

905
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,350

that perhaps is dojo is meant and

00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,360
that perhaps is dojo is meant and
 

907
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,230
that perhaps is dojo is meant and
perhaps that's what the spirits are

908

perhaps that's what the spirits are
 

909
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,549
perhaps that's what the spirits are
telling me to pass on what I I can about

910
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:58,559
telling me to pass on what I I can about
 

911
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,870
telling me to pass on what I I can about
the spiritual aspects that I've found

912
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
the spiritual aspects that I've found
 

913
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,310
the spiritual aspects that I've found
throughout my iido career rather than

914
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320
throughout my iido career rather than
 

915
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,190
throughout my iido career rather than
keeping them personally to myself and

916
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
keeping them personally to myself and
 

917
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,630
keeping them personally to myself and
everybody thinking I'm a lunatic or

925
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,549
so so to me this was an indication that
I should um now

926
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:23,559
