00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:28,150

Chris

2
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160

 

3
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:36,790

Turn.

4
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800

 

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,470

Okay,

6
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
Okay,
 

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,229
Okay,
let's sophisticate our head office a

8
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
let's sophisticate our head office a
 

9
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,990
let's sophisticate our head office a
little bit. The guy is down and we'll

10
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit. The guy is down and we'll
 

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,350
little bit. The guy is down and we'll
introduce the concept uh point of no

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,360
introduce the concept uh point of no
 

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,150
introduce the concept uh point of no
return. Okay, so his spine

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
return. Okay, so his spine
 

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,270
return. Okay, so his spine
is his axis of rotation.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
is his axis of rotation.
 

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,590
is his axis of rotation.
So if I get

18
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
So if I get
 

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,709
So if I get
way over here. I'm very easily going to

20
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
way over here. I'm very easily going to
 

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,390
way over here. I'm very easily going to
lose my balance over on this side. Okay?

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
lose my balance over on this side. Okay?
 

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,789
lose my balance over on this side. Okay?
So, your weight

24
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
So, your weight
 

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,070
So, your weight
should be on this side of that spine.

26
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
should be on this side of that spine.
 

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,230
should be on this side of that spine.
Your your center of gravity this side of

28
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
Your your center of gravity this side of
 

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,270
Your your center of gravity this side of
the spine, never over. Okay? A lot of

30
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
the spine, never over. Okay? A lot of
 

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,350
the spine, never over. Okay? A lot of
times he'll try to get me to go over.

32
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
times he'll try to get me to go over.
 

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,190
times he'll try to get me to go over.
So, we're not going to do it. He has to

34
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
So, we're not going to do it. He has to
 

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,190
So, we're not going to do it. He has to
earn it. Okay? So if you're trying to be

36
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
earn it. Okay? So if you're trying to be
 

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,190
earn it. Okay? So if you're trying to be
heavy, you can't can't get so heavy

38
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
heavy, you can't can't get so heavy
 

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,070
heavy, you can't can't get so heavy
because it's going to get light. I'm

40
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,080
because it's going to get light. I'm
 

41
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,109
because it's going to get light. I'm
kind of here. So if he tries that same

42
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
kind of here. So if he tries that same
 

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,749
kind of here. So if he tries that same
move again, it's too much weight on this

44
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
move again, it's too much weight on this
 

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,789
move again, it's too much weight on this
side and get topped over. Okay. So let's

46
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
side and get topped over. Okay. So let's
 

47
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:46,050
side and get topped over. Okay. So let's
fix that.

48
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,060

 

49
00:01:46,060 --> 00:02:12,150

[Music]

50
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160

 

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,309

Sorry,

52
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319

00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319

 

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,430

Okay.

56
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440

 

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,949

And uh let's pay attention to

58
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
And uh let's pay attention to
 

59
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,949
And uh let's pay attention to
um

60
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
um
 

61
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,949
um
what's a real danger and what's not a

62
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
what's a real danger and what's not a
 

63
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,229
what's a real danger and what's not a
real danger. Okay. So, Sean, you can do

64
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
real danger. Okay. So, Sean, you can do
 

65
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,430
real danger. Okay. So, Sean, you can do
your test.

66
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440

 

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,869

Okay. as he's here and he squeezes

68
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
Okay. as he's here and he squeezes
 

69
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,509
Okay. as he's here and he squeezes
really hard, it doesn't really do

70
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
really hard, it doesn't really do
 

71
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,270
really hard, it doesn't really do
anything to me. My trachea, my veins and

72
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
anything to me. My trachea, my veins and
 

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,309
anything to me. My trachea, my veins and
arteries are not impacted by this, okay?

74
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
arteries are not impacted by this, okay?
 

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,910
arteries are not impacted by this, okay?
So, I don't have to emotionally start

76
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
So, I don't have to emotionally start
 

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,390
So, I don't have to emotionally start
freaking out.

78
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
freaking out.
 

79
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,229
freaking out.
This is not a very trained response,

80
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
This is not a very trained response,
 

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,750
This is not a very trained response,
okay? But it's a very common one. So, as

82
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
okay? But it's a very common one. So, as
 

83
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,030
okay? But it's a very common one. So, as
he's squeezing me, go ahead. I have to

84
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
he's squeezing me, go ahead. I have to
 

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,030
he's squeezing me, go ahead. I have to
learn to relax because if I start

86
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
learn to relax because if I start
 

87
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,070
learn to relax because if I start
tensing then it feels like crazy

88
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
tensing then it feels like crazy
 

89
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:26,070
tensing then it feels like crazy
Okay, let him squeeze it and I release.

90
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080

 

91
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,470

Okay, that's going to be our first

92
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480
Okay, that's going to be our first
 

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,229
Okay, that's going to be our first
thing. He's going to squeeze it and

94
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
thing. He's going to squeeze it and
 

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,990
thing. He's going to squeeze it and
you're going to release just like in

96
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
you're going to release just like in
 

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,830
you're going to release just like in
there. Okay, and you'll feel like you

98
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
there. Okay, and you'll feel like you
 

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,789
there. Okay, and you'll feel like you
you should feel two things. He gets

100
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
you should feel two things. He gets
 

101
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,110
you should feel two things. He gets
tired because he had he feels like I

102
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
tired because he had he feels like I
 

103
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,350
tired because he had he feels like I
should squeeze harder. Um, and you can

104
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
should squeeze harder. Um, and you can
 

105
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,190
should squeeze harder. Um, and you can
feel the fatigue cycle because all his

106
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
feel the fatigue cycle because all his
 

107
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,710
feel the fatigue cycle because all his
muscles are tensing and then you feel

108
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
muscles are tensing and then you feel
 

109
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,110
muscles are tensing and then you feel
like I feel a lot better now than when I

110
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
like I feel a lot better now than when I
 

111
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,509
like I feel a lot better now than when I
was tensing up to it. So, what you're

112
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
was tensing up to it. So, what you're
 

113
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,350
was tensing up to it. So, what you're
going to do is they're going to squeeze,

114
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
going to do is they're going to squeeze,
 

115
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,429
going to do is they're going to squeeze,
you're going to tense up and see how

116
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
you're going to tense up and see how
 

117
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,229
you're going to tense up and see how
uncomfortable, right? Tap out when that

118
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
uncomfortable, right? Tap out when that
 

119
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,910
uncomfortable, right? Tap out when that
happens. You're actually making the

120
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
happens. You're actually making the
 

121
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,350
happens. You're actually making the
pressure. And then on the next one,

122
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
pressure. And then on the next one,
 

123
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,869
pressure. And then on the next one,
they're going to squeeze and you're

124
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
they're going to squeeze and you're
 

125
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,550
they're going to squeeze and you're
going to do the release just like in

126
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
going to do the release just like in
 

127
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,830
going to do the release just like in

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,390
it's it seems uh
maybe like a setup or silliness, but

168
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
maybe like a setup or silliness, but
 

169
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,510
maybe like a setup or silliness, but
here I had the same exact

170
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
here I had the same exact
 

171
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,629
here I had the same exact
environmental conditions happening, but

172
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
environmental conditions happening, but
 

173
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,510
environmental conditions happening, but
I had two different experiences based on

174
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
I had two different experiences based on
 

175
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,029
I had two different experiences based on
how I've responded to them. Okay. And

176
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
how I've responded to them. Okay. And
 

177
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,350
how I've responded to them. Okay. And
that as we take that macrocosmically,

178
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
that as we take that macrocosmically,
 

179
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,189
that as we take that macrocosmically,
this is

180
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
this is
 

181
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,230
this is
I could live and I could experience the

182
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
I could live and I could experience the
 

183
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,189
I could live and I could experience the
world one way or can experience the

184
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
world one way or can experience the
 

185
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,270
world one way or can experience the
world in an entirely different way.

186
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
world in an entirely different way.
 

187
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,070
world in an entirely different way.
Okay. Um, one way sucked. One way wasn't

188
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
Okay. Um, one way sucked. One way wasn't
 

189
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,469
Okay. Um, one way sucked. One way wasn't
so bad at all. Okay. All right. myself.

190
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
so bad at all. Okay. All right. myself.
 

191
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,990
so bad at all. Okay. All right. myself.
Whatever we do, however we move, you

192
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
Whatever we do, however we move, you
 

193
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,230
Whatever we do, however we move, you
have to be relaxed because you're just

194
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
have to be relaxed because you're just
 

195
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,550
have to be relaxed because you're just
going to make everything worse and

196
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
going to make everything worse and
 

197
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,110
going to make everything worse and
everything seems like there's no place

198
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
everything seems like there's no place
 

199
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,590
everything seems like there's no place
to move. There's nothing to do from that

200
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
to move. There's nothing to do from that
 

201
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,870
to move. There's nothing to do from that
tension spot. Okay. All right. So, he's

202
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
tension spot. Okay. All right. So, he's
 

203
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,189
tension spot. Okay. All right. So, he's
going to get the headlock

204
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
going to get the headlock
 

205
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,950
going to get the headlock
and let's look where I can move. Okay.

206
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
and let's look where I can move. Okay.
 

207
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,189
and let's look where I can move. Okay.
My arms can move, my legs can move.

208
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
My arms can move, my legs can move.
 

209
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,990
My arms can move, my legs can move.
Where can't I move? So, I'm gonna go.

210
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
Where can't I move? So, I'm gonna go.
 

211
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,390
Where can't I move? So, I'm gonna go.
That's where it starts craving on me.

212
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
That's where it starts craving on me.
 

213
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,390
That's where it starts craving on me.
Got it.

214
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
Got it.
 

215
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,270
Got it.
I try to turn my head. Nope. I can't

216
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
I try to turn my head. Nope. I can't
 

217
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,510
I try to turn my head. Nope. I can't
turn my head there. Okay. Um, let's say

218
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
turn my head there. Okay. Um, let's say
 

219
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,029
turn my head there. Okay. Um, let's say
this arm. I just keep my back flat.

220
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
this arm. I just keep my back flat.
 

221
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,029
this arm. I just keep my back flat.
Can I move that arm? Nope. That brought

222
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
Can I move that arm? Nope. That brought
 

223
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,629
Can I move that arm? Nope. That brought
tension in there. Okay. So, here's our

224
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
tension in there. Okay. So, here's our
 

225
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,790
tension in there. Okay. So, here's our
discovery learning. He's going to do the

226
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
discovery learning. He's going to do the
 

227
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,110
discovery learning. He's going to do the
headlock.

228
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
headlock.
 

229
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,589
headlock.
I'm going to move till I'm making it

230
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
I'm going to move till I'm making it
 

231
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,270
I'm going to move till I'm making it
tighter. God. Okay. I'm going to turn my

232
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
tighter. God. Okay. I'm going to turn my
 

233
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,150
tighter. God. Okay. I'm going to turn my
head to the left. No, that wasn't it.

234
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
head to the left. No, that wasn't it.
 

235
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,749
head to the left. No, that wasn't it.
Staying flat on my back, I'm going to

236
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
Staying flat on my back, I'm going to
 

237
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,150
Staying flat on my back, I'm going to
try to pull my arm

238
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
try to pull my arm
 

239
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,870
try to pull my arm
up. Okay. And you'll see that's not the

240
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
up. Okay. And you'll see that's not the
 

241
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,230
up. Okay. And you'll see that's not the
end space. But

257
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,469

Okay. So your your jogging on his

258
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
Okay. So your your jogging on his
 

259
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,990
Okay. So your your jogging on his
yonging is increasing the force value at

260
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
yonging is increasing the force value at
 

261
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,070
yonging is increasing the force value at
his contact point. Okay. Um so that's

262
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
his contact point. Okay. Um so that's
 

263
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,710
his contact point. Okay. Um so that's
not if you feel anything like that. If

264
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
not if you feel anything like that. If
 

265
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,990
not if you feel anything like that. If
you feel the force value increasing,

you feel the force value increasing,
 

267
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,230
you feel the force value increasing,
you're not moving into the institute.

you're not moving into the institute.
 

269
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,389
you're not moving into the institute.
Okay? No matter how relaxed you are,

270
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
Okay? No matter how relaxed you are,
 

271
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,790
Okay? No matter how relaxed you are,
eventually everything's going to tighten

272
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
eventually everything's going to tighten
 

273
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,670
eventually everything's going to tighten
on you. Okay? So, here he is back on.

274
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
on you. Okay? So, here he is back on.

This arm

276
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
This arm
 

277
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,790
This arm
is not helping me back here because

278
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800
is not helping me back here because
 

279
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,030
is not helping me back here because
while he can't choke me, he can

280
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
while he can't choke me, he can
 

281
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,910
while he can't choke me, he can
certainly punch me in the face. You see?

282
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
certainly punch me in the face. You see?
 

283
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,790
certainly punch me in the face. You see?
So, I got to get this arm

284
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
So, I got to get this arm
 

285
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,990
So, I got to get this arm
somewhere. Let me shut over here,

286
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
somewhere. Let me shut over here,
 

287
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,430
somewhere. Let me shut over here,
but I can't do it when I'm flat.

288
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
but I can't do it when I'm flat.
 

289
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,750
but I can't do it when I'm flat.
So, I can move this way. You see? But if

290
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
So, I can move this way. You see? But if
 

291
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,670
So, I can move this way. You see? But if
I go too far, that's young. So, I'm

292
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
I go too far, that's young. So, I'm
 

293
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,990
I go too far, that's young. So, I'm
going to just move enough and I go in

294
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
going to just move enough and I go in
 

295
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,509
going to just move enough and I go in
where

296
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519
where
 

297
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,990
where
he has those little water holes like the

298
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
he has those little water holes like the
 

299
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,710
he has those little water holes like the
river going down. And now my hands are

300
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
river going down. And now my hands are
 

301
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,230
river going down. And now my hands are
over here. So, I'm do it again.

302
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
over here. So, I'm do it again.
 

303
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,389
over here. So, I'm do it again.
He's there. I turn sideways and I go

304
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
He's there. I turn sideways and I go
 

305
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,990
He's there. I turn sideways and I go
around all his mass. And now my hands in

306
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
around all his mass. And now my hands in
 

307
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,190
around all his mass. And now my hands in
front of me. Okay,

308
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
front of me. Okay,
 

309
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,509
front of me. Okay,
let's try that. And while I'm teaching

310
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
let's try that. And while I'm teaching
 

311
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,829
let's try that. And while I'm teaching
this, you want to you should feel free

312
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
this, you want to you should feel free
 

313
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,750
this, you want to you should feel free
to walk around and see all the different

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
to walk around and see all the different
 

315
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:22,949
to walk around and see all the different
angles. Okay.

317
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,350

Turn slightly on your side and start to

Turn slightly on your side and start to

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,110
Turn slightly on your side and start to
bring that arm through all the little

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
bring that arm through all the little
 

321
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,630
bring that arm through all the little
cracks,

322
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
cracks,
 

323
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,269

not forcing them.

00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
not forcing them.

So pay pay attention.
If I'm on this side,

356
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
If I'm on this side,
 

357
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,630
If I'm on this side,
so he can't flip me over. You see the

358
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
so he can't flip me over. You see the
 

359
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,710
so he can't flip me over. You see the
space?

360
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
space?
 

361
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,630
space?
I can get rid of that space. Stay there.

362
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
I can get rid of that space. Stay there.
 

363
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,910
I can get rid of that space. Stay there.
Still I can get rid of that space. But

364
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
Still I can get rid of that space. But
 

365
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,069
Still I can get rid of that space. But
now what happened?

366
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
now what happened?
 

367
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,310
now what happened?
Over under. Okay. So, I don't mind if we

368
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
Over under. Okay. So, I don't mind if we
 

369
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,030
Over under. Okay. So, I don't mind if we
keep it a little alive. If you feel that

370
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
keep it a little alive. If you feel that
 

371
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,949
keep it a little alive. If you feel that
there's no space, they're probably over

372
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
there's no space, they're probably over
 

373
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,710
there's no space, they're probably over
the point of no return. You just turn

374
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
the point of no return. You just turn
 

375
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,710
the point of no return. You just turn
them over that way. Okay? Does that make

376
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
them over that way. Okay? Does that make
 

377
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,470
them over that way. Okay? Does that make
sense? Otherwise, have good form. Keep

378
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
sense? Otherwise, have good form. Keep
 

379
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,150
sense? Otherwise, have good form. Keep
yourself on this side of the point of no

380
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
yourself on this side of the point of no
 

381
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,630
yourself on this side of the point of no
return. And he'll find that space by

382
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:00,640
return. And he'll find that space by
 

383
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,110
return. And he'll find that space by
turning onto his side and bring this arm

384
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
turning onto his side and bring this arm
 

385
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,389

elbow there. And now my hand can get a
 

461
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,990
elbow there. And now my hand can get a
little deeper if I move out of the way.

462
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
little deeper if I move out of the way.

So, our drill is going to be this. Now
 

547
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,390
So, our drill is going to be this. Now
we're just starting in SA. Okay. Now I'm

548
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
we're just starting in SA. Okay. Now I'm
 

549
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,430
we're just starting in SA. Okay. Now I'm
going to clear and come in like he not

00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
going to clear and come in like he not
 

551
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,789

So this move
 

557
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,430
So this move
is like that. Okay. He got that arm

558
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440

567
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,750

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
got the arm there. So, I'm just doing my
 

569
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,710

to frame and we're going to take that

718
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,120
to frame and we're going to take that
 

719
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,990
to frame and we're going to take that
elbow of the first day of energetics.

720
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,000
elbow of the first day of energetics.
 

721
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,149
elbow of the first day of energetics.
That same co elbow. I get it in place

722
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:00,159
That same co elbow. I get it in place
 

723
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,110
That same co elbow. I get it in place
and I can secure it with the other hand.

724
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
and I can secure it with the other hand.
 

725
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,230
and I can secure it with the other hand.
And now I'm not going to push him, but

726
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,240
And now I'm not going to push him, but
 

727
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,510
And now I'm not going to push him, but
he can't close on me

728
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
he can't close on me
 

729
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,990
he can't close on me
because that elbow is there.

730
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
because that elbow is there.
 

731
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,390
because that elbow is there.
This is supporting the wrist.

732
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
This is supporting the wrist.
 

733
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,789

I just move up the circle

00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:18,799
I just move up the circle
 

735
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,830
I just move up the circle
and you can see his posture is changing

736
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840

 

737
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,110

forward. Very balanced. Don't let him

738
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,120

739
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,029

00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
this way. Posture change.

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,669
this way. Posture change.
I might need and I probably could use

744
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:37,679
I might need and I probably could use
 

745
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,149
I might need and I probably could use
this push, but if I don't, I just get my

746
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:42,159
this push, but if I don't, I just get my
 

747
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,909
this push, but if I don't, I just get my
leg up there or a combination.

748
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:45,919
leg up there or a combination.
 

749
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,350
leg up there or a combination.
And now I use his head that way.

750
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360
And now I use his head that way.
 

751
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,230
And now I use his head that way.
Watch what I'm doing.

Here's his balance. Stay there.

You see with the leg,

766
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:20,960
You see with the leg,

your urge
 

769
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,149
your urge
is going to want to be to push him away

770
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159

771
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,590

your neck. Okay. So, I move out of the

any opening there?
So don't try to come out there. Go to

908
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:47,600
So don't try to come out there. Go to
 

909
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,950
So don't try to come out there. Go to
the grips or in this case I went

If you're going for the finger locks,

924
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
If you're going for the finger locks,
 

925
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,430
If you're going for the finger locks,
that's not going to do it. And he's

926
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,440
that's not going to do it. And he's
 

927
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,070
that's not going to do it. And he's
doing his wrist, but that's not doing

928
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,080
doing his wrist, but that's not doing
 

929
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,990
doing his wrist, but that's not doing
it. Finger locks go this way. You see?

930
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,000
it. Finger locks go this way. You see?
 

931
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,909
it. Finger locks go this way. You see?
Does that make sense? Okay,

932
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:25,919

 

933
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:33,590

let's try it.

934
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:33,600

 

935
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,070

Oh, feel that's getting tighter. That's

936
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,080
Oh, feel that's getting tighter. That's
 

937
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,310
Oh, feel that's getting tighter. That's
more pressure. Stop moving there. Move

938
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,320
more pressure. Stop moving there. Move
 

939
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:51,029
more pressure. Stop moving there. Move
somewhere else.

940
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:51,039

 

941
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,110

Get your arm across. Turn on to your

00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,120
Get your arm across. Turn on to your
 

943
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,430
Get your arm across. Turn on to your
side first and onto your side. That's

944
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,440
side first and onto your side. That's
 

945
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,269
side first and onto your side. That's
it. And let's put this all the way over

946
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:57,279
it. And let's put this all the way over
 

947
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,269
it. And let's put this all the way over
here. That's it. Okay. Now stay on your

948
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:01,279
here. That's it. Okay. Now stay on your
 

949
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,990
here. That's it. Okay. Now stay on your
side and move your whole body over this

950
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,000
side and move your whole body over this
 

951
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,269
side and move your whole body over this
way. And that's where he falls. Okay.

952
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:07,279
way. And that's where he falls. Okay.
 

953
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,190
way. And that's where he falls. Okay.
Now bring your leg around his neck. If

954
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,200
Now bring your leg around his neck. If
 

955
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,029
Now bring your leg around his neck. If
you need more room, you can take this

956
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,039
you need more room, you can take this
 

957
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,870
you need more room, you can take this
and that'll push his jaw up. Reach it

958
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:12,880
and that'll push his jaw up. Reach it
 

959
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,590
and that'll push his jaw up. Reach it
down. So you get your leg over his head.

down. So you get your leg over his head.
 

961
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,430
down. So you get your leg over his head.
Now you can't come here where his arm

962
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,440
Now you can't come here where his arm
 

963
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,750
Now you can't come here where his arm
is, but you you can maybe come out the

964
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:19,760
is, but you you can maybe come out the
 

965
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,669
is, but you you can maybe come out the
bottom. So take this hand. Good.

966
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:23,679
bottom. So take this hand. Good.
 

967
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,029

987
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,070
Go kill. You see
go kill the elbow has to be stabilized.

988
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,080
go kill the elbow has to be stabilized.
 

989
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,950
go kill the elbow has to be stabilized.
If the elbow's not stabilized,

990
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
If the elbow's not stabilized,
 

991
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,630
If the elbow's not stabilized,
this might stop there. You get it? So,

992
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:12,640
this might stop there. You get it? So,
 

993
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,190
this might stop there. You get it? So,
you don't care what happens because I'm

994
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
you don't care what happens because I'm
 

995
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:24,630
you don't care what happens because I'm
have this pressure here and then I

996
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:24,640

 

997
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,310

stay still. I'll figure it out. Lay

998
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,320
stay still. I'll figure it out. Lay
 

999
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,310
stay still. I'll figure it out. Lay
down.

1000
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:28,320
down.
 

1001
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,990
down.
Okay.

1002
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,000
Okay.
 

1003
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,269
Okay.
If I'm over here and I'm not controlling

1004
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:33,279
If I'm over here and I'm not controlling
 

1005
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,590
If I'm over here and I'm not controlling
that elbow, there's not going to be a

1006
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:35,600
that elbow, there's not going to be a
 

1007
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,590
that elbow, there's not going to be a
pin. Eio is I don't have any strength to

1008
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
pin. Eio is I don't have any strength to
 

1009
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,350
pin. Eio is I don't have any strength to
do that there. Okay. So, somewhere this

1010
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,360
do that there. Okay. So, somewhere this
 

1011
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,909
do that there. Okay. So, somewhere this
elbow has to be stabilized. I can keep

1012
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:45,919
elbow has to be stabilized. I can keep
 

1013
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,909
elbow has to be stabilized. I can keep
it straight.

1014
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:47,919
it straight.
 

1015
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,549
it straight.
I can take it onto the ground. I can

1016
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:50,559
I can take it onto the ground. I can
 

1017
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,110
I can take it onto the ground. I can
take it onto my body. Does that make

1018
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,120
take it onto my body. Does that make
 

1019
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,070
take it onto my body. Does that make
sense? Okay.

1020
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,080
sense? Okay.
 

1021
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,480
sense? Okay.
Try it again.

1022
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:57,490
Try it again.
 

1023
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:06,470
Try it again.

Now get your leg. Come out the inspace.
Either the grip or under the arm. Good.

1036
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,240
Either the grip or under the arm. Good.
 

1037
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,909
Either the grip or under the arm. Good.
Make sure the elbow is stabilized

1038
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:37,919
Make sure the elbow is stabilized
 

1039
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,640
Make sure the elbow is stabilized
against the wrist joint.

1040
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:41,650
against the wrist joint.
 

1041
00:33:41,650 --> 00:34:00,549
against the wrist joint.

1043
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:21,349

Stand. Don't push against the bicep.

1044
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:21,359

 

1045
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,629

Again, do you remember the preface? I'm

1058
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
Again, do you remember the preface? I'm
 

1059
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,829
Again, do you remember the preface? I'm
just trying to observe myself. Okay, so

1060
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:05,839
just trying to observe myself. Okay, so
 

1061
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,550
just trying to observe myself. Okay, so
I have a controlled environment in this

1062
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:08,560
I have a controlled environment in this
 

1063
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,270
I have a controlled environment in this
so that I'm more observable. So my is

1064
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:11,280
so that I'm more observable. So my is
 

1065
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,390
so that I'm more observable. So my is
just try a headlock. I'm not going to

1066
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:14,400
just try a headlock. I'm not going to
 

1067
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,870
just try a headlock. I'm not going to
counter all this stuff yet. Okay? But

1068
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:16,880
counter all this stuff yet. Okay? But
 

1069
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,950
counter all this stuff yet. Okay? But
I'm observing myself and I'm learning

1070
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:18,960
I'm observing myself and I'm learning
 

1071
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,150
I'm observing myself and I'm learning
what is his face feel like versus Yong's

1072
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,160
what is his face feel like versus Yong's
 

1073
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,990
what is his face feel like versus Yong's
face feel like. Okay? We also have the

1074
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,000
face feel like. Okay? We also have the
 

1075
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,790
face feel like. Okay? We also have the
added task of

1076
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:28,800
added task of
 

1077
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,430
added task of
we already addressed this. Um there's a

1078
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:31,440
we already addressed this. Um there's a
 

1079
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,589
we already addressed this. Um there's a
lot of stuff we're supposed to know from

1080
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:33,599
lot of stuff we're supposed to know from
 

1081
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,470
lot of stuff we're supposed to know from
iikido such as non-contestation

1082
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:36,480
iikido such as non-contestation
 

1083
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,589
iikido such as non-contestation
such as my but because it's all assumed

1084
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:39,599
such as my but because it's all assumed
 

1085
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,829
such as my but because it's all assumed
in the form and most of our training is

1086
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:41,839
in the form and most of our training is
 

1087
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,950
in the form and most of our training is
forms training we don't actually have

1088
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
forms training we don't actually have
 

1089
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,829
forms training we don't actually have
that skill because it was put in place

1090
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:47,839
that skill because it was put in place
 

1091
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,190
that skill because it was put in place
in the form. Okay. So right now what

1092
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,200
in the form. Okay. So right now what
 

1093
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,510
in the form. Okay. So right now what
we're seeing is I can't find go

1094
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:55,520
we're seeing is I can't find go
 

1095
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,990
we're seeing is I can't find go
because I didn't have to find it before.

1096
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,000
because I didn't have to find it before.
 

1097
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,550
because I didn't have to find it before.
it was found for me and I just follow

1098
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:00,560
it was found for me and I just follow
 

1099
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,870
it was found for me and I just follow
that model. Okay, you have to be able to

1100
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:04,880
that model. Okay, you have to be able to
 

1101
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,069
that model. Okay, you have to be able to
know that wherever this is, that's

1102
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:08,079
know that wherever this is, that's
 

1103
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,670
know that wherever this is, that's
focal.

1104
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:09,680
focal.
 

1105
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,150
focal.
All I got to do is stabilize that elbow.

1106
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,160
All I got to do is stabilize that elbow.
 

1107
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,190
All I got to do is stabilize that elbow.
Okay, make sense? Okay. Uh cuz what

1108
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:15,200
Okay, make sense? Okay. Uh cuz what
 

1109
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,990
Okay, make sense? Okay. Uh cuz what
we're seeing is you're you're no elbow

1110
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,000
we're seeing is you're you're no elbow
 

1111
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,230
we're seeing is you're you're no elbow
stabilization. We're going the other

1112
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,240
stabilization. We're going the other
 

1113
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,670
stabilization. We're going the other
way. We're doing EQ. The eco no one test

1114
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:23,680
way. We're doing EQ. The eco no one test
 

1115
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,910
way. We're doing EQ. The eco no one test
eco. Okay.

1116
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:25,920
eco. Okay.
 

1117
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,150
eco. Okay.
In real life, there's not enough thumb

1118
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,160
In real life, there's not enough thumb
 

1119
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,510
In real life, there's not enough thumb
torque that I can get that going. Go.

1120
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:31,520
torque that I can get that going. Go.
 

1121
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,030
torque that I can get that going. Go.
I can break that thing. Okay. So, do it

1122
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,040
I can break that thing. Okay. So, do it
 

1123
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,829
I can break that thing. Okay. So, do it
slow, but let us find a technique from

1124
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:37,839
slow, but let us find a technique from
 

1125
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,550
slow, but let us find a technique from
this weird inside out, upside down

1126
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:40,560
this weird inside out, upside down
 

1127
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,710
this weird inside out, upside down
positioning. Okay. All right. Let's try

1128
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:42,720
positioning. Okay. All right. Let's try
 

1129
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,710
positioning. Okay. All right. Let's try
it again.

1130
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:46,720

 

1131
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,710

And we're trading changing partners.

1132
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,720
And we're trading changing partners.
 

1133
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,589
And we're trading changing partners.
Changing partners.

1134
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:51,599
Changing partners.
 

1135
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,390
Changing partners.
Observing ourselves. Turn on to your

1139
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,510

You can't find go, you should find the

1140
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:07,520
You can't find go, you should find the
 

1141
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,790
You can't find go, you should find the
inverse, which would be a finger lock.

1142
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:12,800

 

1143
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,270

Come out the yin space. The bicep is not

1144
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,280
Come out the yin space. The bicep is not
 

1145
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,550
Come out the yin space. The bicep is not

00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:46,559

 

1679
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,870

1683
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,950
Uh,
what's different?

00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:54,960
what's different?
 

1685
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,510
what's different?
One's a projection at that point and one

1689
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,549

What's different? Seemed like the

Okay. My stance didn't get compromised,

1694
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:06,640
Okay. My stance didn't get compromised,
 

1695
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,109
Okay. My stance didn't get compromised,
I would say. What's the tension level

1696
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:09,119
I would say. What's the tension level
 

1697
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,270
I would say. What's the tension level
difference? Tension. Your arms totally.

1698
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:11,280
difference? Tension. Your arms totally.
 

1699
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,670
difference? Tension. Your arms totally.
So watch watch watch my hand.

1700
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:15,680
So watch watch watch my hand.
 

1701
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:20,950
So watch watch watch my hand.
You see watch the other one.

1702
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:20,960

 

1703
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,630

You can see the tension all going

1704
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:22,640
You can see the tension all going
 

1705
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,270
You can see the tension all going
through here. Okay.

1706
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:25,280
through here. Okay.
 

1707
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,710
through here. Okay.
So yes, I'm internalizing it but it that

1708
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:28,720
So yes, I'm internalizing it but it that
 

1709
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,069
So yes, I'm internalizing it but it that
concentrically is still not reconciling

1710
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:32,079
concentrically is still not reconciling
 

1711
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,549
concentrically is still not reconciling
it. Okay. So remember I said

1712
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:34,559
it. Okay. So remember I said
 

1713
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,109
it. Okay. So remember I said
energetically form does not matter but

1714
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:37,119
energetically form does not matter but
 

1715
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,069
energetically form does not matter but
marginally form does matter. Okay. So,

1716
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:40,079
marginally form does matter. Okay. So,
 

1717
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,870
marginally form does matter. Okay. So,
what I'm gonna do here is as he's coming

1718
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:42,880
what I'm gonna do here is as he's coming
 

1719
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,510
what I'm gonna do here is as he's coming
in to touch, I move it move him

1720
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:45,520
in to touch, I move it move him
 

1721
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,069
in to touch, I move it move him
sideways. So, he's gonna come in

1722
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:50,079
sideways. So, he's gonna come in
 

1723
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,829
sideways. So, he's gonna come in
and I move it sideways.

1724
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:53,839
and I move it sideways.
 

1725
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:57,589
and I move it sideways.
I let him hit the arm, but I move it

1726
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:57,599
I let him hit the arm, but I move it
 

1727
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:04,789
I let him hit the arm, but I move it
just a little bit off that straight 180.

All right, let's go to a lower

1758
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:19,359

 

1759
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:22,390

that's where we're at. Right. Okay. He's

1760
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:22,400
that's where we're at. Right. Okay. He's
 

1761
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,390
that's where we're at. Right. Okay. He's
pushing forward. You see?

00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:26,400
pushing forward. You see?
 

1763
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,990
pushing forward. You see?
So he will gradually increase that

1764
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:30,000
So he will gradually increase that
 

1765
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,750
So he will gradually increase that
pressure till he's full of long and

1766

1773
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,750
doing. If I feel as soon as I feel the
pressure, I start reconciling the

00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:47,760

1775
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,230

1777
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,870

everything down. He's going to do it

1778
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:52,880
everything down. He's going to do it
 

1779

What do we got? And I feel like when I
lean forward and I have more semblance

1976
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:38,160
lean forward and I have more semblance
 

1977
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,829
lean forward and I have more semblance
of control of what happens, but when I

1978
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:41,839
of control of what happens, but when I
 

1979
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,230
of control of what happens, but when I
when I walk through like this, then you

1980
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:44,240
when I walk through like this, then you
 

1981
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,470
when I walk through like this, then you
almost essentially me, not almost

1982
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:46,480
almost essentially me, not almost
 

1983
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,069
almost essentially me, not almost
essentially, you immediately have my

1984
01:06:48,069 --> 01:06:48,079
essentially, you immediately have my
 

1985
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,349
essentially, you immediately have my
center and I can't I'm not choosing

1986
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:51,359
center and I can't I'm not choosing
 

1987
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,589
center and I can't I'm not choosing
anymore. This one I can kind of do

1988
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:53,599
anymore. This one I can kind of do
 

1989
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,910
anymore. This one I can kind of do
whatever I want to do. Yeah. So, let's

1990
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:55,920
whatever I want to do. Yeah. So, let's
 

1991
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,230
whatever I want to do. Yeah. So, let's
go back to how we got here and you'll

1992
01:06:58,230 --> 01:06:58,240
go back to how we got here and you'll
 

1993
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,270
go back to how we got here and you'll
see

1994
01:06:59,270 --> 01:06:59,280
see
 

1995
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,069
see
This this happens. Okay. So, I I'll

1996
01:07:02,069 --> 01:07:02,079
This this happens. Okay. So, I I'll
 

1997
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:04,150
This this happens. Okay. So, I I'll
first explain it, then I'll give you a

1998
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:04,160
first explain it, then I'll give you a
 

1999
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,589
first explain it, then I'll give you a
discovery learning where you can

2000
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:05,599
discovery learning where you can
 

2001
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,349
discovery learning where you can
experience what I'm talking about on

2002
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:07,359
experience what I'm talking about on
 

2003
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:12,069
experience what I'm talking about on
your own. Okay? So, how we got here was

2004
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:12,079
your own. Okay? So, how we got here was
 

2005
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:14,870
your own. Okay? So, how we got here was
I want you to grab yadi and I want you

2006
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:14,880
I want you to grab yadi and I want you
 

2007
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,589
I want you to grab yadi and I want you
to spin displace and I don't want you to

2008
01:07:17,589 --> 01:07:17,599
to spin displace and I don't want you to
 

2009
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:20,870
to spin displace and I don't want you to
yield. You remember that? And all of us

2010
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:20,880
yield. You remember that? And all of us
 

2011
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,750
yield. You remember that? And all of us
look like this. Do the technique. Do the

The drill.
 

2065
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:04,309
The drill.
You heard it. Hold his breath. Okay.

You heard it. Hold his breath. Okay.
 

2067
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,510
You heard it. Hold his breath. Okay.
What would you guess? Why? Why the

What would you guess? Why? Why the

difference?
 

2071
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,149
difference?
It's unexpected.

2072
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:12,159
It's unexpected.
 

2073
01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:15,110
It's unexpected.
And you can't get just you can't get why

2074
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:15,120
And you can't get just you can't get why
 

2075
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,510
And you can't get just you can't get why
is it unexpected? You losing control.

2076
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:17,520
is it unexpected? You losing control.
 

2077
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,870
is it unexpected? You losing control.
You lost control. Who's in control?

2078
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:20,880
You lost control. Who's in control?
 

2079
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,470
You lost control. Who's in control?
The Naga is in control. Got it. So when

2080
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:24,480
The Naga is in control. Got it. So when
 

2081
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:28,149
The Naga is in control. Got it. So when
we pick a reaction of as uk that now

2082
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:28,159
we pick a reaction of as uk that now
 

2083
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:29,910
we pick a reaction of as uk that now
makes no sense for the technique we're

2084
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:29,920
makes no sense for the technique we're
 

2085
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,229
makes no sense for the technique we're
working on. We're trying to get control

2086
01:09:32,229 --> 01:09:32,239
working on. We're trying to get control
 

2087
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:37,430
working on. We're trying to get control
back. And that's my rule. Neither assist

2088
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:37,440
back. And that's my rule. Neither assist
 

2089
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,590

nor resist.

Do the prescribed energy print and don't

2092
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:42,640
Do the prescribed energy print and don't
 

2093
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,149
Do the prescribed energy print and don't
die at the end. That's it. Okay, does

2094
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:46,159
die at the end. That's it. Okay, does
 

2095
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:49,590
die at the end. That's it. Okay, does
that make sense? If we were doing gi

2096
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:49,600
that make sense? If we were doing gi
 

2097
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,470
that make sense? If we were doing gi
and the guy felt that and he's trying to

2098
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:52,480
and the guy felt that and he's trying to
 

2099
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,270
and the guy felt that and he's trying to
lower, then would have the ability to go

2100
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,280
lower, then would have the ability to go
 

2101
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,350
lower, then would have the ability to go
there, I would don't want to train you

2102
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:57,360
there, I would don't want to train you
 

2103
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,430
there, I would don't want to train you
to try to bring something up that's

2104
01:09:59,430 --> 01:09:59,440
to try to bring something up that's
 

2105
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,750
to try to bring something up that's
going down. That would be contestation.

2106
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:01,760
going down. That would be contestation.
 

2107
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:06,070
going down. That would be contestation.
Okay, this was the guys coming in. Okay,

2108
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:06,080
Okay, this was the guys coming in. Okay,
 

2109
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:09,110
Okay, this was the guys coming in. Okay,
so that's what has to do. what you can

2110
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:09,120
so that's what has to do. what you can
 

2111
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,070
so that's what has to do. what you can
do because I it is terrifying.

2112
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:12,080
do because I it is terrifying.
 

2113
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,669
do because I it is terrifying.
Okay?

2114
01:10:13,669 --> 01:10:13,679
Okay?
 

2115
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:16,149
Okay?
And that's not the throw. That's just

2116
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:16,159
And that's not the throw. That's just
 

2117
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:18,550
And that's not the throw. That's just
the balance breaking. Do you understand

2118
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
the balance breaking. Do you understand
 

2119
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,350
the balance breaking. Do you understand
the throw you've seen the throw? This

2120
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:21,360
the throw you've seen the throw? This
 

2121
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,830
the throw you've seen the throw? This
base here, I won't do the top part, but

2122
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:23,840
base here, I won't do the top part, but
 

2123
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,070
base here, I won't do the top part, but
this base is going that way. His hand is

2124
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:28,080
this base is going that way. His hand is
 

2125
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,470
this base is going that way. His hand is
going that way and his center is being

2126
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:30,480
going that way and his center is being
 

2127
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,830
going that way and his center is being
projected back on the 12 line. You seen

2128
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:33,840
projected back on the 12 line. You seen
 

2129
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,270
projected back on the 12 line. You seen
that? That's hairy as We're not

2130
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:35,280
that? That's hairy as We're not
 

2131
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,070
that? That's hairy as We're not

So, let's look at the hook.

2164
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:02,480
So, let's look at the hook.
 

2165
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,750
So, let's look at the hook.
Okay,

2166
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:05,760

 

2167
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,830

there's the hook. You see the hook?

2168
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:07,840
there's the hook. You see the hook?
 

2169
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,830
there's the hook. You see the hook?
Okay, here you have your long arm, but

2170
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:09,840
Okay, here you have your long arm, but
 

2171
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,669
Okay, here you have your long arm, but
you do your long arm straight ahead. You

2172
01:12:11,669 --> 01:12:11,679
you do your long arm straight ahead. You
 

2173
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,630
you do your long arm straight ahead. You
see that? It's hooking him.

2174
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:14,640
see that? It's hooking him.
 

2175
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,790
see that? It's hooking him.
So, when he starts to push and I hook,

2176
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:18,800
So, when he starts to push and I hook,
 

2177
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,830
So, when he starts to push and I hook,
watch where his center goes. Plot his

2178
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:21,840
watch where his center goes. Plot his
 

2179
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,510
watch where his center goes. Plot his
center in a vertical plane. You

2180
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:23,520
center in a vertical plane. You
 

2181
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,590
center in a vertical plane. You
understand?

2182
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:25,600
understand?
 

2183
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,870
understand?
There's the hook. He starts to go.

2184
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:28,880
There's the hook. He starts to go.
 

2185
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:34,310
There's the hook. He starts to go.
He came this way.

2186
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:34,320

 

2187
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,709

Go.

2188
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719
Go.
 

2189
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,030
Go.
All right. Where did he go? It went

2190
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:39,040
All right. Where did he go? It went
 

2191
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,669
All right. Where did he go? It went
forward. You see that? Do you guys see

2192
01:12:41,669 --> 01:12:41,679
forward. You see that? Do you guys see
 

2193
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,950
forward. You see that? Do you guys see
that? Okay. So, that means his center of

2194
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:44,960
that? Okay. So, that means his center of
 

2195
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:49,350
that? Okay. So, that means his center of
gravity is being deconstructed from his

2196
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:49,360
gravity is being deconstructed from his
 

2197
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,790
gravity is being deconstructed from his
head. On the other one,

2198
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:52,800
head. On the other one,
 

2199
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,470
head. On the other one,
I'm pulling his center of gravity this

2200
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:54,480
I'm pulling his center of gravity this
 

2201
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,910
I'm pulling his center of gravity this
way. On this one, I'm letting it go

2202
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:57,920
way. On this one, I'm letting it go
 

2203
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,910
way. On this one, I'm letting it go
forward.

2204
01:12:59,910 --> 01:12:59,920
forward.
 

2205
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,470
forward.
That way, he's going forward, but he's

2206
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:02,480
That way, he's going forward, but he's
 

2207
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,550
That way, he's going forward, but he's
falling backwards. Do you understand

2208
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:04,560
falling backwards. Do you understand
 

2209
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,030
falling backwards. Do you understand
that? And so, I don't ever feel his

2210
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:07,040
that? And so, I don't ever feel his
 

2211
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,990
that? And so, I don't ever feel his
weight. It's no different than kotesh

2212
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:10,000
weight. It's no different than kotesh
 

2213
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,310
weight. It's no different than kotesh
goes forward and then back. I'm just

2214
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:12,320
goes forward and then back. I'm just
 

2215
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,550
goes forward and then back. I'm just
doing it on his head. Okay? You do

2216
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:14,560
doing it on his head. Okay? You do
 

2217
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,030
doing it on his head. Okay? You do
kayesh like this and everyone comes this

2218
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:17,040
kayesh like this and everyone comes this
 

2219
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:21,510
kayesh like this and everyone comes this
way. Okay? So, don't hook.

2220
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:21,520
way. Okay? So, don't hook.
 

2221
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,149

Now ask the question then how do I make

2222
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:24,159
Now ask the question then how do I make
 

2223
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:26,870
Now ask the question then how do I make
him move that way? What do you think it

2224
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:26,880
him move that way? What do you think it
 

2225
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,470
him move that way? What do you think it
is?

is?
 

2227
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,390
is?
Okay. And what's generating the adhesion

2228
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:30,400
Okay. And what's generating the adhesion
 

2229
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,709
Okay. And what's generating the adhesion
here? His initial inertia. His initial

2230
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:32,719
here? His initial inertia. His initial
 

2231
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,430
here? His initial inertia. His initial
inertia. He's he's he's pressing on

01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:35,440
inertia. He's he's he's pressing on
 

2233
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,030
inertia. He's he's he's pressing on
that. I use that to move him. You see

2234
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:39,040
that. I use that to move him. You see
 

2235
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:57,750

01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:45,120
you hear me say I equalize his yong
 

2257
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,550
you hear me say I equalize his yong
aspect. Okay? So, for example,

go over value, I'm now contesting. But
 

2265
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:01,189
go over value, I'm now contesting. But
if I latch him, he gets stuck to me. Can

2266
01:15:01,189 --> 01:15:01,199
if I latch him, he gets stuck to me. Can
 

2267
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:04,149
if I latch him, he gets stuck to me. Can
you see that? Now, can you feel feel

01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:06,790
you see that? Now, can you feel feel
your skin go like that? Okay. So, wait

2270
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:06,800
your skin go like that? Okay. So, wait

trapped. He can't go anywhere. And this

2276
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:16,320
trapped. He can't go anywhere. And this
 

2277
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,550
trapped. He can't go anywhere. And this
is what I meant this morning when I say

01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:18,560
is what I meant this morning when I say
 

2279
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,229
is what I meant this morning when I say
Iikido Kihon is using the inertia, the

So now it's not that I'm trying to

2288
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:32,880
So now it's not that I'm trying to
 

2289
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,950
So now it's not that I'm trying to
leverage his head, his whole body. I

2290
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:36,960
leverage his head, his whole body. I
 

2291
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,510
leverage his head, his whole body. I
make the lever with the inertia going

We're not fighting. I'm doing energy
 

2505
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,629
We're not fighting. I'm doing energy
drills.

01:23:38,629 --> 01:23:38,639

 

2529
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:46,470

Yeah. Don't put use the energy, not his
anatomy. Use the energy. You understand

2534
01:23:52,709 --> 01:23:52,719
anatomy. Use the energy. You understand
 

2535
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:56,629
anatomy. Use the energy. You understand
the difference? Okay. Uh, another thing,

2536
01:23:56,629 --> 01:23:56,639
the difference? Okay. Uh, another thing,
 

2537
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,790
the difference? Okay. Uh, another thing,
uh, we did this. You guys mentioned

2538
01:23:58,790 --> 01:23:58,800
uh, we did this. You guys mentioned
 

2539
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,510
uh, we did this. You guys mentioned
stable base, right?

2540
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:01,520
stable base, right?
 

2541
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,510
stable base, right?
He's pushing and we mentioned stable

2542
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:03,520
He's pushing and we mentioned stable
 

2543
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,950
He's pushing and we mentioned stable
base. Push, push, push, push. We

2544
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:04,960
base. Push, push, push, push. We
 

2545
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:10,149
base. Push, push, push, push. We
mentioned stable base. We come up,

2546
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:10,159

 

2547
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:13,110

right? Stable base. You see that? That

2548
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,120
right? Stable base. You see that? That
 

2549
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:18,229
right? Stable base. You see that? That
energy goes down.

2550

2551
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:25,750

2559
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:38,629

Okay, try to reduce the steps because

2564
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:44,320
Okay, try to reduce the steps because
 

2565
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,709
Okay, try to reduce the steps because
the more steps we need, the further we

2566
01:24:46,709 --> 01:24:46,719
the more steps we need, the further we
 

2567
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:48,629
the more steps we need, the further we
are from the technique. Techniques two

2568
01:24:48,629 --> 01:24:48,639
are from the technique. Techniques two
 

2569
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:51,910
are from the technique. Techniques two
steps. So

2570
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:51,920
steps. So
 

2571
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,510
steps. So
here

2572
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:53,520

Don't do the second move. I'm telling

Don't do the second move. I'm telling
 

2641
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,149
Don't do the second move. I'm telling
you right now, don't do the second move

you right now, don't do the second move
 

2643
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,149
you right now, don't do the second move
because that is not how we throw from

that second move, it's jacking up your

2651
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,030

forward and I go like that and I crunch

01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:01,440
forward and I go like that and I crunch
 

2777
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:05,750
forward and I go like that and I crunch
