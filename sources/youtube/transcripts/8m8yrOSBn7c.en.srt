we talk about it's a yin energy just
 

45
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,860
we talk about it's a yin energy just
like victimhood mentality is a yin

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:44,440
so it's wrong and I made the comment
 

57
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,160
so it's wrong and I made the comment
that you have any chemical ER so these

69
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,520
so if hookah does a different energy
than whatever not it is doing should

they stay with the as if prescribed not
yet Pavin it is actually wrong you get

74
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:18,550
yet Pavin it is actually wrong you get
 

75
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,450
yet Pavin it is actually wrong you get
that and then when you get two parts

76
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:21,460
that and then when you get two parts
 

77
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,950
that and then when you get two parts
from that as if prescribed pattern Luke

78
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:25,960
from that as if prescribed pattern Luke
 

79
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,440
from that as if prescribed pattern Luke
is not actually learning what is learned

80
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:28,450
is not actually learning what is learned
 

81
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,850
is not actually learning what is learned
through the yin side of the technique

82
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:31,860
through the yin side of the technique
 

83
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,490
through the yin side of the technique
okay so when we watch your knock it was

84
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:35,500
okay so when we watch your knock it was
 

85
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,350
okay so when we watch your knock it was
up it is very mushy because your can be

86
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
up it is very mushy because your can be
 

87
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,910
up it is very mushy because your can be
so for example when if we're here we

88
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:46,920
so for example when if we're here we
 

89
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,069
so for example when if we're here we
have the drill yesterday of the pressure

90
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:49,079
have the drill yesterday of the pressure
 

91
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:53,240
have the drill yesterday of the pressure
and his job was to not shut off the

92
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,250
and his job was to not shut off the
 

93
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,000
and his job was to not shut off the
pressure and to be tastin being moved

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,010
pressure and to be tastin being moved
 

95
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,710
pressure and to be tastin being moved
through the pressure okay so a way of

96
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
through the pressure okay so a way of
 

97
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,439
through the pressure okay so a way of
cooking records a way of bukit shutting

98
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:03,449
cooking records a way of bukit shutting
 

99
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:11,240
cooking records a way of bukit shutting
it off is to absorb it in the elbow you

100
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,250
it off is to absorb it in the elbow you
 

101
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,240
it off is to absorb it in the elbow you
see so here i we generated pressure and

102
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,250
see so here i we generated pressure and
 

103
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:20,540
see so here i we generated pressure and
I feel it and I take it here I shut it

104
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:20,550
I feel it and I take it here I shut it
 

105
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:27,199
I feel it and I take it here I shut it
off see so if you would feel that shut

106
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:27,209
off see so if you would feel that shut
 

107
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:31,340
off see so if you would feel that shut
off right then this technique now makes

108
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,350
off right then this technique now makes
 

109
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,400
off right then this technique now makes
no sense okay so you do a shutoff and

110
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,410
no sense okay so you do a shutoff and
 

111
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,530
no sense okay so you do a shutoff and
you would just keep coming in into

112
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:42,540
you would just keep coming in into
 

113
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,520
you would just keep coming in into
something else okay

114
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:48,530

 

115
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:53,930

so she has it on boom and now here I

116
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:53,940
so she has it on boom and now here I
 

117
00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:00,130
so she has it on boom and now here I
have a turning pattern

118
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:00,140

 

119
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,190

well if you reverse engineering that

120
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,200
well if you reverse engineering that
 

121
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,920
well if you reverse engineering that
means she has a pushing pattern if she

122
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:11,930
means she has a pushing pattern if she
 

123
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:18,290
means she has a pushing pattern if she
shuts it off leaves it off then 9 now

124
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:18,300
shuts it off leaves it off then 9 now
 

125
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:24,560
shuts it off leaves it off then 9 now
I'm doing this and that's hot right so

126
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:24,570
I'm doing this and that's hot right so
 

127
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:30,380
I'm doing this and that's hot right so
she leaves it on leaves it on leaps it

128
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:30,390
she leaves it on leaves it on leaps it
 

129
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:38,630
she leaves it on leaves it on leaps it
off okay she left it on she leaves it

130
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
off okay she left it on she leaves it
 

131
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,610
off okay she left it on she leaves it
off right and then the same thing I

132
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:42,620
off right and then the same thing I
 

133
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:49,540
off right and then the same thing I
should go do something else

134
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:49,550

 

135
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,460

he has it on she needs it all right

136
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:54,470
he has it on she needs it all right
 

137
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:03,730
he has it on she needs it all right
actually go do something else

138
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:03,740

 

139
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:12,560

so you have a job okay it goes on the

140
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,570
so you have a job okay it goes on the
 

141
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:22,639
so you have a job okay it goes on the
hip then you went up you see the

142
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:22,649
hip then you went up you see the
 

143
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,490
hip then you went up you see the
beginner who can't will shut it off

144
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:24,500
beginner who can't will shut it off
 

145
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,540
beginner who can't will shut it off
because of fear so look how slow we're

146
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:29,550
because of fear so look how slow we're
 

147
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:38,080
because of fear so look how slow we're
going on yep yes yes

vertical plane you get up you're going

312
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:58,980
vertical plane you get up you're going
 

313
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,640
vertical plane you get up you're going
backwards and you wouldn't be able to

314
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:00,650
backwards and you wouldn't be able to
 

315
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:09,040
backwards and you wouldn't be able to
get up good you keep wanting to go back

316
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,050

 

317
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,810

you see where you have to get up forward

318
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:11,820
you see where you have to get up forward
 

319
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,460
you see where you have to get up forward
okay so she gets up forward good and

320
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:16,470
okay so she gets up forward good and
 

321
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,220
okay so she gets up forward good and
then she would address right do you

322
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,230
then she would address right do you
 

323

understand
 

325
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,720
understand
so as she starts to address I do you see

326
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:23,730
so as she starts to address I do you see
 

327
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,540
so as she starts to address I do you see
actually hits me hey okay if I do one

328
