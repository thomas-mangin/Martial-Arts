60
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:13,080

 

61
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,710

is

62
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
is
 

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,070
is
here here is okay steps forward here and

64
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,080
here here is okay steps forward here and
 

65
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,910
here here is okay steps forward here and
here but this Fleck becomes too big it

66
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
here but this Fleck becomes too big it
 

67
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,750
here but this Fleck becomes too big it
becomes like almost like it becomes here

68
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
becomes like almost like it becomes here
 

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,470
becomes like almost like it becomes here
and now it's gone away from him so it

70
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
and now it's gone away from him so it
 

71
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,630
and now it's gone away from him so it
really needs to be more like

72
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:31,640
really needs to be more like
 

73
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:47,149
really needs to be more like
a change

74
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:47,159

 

75
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,110

over this goes like this and it's going

76
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,120
over this goes like this and it's going
 

77
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,270
over this goes like this and it's going
away from him where it should be like

78
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
away from him where it should be like
 

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,470
away from him where it should be like

over again from the

84
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,000
over again from the
 

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,910
over again from the
head to the wrist it should be

86
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
head to the wrist it should be
 

87
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,550
head to the wrist it should be
like

88
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
like
 

89
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,110
like
rolling

90
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
rolling
 

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,949
rolling
over if you watch my center and and the

92
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
over if you watch my center and and the
 

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,710
over if you watch my center and and the
Ken together it's as if my hands are

94
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
Ken together it's as if my hands are
 

95
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,110
Ken together it's as if my hands are
being

96
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,120
being
 

97
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,710
being
rolled by my by my sent at this point

98
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:25,720
rolled by my by my sent at this point
 

99
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,309
rolled by my by my sent at this point
so so we're here here as I lift off my

100
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:31,319
so so we're here here as I lift off my
 

101
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,390
so so we're here here as I lift off my
sensor

102
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,400
sensor
 

103
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:41,110
sensor
look my

104
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120

 

105
00:03:41,120 --> 00:04:05,350

sens so then we have the whole mubi

106
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360

 

107
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,550

so that was a roll rather than a a

108
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:09,560
so that was a roll rather than a a
 

109
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,400
so that was a roll rather than a a
lift okay come on
