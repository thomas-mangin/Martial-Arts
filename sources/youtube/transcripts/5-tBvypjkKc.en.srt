they don't coexist
in the forms right so like for example

in the forms right so like for example
 

165
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,990
in the forms right so like for example
when you're doing a form you'll see a

situations they're not applications it's
 

173
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,310
situations they're not applications it's
better to think of the forms as like a

better to think of the forms as like a
myth in uh the Scholastic study of

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:43,560
myth in uh the Scholastic study of
 

177
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,350
myth in uh the Scholastic study of
Religion that kind of myth all right

178
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
Religion that kind of myth all right
 

179
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,510
Religion that kind of myth all right
they're they're kind of just markers so

180
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
they're they're kind of just markers so
 

181
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,909
they're they're kind of just markers so
if you if you read verses of the Bible

182

if you if you read verses of the Bible
 

183
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,189
if you if you read verses of the Bible
it doesn't make sense to read it

184
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:52,199
it doesn't make sense to read it
 

185
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,350
it doesn't make sense to read it
literally uh they're just kind of

literally uh they're just kind of
 

187
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,090
literally uh they're just kind of
sticking in things so if you go like I'm

188
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,100
sticking in things so if you go like I'm
 

189

going to read it literally and you try
 

191
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,850
going to read it literally and you try
to find like a timeline it's it's not

to find like a timeline it's it's not
 

193
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,070
to find like a timeline it's it's not
going to work it doesn't work things get

194
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
going to work it doesn't work things get
 

195
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,770
going to work it doesn't work things get
stuck in they're like Place markers for

196
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:06,780
stuck in they're like Place markers for
 

197
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,370
stuck in they're like Place markers for
ideas so that strike in ikyo is a place

it doesn't mean that's what you do so

212
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:29,820
it doesn't mean that's what you do so
 

213
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,490
it doesn't mean that's what you do so
what you want to understand at a

214
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:31,500
what you want to understand at a
 

215
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,590
what you want to understand at a
practical level anything where I would

216
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
practical level anything where I would
 

217
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,930
practical level anything where I would
be able to companies coming in anything

218
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:35,940
be able to companies coming in anything
 

219
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,930
be able to companies coming in anything
that I would be able to throw I would

220
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:38,940
that I would be able to throw I would
 

221
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,730
that I would be able to throw I would
not be able to strike so the idea that

222
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:43,740
not be able to strike so the idea that
 

223
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,090
not be able to strike so the idea that
um he's he comes in and I go to throw

224
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,100
um he's he comes in and I go to throw
 

225
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,950
um he's he comes in and I go to throw
and he resists and you're gonna do it to

226
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
and he resists and you're gonna do it to
 

227
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,950
and he resists and you're gonna do it to
me and then the throne no you're not

228
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:51,960
me and then the throne no you're not
 

229
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,390
me and then the throne no you're not
no you're not do you guys understand

230
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:53,400
no you're not do you guys understand
 

231
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,370
no you're not do you guys understand
that okay

232
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:55,380
that okay
 

233
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,590
that okay
so uh

234
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
so uh
 

235
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,529
so uh
you can't do it under pressure

236
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:00,539
you can't do it under pressure
 

237
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,689
you can't do it under pressure
there's several ways that you're not

238
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:02,699
there's several ways that you're not
 

239
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,189
there's several ways that you're not
under pressure

240
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:04,199
under pressure
 

241
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,830
under pressure
you can uh get yourself to a sweet spot

242
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:08,840
you can uh get yourself to a sweet spot
 

243
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,390
you can uh get yourself to a sweet spot
uh so let's say he's doing that same

244
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:11,400
uh so let's say he's doing that same
 

245
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,510
uh so let's say he's doing that same
thing but he felt

246
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:14,520
thing but he felt
 

247
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,350
thing but he felt
um

248
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
um
 

249
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,230
um
he he was like half-assed kind of

250
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
he he was like half-assed kind of
 

251
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,409
he he was like half-assed kind of
half-assed you get it so he comes in I

252
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:21,419
half-assed you get it so he comes in I
 

253
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,010
half-assed you get it so he comes in I
move boom and then I can get that

254
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,020
move boom and then I can get that
 

255
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,890
move boom and then I can get that
um or he never meant his finally display

256
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:27,900
um or he never meant his finally display
 

257
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,469
um or he never meant his finally display
so that was a half-assed final he's kind

258
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
so that was a half-assed final he's kind
 

259
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,170
so that was a half-assed final he's kind
of cautiously coming in boom you can get

260
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:33,180
of cautiously coming in boom you can get
 

261
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,050
of cautiously coming in boom you can get
yourself to take pressure off with your

262
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,060
yourself to take pressure off with your
 

263
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,870
yourself to take pressure off with your
foot footwork where there's no more

264
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
foot footwork where there's no more
 

265
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,670
foot footwork where there's no more
pressure that would smother your strike

266
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:40,680
pressure that would smother your strike
 

267
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,909
pressure that would smother your strike
okay so that's me taking pressure off he

268
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
okay so that's me taking pressure off he
 

269
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,790
okay so that's me taking pressure off he
could take pressure off too uh so let's

270
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
could take pressure off too uh so let's
 

271
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,909
could take pressure off too uh so let's
say he he comes in half-assed now he

272
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
say he he comes in half-assed now he
 

273
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,850
say he he comes in half-assed now he
starts to go back right and boom now now

274
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:52,860
starts to go back right and boom now now
 

275
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,430
starts to go back right and boom now now
your strikes will work again you get

276
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
your strikes will work again you get
 

277
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,670
your strikes will work again you get
that what you have to do is not do them

278
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:58,680
that what you have to do is not do them
 

279
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,490
that what you have to do is not do them
under a spinal displacement pressure

280
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:01,500
under a spinal displacement pressure
 

281
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,390
under a spinal displacement pressure
otherwise they will be smothered okay uh

282
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,400
otherwise they will be smothered okay uh
 

283
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,850
otherwise they will be smothered okay uh
it could be that he just came in with

284
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:07,860
it could be that he just came in with
 

285
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,730
it could be that he just came in with
one step like a strike on one step

286
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:10,740
one step like a strike on one step
 

287
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,150
one step like a strike on one step
strike on one step so he goes boom

288
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
strike on one step so he goes boom
 

289
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,710
strike on one step so he goes boom
that's all he's trying to do do you see

290
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:15,720
that's all he's trying to do do you see
 

291
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,650
that's all he's trying to do do you see
that and he stopped himself on that

292
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:18,660
that and he stopped himself on that
 

293
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,890
that and he stopped himself on that
strike so he's doing that again and I

294
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:21,900
strike so he's doing that again and I
 

295
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,570
strike so he's doing that again and I
come in and I'll hit my strike he

296
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:23,580
come in and I'll hit my strike he
 

297
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,969
come in and I'll hit my strike he
stopped my striking get smothered and I

298
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:25,979
stopped my striking get smothered and I
 

299
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,830
stopped my striking get smothered and I
didn't get over with it you guys

300
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
didn't get over with it you guys
 

301
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,070
didn't get over with it you guys
understand that all right so

302
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,080
understand that all right so
 

303
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,650
understand that all right so
um let's deal with that pressure first

304
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:33,660
um let's deal with that pressure first
 

305
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,650
um let's deal with that pressure first
or that lack of pressure he's stopping

306
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:36,660
or that lack of pressure he's stopping
 

307
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,930
or that lack of pressure he's stopping
himself he didn't do spinal displacement

308
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:38,940
himself he didn't do spinal displacement
 

309
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,670
himself he didn't do spinal displacement
okay

310
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:40,680
okay
 

311
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,529
okay
um and we'll do that one

312
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:42,539
um and we'll do that one
 

313
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,010
um and we'll do that one
so he he had that jab I'm gonna move to

314
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,020
so he he had that jab I'm gonna move to
 

315
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,469
so he he had that jab I'm gonna move to
the inside and pull on the hip right

316
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
the inside and pull on the hip right
 

317
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,490
the inside and pull on the hip right
here on the on the rib so my inward hand

318
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:52,500
here on the on the rib so my inward hand
 

319

here on the on the rib so my inward hand
sword is part Perry comes around and is

320
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,220
sword is part Perry comes around and is
 

321
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,010
sword is part Perry comes around and is
gonna track that shot in okay so we'll

322
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:01,020
gonna track that shot in okay so we'll
 

323
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,290
gonna track that shot in okay so we'll
do it again again if I don't move at all

324
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:03,300
do it again again if I don't move at all
 

325

could see uh what's happening is I am
going to hit him uh before that thing

386
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,060
going to hit him uh before that thing
 

387
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,030
going to hit him uh before that thing
reaches full extension I've already

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,730
reaches full extension I've already
started my strike because he's going to

390
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:31,740
started my strike because he's going to
 

391
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,710
started my strike because he's going to
pull that jab back that's what a jab

see that so instead of going here and

396
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
see that so instead of going here and
 

397
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,490
see that so instead of going here and
I'm here and then he just sticks his

398
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:40,500
I'm here and then he just sticks his
 

399
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,230
I'm here and then he just sticks his
hand out but I'm like no one else will

400
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
hand out but I'm like no one else will
 

401
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,210
hand out but I'm like no one else will
do in reality

402
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:44,220
do in reality
 

403
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,269
do in reality
you gotta hit him

404
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
you gotta hit him
 

405
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,610
you gotta hit him
and strike is still going out that way

406
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:49,620
and strike is still going out that way
 

407
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,990
and strike is still going out that way
you see that

408
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,000
you see that
 

409
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,829
you see that
so stop training like this

410
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:54,839
so stop training like this
 

411
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,410
so stop training like this
it's in what you were hitting him as

412
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:57,420
it's in what you were hitting him as
 

413
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,930
it's in what you were hitting him as
he's coming back and that way the little

he's coming back and that way the little
 

415
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,230
he's coming back and that way the little
residual inertia that he had thinking he

416
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:03,240
residual inertia that he had thinking he
 

417
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,389
residual inertia that he had thinking he
was going to hit the target is going to

add to your opposing forces at the ribs
 

421
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,190
add to your opposing forces at the ribs
and to your Coq projection

422
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:12,200
and to your Coq projection
 

423
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,070
and to your Coq projection
okay that's what you're trying to do

424
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,080
okay that's what you're trying to do
 

425
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,710
okay that's what you're trying to do
boom you're gonna go slow and time it

426
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:21,720
boom you're gonna go slow and time it
 

427
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,170
boom you're gonna go slow and time it
boom

428
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:24,180
boom
 

429
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,850
boom
boom

430
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:25,860
boom

boom
 

433
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,730
boom
boom okay let's try it but you can't

434
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:31,740
boom okay let's try it but you can't
 

435
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,290
boom okay let's try it but you can't
have the hand sticking out there and

436
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,300
have the hand sticking out there and
 

437
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,509
have the hand sticking out there and
then you go go

438
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
then you go go
 

439
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,970
then you go go
so there's something now called

440
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:37,980
so there's something now called
 

441
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,370
so there's something now called
anatomical positioning but it assumes

442
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:40,380
anatomical positioning but it assumes
 

443
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,070
anatomical positioning but it assumes
that you have the actual power on your

444
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,080
that you have the actual power on your
 

445
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,530
that you have the actual power on your
strikes okay so when he's coming in

446
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:45,540
strikes okay so when he's coming in
 

447
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,269
strikes okay so when he's coming in
right boom I can move move him here that

451
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,569

I'm either I could throw it to displace

452
00:10:59,569 --> 00:10:59,579
I'm either I could throw it to displace
 

453
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:02,150

him do you see as I did there but you

454
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
him do you see as I did there but you
 

455
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,329
him do you see as I did there but you
can uh aim the power so that most of it

456
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:05,339
can uh aim the power so that most of it
 

457
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,889
can uh aim the power so that most of it
hits inside and you're trying to break

458
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:06,899
hits inside and you're trying to break
 

459
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,550
hits inside and you're trying to break
the ribs okay

460
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560

 

461
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,069

00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:27,899
forward as I contoured under this arm
 

473
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,650
forward as I contoured under this arm
I'll Palm to her under over over the arm

hamstring
so and I get here and now when I when I

480
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:38,700
so and I get here and now when I when I
 

481

do those two things that are my gets
 

483
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,250
do those two things that are my gets
stuck out there and now I'll get my

stuck out there and now I'll get my
 

485
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,780
stuck out there and now I'll get my
angle cancellation this way okay boom

486
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:46,790
angle cancellation this way okay boom
 

487
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,509
angle cancellation this way okay boom

okay your adhesion point just change but
 

513
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,769
okay your adhesion point just change but
you can do this though

514

other
Arm Control uh we're gonna use it to

532
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
Arm Control uh we're gonna use it to
 

533
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,269
Arm Control uh we're gonna use it to
continue the angle cancellation for more

534
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:26,279
continue the angle cancellation for more
 

535
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,110
continue the angle cancellation for more
stripes okay so we'll go back slow

536
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,120
stripes okay so we'll go back slow
 

537

541
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,430
over don't roll it over that's how you
get into cutting atomic

542
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:40,440
get into cutting atomic
 

543
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,550
get into cutting atomic
lock it in you have a friction Point

544
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:43,560
lock it in you have a friction Point
 

545
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,910
lock it in you have a friction Point
here your Ike's there and you have your

546
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:46,920
here your Ike's there and you have your
 

547
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,850
here your Ike's there and you have your
ikey here you keep those pressures so

548
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:49,860
ikey here you keep those pressures so
 

549
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,030
ikey here you keep those pressures so
that we can now just use this to slam my

550
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
that we can now just use this to slam my
 

551
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,290
that we can now just use this to slam my
him into my knee
