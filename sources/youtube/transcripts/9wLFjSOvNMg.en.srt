1
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,440
Good evening!

2
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,030
Good evening!

3
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,550

00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,500
Hachioji

5
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,160
Are you all from Hachioji?

6
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,320
She is from Setagaya

7
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,200
What time did you start queueing?

8
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,520
On the 19th (Wednesday), around 8 p.m.

9
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,800
Do you already have an iPhone?

10
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,880
Yes

11
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,800
Which iPhone?

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,130
I have an iPhone 4

13
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,580
Where are you from?

14
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,580
I am from Shibuya

15
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,490
Shibuya?? Me too!

16
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,260
Really?

17
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,110
Yes, from Udagawa-cho

18
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,320
Oh, Udagawa-cho? I am from Dogenzaka

19
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Oh really!

20
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,110
If we can, we will try to sleep but it is probably going to be difficult here

21
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,920
Yes indeed... a bit difficult...

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,050
2 years ago we did the same thing

23
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:04,100
You came here in Ginza 2 years ago for the iPhone 4?

24
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,740
That time we were in Omotesando

25
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,130
What time did you get here?

26
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:19,220
We started queuing at about the same time as today, around 8 p.m., straight after work

27
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,080
Is it the second time that you queue for an Apple product isn't it?

28
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,400
Yes, we did for the latest iPad

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,030
iPad2?

30
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,390
No, iPad New, the latest one

31
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,670
What was your position in the queue?

32
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:51,830
Almost like today, over there, about 50th

33
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,270
Around what time did you get here?

34
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,610
I came last night around 8 p.m. 

35
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,230
Have you ever queued like that for other products than Apple's?

36
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,710
Yes I did

37
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,590
For what occasion?

38
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,730
For live concerts, and also at Akihabara

39
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,250
You always do this then?

40
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,960
Yes

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,360
It is going to be a long night, what are you going to do?

42
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,670
I will enjoy the event with everybody, and with accessory here

43
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,680
Will you try to sleep?

44
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,710
Yes, I will try to get some sleep too

45
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:45,830
Where are you from?

46
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,750
I am from Ootaku

47
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,120
What time did you arrive here?

48
00:03:52,120 --> 00:04:02,750
Yesterday, around 10 p.m.

49
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,610
Do you have an iPhone already?

50
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,680
Let me show you...

51
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,780
This is all my stuff

52
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,310
This is all yours really? One person?

53
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,300
Yes, everything

54
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,780
Do you have the last series of iPhone 4S?

55
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,690
No, but I have the latest iPad New

56
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:46,350
And this too, MacBook Air, iPhone, iPod...

57
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,710
How many time did you queue like this?

58
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,420
This is the third time

59
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,600
Each time in Ginza?

60
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,470
Yes

61
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,590
What is your position usually?

62
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:19,550
Before I was far back, about 150th, but this time I am about 18th or 19th

63
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,450
Look, this is a case for the iPhone 5

64
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:35,820
A case fr iPhone 5? Already?

65
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,210
I bought it to protect my new iPhone, as soon as possible, in case of emergency

66
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,160
i don't want to damage it, just in case

67
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,590
You see, it is different, it does not fit well, the size is different

68
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,390
It is very different

69
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,580
The buttons too don't fit

70
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,590
...

71
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,000
Interesting isn't it?

72
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,580
What will you do tonight?

73
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,430
Today, I think I won't sleep

74
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,170
I am not sure

75
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,340
Talk to other people right?

76
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,260
I want to make friends with the others

77
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:48,910
These people are new faces for me but I feel a friendly atmosphere, like if I had known them from before

78
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,290
"10 hours left!"

79
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,680
The iPhone 5 no longer supports Google Map...

80
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,280
Oh... yes...

81
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,060
Then what are you going to do?

82
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:13,050
I guess that Google will make an application for the iPhone 5

83
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,140
Apple Map is not so good right now, it is a shame so i hope that Google does this

84
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:31,230
What do you think of Apple Map? Will it top Google Map?

85
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:45,300
Yes definitely, it has too many problems right now,

86
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,700
So you have hope?

87
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:59,640
Sure, even though it has so many bad point now,

88
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,770
at the beginning, the iPhone too had it's bad points but it developed,

89
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:16,230
so I know that the maps will eventually reach a better quality

90
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,160
Will Apple Map be better than Google Map?

91
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:31,690
I think that competition will make both systems better, as they will be trying to top each other

92
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,640
My sponsor is Wendy's Burgers so it is better if u guys show it on film

93
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,800
Really?

94
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,740
Where do you come from today?

95
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,620
from Roppongi

96
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,080
When did you arrive here?

97
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:55,880
I arrived on Sunday, around 11 p.m.

98
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,410
When I arrived, that guy was 2nd so I thought it's ok, I'll go for dinner,

99
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,060
but when I came back another guy appeared so I lost my place

100
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,940
These people are your friends?

101
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,610
These I don't know, but that guy here is my friend

102
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,730
You are 4th then?

103
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,700
No I am not queuing here, I just came to support him

104
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,950
I am queuing at Softbank, another shop not far

105
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,430
I am 4th over there

106
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,810
I made the reservation on the same day

107
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,100
Where do you come from?

108
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,080
From Kanagawa

109
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,120
My friend arrived on Monday

110
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,140
Monday! What is her number?

111
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,260
She is second, since Monday

112
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,370
Do you already own an iPhone?

113
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:53,860
Yes I have the 3GS

114
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,060
And you?

115
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,810
I have a Nexus!

116
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,980
but I have an iPad too!

117
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,720
An iPad New?

118
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,030
Yes, the first one in the world

119
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,540
The first one in the world?

120
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:17,760
I got it here in Ginza, number one in the world!

121
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,800
You were on TV?

122
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,410
Yes I was!

123
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,160
Famous! What is your name?

124
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,910
I am Watanabe Riyo

125
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,480
Impressive!

126
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,600
You take the queue every time?

127
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,360
First time was for the iPad 2, and then for the iPhone 4S,

128
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,060
every time there is something new, I come

129
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,820
What is you average position?

130
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,660
First time I was 14th, 

131
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,500
then for the iPhone 4S I was 2nd,

132
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,990
for the iPad I was 1st, and now I am 4th

133
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,430
You really take this seriously!

134
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,880
If I do something, I go for it!

135
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,860
What will you do until morning?

136
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:22,100
I will walk around, take it easy and talk to everybody, enjoy the event until morning

137
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,240
There is no longer Google Map on the iPhone 5

138
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,670
I guess they will make an application for it

139
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,320
I hope

140
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,040
I tried Apple Map, it is not so bad

141
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,790
I don't want to wait until they get it working, 

142
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,910
if i want to buy something, i go physically and I get it,  I want to join the event

143
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,960
Everybody says that Apple Map is bad

144
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:43,890
They said it is bad but I really think that it is not so bad,

145
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,800
I downloaded it, 

146
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:07,750
they said it won't show Shibuya station but who cares?

147
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,760
We don't use place names anyway so it doesn't matter, nothing bad
