and i'm in the bare leg
in the body here

28
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600

 

29
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,830

um

30
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:43,840
um
 

31
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,910
um
he's turned the other way

32
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:45,920
he's turned the other way
 

33
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,790
he's turned the other way
and you're trying to ambush right

34
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
and you're trying to ambush right
 

35
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,549
and you're trying to ambush right
from the back

36
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
from the back
 

37
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,150
from the back
um

38
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
um
 

39
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,430
um
so an ambush might be

40
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
so an ambush might be
 

41
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,470
so an ambush might be
the result of a

42
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
the result of a
 

43
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,310
the result of a
predation model well i think i could

44
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
predation model well i think i could
 

45
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,670
predation model well i think i could
take her

46
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
take her
 

47
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,590
take her
take her

48
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
take her
 

49
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,910
take her
you got into your ambush all right

50
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
you got into your ambush all right
 

51
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,270
you got into your ambush all right
so uh

52
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
so uh
 

53
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,789
so uh
you gotta play with

okay
let's do that again

80
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
let's do that again
 

81
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,469
let's do that again
you're you're getting it

82
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479
you're you're getting it
 

83
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,910
you're you're getting it
go

84
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920

 

85
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,749

that's not the uk

86
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
that's not the uk
 

87
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,270
that's not the uk
okay

88
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
okay
 

89
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,789
okay
go let's uh start working it uh

90
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
go let's uh start working it uh
 

91
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,709
go let's uh start working it uh
conception okay

92
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
conception okay
 

93
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,350
conception okay
so we'll take away the entry i showed

94
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
so we'll take away the entry i showed
 

95
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,230
so we'll take away the entry i showed
you how you can get into it okay

96
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
you how you can get into it okay
 

97
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,670
you how you can get into it okay
um

98
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
um
 

99
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,830
um
the guy is coming around right he's

100
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
the guy is coming around right he's
 

101
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,830
the guy is coming around right he's
coming around to do the barrel all right

102
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
coming around to do the barrel all right
 

103
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,790
coming around to do the barrel all right
um

104
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
um
 

105
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,750
um
so

106
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
so
 

107
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,150
so
first concept is go

108
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
first concept is go
 

109
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,390
first concept is go
is don't stand straight up

110
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
is don't stand straight up
 

111
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,110
is don't stand straight up
and let your weight go to your heels

112
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
and let your weight go to your heels
 

113
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,430
and let your weight go to your heels
you have to get this thing on mid-foot

114
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
you have to get this thing on mid-foot
 

115
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,150
you have to get this thing on mid-foot
mid-foot vector okay

116
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
mid-foot vector okay
 

117
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,430
mid-foot vector okay
some of you are

118
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
some of you are
 

119
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,390
some of you are
going

120
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
going
 

121
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,630
going
and you're on your heels and oh no

you're toast okay
 

125
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,350
you're toast okay
so as he goes my weight shifts home to

126
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
so as he goes my weight shifts home to
 

127
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,390
so as he goes my weight shifts home to
mid-foot vector this is too far

128
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
mid-foot vector this is too far
 

129
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,710
mid-foot vector this is too far
mid-foot vector like you're doing the

130
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
mid-foot vector like you're doing the
 

131
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,430
mid-foot vector like you're doing the
back squat okay that's where your power

132
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
back squat okay that's where your power
 

133
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,150
back squat okay that's where your power
is

134
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
is
 

135
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,990
is
okay don't

136
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
okay don't
 

137
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,869
okay don't
back

138
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
back
 

139
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,110
back
just like your back squat

140
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
just like your back squat

down okay it's mid-foot back

146
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
down okay it's mid-foot back
 

147
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,350
down okay it's mid-foot back
so that's our drill guy comes around

148
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
so that's our drill guy comes around
 

149
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,270
so that's our drill guy comes around
big foot vector

150
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
big foot vector
 

151
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,830
big foot vector
we'll do the ambush one two

152
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
we'll do the ambush one two
 

153
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,869
we'll do the ambush one two
you'll feel it mid foot vector you can

154
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
you'll feel it mid foot vector you can
 

155
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,470
you'll feel it mid foot vector you can
also deepen your sound so he goes

156
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
also deepen your sound so he goes
 

157
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,869
also deepen your sound so he goes
mid-foot vector deeper

158
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
mid-foot vector deeper
 

159
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,509
mid-foot vector deeper
ambush

160
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
ambush
 

161
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,229
ambush
people my stance midfielder okay let's

162
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
people my stance midfielder okay let's
 

163
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,710
people my stance midfielder okay let's
just get the weight distribution yeah

164
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
just get the weight distribution yeah
 

165
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,350
just get the weight distribution yeah
hey uh the midfield vector that goes

166
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
hey uh the midfield vector that goes
 

167
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,110
hey uh the midfield vector that goes
around uh it's not a bracing angle okay

168
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
around uh it's not a bracing angle okay
 

169
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,869
around uh it's not a bracing angle okay
it's dynamic so as he tries to move me i

170
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
it's dynamic so as he tries to move me i
 

171
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,190
it's dynamic so as he tries to move me i
keep that mid foot vector not fighting

172
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
keep that mid foot vector not fighting
 

173
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,750
keep that mid foot vector not fighting
with him as he he go ahead so you see

174
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
with him as he he go ahead so you see

he's trying to move me that way i move
 

177
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,990
he's trying to move me that way i move
that way he's trying to go forward i

178
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
that way he's trying to go forward i
 

179
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,030
that way he's trying to go forward i
move forward because you go backwards i

180
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
move forward because you go backwards i
 

181
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,589
move forward because you go backwards i
move backwards keeping that midfoot okay

182
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
move backwards keeping that midfoot okay
 

183
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,630
move backwards keeping that midfoot okay
don't don't sing and brace and settle

184
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
don't don't sing and brace and settle
 

185
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,949
don't don't sing and brace and settle
it's got to be dynamic with perspective

186
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
it's got to be dynamic with perspective
 

187
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,990
it's got to be dynamic with perspective
and that's your drill now

188
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
and that's your drill now
 

189
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,509
and that's your drill now
hey uh

190
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
hey uh
 

191
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,070
hey uh
next concept is don't get small

192
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
next concept is don't get small
 

193
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,190
next concept is don't get small
don't get small

194
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200

 

195
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,910

so you have your uh inward spiral that

196
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
so you have your uh inward spiral that
 

197
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,509
so you have your uh inward spiral that
you work with and you're going to use

198
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
you work with and you're going to use
 

199
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,630
you work with and you're going to use
the torso aspect of the inward spiral so

200
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
the torso aspect of the inward spiral so
 

201
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,789
the torso aspect of the inward spiral so
he's coming around

202
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
he's coming around
 

203
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,949
he's coming around
okay

204
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
okay
 

205
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,069
okay
um

206
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
um
 

207
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,909
um
he goes again

208
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
he goes again
 

209
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,590
he goes again
move strong

210
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
move strong
 

211
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,670
move strong
throw him here okay

212
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
throw him here okay
 

213
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,310
throw him here okay
let's say he got uh

214
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
let's say he got uh
 

215
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,510
let's say he got uh
one arm so you doing the arm drag

216
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
one arm so you doing the arm drag
 

217
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,150
one arm so you doing the arm drag
well it'll go underneath it it would be

218
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
well it'll go underneath it it would be
 

219
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,990
well it'll go underneath it it would be
the technique sean

220
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
the technique sean
 

221
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,870
the technique sean
he does the arm drag hold underneath it

222
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
he does the arm drag hold underneath it
 

223
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,990
he does the arm drag hold underneath it
arm drag underneath it

224
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000

 

225
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,030

arm drag underneath it okay so you're

226
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
arm drag underneath it okay so you're
 

227
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,150
arm drag underneath it okay so you're
going to have

228
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
going to have
 

229
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,710
going to have
one arm automatically out if you made it

230
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
one arm automatically out if you made it
 

231
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,749
one arm automatically out if you made it
go out

232
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
go out
 

233
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,590
go out
so you have the other arm boom trying to

234
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
so you have the other arm boom trying to
 

235
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,110
so you have the other arm boom trying to
not be small

236
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120

 

237
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,189

here we go

238
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199

 

239
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,870

and this is always better

240
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
and this is always better
 

241
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,150
and this is always better
than

242
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
than
 

243
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,310
than
this okay here feel the ambush one

244
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
this okay here feel the ambush one
 

245
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,070
this okay here feel the ambush one
you'll feel it

246
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
you'll feel it
 

247
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,350
you'll feel it
boom

248
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
boom
 

249
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,230
boom
big

250
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
big
 

251
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,029
big
okay

252
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
okay
 

253
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,390
okay
let's try it don't be small okay go

254
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
let's try it don't be small okay go
 

255
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,670
let's try it don't be small okay go
okay the next concept

256
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
okay the next concept
 

257
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,110
okay the next concept
he's going on big midfoot weight is

258
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
he's going on big midfoot weight is
 

259
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,909
he's going on big midfoot weight is
kazushi so uh

260
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
kazushi so uh
 

261
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,350
kazushi so uh
take his balance

262
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
take his balance
 

263
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,270
take his balance
okay

264
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
okay
 

265
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,029
okay
he's going

266
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
he's going
 

267
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:45,189
he's going
bigger

268
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199

 

269
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,350

don't worry if he falls or not you just

270
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
don't worry if he falls or not you just
 

271
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,830
don't worry if he falls or not you just
can't be standing still okay

272
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
can't be standing still okay
 

273
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,629
can't be standing still okay
again your kazushi angles will just do

274
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
again your kazushi angles will just do
 

275
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,629
again your kazushi angles will just do
it from here slowly

276
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
it from here slowly
 

277
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,189
it from here slowly
is probably going to if he's coming in

278
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
is probably going to if he's coming in
 

279
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,350
is probably going to if he's coming in
aggressively it's going to be the front

280
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
aggressively it's going to be the front
 

281
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,430
aggressively it's going to be the front
inward on the left

282
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
inward on the left
 

283
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,590
inward on the left
front inward on the right

284
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
front inward on the right
 

285
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,550
front inward on the right
okay got it i wouldn't be trying uh the

286
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
okay got it i wouldn't be trying uh the
 

287
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,070
okay got it i wouldn't be trying uh the
back ones

288
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
back ones
 

289
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,950
back ones
okay

290
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
okay
 

291
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,189
okay
of course if he's pulling you backward

292
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
of course if he's pulling you backward
 

293
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,510
of course if he's pulling you backward
right then

294
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
right then
 

295
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,510
right then
run inwards in the rear

296
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
run inwards in the rear
 

297
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,990
run inwards in the rear
inward to the other rear okay try it

298
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
inward to the other rear okay try it
 

299
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,430
inward to the other rear okay try it
again

300
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
again
 

301
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,110
again
okay so uh

302
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
okay so uh
 

303
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,230
okay so uh
what i'm doing is uh subverting it it's

304
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
what i'm doing is uh subverting it it's
 

305
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,309
what i'm doing is uh subverting it it's
always easier to disperse something

306
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
always easier to disperse something
 

307
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,790
always easier to disperse something
before it comes to fruition

308
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
before it comes to fruition
 

309
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,590
before it comes to fruition
uh than to try to get rid of it once it

310
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
uh than to try to get rid of it once it
 

311
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,430
uh than to try to get rid of it once it
has happened okay

312
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
has happened okay
 

313
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,590
has happened okay
uh but what tends to happen as she's

314
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
uh but what tends to happen as she's
 

315
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,390
uh but what tends to happen as she's
going is they'll go for other things

316
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
going is they'll go for other things
 

317
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,070
going is they'll go for other things
because they realize she's never gonna

00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
which you can do in the other one so
 

517
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,790
which you can do in the other one so
let's say he has the other grips and

518
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
let's say he has the other grips and
 

519

let's say he has the other grips and
he's really freaking strong and i can't

520
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
he's really freaking strong and i can't
 

521
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,829
he's really freaking strong and i can't
push it maybe i could just get it uh

522
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
push it maybe i could just get it uh
 

523
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,430
push it maybe i could just get it uh
loosen up with this knuckle tank you see

524
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
loosen up with this knuckle tank you see
 

525
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,990
loosen up with this knuckle tank you see
so i just i just get it loosen up and

526
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
so i just i just get it loosen up and
 

527
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,870
so i just i just get it loosen up and
then

528
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
then
 

529
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,430
then
i can maybe get it so uh we're just

530
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
i can maybe get it so uh we're just
 

531
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,310
i can maybe get it so uh we're just
gonna show that

532
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
gonna show that
 

533
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,990
gonna show that
we'll just use this one

534
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
we'll just use this one
 

535
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,870
we'll just use this one
okay

536
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
okay
 

537
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,269
okay
so you're going to take the the phoenix

538
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
so you're going to take the the phoenix
 

539
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,670
so you're going to take the the phoenix
fist here this middle knuckle fist and

540
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
fist here this middle knuckle fist and
 

541
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,949
fist here this middle knuckle fist and
you're just going to put it in the back

542
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
you're just going to put it in the back
 

543
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,590
you're just going to put it in the back
of the hand if you need more energy you

544
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
of the hand if you need more energy you
 

545
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,550
of the hand if you need more energy you
just

546
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
just
 

547
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,030
just
use the other hand and you're gonna rub

548
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
use the other hand and you're gonna rub
 

549
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,470
use the other hand and you're gonna rub
it like a

550
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
it like a
 

551
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,150
it like a
like a cpr

552
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
like a cpr
 

553
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,310
like a cpr
chest rub okay

554
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
chest rub okay
 

555
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,310
chest rub okay
and now you're out okay

556
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
and now you're out okay
 

557
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,790
and now you're out okay
um we'll do that one

558
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
um we'll do that one
 

559
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,750
um we'll do that one
and then

560
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
and then
 

561
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,110
and then
uh another one is the finger so you're

562
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
uh another one is the finger so you're
 

563
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,750
uh another one is the finger so you're
going to get underneath and use your

564
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
going to get underneath and use your
 

565
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,550
going to get underneath and use your
hands to get those fingers out you see

566
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
hands to get those fingers out you see
 

567
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,550
hands to get those fingers out you see
and then you have the

568
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
and then you have the
 

569
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,590
and then you have the
pain

570
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
pain
 

571
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,910
pain
so you can work either of those okay all

572
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
so you can work either of those okay all
 

573
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,350
so you can work either of those okay all
right so let's play it

574
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360

 

575
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,150

okay uh this last concept you have is

576
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
okay uh this last concept you have is
 

577
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,990
okay uh this last concept you have is
one that you use all the time in your

578
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
one that you use all the time in your
 

579
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,870
one that you use all the time in your
tachiwasa and in your network

580
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
tachiwasa and in your network
 

581
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,630
tachiwasa and in your network
is uh don't be

582
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
is uh don't be
 

583
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,430
is uh don't be
where the attack requires you to be so

584
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
where the attack requires you to be so
 

585
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,949
where the attack requires you to be so
you know if you don't want to uh

586
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
you know if you don't want to uh
 

587
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,389
you know if you don't want to uh
to be

588
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
to be
 

589
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,990
to be
let's say you're you're in someone's

590
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
let's say you're you're in someone's
 

591
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,310
let's say you're you're in someone's
closed guard and you don't want to get

592
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
closed guard and you don't want to get
 

593
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,910
closed guard and you don't want to get
yourself stuck

594
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
yourself stuck
 

595
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,269
yourself stuck
in the

596
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
in the
 

597
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,670
in the
triangle armbar omoplata dilemma don't

598
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
triangle armbar omoplata dilemma don't
 

599

601
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,110
lean
forward into that 45 degree angle does

602
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
forward into that 45 degree angle does
 

603
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,269
forward into that 45 degree angle does
you got no business being there and the

604
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
you got no business being there and the
 

605
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,829
you got no business being there and the
best thing to do then is don't pass

uh seated because you're likely going to
 

611
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,110
uh seated because you're likely going to
get there so you got no business being

we're still working with this geometry

624
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
we're still working with this geometry
 

625
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,470
we're still working with this geometry
is working because he's behind me and

626
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
is working because he's behind me and
 

627
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,829
is working because he's behind me and
i'm over here you see that so uh a

628
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:33,839
i'm over here you see that so uh a
 

629
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,430
i'm over here you see that so uh a
simple just turn just get this thing not

630
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
simple just turn just get this thing not
 

631
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,629
simple just turn just get this thing not
where he wants it to be you see that

632
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
where he wants it to be you see that
 

633
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,389
where he wants it to be you see that
you see and now this thing already

634
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
you see and now this thing already
 

635
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,430
you see and now this thing already
changed

636
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
changed
 

637
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,030
changed
so um you it's not like the other one

638
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
so um you it's not like the other one
 

639
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,550
so um you it's not like the other one
where i'm trying to throw him i'm just

where i'm trying to throw him i'm just
 

641
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,069
where i'm trying to throw him i'm just
trying to change this geometry just

642
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
trying to change this geometry just
 

643
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,350
trying to change this geometry just
enough you see and now he's not where he

644
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
enough you see and now he's not where he
 

645
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,750
enough you see and now he's not where he
wanted to be okay

646
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
wanted to be okay
 

647
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,629
wanted to be okay
and now you have all kinds of other

648
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
and now you have all kinds of other
 

649
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,750
and now you have all kinds of other
attacks

650
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
attacks
 

651
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,389
attacks
so you've got the ankle here

652
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
so you've got the ankle here
 

653
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,870
so you've got the ankle here
which is very much

654
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
which is very much
 

655
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,470
which is very much
on there

656
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
on there
 

657
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,150
on there
and you have the groin with the heel

658
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
and you have the groin with the heel
 

659
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,949
and you have the groin with the heel
hook

660
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
hook
 

661
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,710
hook
over here you see that

662
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
over here you see that
 

663
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,190
over here you see that
without forfeiting

664
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,200
without forfeiting
 

665
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,750
without forfeiting
your balance that's not a good shot

666
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:19,760
your balance that's not a good shot
 

667
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,990
your balance that's not a good shot
because i can't bleed with the heel from

668
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
because i can't bleed with the heel from
 

669
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,629
because i can't bleed with the heel from
there you see from this angle and then

670
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
there you see from this angle and then
 

671
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,829
there you see from this angle and then
this really compromises my balance so

672
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
this really compromises my balance so
 

673
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,949
this really compromises my balance so
inside his movement just that was enough

674
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
inside his movement just that was enough
 

675
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,629
inside his movement just that was enough
that's enough and you're going to get

676
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
that's enough and you're going to get
 

677
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,030
that's enough and you're going to get
that heel to leave there and

678
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
that heel to leave there and
 

679
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,590
that heel to leave there and
you'll get your heel hook into the groin

680
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600
you'll get your heel hook into the groin
 

681
