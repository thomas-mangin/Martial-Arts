1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,350

so he's here

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:03,360
so he's here
 

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,550
so he's here
and a guy can really control

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:06,560
and a guy can really control
 

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,669
and a guy can really control
what you're doing okay but he can anchor

6
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
what you're doing okay but he can anchor
 

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,790
what you're doing okay but he can anchor
his elbow here

8
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
his elbow here
 

9
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,669
his elbow here
and anchor someone here and i control so

10
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:13,679
and anchor someone here and i control so
 

11
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,110
and anchor someone here and i control so
he tries to posture

12
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
he tries to posture
 

13
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,670
he tries to posture
and he can't posture and eventually like

14
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
and he can't posture and eventually like
 

15
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,390
and he can't posture and eventually like
he finds

16
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
he finds
 

17
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,590
he finds
things okay and so

18
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
things okay and so
 

19
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,790
things okay and so
it's not so easy uh

20
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800
it's not so easy uh
 

21
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,070
it's not so easy uh
to always get this off okay

22
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
to always get this off okay
 

23
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,589
to always get this off okay
so look at what i'm what i'm doing here

24
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
so look at what i'm what i'm doing here
 

25
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,990
so look at what i'm what i'm doing here
i'm trapped inside his head

26
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
i'm trapped inside his head
 

27
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,350
i'm trapped inside his head
and his grip and his anchored elbow okay

28
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
and his grip and his anchored elbow okay
 

29
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,830
and his grip and his anchored elbow okay
so i i don't want to go against that

30
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:39,840
so i i don't want to go against that
 

31
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,069
so i i don't want to go against that
because that's going to be yong

32
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
because that's going to be yong
 

33
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,670
because that's going to be yong
on yong okay so i'm gonna go

34
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
on yong okay so i'm gonna go
 

35
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,430
on yong okay so i'm gonna go
this way maybe my hand helps me

36
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
this way maybe my hand helps me
 

37
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,590
this way maybe my hand helps me
this one then my other hand

38
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
this one then my other hand
 

39
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,110
this one then my other hand
goes in and i use two hands

40
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
goes in and i use two hands
 

41
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,470
goes in and i use two hands
so you just peel that off

42
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
so you just peel that off
 

43
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,630
so you just peel that off
then i want to start the spiral okay

44
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
then i want to start the spiral okay
 

45
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,070
then i want to start the spiral okay
so if he's pushing then i'm going to

46
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
so if he's pushing then i'm going to
 

47
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,350
so if he's pushing then i'm going to
turn this

48
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
turn this
 

49
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,109
turn this
okay if he's pulling going this way

50
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
okay if he's pulling going this way
 

51
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,109
okay if he's pulling going this way
go back if he's pulling this way

52
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
go back if he's pulling this way
 

53
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,310
go back if he's pulling this way
then i'll enter and i'll pull this way

54
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
then i'll enter and i'll pull this way
 

55
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,710
then i'll enter and i'll pull this way
but i'm now on the outside

56
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720

 

57
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,350

so he's pushing hook

58
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360

 

59
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,069

he's pulling i go in with it and i'm on

60
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
he's pulling i go in with it and i'm on
 

61
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,630
he's pulling i go in with it and i'm on
the outside

62
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640

 

63
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,710

he pushes

64
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720

 

65
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,670

he falls

66
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680

 

67
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,069

pushes out

68
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079

 

69
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,069

okay your basic aikido strategy

70
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
okay your basic aikido strategy
 

71
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,350
okay your basic aikido strategy
is as as he goes he

72
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
is as as he goes he
 

73
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,469
is as as he goes he
just comes in i would move off so that

74
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
just comes in i would move off so that
 

75
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,150
just comes in i would move off so that
he has to now turn

76
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
he has to now turn
 

77
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,229
he has to now turn
to continue re-engaging so if i'm

78
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
to continue re-engaging so if i'm
 

79
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,270
to continue re-engaging so if i'm
if i'm on the inside he goes i will move

80
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
if i'm on the inside he goes i will move
 

81
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,150
if i'm on the inside he goes i will move
on

82
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
on
 

83
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:30,470
on
and he has to turn to keep engaging

84
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480

 

85
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,790

so when i'm here like that he goes to

86
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
so when i'm here like that he goes to
 

87
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,589
so when i'm here like that he goes to
push

88
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
push
 

89
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,309
push
and he has to turn to keep engaging

90
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319

 

91
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,070

so you don't go he goes

92
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
so you don't go he goes
 

93
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,229
so you don't go he goes
and now we're here he gets to come in

94
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
and now we're here he gets to come in
 

95
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,309
and now we're here he gets to come in
straight

96
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319

 

97
00:02:48,319 --> 00:03:01,750

he goes

98
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760

 

99
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,990

it doesn't have to be a big turn in fact

100
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
it doesn't have to be a big turn in fact
 

101
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,149
it doesn't have to be a big turn in fact
if it's too big you give him the option

102
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
if it's too big you give him the option
 

103
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,350
if it's too big you give him the option
of spinning

104
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
of spinning
 

105
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,830
of spinning
okay so you just got to get off of this

106
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
okay so you just got to get off of this
 

107
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,869
okay so you just got to get off of this
center line

108
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879

 

109
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,630

you just gotta get off of this center

110
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
you just gotta get off of this center
 

111
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:26,789
you just gotta get off of this center
line boom and now he has to turn

112
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799

 

113
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,630

i just need him to want to turn

114
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
i just need him to want to turn
 

115
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,869
i just need him to want to turn
so i do have a escape but i have to put

116
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
so i do have a escape but i have to put
 

117
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,830
so i do have a escape but i have to put
it in with the

118
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
it in with the
 

119
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:55,509
it in with the
strategy okay

120
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:55,519

 

121
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,190

i'm not wrestling him with bob wrestling

122
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
i'm not wrestling him with bob wrestling
 

123
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,750
i'm not wrestling him with bob wrestling
so i'm not doing these

124
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
so i'm not doing these
 

125
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,270
so i'm not doing these
things so as as he pushes

126
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
things so as as he pushes
 

127
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,869
things so as as he pushes
that's what allows me to find a yield

128
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
that's what allows me to find a yield
 

129
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,350
that's what allows me to find a yield
okay so the same thing as he pulls

130
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
okay so the same thing as he pulls
 

131
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,710
okay so the same thing as he pulls
that's what allows me to get out i i am

132
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
that's what allows me to get out i i am
 

133
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,150
that's what allows me to get out i i am
in some sort of muscle match

134
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
in some sort of muscle match
 

135
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,110
in some sort of muscle match
and the idea is to get out of it so as

136
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
and the idea is to get out of it so as
 

137
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,909
and the idea is to get out of it so as
he goes

138
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
he goes
 

139
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:54,790
he goes
and i'm not

140
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800

so i have to make this arm go
 

169
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,550
so i have to make this arm go
this way

170
