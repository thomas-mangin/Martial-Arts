00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:05,920
and this time how you can use footwork
 

9
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,470
and this time how you can use footwork
to move whilst spinning

00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
and vice versa if for example i was
 

35
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,830
and vice versa if for example i was
spinning in a forwards figure eight here

as i let it sweep down in this arc i

38
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
as i let it sweep down in this arc i
 

39
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,069
as i let it sweep down in this arc i
stop

40
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
stop
 

41
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,830
stop
and note to myself i started with the

42
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
and note to myself i started with the
 

43
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,430
and note to myself i started with the
forged figure eight so now this needs to

44
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
forged figure eight so now this needs to
 

45
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,950
forged figure eight so now this needs to
be backwards figure eight

46
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
be backwards figure eight
 

47
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,270
be backwards figure eight
and then i continue with the backwards

48
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
and then i continue with the backwards
 

49
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,150
and then i continue with the backwards

and then again when i take it back over

52
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
and then again when i take it back over
 

53
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,189
and then again when i take it back over
i take it back over the top and pause

54
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
i take it back over the top and pause
 

55
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,189
i take it back over the top and pause
and then go back to the forwards figure

56
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
and then go back to the forwards figure
 

57
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,270
and then go back to the forwards figure
eight and the same could be done if i

58
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
eight and the same could be done if i
 

59
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,549
eight and the same could be done if i
was going backwards

60
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559
was going backwards
 

61
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,670
was going backwards
so if i was going backwards

62
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
so if i was going backwards
 

63
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,510
so if i was going backwards
i take it over the top stop

64
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
i take it over the top stop
 

65
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,830
i take it over the top stop
and now i'm back into a board figuring

66
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,840
and now i'm back into a board figuring
 

67
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,670
and now i'm back into a board figuring

sweep back over and now i'm back into a

70
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
sweep back over and now i'm back into a
 

71
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,910
sweep back over and now i'm back into a
backwards figure

72
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920
backwards figure
 

73
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,870
backwards figure
and when you have this movement where

74
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
and when you have this movement where
 

75
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,630
and when you have this movement where
you feel that you're comfortable

76
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
you feel that you're comfortable
 

77
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,350
you feel that you're comfortable
you can then let it just flow from side

78
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
you can then let it just flow from side
 

79
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,310
you can then let it just flow from side
to side

80
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320

 

81
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,630

you also want to maintain clean flames

82
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
you also want to maintain clean flames
 

83
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,550
you also want to maintain clean flames
so if you can create a visual barrier

84
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
so if you can create a visual barrier
 

85
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,230
so if you can create a visual barrier
either side of you and if you can see

86
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
either side of you and if you can see
 

87
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,789
either side of you and if you can see
here i've got two lines

88
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
here i've got two lines
 

89
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,990
here i've got two lines
here and here if i was spinning i don't

90
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
here and here if i was spinning i don't
 

91
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,670
here and here if i was spinning i don't
want to let it stray over those lines

92
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
want to let it stray over those lines
 

93
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,270
want to let it stray over those lines
like this i want to try and keep

94
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
like this i want to try and keep
 

95
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,030
like this i want to try and keep
everything nice and tight

96
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
everything nice and tight
 

97
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,670
everything nice and tight
so it doesn't go within without outside

98
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
so it doesn't go within without outside
 

99
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,550
so it doesn't go within without outside
of those lines

100
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
of those lines
 

101
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,310
of those lines
so then when you're turning it actually

102
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
so then when you're turning it actually
 

103
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,550
so then when you're turning it actually
makes things a lot easier

104
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
makes things a lot easier
 

105
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,630
makes things a lot easier
if i show you side on like this

106
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
if i show you side on like this
 

107
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,270
if i show you side on like this
as i take it over to this side you can

108
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
as i take it over to this side you can
 

109
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,749
as i take it over to this side you can
see

110
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
see
 

111
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,709
see
it still remains within that boundary

112
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
it still remains within that boundary
 

113
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,830
it still remains within that boundary
same when i go back over to the other

114
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
same when i go back over to the other
 

115
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,430
same when i go back over to the other
side i'm not letting it drift

116
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
side i'm not letting it drift
 

117
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,229
side i'm not letting it drift
either side by doing something like this

118
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
either side by doing something like this
 

119
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,830
either side by doing something like this
or taking it outwards

120
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
or taking it outwards
 

121
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,350
or taking it outwards
you just want to make sure that you keep

122
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
you just want to make sure that you keep
 

123
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,990
you just want to make sure that you keep
it within that boundary

124
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
it within that boundary
 

125
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,589
it within that boundary
whilst you're spinning

126
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599

 

127
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,110

the other important point to understand

128
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
the other important point to understand
 

129
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,630
the other important point to understand
is where the staff is in relation to me

130
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
is where the staff is in relation to me
 

131
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,830
is where the staff is in relation to me
as a spinner

132
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
as a spinner
 

133
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,070
as a spinner
so if for example i'm spinning here in

134
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
so if for example i'm spinning here in
 

135
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,750
so if for example i'm spinning here in
this position

136
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
this position
 

137
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,910
this position
to me it feels like i'm spinning front

138
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
to me it feels like i'm spinning front
 

139
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,270
to me it feels like i'm spinning front
to back

140
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
to back
 

141
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,350
to back
but if i turn my hips and i face this

142
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
but if i turn my hips and i face this
 

143
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,550
but if i turn my hips and i face this
direction

144
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
direction
 

145
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,949
direction
it now feels like i'm spinning side to

146
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
it now feels like i'm spinning side to
 

147
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,470
it now feels like i'm spinning side to
side

148
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
side
 

149
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,190
side
but to you as a viewer it still looks

150
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
but to you as a viewer it still looks
 

151
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,990
but to you as a viewer it still looks
the same

152
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000

 

153
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,910

so the first step to try is getting this

154
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
so the first step to try is getting this
 

155
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,670
so the first step to try is getting this
feeling where you've got it spinning

156
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
feeling where you've got it spinning
 

157
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,790
feeling where you've got it spinning
front to back and then rotating your

158
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
front to back and then rotating your
 

159
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,630
front to back and then rotating your
hips

160
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
hips
 

161
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,589
hips
where it's now side to side but the spin

162
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
where it's now side to side but the spin
 

163
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,110
where it's now side to side but the spin
hasn't really changed it's just my body

164
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
hasn't really changed it's just my body
 

165
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,589
hasn't really changed it's just my body
that's

166
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
that's
 

167
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,350
that's
moved so here's front to back

168
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
moved so here's front to back
 

169
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,869
moved so here's front to back
and then side to side you can also do

170
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
and then side to side you can also do
 

171
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:16,070
and then side to side you can also do
this both directions

172
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080

 

173
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,949

you can then turn and this time when

174
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
you can then turn and this time when
 

175
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:19,430
you can then turn and this time when
we're

176
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
we're
 

177
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,110
we're
side on take the front leg

178
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
side on take the front leg
 

179
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,670
side on take the front leg
back and now we're in this position

180
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
back and now we're in this position
 

181
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,149
back and now we're in this position
which is spinning across your body you

182
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
which is spinning across your body you
 

183
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,710
which is spinning across your body you
can then

184
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
can then
 

185
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,030
can then
take another step forward and then turn

186
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
take another step forward and then turn
 

187
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,710
take another step forward and then turn
back square

188
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
back square
 

189
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,229
back square
so we're just moving one foot and

190
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
so we're just moving one foot and
 

191
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,990
so we're just moving one foot and
pivoting on the other

192
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
pivoting on the other
 

193
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,149
pivoting on the other
so yeah

194
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
so yeah
 

195
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,190
so yeah
and if you need to break it down so

196
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
and if you need to break it down so
 

197
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,789
and if you need to break it down so
stop and continue the figure eight

198
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
stop and continue the figure eight
 

199
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,509
stop and continue the figure eight
stop take a step back and then continue

200
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
stop take a step back and then continue
 

201
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,949
stop take a step back and then continue
the figure eight

202
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
the figure eight
 

203
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,229
the figure eight
stop you can just pause between those

204
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
stop you can just pause between those
 

205
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:56,869
stop you can just pause between those
points

206
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
points
 

207
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,229
points
if you need to until you can do it

208
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
if you need to until you can do it
 

209
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,750
if you need to until you can do it
smoothly

210
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760

 

211
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,990

again practice that both directions and

212
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
again practice that both directions and
 

213
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,030
again practice that both directions and
both sides

214
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
both sides
 

215
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,470
both sides
so you also want to practice stepping

216
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
so you also want to practice stepping
 

217
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,190
so you also want to practice stepping
back while spinning across your body

218
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
back while spinning across your body
 

219
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,350
back while spinning across your body
so in this position i'll take a step

220
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
so in this position i'll take a step
 

221
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,229
so in this position i'll take a step
back

222
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
back
 

223
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,749
back
continue spinning

224
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759

 

225
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,469

and just get used to this being able to

226
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
and just get used to this being able to
 

227
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,710
and just get used to this being able to
step forward and backwards

228
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
step forward and backwards
 

229
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,749
step forward and backwards
whilst spinning then go square

230
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
whilst spinning then go square
 

231
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,990
whilst spinning then go square
and now we can join it up with the other

232
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
and now we can join it up with the other
 

233
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,430
and now we can join it up with the other
side

234
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
side
 

235
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,469
side
we'll step back step forwards

236
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
we'll step back step forwards
 

237
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,030
we'll step back step forwards
and then continue the movement through

238
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
and then continue the movement through
 

239
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,110
and then continue the movement through
to the other side as well

240
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
to the other side as well
 

241
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,350
to the other side as well
and now we're moving from side to side

242
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
and now we're moving from side to side
 

243
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,390
and now we're moving from side to side
you know a step

244
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
you know a step
 

245
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,629
you know a step
forward backwards

246
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639

 

247
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,990

if i'm spinning forwards in this

248
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
if i'm spinning forwards in this
 

249
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,110
if i'm spinning forwards in this
position and i take my foot back

250
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
position and i take my foot back
 

251
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,189
position and i take my foot back
i can continue the movement this way

252
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
i can continue the movement this way
 

253
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,870
i can continue the movement this way
towards the wall

254
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
towards the wall
 

255
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,629
towards the wall
spin and now i'm backwards on the

256
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
spin and now i'm backwards on the
 

257
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,390
spin and now i'm backwards on the
opposite side

258
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
opposite side
 

259
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,990
opposite side
and then take a step and then back to

260
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
and then take a step and then back to
 

261
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,070
and then take a step and then back to
the beginning again so i've continued

262
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
the beginning again so i've continued
 

263
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,629
the beginning again so i've continued
the movement round rather than reversing

264
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
the movement round rather than reversing
 

265
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,710
the movement round rather than reversing
so from this position i could stop

266
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
so from this position i could stop
 

267
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,950
so from this position i could stop
move round to this side continue the

268
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
move round to this side continue the
 

269
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,070
move round to this side continue the
figure eight

270
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
figure eight
 

271
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,350
figure eight
in a backwards motion step

272
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
in a backwards motion step
 

273
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,790
in a backwards motion step
and now i'm back to the opposite side

274
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
and now i'm back to the opposite side
 

275
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,909
and now i'm back to the opposite side
again we can just continue that

276
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
again we can just continue that
 

277
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,070
again we can just continue that
until it becomes fluid

278
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
until it becomes fluid
 

279
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,950
until it becomes fluid
in continuous again you can go both

280
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
in continuous again you can go both
 

281
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,550
in continuous again you can go both
directions with this

282
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
directions with this
 

283
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,070
directions with this
step this way and back

284
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
step this way and back
 

285
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,510
step this way and back
in my last video i'll talk about hand

286
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
in my last video i'll talk about hand
 

287
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,029
in my last video i'll talk about hand
transfers and this is something you can

288
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
transfers and this is something you can
 

289
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,590
transfers and this is something you can
introduce

290
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
introduce
 

291
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,670
introduce
whilst moving a good way to practice

292
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
whilst moving a good way to practice
 

293
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,189
whilst moving a good way to practice
this is actually timing

294
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
this is actually timing
 

295
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,189
this is actually timing
your step with your hand change

296
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199

 

297
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,029

if for example i'm spinning in a

298
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
if for example i'm spinning in a
 

299
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,909
if for example i'm spinning in a
forwards figure eight here

300
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
forwards figure eight here
 

301
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,070
forwards figure eight here
i can change on this side to my left

302
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
i can change on this side to my left
 

303
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,189
i can change on this side to my left
hand

304
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
hand
 

305
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,110
hand
and i'm going to step with my left foot

306
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
and i'm going to step with my left foot
 

307
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,469
and i'm going to step with my left foot
there so it lands

308
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
there so it lands
 

309
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,189
there so it lands
together in this position do the same

310
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
together in this position do the same
 

311
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:57,909
together in this position do the same
again if i

312
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
again if i
 

313
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,189
again if i
step on my right side changes there

314
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
step on my right side changes there
 

315
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,749
step on my right side changes there
and the step forms at the same time as i

316
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
and the step forms at the same time as i
 

317
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,629
and the step forms at the same time as i
release

318
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
release
 

319
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,270
release
with the other hand if i change to the

320
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
with the other hand if i change to the
 

321
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,950
with the other hand if i change to the
other side here

322
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
other side here
 

323
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,870
other side here
i'm going to start to receive it with my

324
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
i'm going to start to receive it with my
 

325
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,029
i'm going to start to receive it with my
left hand and i'm going to take a step

326
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
left hand and i'm going to take a step
 

327
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,110
left hand and i'm going to take a step
back from my left leg

328
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
back from my left leg
 

329
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,469
back from my left leg
there so i fully release at that point

330
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
there so i fully release at that point
 

331
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,950
there so i fully release at that point
again if i take a step forward with my

332
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
again if i take a step forward with my
 

333
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,830
again if i take a step forward with my
left

334
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
left
 

335
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,029
left
and take a step forward and i'm now in

336
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
and take a step forward and i'm now in
 

337
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,070
and take a step forward and i'm now in
this position

338
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
this position
 

339
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,550
this position
so you could stop and pause between

340
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
so you could stop and pause between
 

341
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,270
so you could stop and pause between
these

342
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
these
 

343
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,670
these
