you're going to feel the Y of his

42
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
you're going to feel the Y of his

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,029
you're going to feel the Y of his
standing inertia and his forward inertia

00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:08,039
standing inertia and his forward inertia
 

45
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,430
standing inertia and his forward inertia
so I have to take the forward inertia

46
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
so I have to take the forward inertia
 

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,190

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,430
okay so in the last Technique we were
doing the backward

140
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:32,440
doing the backward
 

141
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,629
doing the backward
position this this

142
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:35,639
position this this
 

143
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,189

you're going to make him go this way and
 

179
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:38,790
you're going to make him go this way and
then you're entering across
