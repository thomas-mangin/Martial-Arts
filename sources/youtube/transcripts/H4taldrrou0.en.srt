00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,630
uh
get the adhesion okay but in the game

14
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:23,640
get the adhesion okay but in the game
 

15
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,970
get the adhesion okay but in the game
you're gonna do some of that and some

16
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:25,980
you're gonna do some of that and some
 

17
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,290
you're gonna do some of that and some
adhesion

18
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:27,300
adhesion
 

19
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,830
adhesion
you're gonna do some Coq projections so

20
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:30,840
you're gonna do some Coq projections so
 

21
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,790
you're gonna do some Coq projections so
you're going to do a higher young value

22
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
you're going to do a higher young value
 

23
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,610
you're going to do a higher young value
but we're going to aim it into his uh

24
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:37,620
but we're going to aim it into his uh
 

25
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,530
but we're going to aim it into his uh
Tandon okay

26
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:39,540
Tandon okay
 

27
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,270
Tandon okay
and then you're going to do some

28
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
and then you're going to do some
 

29
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,729
and then you're going to do some
following some just basic trapping

30
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:43,739
following some just basic trapping
 

31
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,830
following some just basic trapping
skills you have to combine all of them

32
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
skills you have to combine all of them
 

33
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,830
skills you have to combine all of them

from a Coq projection so you have to do

44
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:03,059
from a Coq projection so you have to do
 

45
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,950
from a Coq projection so you have to do
some basic trapping skills okay all

46
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:06,960
some basic trapping skills okay all
 

47
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,830
some basic trapping skills okay all
right so he's uh trying to touch my

48
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
right so he's uh trying to touch my

67
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,990

so there's something

68
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,000

 

69
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,050

to understand

70
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,060

 

71
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,410

about the game

72
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:57,420

 

73
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,509

um that it is a game

74
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
um that it is a game
 

75
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,150
um that it is a game
that it has rules okay

76
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
that it has rules okay
 

77
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,290
that it has rules okay
so uh for example

78
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:06,300
so uh for example
 

79
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,130
so uh for example
uh anchor your base that is deep in this

80
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,140
uh anchor your base that is deep in this
 

81
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,949
uh anchor your base that is deep in this
there you go don't let me push you over

82
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:15,959

 

83
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,290

right

84
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:18,300

right
okay

86
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:20,820

 

87
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,250

um

88
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:25,260

 

89
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,250

what this is going to do is like we've

90
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:28,260
what this is going to do is like we've
 

91
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,210
what this is going to do is like we've
fallen out of the game rule set and this

92
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:32,220
fallen out of the game rule set and this
 

93
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,889
fallen out of the game rule set and this
is this always happens with games

94
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:33,899
is this always happens with games
 

95
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,930
is this always happens with games
whenever you make rules whenever you

96
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:35,940
whenever you make rules whenever you
 

97
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,590
whenever you make rules whenever you
make context we start to milk the rule

98
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
make context we start to milk the rule
 

99
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,790
make context we start to milk the rule
set as we Chase what we consider victory

100
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:43,800
set as we Chase what we consider victory
 

101
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,610
set as we Chase what we consider victory
in the game versus the training thing

102
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:46,620
in the game versus the training thing
 

103
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,470
in the game versus the training thing
okay

104
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
okay
 

105
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,210
okay
um and all you have to do is uh change

106
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:53,220
um and all you have to do is uh change
 

107
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,250
um and all you have to do is uh change
sides and you'll notice that

108
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:58,260
sides and you'll notice that
 

109
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,670
sides and you'll notice that
um while you become a little more

110
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
um while you become a little more
 

111
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,329
um while you become a little more
difficult to project do you understand

112
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:05,339
difficult to project do you understand
 

113
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,310
difficult to project do you understand
uh you become so you over uh how I want

114
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
uh you become so you over uh how I want
 

115
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,230
uh you become so you over uh how I want
to say this you over stabilize in the

116
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
to say this you over stabilize in the
 

117
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,590
to say this you over stabilize in the
game and which is fine when you're not

118
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
game and which is fine when you're not
 

119
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,490
game and which is fine when you're not
uh being hit back because Mobility is

120
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:19,500
uh being hit back because Mobility is
 

121
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,310
uh being hit back because Mobility is
not there okay so we'll switch roles

122
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
not there okay so we'll switch roles
 

123
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,030
not there okay so we'll switch roles
okay and that'll be enough to to expose

124
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,040
okay and that'll be enough to to expose
 

125
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:36,350
okay and that'll be enough to to expose
it

126
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:36,360

 

127
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,590

okay

128
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600

 

129
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,670

you see

130
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
you see
 

131
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,069
you see
so you as your as you're doing the drill

132
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
so you as your as you're doing the drill
 

133
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,930
so you as your as you're doing the drill
you have as you're the UK

134
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:50,940
you have as you're the UK
 

135
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,490
you have as you're the UK
you don't want to get caught in the game

136
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:55,500
you don't want to get caught in the game
 

137
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,630
you don't want to get caught in the game
as a winning losing game it's more like

138
00:10:59,630 --> 00:10:59,640
as a winning losing game it's more like
 

139
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,910
as a winning losing game it's more like
a game that has rules so if you're

140
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
a game that has rules so if you're
 

141
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,650
a game that has rules so if you're
playing Monopoly

142
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:03,660
playing Monopoly
 

143
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,110
playing Monopoly
you play Within the rules you don't just

144
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,120
you play Within the rules you don't just
 

145
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,470
you play Within the rules you don't just
take everyone's money and go I win does

146
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:09,480
take everyone's money and go I win does
 

147
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,050
take everyone's money and go I win does
that make sense so

148
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:12,060
that make sense so
 

149
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,250
that make sense so
as uh you're trying to do this

150
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:16,260
as uh you're trying to do this
 

151
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,230
as uh you're trying to do this
you're also giving the spinal

152
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
you're also giving the spinal
 

153
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,889
you're also giving the spinal
displacement energy you get that

154
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:21,899
displacement energy you get that
 

155
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,690
displacement energy you get that
as opposed to when connect and hear

156
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:26,700
as opposed to when connect and hear
 

157
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,569
as opposed to when connect and hear
what am I do you feel like if you go off

158
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:29,579
what am I do you feel like if you go off
 

159
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,910
what am I do you feel like if you go off
really fast go off really fast no you're

160
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
really fast go off really fast no you're
 

161
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,009
really fast go off really fast no you're
gonna go off really fast get connection

162
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:34,019
gonna go off really fast get connection
 

163
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,650
gonna go off really fast get connection
again there we are here we are right you

164
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:36,660
again there we are here we are right you
 

165
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,230
again there we are here we are right you
see I have spinal displacement energy

166
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,240
see I have spinal displacement energy
 

167
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,090
see I have spinal displacement energy
move out of the way really fast and be

168
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:41,100
move out of the way really fast and be
 

169
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,710
move out of the way really fast and be
safe

170
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
safe
 

171
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,350
safe
come back I feel you connect to my

172

for which I wouldn't even call grounding
 

193
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,090
for which I wouldn't even call grounding
it's a bracing angle so uh don't let me

194
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,100
it's a bracing angle so uh don't let me
 

195

and you can see
 

213
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:41,990
and you can see
this little Arc right here

214
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
this little Arc right here
 

215
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,050
this little Arc right here
okay

216
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:45,060

 

217
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,190

so I'll exaggerate it so you you can see

218
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
so I'll exaggerate it so you you can see
 

219
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,829
so I'll exaggerate it so you you can see
come in the back so you can see

220
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:54,839

 

221
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,930

you see here

222

you see here
 

223
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,629
you see here
okay as opposed to

224
00:12:59,629 --> 00:12:59,639
okay as opposed to
 

225
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,430
okay as opposed to
here

226
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
here
 

227
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,870
here
you go look at that

228
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:05,880

 

229
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,730

see
 

231
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,970
see
so when I go like this

232
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:10,980
so when I go like this
 

233
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,370
so when I go like this
I get a bracing angle that's what that

234
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:13,380
I get a bracing angle that's what that
 

235
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,829
I get a bracing angle that's what that
that's what a lot of Aikido people do is

236
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
that's what a lot of Aikido people do is
 

237
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,889
that's what a lot of Aikido people do is
they Point their pelvis down

they Point their pelvis down
 

239
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,129
they Point their pelvis down
and a lot of tension and stress goes in

240
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:22,139
and a lot of tension and stress goes in
 

241
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,670
and a lot of tension and stress goes in
the back you see that you get that okay

242
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
the back you see that you get that okay
 

243
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,310
the back you see that you get that okay
so again try to push me and I'm just

244
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
so again try to push me and I'm just
 

245
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,090
so again try to push me and I'm just
bracing against that and say that you

246
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,100
bracing against that and say that you
 

247
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,370
bracing against that and say that you
should feel that you've just generated a

248
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:34,380
should feel that you've just generated a
 

249
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,790
should feel that you've just generated a
huge amount of tension all through here

250
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:37,800
huge amount of tension all through here
 

251
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,610
huge amount of tension all through here
all through here if you see and in that

00:13:59,810 --> 00:13:59,820
do you feel the tension in your all
 

269
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,690
do you feel the tension in your all
through here okay so that that you don't

270
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:02,700
through here okay so that that you don't
 

271
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,970
through here okay so that that you don't
want to do it's not that it's not

272
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:04,980
want to do it's not that it's not
 

273
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,090
want to do it's not that it's not
projectable but it's not training so for

274
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,100
projectable but it's not training so for
 

275
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,210
projectable but it's not training so for
example here's here's the block and when

276
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:11,220
example here's here's the block and when
 

277
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,430
example here's here's the block and when
you watch the video you'll see me just

278
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
you watch the video you'll see me just
 

279
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,009
you watch the video you'll see me just
circle it okay

280
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:16,019
circle it okay
 

281
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,250
circle it okay
or you go around you go around it get

282
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:19,260
or you go around you go around it get
 

283
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,530
or you go around you go around it get
off of this one get off that one hit the

284
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:21,540
off of this one get off that one hit the
 

285
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,590
off of this one get off that one hit the
chest get off of it okay so when you go

286
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:24,600
chest get off of it okay so when you go
 

287
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,750
chest get off of it okay so when you go
around when you get off then I circled

288
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:26,760
around when you get off then I circled
 

289
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,710
around when you get off then I circled
it again you see okay or you pull back

290
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
it again you see okay or you pull back
 

291
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,889
it again you see okay or you pull back
go off of it you see and then I follow

292
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:33,899
go off of it you see and then I follow
 

293
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:38,090
go off of it you see and then I follow
you see and I'm in here okay and then I

294
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,100
you see and I'm in here okay and then I
 

295
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,889
you see and I'm in here okay and then I
would do it again you would brace again

296
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:39,899
would do it again you would brace again
 

297
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:43,069
would do it again you would brace again
you see and then we have

298
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:43,079
you see and then we have
 

299
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,790
you see and then we have
another way you get it it's not that

300
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
another way you get it it's not that
 

301
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,030
another way you get it it's not that
I I liked it myself because it trains me

302
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,040
I I liked it myself because it trains me
 

303
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,150
I I liked it myself because it trains me
higher but it's training you lower okay

304
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,160
higher but it's training you lower okay
 

305
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,600
higher but it's training you lower okay
got it all right okay
