underneath that midline
 

111
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,429
underneath that midline
of the grid then then it has your weight

112
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:04,439
of the grid then then it has your weight
 

113
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,390

that same line
 

117
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,470
that same line
around there's the line right here

118
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
around there's the line right here
 

119
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,349
around there's the line right here
that's where I push down straight and

120
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
that's where I push down straight and
 

121
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,189
