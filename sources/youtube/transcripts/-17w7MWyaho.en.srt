00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,850
he blocks me
so this is this happens with anybody of

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:13,860
so this is this happens with anybody of
 

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,849
so this is this happens with anybody of
any rank is blocked

6
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:16,859
any rank is blocked

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,790
any rank is blocked
so what you've got to do is on this side

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:19,800
so what you've got to do is on this side
 

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,550
so what you've got to do is on this side
of the body to that side of the body

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
of the body to that side of the body
 

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,790
of the body to that side of the body
you've got to float

12
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:25,800
you've got to float
 

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,730
you've got to float
you've got to float

14
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:28,740
you've got to float
 

15
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,609
you've got to float
watch this foot

16
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:31,619
watch this foot
 

17
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,729
watch this foot
hmm now the foot's got to be ready for

18
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:34,739
hmm now the foot's got to be ready for
 

19
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,530
hmm now the foot's got to be ready for
the next position before the next

20
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:36,540
the next position before the next
 

21
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,049
the next position before the next
position gets there

22
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:39,059
position gets there
 

23
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,709
position gets there
and that's why that's why

24
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
and that's why that's why
 

25
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,869
and that's why that's why
if you don't move it

26
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
if you don't move it
 

27
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,090
if you don't move it
and then step in it'll flop

28
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:50,100

 

29
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,490

you know I've used probably years but

30
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:52,500
you know I've used probably years but
 

31
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,270
you know I've used probably years but
pinball games the ball goes bing bing

32
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:56,280
pinball games the ball goes bing bing
 

33
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,590
pinball games the ball goes bing bing
you've got to be that ball so depending

34
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,600
you've got to be that ball so depending
 

35
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,189
you've got to be that ball so depending
on the person's how they feel to you

36
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,199
on the person's how they feel to you
 

37
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,230
on the person's how they feel to you
or depend how whether this goes outwards

38
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,240
or depend how whether this goes outwards
 

39
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,969
or depend how whether this goes outwards
straight ahead

40
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:10,979
straight ahead
 

41
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,910
straight ahead
and it all depends on where their arm is

42
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
and it all depends on where their arm is
 

43
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,609
and it all depends on where their arm is
in length

44
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:16,619
in length
 

45
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,750
in length
so

46
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:17,760
so
 

47
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,530
so
don't reduce in but you know but make it

48
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:21,540
don't reduce in but you know but make it
 

49
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,690
don't reduce in but you know but make it
so it's strong

50
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:23,700
so it's strong
 

51
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,690
so it's strong
if it's strong I can perhaps fight

52
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:26,700
if it's strong I can perhaps fight
 

53
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,910
if it's strong I can perhaps fight
against it so scientists are used to

54
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:28,920
against it so scientists are used to
 

55
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,710
against it so scientists are used to
show it like this he used to make a ring

56
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
show it like this he used to make a ring
 

57
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,730
show it like this he used to make a ring
and he used to do

00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:37,740

 

59
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,429

so for years you'd think oh that's

60
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:40,439
so for years you'd think oh that's
 

61
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,590
so for years you'd think oh that's

because he's a night then isn't it
 

63
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,289
because he's a night then isn't it
but what he's showing us is you can't

64
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:45,299
but what he's showing us is you can't
 

65
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,390
but what he's showing us is you can't
take it anywhere you have to go where

66
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:47,400
take it anywhere you have to go where
 

67
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,690
take it anywhere you have to go where
that is so by making the ring we work

68
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:50,700
that is so by making the ring we work
 

69
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,670

247
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,370

so that's the sort of thing I do when

248
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:19,380
so that's the sort of thing I do when
 

249

00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,020

 

255
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,770

a float

stretch them out
at this point it's too much

264
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:50,039
at this point it's too much
 

265
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,129
at this point it's too much
and there's a stop and they're not very

285
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,430
keep cutting it what I'm saying is I
actually backed off

286
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:22,440

 

287
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,670

my back office as if I I cut a corner of

00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
my back office as if I I cut a corner of
 

289
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,249
my back office as if I I cut a corner of
the circle because

290
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:28,259
the circle because
 

291
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,490
the circle because
to do the circle

292
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:31,500

 

293
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,889

to do the circle

294
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:33,899
to do the circle
 

295
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,449
to do the circle
now

296
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:35,459
now
 

297
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:38,029
now
