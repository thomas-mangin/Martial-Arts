okay so now we got 21 to 27 it steps
back from 20 to 21 so there's no issues
with leaking in instead just coming
forwards he just stepped back out the
way of the thrust so in 21 new raises
strife I come forward and thrust he
stepped back then he does the high
struts
here I step back offline turn over 23
and I go it's two thrusts twenty-four
here he scoots under it then before 25
and then I pull back and double time he
thrusts right this makes more sense to
be doing up close because he's having to
dodge my thrust and step across each
time you're doing it this it's probably
do something slightly different
