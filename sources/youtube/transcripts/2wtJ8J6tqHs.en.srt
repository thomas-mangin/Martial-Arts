the stressor I go right through his

186
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
the stressor I go right through his
 

187
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,550
the stressor I go right through his
Center not around his Center so in the

193
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:34,110

here I push through his Center

194
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,120

 

195
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,550

you notice he gets projected out he get

196
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
you notice he gets projected out he get
 

197
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,629
you notice he gets projected out he get
squeezed

198
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639

 

199
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,749

out not falling over

200
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:50,759

on that Y Line
 

209
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,150
on that Y Line
okay all right try it

210
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
okay all right try it
 

211
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,230
okay all right try it
again it's even here it's prevalent okay

212
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
again it's even here it's prevalent okay
 

213

uh you don't start in Comm then to go

214
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
uh you don't start in Comm then to go
 

215
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,309
uh you don't start in Comm then to go
end up in Comm you you start in Han me

216
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:17,319
end up in Comm you you start in Han me
 

217
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,950
end up in Comm you you start in Han me
in Han me my feet are underneath my hips

218
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:21,960
in Han me my feet are underneath my hips
 

219
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,990
in Han me my feet are underneath my hips
okay most people do Kam because that's

220
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,000
okay most people do Kam because that's
 

221
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,469
okay most people do Kam because that's
the only way they get the bracing angle

222
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:27,479
the only way they get the bracing angle
 

223
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:32,189
the only way they get the bracing angle
is he's he's pushing on me

224
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:32,199

 

225
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,469

but if I can ground one leg's enough

226
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:35,479
but if I can ground one leg's enough
 

227
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,510
but if I can ground one leg's enough
doesn't matter so H me is definitely

228
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
doesn't matter so H me is definitely
 

229
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,230
doesn't matter so H me is definitely
enough okay so don't start in Kam

230
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:41,240
enough okay so don't start in Kam
 

231
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,110
enough okay so don't start in Kam
because then your ademia is really small

232
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,120
because then your ademia is really small
 

233
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,510
because then your ademia is really small
so your displacement is small so the

234
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:46,520
so your displacement is small so the
 

235
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,710
so your displacement is small so the
exercise is shorter so the cultivation

236
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:49,720
exercise is shorter so the cultivation
 

237
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,869
exercise is shorter so the cultivation
in in regards to the adaptation is

238
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:51,879
in in regards to the adaptation is
 

239
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,110
in in regards to the adaptation is
smaller it would be like if doing bench

240
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,120
smaller it would be like if doing bench
 

241
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,469
smaller it would be like if doing bench

pressure so but it's the same thing so I

280
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:52,920
pressure so but it's the same thing so I
 

281
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,430
pressure so but it's the same thing so I
not only have the distance I get between

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
not only have the distance I get between
 

283
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,630
not only have the distance I get between
my legs but I have the distance as I

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
exaggerated for now elbow
 

293
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,710
exaggerated for now elbow
in this is too late I'm below my hand

294
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:15,720
in this is too late I'm below my hand
 

295
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,230
in this is too late I'm below my hand
okay again if you have relaxed power

296
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
okay again if you have relaxed power
 

297
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,430
okay again if you have relaxed power
it'll work but it's not the exercise you

298
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
it'll work but it's not the exercise you

I have to figure out we go we're going

302
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
I have to figure out we go we're going
 

303
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,030
I have to figure out we go we're going
to kind of game it as I come

304
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,040
to kind of game it as I come
 

305
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,150
to kind of game it as I come
in coming

306
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
in coming
 

307
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,150
in coming
in here you can see that my weight is

308
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
in here you can see that my weight is
 

309
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,949
in here you can see that my weight is
now on top of that hand and the knee is

310
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:43,959
now on top of that hand and the knee is
 

311
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:50,350
now on top of that hand and the knee is
at its full y face then my hand can

312
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:50,360

 

313
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,269

drop so I'm not going to go here y face

314
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:54,279
drop so I'm not going to go here y face
 

315
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,350
drop so I'm not going to go here y face
that's going to be just hand with no

316
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:56,360
that's going to be just hand with no
 

317
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,670
that's going to be just hand with no
relaxed power you're going to want to

318
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
relaxed power you're going to want to
 

319
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,990
relaxed power you're going to want to
pull your elbow down okay

320
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000

 

321
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,750

so time

322
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760

 

323
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,030

it it's from straight angle to Young

324
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
it it's from straight angle to Young
 

325
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,770
it it's from straight angle to Young
line that's your

326
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:14,780
line that's your
 

327
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:28,030
line that's your
[Music]

328
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,040

 

329
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:51,550

timing

330
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:51,560

 

331
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,990

different that was more heavy hand and

332
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,000
different that was more heavy hand and
 

333
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,629
different that was more heavy hand and
the timy all right let's try

334
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:56,639
the timy all right let's try
 

335
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,389
the timy all right let's try
it you'll get your grips cool and you

336
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
it you'll get your grips cool and you
 

337
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,190
it you'll get your grips cool and you
come over you get your ribs okay so

338
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
come over you get your ribs okay so
 

339
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,110
come over you get your ribs okay so
there's all that pressure no I ground

340
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,120
there's all that pressure no I ground
