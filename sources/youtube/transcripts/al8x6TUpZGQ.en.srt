171
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,990
to the technique
rather than

172
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
rather than
 

173
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,030
rather than
him

174
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
him
 

175
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,470
him
being under

176
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
being under
 

177
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,390
being under
sort of pressure so now

178
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
sort of pressure so now
 

179
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,990
sort of pressure so now
so now you haven't got any string but

180
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
so now you haven't got any string but
 

181
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,990
so now you haven't got any string but
you've got a person who still weighs a

182
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
you've got a person who still weighs a
 

183
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,190
you've got a person who still weighs a
lot and do the sheer nag again

184
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
lot and do the sheer nag again
 

185
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,710
lot and do the sheer nag again
well you don't weigh that much but

186
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720

 

187
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,070

so he has to somehow work out

188
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
so he has to somehow work out
 

189
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,190
so he has to somehow work out
how he

190
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
how he
 

191
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,869
how he
goes that's better

192
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879

 

193
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,710

so we don't

194
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
so we don't
 

195
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,630
so we don't
um

196
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
um
 

197
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,670
um
we don't pin ourself

198
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
we don't pin ourself
 

199
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,990
we don't pin ourself
to the form and sometimes or most of the

200
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
to the form and sometimes or most of the
 

201
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,110
to the form and sometimes or most of the
time we do we go well it's there it's

202
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
time we do we go well it's there it's
 

203
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,990
time we do we go well it's there it's
there it's there and about and then

204
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
there it's there and about and then
 

205
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,390
there it's there and about and then
you'll see you'll hear what we call

206
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
you'll see you'll hear what we call
 

207
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,789
you'll see you'll hear what we call
unbendable arm then also this unbendable

208
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
unbendable arm then also this unbendable
 

209
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,309
unbendable arm then also this unbendable
arm gets to a bent arm and you're

210
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
arm gets to a bent arm and you're
 

211
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,310
arm gets to a bent arm and you're
getting shorter and some people can even

212
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
getting shorter and some people can even
 

213
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,629
getting shorter and some people can even
pull you back because

214
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
pull you back because
 

215
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,349
pull you back because
you are not realizing

216
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
you are not realizing
 

217
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,950
you are not realizing
and this technique you're doing i'm not

218
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
and this technique you're doing i'm not
 

219
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,110
and this technique you're doing i'm not
going to go into the depth of it but

220
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
going to go into the depth of it but
 

221
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,150
going to go into the depth of it but
when you

222
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
when you
 

223
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,670
when you
do that

224
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
do that
 

225
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,430
do that
when you do that

226
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
when you do that
 

227
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,950
when you do that
you're actually

228
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
you're actually
 

229
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,189
you're actually
not becoming supple enough you might

230
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
not becoming supple enough you might
 

231
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,270
not becoming supple enough you might
need to with your buttock you might need

232
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
need to with your buttock you might need
 

233
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,990
need to with your buttock you might need
to actually go into them a little bit

234
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
to actually go into them a little bit
 

235
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,150
to actually go into them a little bit
not giving anything you know so you

236
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
not giving anything you know so you
 

237
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,749
not giving anything you know so you
should be using the whole thing of

238
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
should be using the whole thing of
 

239
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,350
should be using the whole thing of
aikido you know people have been around

240
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
aikido you know people have been around
 

241
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,550
aikido you know people have been around
a long time you'll know you shouldn't uh

242
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560

 

243
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:56,469

i don't know what the word was um

244
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479

 

245
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,390

equilibrium yeah

246
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
equilibrium yeah
 

247
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,150
equilibrium yeah
balance equally you know

248
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
balance equally you know
 

249
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,390
balance equally you know
if i can see my hands

250
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
if i can see my hands
 

251
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,629
if i can see my hands
they need to be at the same distance if

252
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
they need to be at the same distance if
 

253
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,310
they need to be at the same distance if
that's where the distance is and i'll

254
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
that's where the distance is and i'll
 

255
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,909
that's where the distance is and i'll
bring it down here

256
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
bring it down here
 

257
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,070
bring it down here
then i haven't got aikido you know i've

258
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
then i haven't got aikido you know i've
 

259
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,590
then i haven't got aikido you know i've
got this what they call the unbendable

260
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
got this what they call the unbendable
 

261
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,070
got this what they call the unbendable
arm so if you're going to start off here

262
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
arm so if you're going to start off here
 

263
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,590
arm so if you're going to start off here
you might have to move into them

264
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
you might have to move into them
 

265
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,110
you might have to move into them
uh

266
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
uh
 

267
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,790
uh
if you're training with someone this

268
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
if you're training with someone this
 

269
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,629
if you're training with someone this
high and you're this high

270
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
high and you're this high
 

271
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,510
high and you're this high
forget she's an aggie it can't work oh

272
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
forget she's an aggie it can't work oh
 

273
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,230
forget she's an aggie it can't work oh
i'll bend my knees i'll be really good

274
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
i'll bend my knees i'll be really good
 

275
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,830
i'll bend my knees i'll be really good
it doesn't fit

276
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
it doesn't fit
 

277
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,670
it doesn't fit
it doesn't work

278
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
it doesn't work
 

279
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,469
it doesn't work
you need to only do sheer naggies really

280
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
you need to only do sheer naggies really
 

281
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,710
you need to only do sheer naggies really
on you know you might go bell and then

282
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
on you know you might go bell and then
 

283
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,870
on you know you might go bell and then
when they get up you go oh blimey

284
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
when they get up you go oh blimey
 

285
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,749
when they get up you go oh blimey

go and find somebody else
 

289
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,430
go and find somebody else
all right so but if you can get somebody

290
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
all right so but if you can get somebody
 

291
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,390
all right so but if you can get somebody
similar height then you can do this a

292
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
similar height then you can do this a
 

293
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,629
similar height then you can do this a
shinagi all right so i'd like to just

294
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
shinagi all right so i'd like to just
 

295
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,950
shinagi all right so i'd like to just
switch now into the shia nagi

296
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
switch now into the shia nagi
 

297
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,950
switch now into the shia nagi
and see if you can keep

298
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
and see if you can keep
 

299
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,710
and see if you can keep
your arms

300

your arms
 

301
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,350
your arms
seeing your arms at the distance

302
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
seeing your arms at the distance
 

303
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,189
seeing your arms at the distance
and remember it's no good trying to see

304
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
and remember it's no good trying to see
 

305
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,029
and remember it's no good trying to see
your arms by dragging them around the

306
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
your arms by dragging them around the
 

307
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,110
your arms by dragging them around the
mat with you

308
