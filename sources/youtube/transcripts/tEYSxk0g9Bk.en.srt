00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:04,560
and
 

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,430
and
relaxing releasing particularly the calf

00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440
relaxing releasing particularly the calf
 

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,390
relaxing releasing particularly the calf
muscle

00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,400
muscle
 

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,390
muscle
as as he's starting to get the ground

8
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
as as he's starting to get the ground
 

9
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,470
as as he's starting to get the ground
vector as i'm starting to establish the

10
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480
vector as i'm starting to establish the
 

11
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,070
vector as i'm starting to establish the
ground vector on the back foot

12
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
ground vector on the back foot
 

13
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,710
ground vector on the back foot
come on don't loosen up okay i try to

14
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
come on don't loosen up okay i try to
 

15
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,870
come on don't loosen up okay i try to
relax that back flow

16
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:18,880
relax that back flow
 

17
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,790
relax that back flow
next drill we came on both sides of the

18
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
next drill we came on both sides of the
 

19
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,189
next drill we came on both sides of the
body you can put more pressure on me

20
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
body you can put more pressure on me
 

21
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,670
body you can put more pressure on me
and i'm gonna do the same thing release

22
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
and i'm gonna do the same thing release
 

23
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,230
and i'm gonna do the same thing release
as as the back foot is getting weighted

24
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,240
as as the back foot is getting weighted
 

25
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,990
as as the back foot is getting weighted
release the calf muscle

26
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000

 

27
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,150

and then the next drill was to walk

28
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,160
and then the next drill was to walk
 

29
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,790
and then the next drill was to walk
with that same releasing skill so

30
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
with that same releasing skill so
 

31
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,389
with that same releasing skill so
release

32
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
release
 

33
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,590
release
release the cap release the calf cap

34
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600

 

35
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,750

uh obviously this is not it

36
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
uh obviously this is not it
 

37
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,590
uh obviously this is not it
and this forward is just bracing

38
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
and this forward is just bracing
 

39
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,069
and this forward is just bracing
but if you want to move forward even

40
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
but if you want to move forward even
 

41
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,750
but if you want to move forward even
establishing

42
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
establishing
 

43
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,590
establishing
the yang on the next foot and then going

44
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
the yang on the next foot and then going
 

45
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,630
the yang on the next foot and then going
isn't quite the same thing so

46
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
isn't quite the same thing so
 

47
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,670
isn't quite the same thing so
uh i could be like this he's pushing

48
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
uh i could be like this he's pushing
 

49
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,469
uh i could be like this he's pushing
and i could walk like this he still

50
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
and i could walk like this he still
 

51
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,270
and i could walk like this he still
can't stop

52
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
can't stop
 

53
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,510
can't stop
the pain

54
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520

 

55
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,270

okay so remember

56
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
okay so remember
 

57
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,429
okay so remember
the young foot bringing the knees to the

58
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
the young foot bringing the knees to the
 

59
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,710
the young foot bringing the knees to the
toe

60
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
toe
 

61
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,710
toe
and then establishing the ground vector

62
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
and then establishing the ground vector
 

63
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,870
and then establishing the ground vector
now on the front foot

64
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880
now on the front foot
 

65
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,670
now on the front foot
is a phase but it's a beginner phase

66
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
is a phase but it's a beginner phase
 

67
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,990
is a phase but it's a beginner phase
okay so if you want

68
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
okay so if you want
 

69
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,109
okay so if you want
your movement is just he's pushing

70
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
your movement is just he's pushing
 

71
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,910
your movement is just he's pushing
your movement is just natural

72
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920

 

73
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,350

hence my demonstration that i can stand

74
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
hence my demonstration that i can stand
 

75
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,710
hence my demonstration that i can stand
straight

76
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
straight
 

77
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,069
straight
i could even lean backwards to show

78
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
i could even lean backwards to show
 

79
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,590
i could even lean backwards to show
i don't need to do this okay

80
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
i don't need to do this okay
 

81
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,270
i don't need to do this okay
all right let's go okay so

82
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
all right let's go okay so
 

83
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,550
all right let's go okay so
um

84
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560

 

85
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,870

what you're trying to do up till now is

86
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
what you're trying to do up till now is
 

87
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,389
what you're trying to do up till now is
not push on him

88
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
not push on him
 

89
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,070
not push on him
to let his energy go by okay

90
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
to let his energy go by okay
 

91
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,990
to let his energy go by okay
so i'm not bracing against him

92
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000

 

93
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,710

so already his energy is passing through

94
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
so already his energy is passing through
 

95
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,430
so already his energy is passing through
me so

96
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
me so
 

97
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,750
me so
technically as he as he weighs my back

98
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
technically as he as he weighs my back
 

99
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,430
technically as he as he weighs my back
foot his energy is going past me

100
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
foot his energy is going past me
 

101
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,350
foot his energy is going past me
so technically i am not pushing against

102
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
so technically i am not pushing against
 

103
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,390
so technically i am not pushing against
his energy

104
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
his energy
 

105
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,869
his energy
otherwise it would not go down on the

106
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
otherwise it would not go down on the
 

107
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,509
otherwise it would not go down on the
ground

108
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
ground
 

109
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,430
ground
so technically i'm already in a state of

110
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:38,440
so technically i'm already in a state of
 

111
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,350
so technically i'm already in a state of
non-contestation

112
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
non-contestation
 

113
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,470
non-contestation
this is the more sophisticated form as

114
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
this is the more sophisticated form as
 

115
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,150
this is the more sophisticated form as
opposed to he's coming in

116
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
opposed to he's coming in
 

117
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,350
opposed to he's coming in
and usually that's non-contestation too

118
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
and usually that's non-contestation too
 

119
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,670
and usually that's non-contestation too
because his energy's going young and i

120
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
because his energy's going young and i
 

121
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,710
because his energy's going young and i
go yin

122
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
go yin
 

123
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,630
go yin
true

124
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640

 

125
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,589

but if you keep it yang and yin aspects

126
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
but if you keep it yang and yin aspects
 

127
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,790
but if you keep it yang and yin aspects
or perspective

128
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
or perspective
 

129
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,670
or perspective
the same thing's happening here his

130
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
the same thing's happening here his
 

131
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,589
the same thing's happening here his
energy is going through me that

132
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
energy is going through me that
 

133
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,830
energy is going through me that
that's why i don't need and i don't need

134
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
that's why i don't need and i don't need
 

135
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,110
that's why i don't need and i don't need
anything push

136
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
anything push
 

137
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,830
anything push
i don't need anything don't don't need

138
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
i don't need anything don't don't need
 

139
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,350
i don't need anything don't don't need
the other leg

140
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
the other leg
 

141
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,390
the other leg
that's why i can walk like this he's not

142
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
that's why i can walk like this he's not
 

143
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,149
that's why i can walk like this he's not
pushing on me

144
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
pushing on me
 

145
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,990
pushing on me
he's pushing on the ground you could do

146
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
he's pushing on the ground you could do
 

147
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,509
he's pushing on the ground you could do
whatever

148
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519

 

149
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,869

so now we'll go into tenshi nage and i'm

150
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
so now we'll go into tenshi nage and i'm
 

151
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,229
so now we'll go into tenshi nage and i'm
not doing an

152
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
not doing an
 

153
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,750
not doing an
external non-contestation because

154
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
external non-contestation because
 

155
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,270
external non-contestation because
here as you go young

156
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
here as you go young
 

157
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,229
here as you go young
you're keeping him out which is what we

158
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
you're keeping him out which is what we
 

159
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,430
you're keeping him out which is what we
usually do

160
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
usually do
 

161
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,110
usually do
so we keep him out boom and then

162
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120

 

163
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,390

so i'm gonna do the same walking drill

164
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
so i'm gonna do the same walking drill
 

165
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,030
so i'm gonna do the same walking drill
keep the same internal non-contest

166
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
keep the same internal non-contest
 

167
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,750
keep the same internal non-contest
station

168
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
station
 

169
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,390
station
and you'll see how he comes really far

170
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
and you'll see how he comes really far
 

171
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,030
and you'll see how he comes really far
forward

172
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
forward
 

173
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,550
forward
you see that's what we're testing
