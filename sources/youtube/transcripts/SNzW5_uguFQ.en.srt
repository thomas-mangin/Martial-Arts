00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,080
I am very grateful to see that so many people gathered today

2
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:34,640
to celebrate together this Kagamibiraki of the Aikikai Hombu Dojo.

3
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,440
Last year, many events occurred in our society,

4
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:48,040
but thanks to everyone of you, Aikido could continue to evolve in the right direction.

5
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,680
Aikido has spread tremendously and it is now present in 130 countries.

6
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:12,120
I think that it is the pursuit of the dynamic created by the founder Morihei Ueshiba and continued by the second Doshu, Kisshomaru Ueshiba,

7
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:27,320
supported by your sincerity in practice, which has allowed the creation of such harmony.

8
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:41,440
I think that our duty is to keep this spirit in mind while training dutifully every day,

9
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,640
and in our own measure, contribute to the evolution of society by infusing it with the values carried by Aikido.

10
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,480
To do so, we must practice sincerely every day, and move forward while looking ahead.

11
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,560
Let's practice together in that spirit.

12
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,520
So are my wishes for 2015. Thank you all.
