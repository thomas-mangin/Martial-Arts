1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,670

so we did this first he pushes

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:05,680
so we did this first he pushes
 

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,110
so we did this first he pushes
remember he's just pushing

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,120

 

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,789

the eyes pushing on you do you see that

6
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:12,799
the eyes pushing on you do you see that
 

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,070
the eyes pushing on you do you see that
remember and you felt the two uh

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
remember and you felt the two uh
 

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,310
remember and you felt the two uh
resistance the first one was the brace

10
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
resistance the first one was the brace
 

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,830
resistance the first one was the brace
right here as you braced

12
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
right here as you braced
 

13
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,750
right here as you braced
and the second one was when you felt

14
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
and the second one was when you felt
 

15
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,349
and the second one was when you felt
your balance go whoa

16
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
your balance go whoa
 

17
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,269
your balance go whoa
that's where your ego tripartite kicks

18
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
that's where your ego tripartite kicks
 

19
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,429
that's where your ego tripartite kicks
in so you have dichotomous

20
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:27,439
in so you have dichotomous
 

21
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,070
in so you have dichotomous
experience of the rule he's trying to

22
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
experience of the rule he's trying to
 

23
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,470
experience of the rule he's trying to
get

24
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
get
 

25
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,350
get
me and then your will to power kicks in

26
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
me and then your will to power kicks in
 

27
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,030
me and then your will to power kicks in
life will be a lot better if i get him

28
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
life will be a lot better if i get him
 

29
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,069
life will be a lot better if i get him
that's still dichotomous okay but

30
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
that's still dichotomous okay but
 

31
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,670
that's still dichotomous okay but
instead as he's going in i'm just

32
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
instead as he's going in i'm just
 

33
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,910
instead as he's going in i'm just
letting that hand go live no

34
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
letting that hand go live no
 

35
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,549

contestation on his hand
 

37
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,110
contestation on his hand
so if you pay attention when he goes you

38

go like this
and that's what's taking it off

42
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
and that's what's taking it off
 

43
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,229
and that's what's taking it off
so i go inside this hand i let him push

stay here
 

49
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,510
stay here
that's my contestation if i move with

50
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
that's my contestation if i move with
 

51
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,950
that's my contestation if i move with
his push

52
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
his push

okay now find the x pattern

114
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
okay now find the x pattern
 

115
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,030
okay now find the x pattern
you you find it shout it out where is it

116
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
you you find it shout it out where is it
 

117
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,430
you you find it shout it out where is it
the first arm leads the head in the way

118
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
the first arm leads the head in the way
 

119
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,710
the first arm leads the head in the way
it was originally going

120
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
it was originally going
 

121
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,030
it was originally going
the chest hand arm is going to project

122
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
the chest hand arm is going to project
 

123
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,830
the chest hand arm is going to project
over the hip

124
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
over the hip
 

125
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,589
over the hip
across i'm going to say not quite

126
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
across i'm going to say not quite
 

127
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,229
across i'm going to say not quite
your right hand is going to project his

128
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
your right hand is going to project his
 

129
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,270
your right hand is going to project his
where's the left arm going

130
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
where's the left arm going
 

131
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,309
where's the left arm going
around all right where's the

132
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
around all right where's the
 

133
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,830
around all right where's the
shoulder hand going crossing across

134
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
shoulder hand going crossing across
 

135
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,790
shoulder hand going crossing across
okay so this arm is going like this your

136
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
okay so this arm is going like this your
 

137
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,830
okay so this arm is going like this your
foot

138
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
foot
 

139
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,869
foot
this arm's going like this

140
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879

 

141
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,270

he goes take the foot and this hand is

142
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
he goes take the foot and this hand is
 

143
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,869
he goes take the foot and this hand is
going like that

144
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879

 

145
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,070

so this has gone here it starts to bring

146
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
so this has gone here it starts to bring
 

147
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,670
so this has gone here it starts to bring
it around

148
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680

 

149
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,149

then this shoulder arm goes this way

150
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159

 

151
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,789

so i combine the two

152
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
so i combine the two
 

153
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:57,110
so i combine the two
across

154
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120

 

155
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,760

two okay try it again
