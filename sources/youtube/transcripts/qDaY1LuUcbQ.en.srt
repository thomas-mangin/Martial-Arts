thinking
 

9
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,950
thinking
is hip rotation

10
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
is hip rotation
 

11
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,950
is hip rotation
that's what she's thinking okay

12
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:16,960
that's what she's thinking okay
 

13

15
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,550

who can guess what's gonna happen when i

16
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560
who can guess what's gonna happen when i
 

17
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:35,590
who can guess what's gonna happen when i
add resistance to this line

18
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600

 

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,750

do you see do you see that

do you see that okay why is that
happening

24
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920

 

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,110

what is newton's law about

26
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
what is newton's law about
 

27
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,389
what is newton's law about
the force going that way and i have this

28
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
the force going that way and i have this
 

29
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,670
the force going that way and i have this
opposite equal angle right

30
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
opposite equal angle right
 

31
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,389
opposite equal angle right
she has no base over here you see that

32
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
she has no base over here you see that
 

33
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,229
she has no base over here you see that
so she goes

34
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
so she goes
 

35
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,350
so she goes
she has no base over here we got that

36
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
she has no base over here we got that
 

37
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,510
she has no base over here we got that
so as she goes into his

38
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
so as she goes into his
 

39
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,230
so as she goes into his
technique with that you can and you're

40
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
technique with that you can and you're
 

41
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,149
technique with that you can and you're
gonna go slow

42
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
gonna go slow
 

43
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,990
gonna go slow
you're gonna step into this foot you're

you're gonna step into this foot you're
 

45
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,990
you're gonna step into this foot you're
gonna put it back you see

46
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
gonna put it back you see
 

47
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,270
gonna put it back you see
so what's happening now as you go just

121
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,190

see it'll work it's big man aikido

122
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
see it'll work it's big man aikido
 

123
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,190
see it'll work it's big man aikido
um he can generate enough force

124
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
um he can generate enough force
 

125
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,229
um he can generate enough force
to overcome her resistance okay

126

okay you got it because there's a rule

144
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
okay you got it because there's a rule
 

145
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,550
okay you got it because there's a rule
here

146
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
here
 

147
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,910
here
where a guy is pushing i

148
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
where a guy is pushing i
 

149
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,949
where a guy is pushing i
turn okay so

150
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
turn okay so
 

151
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,670
turn okay so
if you reverse engineered the technique

152
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
if you reverse engineered the technique
 

153
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,309
if you reverse engineered the technique
i was

154
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
i was
 

155
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,070
i was
turning then by default we know uke was

156
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
turning then by default we know uke was
 

157
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,789
turning then by default we know uke was
what

158
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
what
 

159
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,830
what
we're pushing okay um

160
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840
we're pushing okay um
 

161
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,509
we're pushing okay um
so uh okay is going to push

162
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
so uh okay is going to push
 

163
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,470
so uh okay is going to push
and let's just use the same uh weird

164
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
and let's just use the same uh weird
 

165
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,509
and let's just use the same uh weird
foot maneuver

166
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
foot maneuver
 

167
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,470
foot maneuver
where i separate my feet okay so i go

168
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
where i separate my feet okay so i go
 

169
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,350
where i separate my feet okay so i go
like this

170
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
like this
 

171
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,070
like this
and i go like this and then uk is gonna

172
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
and i go like this and then uk is gonna
 

173
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,949
and i go like this and then uk is gonna
push

174
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
push
 

175
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,469
push
and i'm going to absorb that

176
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
and i'm going to absorb that
 

177
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,390
and i'm going to absorb that
go in the turn okay

178
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
go in the turn okay
 

179
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,790
go in the turn okay
that's where i just want to try that now

180
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
that's where i just want to try that now
 

181
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,510
that's where i just want to try that now
uke

182
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
uke
 

183
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,629
uke
is going to push

184
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
is going to push
 

185
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,550
is going to push
in the turn i'm going to try to get it

186
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
in the turn i'm going to try to get it
 

187
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:30,950
in the turn i'm going to try to get it
down

188
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
down
 

189
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,189
down
again okay let's do that experiment

190
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
again okay let's do that experiment
 

191
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,230
again okay let's do that experiment
so i'm doing the technique i take this

192
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
so i'm doing the technique i take this
 

193
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,830
so i'm doing the technique i take this
down skirt you see it

194
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
down skirt you see it
 

195
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,870
down skirt you see it
okay now he pushes

196
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
okay now he pushes
 

197
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,150
okay now he pushes
and then i have some energy that i could

198
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
and then i have some energy that i could
 

199
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,670
and then i have some energy that i could
at least

200
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
at least
 

201
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,070
at least
deal with some of his mass you got the

202
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
deal with some of his mass you got the
 

203
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,110
deal with some of his mass you got the
idea

204
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
idea
 

205
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,030
idea
okay but let's understand

206
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
okay but let's understand
 

207
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,110
okay but let's understand
the engineering need for ura

208
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
the engineering need for ura
 

209
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,029
the engineering need for ura
so when he pushes and i go

210
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
so when he pushes and i go
 

211
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,950
so when he pushes and i go
here where is he supposed to push

212
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
here where is he supposed to push
 

213
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,710
here where is he supposed to push
into me not around

214
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
into me not around
 

215
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,629
into me not around
okay so his angle goes here

216
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639

 

217
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,270

now i'm gonna he can go slow make sure

218
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
now i'm gonna he can go slow make sure
 

219
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,790
now i'm gonna he can go slow make sure
you're not going around me

220
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
you're not going around me
 

221
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,870
you're not going around me
he's pushing into me and i'm

222
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
he's pushing into me and i'm
 

223
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,870
he's pushing into me and i'm
trying to do the technique now okay

224
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
trying to do the technique now okay
 

225
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,710
trying to do the technique now okay
i go this thing

226
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
i go this thing
 

227
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,830
i go this thing
pushes into me

228
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840

 

229
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,670

it's not going to go around me like i

230
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
it's not going to go around me like i
 

231
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,950
it's not going to go around me like i
think he is

232
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
think he is
 

233
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,629
think he is
okay so uh

234
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
okay so uh
 

235
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,590
okay so uh
you'll be doing that as you can okay so

236
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
you'll be doing that as you can okay so
 

237
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,350
you'll be doing that as you can okay so
the first time you were just here you're

238
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
the first time you were just here you're
 

239
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,390
the first time you were just here you're
going like no

240
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
going like no
 

241
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,510
going like no
okay we'll give some energy but we give

242
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
okay we'll give some energy but we give
 

243
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,070
okay we'll give some energy but we give
the right

244
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
the right
 

245
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,350
the right
energy and the right energy is not

246
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
energy and the right energy is not
 

247
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,909
energy and the right energy is not
around

248
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919
around
 

249
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,189
around
him

250
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199

 

251
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,309

the right energy is into him

252
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319

 

253
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,830

okay try it yeah okay

254
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
okay try it yeah okay
 

255
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,029
okay try it yeah okay
let's make the next experiment when a

256
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
let's make the next experiment when a
 

257
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,550
let's make the next experiment when a
guy is coming

258
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
guy is coming
 

259
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,110
guy is coming
in to me he has ill intent

260
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
in to me he has ill intent
 

261
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,550
in to me he has ill intent
okay either to counter my maneuver or to

262
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
okay either to counter my maneuver or to
 

263
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,749
okay either to counter my maneuver or to
attack me

264
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
attack me
 

265
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,270
attack me
okay um

266
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280

 

267
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,230

but here's what happens some people come

268
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
but here's what happens some people come
 

269
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,350
but here's what happens some people come
in

270
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
in
 

271
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,230
in
leave their feet there don't move your

272
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
leave their feet there don't move your
 

273
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,350
leave their feet there don't move your
feet

274
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
feet
 

275
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,950
feet
it can't move okay but he kind of comes

276
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
it can't move okay but he kind of comes
 

277
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,909
it can't move okay but he kind of comes
in

278
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919

 

279
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,830

then it'll work okay

280
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840

 

281
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,070

it looks like it's going to work but why

282
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
it looks like it's going to work but why
 

283
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,870
it looks like it's going to work but why
does it work

284
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
does it work
 

285
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,870
does it work
because he didn't move his feet he

286
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
because he didn't move his feet he
 

287
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,469
because he didn't move his feet he
doesn't move his feet

288
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479

 

289
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,550

looks like it'll work okay

290
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560

 

291
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,990

instead let's just uh look at

292
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
instead let's just uh look at
 

293
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,270
instead let's just uh look at
why i come in so as i did the first

294
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
why i come in so as i did the first
 

295
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,469
why i come in so as i did the first
experiment and he tries to turn and here

296
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
experiment and he tries to turn and here
 

297
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,550
experiment and he tries to turn and here
i was resisting

298
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
i was resisting
 

299
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,990
i was resisting
right there's not a very

300
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
right there's not a very
 

301
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,070
right there's not a very
good resisting angle so we want a better

302
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
good resisting angle so we want a better
 

303
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,430
good resisting angle so we want a better
resisting angle

304
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
resisting angle
 

305
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,309
resisting angle
and that is achieved go ahead by coming

306
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
and that is achieved go ahead by coming
 

307
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,430
and that is achieved go ahead by coming
in

308
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
in
 

309
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,270
in
to him you see he tries to do the

310
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
to him you see he tries to do the
 

311
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,270
to him you see he tries to do the
technique he's even weaker

312
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
technique he's even weaker
 

313
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,270
technique he's even weaker
so he's even weaker

314
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
so he's even weaker
 

315
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,990
so he's even weaker
okay uh so when i come in

316
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
okay uh so when i come in
 

317
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,110
okay uh so when i come in
i want to put my feet under

318
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120

 

319
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,990

not leave him behind and let him stretch

320
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
not leave him behind and let him stretch
 

321
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,309
not leave him behind and let him stretch
you

322
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319

 

323
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,790

so he goes i come in

324
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
so he goes i come in
 

325
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,790
so he goes i come in
get out of the way and i just move

326
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
get out of the way and i just move
 

327
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,790
get out of the way and i just move
he's never gonna get it okay

328
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
he's never gonna get it okay
 

329
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,869
he's never gonna get it okay
that's why we come in i'm resisting

330
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
that's why we come in i'm resisting
 

331
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,749
that's why we come in i'm resisting
in a mechanically sound way posting my

332
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
in a mechanically sound way posting my
 

333
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,710
in a mechanically sound way posting my
legs

334
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
legs
 

335
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,150
legs
and keep moving forward okay so go

336
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
and keep moving forward okay so go
 

337
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,909
and keep moving forward okay so go
towards him

338
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
towards him
 

339
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,550
towards him
bring your feet with you don't leave

340
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
bring your feet with you don't leave
 

341
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,909
bring your feet with you don't leave
your feet there

342
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
your feet there
 

343
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,869
your feet there
and go towards him okay try it now let's

344
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
and go towards him okay try it now let's
 

345
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,469
and go towards him okay try it now let's
look at

346
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
look at
 

347
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,630
look at
something that you might be thinking

348
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640

 

349
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,149

if he could get the elbow under him

350
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
if he could get the elbow under him
 

351
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,949
if he could get the elbow under him
then he could be stronger and get me

352
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
then he could be stronger and get me
 

353
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,550
then he could be stronger and get me
down well that's a big if

354
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
down well that's a big if
 

355
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,110
down well that's a big if
because if i keep moving he can't get

356
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
because if i keep moving he can't get
 

357
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,630
because if i keep moving he can't get
the elbow under him

358
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
the elbow under him
 

359
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,670
the elbow under him
okay but let's allow it

360
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
okay but let's allow it
 

361
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,870
okay but let's allow it
i came in you see my elbow turn around

362
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880

 

363
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,790

put it right under you separate your

364
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
put it right under you separate your
 

365
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,870
put it right under you separate your
feet put your foot back

366
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
feet put your foot back
 

367
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,870
feet put your foot back
that's our style there you go okay

368
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
that's our style there you go okay
 

369
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,230
that's our style there you go okay
and he's going to push down

370
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240

 

371
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,430

he's got to overcome the leg see go

372
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
he's got to overcome the leg see go
 

373
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,790
he's got to overcome the leg see go
ahead

374
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
ahead
 

375
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,310
ahead
so let's say i go here go ahead

376
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
so let's say i go here go ahead
 

377
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,509
so let's say i go here go ahead
go ahead he he can't because the legs

378
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
go ahead he he can't because the legs
 

379
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,389
go ahead he he can't because the legs
the legs are just too strong for his

380
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
the legs are just too strong for his
 

381
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,990
the legs are just too strong for his
size to me

382
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
size to me
 

383
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,990
size to me
okay someone may be a little smaller

384
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
okay someone may be a little smaller
 

385
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,110
okay someone may be a little smaller
he could maybe do it but again that's

386
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
he could maybe do it but again that's
 

387
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,790
he could maybe do it but again that's
not jiu-jitsu

388
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
not jiu-jitsu
 

389
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,070
not jiu-jitsu
let alone it's not aikido okay

390
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
let alone it's not aikido okay
 

391
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,829
let alone it's not aikido okay
overpowering is not what we're doing

392
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:34,839
overpowering is not what we're doing
 

393
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,710
overpowering is not what we're doing
okay

394
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
okay
 

395
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,710
okay
all this comes from

396
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720

 

397
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,750

this this

398
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
this this
 

399
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,590
this this
this footwork okay

400
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600

 

401
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,710

we don't want that footwork we want to

402
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
we don't want that footwork we want to
 

403
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,389
we don't want that footwork we want to
be right here

404
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
be right here
 

405
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,389
be right here
right here feet underneath me

406
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
right here feet underneath me
 

407
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,310
right here feet underneath me
okay so let's have him

408
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
okay so let's have him
 

409
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,750
okay so let's have him
come in feed underneath me he goes

410
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760

 

411
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,470

i'm just gonna move it around he's not

412
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
i'm just gonna move it around he's not
 

413
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,750
i'm just gonna move it around he's not
going around

414
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760

 

415
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,590

okay right behind his elbow he comes in

416
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
okay right behind his elbow he comes in
 

417
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,710
okay right behind his elbow he comes in
you see he's not going around he comes

418
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
you see he's not going around he comes
 

419
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,590
you see he's not going around he comes
in

420
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600

 

421
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,150

to make him go around

422
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160

 

423
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,430

boom stay here

424
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
boom stay here
 

425
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:44,829
boom stay here
when you feel this just maybe

426
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839

 

427
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,630

okay

428
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640

 

429
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,750

okay try it okay so there now

430
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:51,760
okay try it okay so there now
 

431
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,990
okay try it okay so there now
has to be a skill set it's another

432
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,000
has to be a skill set it's another
 

433
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,509
has to be a skill set it's another
internal skill

434
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
internal skill
 

435
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,910
internal skill
okay um let's say he's pushing on me

436
00:10:59,910 --> 00:10:59,920
okay um let's say he's pushing on me
 

437
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,389
okay um let's say he's pushing on me
you're

438
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
you're
 

439
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,389
you're
really pushing you often look like

440
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
really pushing you often look like
 

441
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,430
really pushing you often look like
you're not pushing

442
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
you're not pushing
 

443
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,350
you're not pushing
people people don't realize how much

444
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
people people don't realize how much
 

445
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,310
people people don't realize how much
energy there is okay

446
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320

 

447
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,509

so he's pushing and i'm going to get the

448
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
so he's pushing and i'm going to get the
 

449
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:13,990
so he's pushing and i'm going to get the
ground

450
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
ground
 

451
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,269
ground
vector but not in a bracing angle

452
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
vector but not in a bracing angle
 

453
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,230
vector but not in a bracing angle
he's pushing and you won't push long so

454
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
he's pushing and you won't push long so
 

455
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,509
he's pushing and you won't push long so
drive okay

456
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
drive okay
 

457
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,069
drive okay
and i don't need the front foot for that

458
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
and i don't need the front foot for that
 

459
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,230
and i don't need the front foot for that
he's grounding the front the back foot

460
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
he's grounding the front the back foot
 

461
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,150
he's grounding the front the back foot
do you see those

462
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
do you see those
 

463
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,990
do you see those
since i don't have a bracing angle it's

464
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
since i don't have a bracing angle it's
 

465
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,910
since i don't have a bracing angle it's
just a ground path

466
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
just a ground path
 

467
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,069
just a ground path
just a ground path it doesn't matter

468
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
just a ground path it doesn't matter
 

469
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,069
just a ground path it doesn't matter
what my other foot is do

470
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
what my other foot is do
 

471
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,269
what my other foot is do
okay so

472
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
okay so
 

473
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,030
okay so
when i go to this technique

474
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
when i go to this technique
 

475
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,150
when i go to this technique
if i can't take that energy into the

476
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
if i can't take that energy into the
 

477
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,190
if i can't take that energy into the
ground

478
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
ground
 

479
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,310
ground
what happens is my axis of rotation

480
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
what happens is my axis of rotation
 

481
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,269
what happens is my axis of rotation
starts to get thrown backwards as i push

482
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
starts to get thrown backwards as i push
 

483
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,550
starts to get thrown backwards as i push
him around

484
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
him around
 

485
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,110
him around
can you get it so as he's coming in

486
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
can you get it so as he's coming in
 

487
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,990
can you get it so as he's coming in
slower

488
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
slower
 

489
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,870
slower
he's coming into me and i'm attempting

490
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
he's coming into me and i'm attempting
 

491
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,470
he's coming into me and i'm attempting
to push him around

492
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
to push him around
 

493
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,629
to push him around
that energy is coming back to me if i

494
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:06,639
that energy is coming back to me if i
 

495
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,150
that energy is coming back to me if i
can't ground it it makes me move

496
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160

 

497
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,990

that's what you think why you put that

498
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
that's what you think why you put that
 

499
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,829
that's what you think why you put that
foot here

500
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
foot here
 

501
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,710
foot here
but that foot causes all those other

502
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:20,720
but that foot causes all those other
 

503
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,590
but that foot causes all those other
problems

504
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
problems
 

505
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,389
problems
as you try for the rotation

506
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399

 

507
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,389

so his energy that comes into me

508
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
so his energy that comes into me
 

509
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,670
so his energy that comes into me
keeps pushing it's all going into the

510
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
keeps pushing it's all going into the
 

511
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,389
keeps pushing it's all going into the
ground

512
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
ground
 

513
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,069
ground
keep going it's going into the ground

514
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
keep going it's going into the ground
 

515
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,829
keep going it's going into the ground
keep going it's going into the ground

516
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:41,839

see a little harder and that's what i

518
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
see a little harder and that's what i
 

519

537
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,430

well you can see

538
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440

 

539
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,670

that part's not important the ground

okay try it again

546
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
okay try it again
 

547
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,350
okay try it again
so maybe you got here

548
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
so maybe you got here
 

549
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,030
so maybe you got here
and then you want to put this underneath

550
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
and then you want to put this underneath
 

551
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,710
and then you want to put this underneath
you and do the other technique

552
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
you and do the other technique
 

553
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,069
you and do the other technique
where you're trying to overpower him but

554
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
where you're trying to overpower him but
 

555
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,470
where you're trying to overpower him but
he was coming into me and there's no

556
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,480
he was coming into me and there's no
 

557
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,150
he was coming into me and there's no
angle of deflection on this one

558
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160

559
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,269
angle of deflection on this one
you don't get on top you get close-up of

560
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
you don't get on top you get close-up of
 

561
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,069
you don't get on top you get close-up of
the hands

562
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
the hands
 

563
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,590
the hands
this is incorrect incorrect incorrect

564
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:49,600
this is incorrect incorrect incorrect
 

565
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,750
this is incorrect incorrect incorrect
if he was coming at you he's going to

566
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:51,760
if he was coming at you he's going to
 

567
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,430
if he was coming at you he's going to
still keep coming at you

568
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
still keep coming at you
 

569
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,350
still keep coming at you
okay so your deflection is

570
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
okay so your deflection is
 

571
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,990
okay so your deflection is
out out he's turned this way

572
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
out out he's turned this way
 

573
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,350
out out he's turned this way
here do you see out

574
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
here do you see out
 

575
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:13,829
here do you see out
not on top out

576
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839

 

577
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,670

boom we'll add the technique now

578
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
boom we'll add the technique now
 

579
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,870

he goes i'm going to find it even easier

584
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240

 

585
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:45,509

he goes

586
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
he goes
 

587
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,430
he goes
try it uh so as he goes

588
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,440
try it uh so as he goes
 

589
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,230
try it uh so as he goes
and he feels that going around he should

590
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240
and he feels that going around he should
 

591
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,230
and he feels that going around he should
try to get his foot in there

592
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
try to get his foot in there
 

593
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:02,550
try to get his foot in there
you see so i can't shut that thing down

594
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560

 

595
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,110

he doesn't leave his feet there and then

596
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,120
he doesn't leave his feet there and then
 

597
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,670
he doesn't leave his feet there and then
i go

598
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
i go
 

599
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,470
i go
and no

600
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480

 

601
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,069

he's trying to come in then he counters

602
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
he's trying to come in then he counters
 

603
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,710
he's trying to come in then he counters
do you see

604
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720

 

605
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,870

so the first thing i have to do is on

606
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880
so the first thing i have to do is on
 

607
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,790
so the first thing i have to do is on
the initial projection

608
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:22,800
the initial projection
 

609
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,069
the initial projection
is i turn with it so i keep facing

610
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
is i turn with it so i keep facing
 

611
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,590
is i turn with it so i keep facing
it

612
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,600

 

613
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,430

boom he's coming in

614
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
boom he's coming in
 

615
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,829
boom he's coming in
keep facing so i'm turning with

616
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:38,839
keep facing so i'm turning with
 

617
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:46,949
keep facing so i'm turning with

618
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959

 

619
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,189

you're going to then feel his foot so

620
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199
you're going to then feel his foot so
 

621
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,150
you're going to then feel his foot so
we'll go slow

622
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
we'll go slow
 

623
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,949
we'll go slow
that's his energy coming this way i make

624
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
that's his energy coming this way i make
 

625
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:53,990
that's his energy coming this way i make
it go out

626
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
it go out
 

627
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,749
it go out
and i'm going to feel that foot it's

628
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
and i'm going to feel that foot it's
 

629
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,829
and i'm going to feel that foot it's
going to push up on my elbow

630
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:57,839
going to push up on my elbow
 

631
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,190
going to push up on my elbow
okay when i feel that upward energy

632
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,200
okay when i feel that upward energy
 

633
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,470

637
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,110
that's what i keep lift it up you see
when i feel the upward energy that's

00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
when i feel the upward energy that's
 

639
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,150
when i feel the upward energy that's
what i think around again

640
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160

 

641
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,509

so the initial energy goes around

642
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
so the initial energy goes around
 

643
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:30,060
so the initial energy goes around
the upward energy goes around again
