Watch this video to master

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,720
Ushiro Ukemi.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,840
If you are a beginner, or struggling with\hushiro ukemi this is the video for you.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,519
In aikido, in many cases, we get thrown backwards,\hso first you have to learn how to deal with this\hsituation.

5
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,842
In this video I'm gonna show you how\hto do ushiro ukemi step by step, 

6
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:32,886
and then we are\h\hgonna show how to apply it in actual situations.

7
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:38,607
\hTo overcome the fear of falling backwards, I recommend you to first try this exercise.

8
00:00:38,607 --> 00:00:42,613
First, just\hsit down put your feet together and grab them.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,390
Bend your back a little\hbit and pull your chin down,

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,477
so you can roll back and sit up safely.

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,441
It also helps if you keep looking at your belly during this exercise.

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,731
The next one is a standard ushiro ukemi exercise\hin aikido,

13
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:16,331
one knee up and one knee down.

14
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,924
You can\hgrab your knees and we are gonna roll back and sit up.

15
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:27,177
Usually, I prefer to change side while\hmy feet are in the air

16
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:31,302
so here from left to right.

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,801
If your abs are strong enough you can also\htap the mat.

18
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:42,647
So when my right knee is up I'm going to use my right arm.

19
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:45,692
Tap the mat and change side.

20
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,464
The next one is from kneeling\hposition, something like this.

21
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:04,423
Keep your posture straight.

22
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,104
I'm gonna\hsit down.

23
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:11,378
Make sure that you don't sit\hon your foot like this because it can be dangerous.

24
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:18,139
Move your foot away, sit on the mat, roll\hyour back, pull your chin down, 

25
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,063
and everything\helse goes just like before.

26
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:25,841
Straight posture.

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,755
As I'm falling backward, I gradually bend my back.

28
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,663
Something like this.

29
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:42,138
After that you can try\hthis exercise from standing in a hanmi position.

30
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,511
You're going to stand on the line,

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,742
relax\hyour knees,

32
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:51,094
and first kneel down from the back knee,

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,444
something like this,

34
00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:56,252
bend your back a\hlittle bit keep watching your belly

35
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,595
and stand up.

36
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:03,890
Right hanmi to left hanmi position.

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,933
In actual techniques, we start the ukemi not from the back leg but from the front one.\h\h

38
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,358
So the next exercise is gonna be something\hlike this.

39
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,938
We're going to step back, kneel down, and ukemi.

40
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:32,735
Step back, kneel down, and ukemi.

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,304
Keep your posture straight,

42
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:41,304
start to bend your neck, chin down,

43
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,288
and execute the back background safely.

44
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:49,682
The next exercise is a little bit more advanced.

45
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:53,904
Make sure that you clear all the previous steps\hbefore trying this one

46
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,000
You can open from\hhanmi position, 

47
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:59,073
or start like this,

48
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:01,253
with your feet, shoulder\hwidth apart,

49
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:06,118
i'm gonna bend my knees, stretch a\h\hlittle bit backwards, 

50
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:09,432
when I reach my limit, when\hI start to lose my balance, 

51
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:12,907
I start the ushiro ukemi.

52
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,465
Okay something like this.\h

53
00:04:18,986 --> 00:04:22,023
Stretch, start to reach my limit,

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,840
and ushiro ukemi.

55
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,868
For the next exercise you're going to\hneed a partner have your bestie,

56
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,840
and first he's going push me softly, gently.

57
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,857
I want to absorb his energy\hand execute the ushiro ukemi safely.

58
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:55,840
If you get used to this\hmovement, you can increase the force.

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Try to absorb.

60
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,936
Something like this.

61
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:09,706
Now we are going to show\hyou how to apply this ukemi in actual techniques.

62
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:13,990
First from sumi otoshi katate dori (one-handed\h
grab). 

63
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,990
He's gonna step in and throw me backwards.

64
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,840
OK, other side.\h

65
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,153
Don't start the ukemi on your own, the\htiming is very important.

66
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:30,653
Don't be early like this.

67
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,680
You have to feel what's going on in the technique.

68
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:51,840
Keep your connection and start doing\hwhen you actually reach your limit.

69
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,240
