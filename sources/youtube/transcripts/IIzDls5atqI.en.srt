00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:45,590
I moved that's where her balance good
 

185
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:53,060
I moved that's where her balance good
right so I go back and I'm throwing her

higher than that so if you look at my

00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:57,899
higher than that so if you look at my
 

191
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,920
higher than that so if you look at my
foot it's about four inches off it's

back down and the more precarious your
 

201
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:22,130

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:39,480
bring the target down even like I was

won't start on the right so I think

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
won't start on the right so I think
 

209
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,460
won't start on the right so I think
probably at the beginning level we're

210
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:52,470
probably at the beginning level we're
 

211
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,289
probably at the beginning level we're
having some problems with weight

212
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:54,299
having some problems with weight
 

213
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,539
having some problems with weight
shifting so the beginner tends to move

214
00:17:58,539 --> 00:17:58,549
shifting so the beginner tends to move
 

215
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:02,870
shifting so the beginner tends to move
the foot before the weight has shifted I

00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:02,880
the foot before the weight has shifted I
 

217
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,180

don't mean beginner interpretive senses

218
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,190
don't mean beginner interpretive senses
 

219
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,140
don't mean beginner interpretive senses
I haven't figured that out so what

220
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,150
I haven't figured that out so what
 

221
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:18,780
I haven't figured that out so what
happens

222
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:18,790

 

223
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:25,810

and then then this will move my Center

224
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:25,820
and then then this will move my Center
 

225
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:32,800
and then then this will move my Center
and then I'm actually going around my

226
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:32,810
and then I'm actually going around my
 

227
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,220
and then I'm actually going around my
Center my center moves and gets this new

228
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,230
Center my center moves and gets this new
 

229
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,730
Center my center moves and gets this new
angle over here and so when you move

230
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:39,740
angle over here and so when you move
 

231
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,310
angle over here and so when you move
your foot versus shift your weight

232
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,320
your foot versus shift your weight
 

233
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,520
your foot versus shift your weight
first you create way more space because

234
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:45,530
first you create way more space because
 

235
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,500
first you create way more space because
your movement is linear so that will

236
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:47,510
your movement is linear so that will
 

237
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,480
your movement is linear so that will
kind of feel like they're not coming in

238
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:49,490
kind of feel like they're not coming in
 

239
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,740
kind of feel like they're not coming in
they're too far away okay and of course

240
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:53,750
they're too far away okay and of course
 

241
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,810
they're too far away okay and of course
there's timing but ultimately you have

242
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:58,820
there's timing but ultimately you have
 

243
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,390
there's timing but ultimately you have
to have that stickiness which is all

244
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:01,400
to have that stickiness which is all
 

245
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,400
to have that stickiness which is all
cheap okay because you can if you have

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,410
cheap okay because you can if you have
 

247
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:11,910
cheap okay because you can if you have
good IP adhesion you can't move them in

248
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:11,920
good IP adhesion you can't move them in
 

249
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,920
good IP adhesion you can't move them in
as far as you need to you could step the

250
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:14,930
as far as you need to you could step the
 

251
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,990
as far as you need to you could step the

00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,000
other way if you wanted to you could
 

253
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,620
other way if you wanted to you could
move in but tactically IP really only

254
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:20,630
move in but tactically IP really only
 

255
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,860

so just retire to keep working get that

260
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:30,520
so just retire to keep working get that
 

261
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,970
so just retire to keep working get that
weight shifting and then I'll always be

262
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:32,980
weight shifting and then I'll always be
 

263
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,340
weight shifting and then I'll always be

okay that's Q I don't think we're gonna

266
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:40,420
okay that's Q I don't think we're gonna
 

267
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:50,390
okay that's Q I don't think we're gonna
get the art right without the occasion

thing that kind of getting over that and

274
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:57,550
thing that kind of getting over that and
 

275
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,840
thing that kind of getting over that and
my question was for in that process of

276
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:00,850
my question was for in that process of
 

277
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,390
my question was for in that process of
getting exposed to that that repeated

278
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:03,400
getting exposed to that that repeated
 

279
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,010
getting exposed to that that repeated
shock and when the strikes come through

280
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:05,020
shock and when the strikes come through
 

281
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,520
shock and when the strikes come through
how not to let that be a negative

282
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:10,530
how not to let that be a negative
 

283
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,660
how not to let that be a negative
experience so that you're not getting

284
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:12,670
experience so that you're not getting
 

285
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,460
experience so that you're not getting
the positive benefit of it but you're

286
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:14,470
the positive benefit of it but you're
 

287
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,900
the positive benefit of it but you're
actually getting worse does that make

288
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:15,910
actually getting worse does that make
 

289
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,750
actually getting worse does that make
sense yes so I I did there's a so the

290
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:18,760
sense yes so I I did there's a so the
 

291

arts will do some sort of desensitize to

294
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:25,900
arts will do some sort of desensitize to
 

295
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,720
arts will do some sort of desensitize to
your body and that was part of why I

296
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:27,730
your body and that was part of why I
 

297
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,670

chose the strikes because James would

298
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:29,680

not take McKinney when he felt the alien

300
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:32,860
not take McKinney when he felt the alien
 

301
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,170
not take McKinney when he felt the alien
in his wrist but that's precisely why he

302
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:37,180
in his wrist but that's precisely why he
 

303
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,910
in his wrist but that's precisely why he
would want to come in because then I

304
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:38,920
would want to come in because then I
 

305
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,800
would want to come in because then I
wouldn't be there but so the pain is

306
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:40,810
wouldn't be there but so the pain is
 

307
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,620
wouldn't be there but so the pain is
motivating you and preventing you from

I don't know I can't access it the pain

I don't know I can't access it the pain
 

313
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,060
I don't know I can't access it the pain
is telling me forget all that focusing

314
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,070
is telling me forget all that focusing
 

315
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,420

right so there's many ways that you are
 

325
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,320
right so there's many ways that you are
desensitized and we did we did some

326
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,330
desensitized and we did we did some
 

327
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,600
desensitized and we did we did some
desensitize training here tonight with
