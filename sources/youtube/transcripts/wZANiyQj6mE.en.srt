i'm talking a little bit about filling

10
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160
i'm talking a little bit about filling
 

11
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,270
i'm talking a little bit about filling
in the gap

12
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,280
in the gap
 

13
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,550
in the gap
that exists in aikido so i think most

14
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,560
that exists in aikido so i think most
 

15
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,230
that exists in aikido so i think most
people have a pretty good idea of what

16
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
people have a pretty good idea of what
 

17
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,470
people have a pretty good idea of what
the aikido philosophy is right so

18
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,480
the aikido philosophy is right so
 

19
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,590
the aikido philosophy is right so
there's still a lot of stuff to be

20
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:23,600
there's still a lot of stuff to be
 

21
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,950
there's still a lot of stuff to be
hashed out with that right it's not

22
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
hashed out with that right it's not
 

23
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,990
hashed out with that right it's not
perfect we don't

24
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
perfect we don't
 

25
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,509
perfect we don't
exactly have nailed down what we think

26
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
exactly have nailed down what we think
 

27
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,710
exactly have nailed down what we think
the philosophy is but we know the

28
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
the philosophy is but we know the
 

29
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,230
the philosophy is but we know the
philosophy has something to do with

30
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
philosophy has something to do with
 

31
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,589
philosophy has something to do with
you know maybe some kind of peaceful

32
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
you know maybe some kind of peaceful
 

33
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,670
you know maybe some kind of peaceful
martial art where the idea is to not

34
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
martial art where the idea is to not
 

35
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,350
martial art where the idea is to not
hurt the other person and still be able

36
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
hurt the other person and still be able
 

37
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,470
hurt the other person and still be able
to protect myself

38
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
to protect myself
 

39
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,590
to protect myself
and these are the kind of things that

40
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600
and these are the kind of things that
 

41
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,590
and these are the kind of things that
differentiates aikido from

42
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
differentiates aikido from
 

43
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,430
differentiates aikido from
other martial arts systems right so

44
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
other martial arts systems right so
 

45
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,869
other martial arts systems right so
maybe not the idea of just beating the

46
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:42,879
maybe not the idea of just beating the
 

47
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:43,990
maybe not the idea of just beating the
heck out of somebody but

48
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
heck out of somebody but
 

49
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,910
heck out of somebody but
but instead being able to defend myself

50
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:45,920
but instead being able to defend myself
 

51
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,670
but instead being able to defend myself
in a way that doesn't hurt someone else

52
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
in a way that doesn't hurt someone else
 

53
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,549
in a way that doesn't hurt someone else
ideally so

54
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
ideally so
 

55
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,470
ideally so
so that's kind of the philosophy and a

56
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,480
so that's kind of the philosophy and a
 

57
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,910
so that's kind of the philosophy and a
lot of people talk about the philosophy

58
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
lot of people talk about the philosophy
 

59
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,310
lot of people talk about the philosophy
so

60
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
so
 

61
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,990
so
even if it's not completely hammered out

62
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
even if it's not completely hammered out
 

63
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,430
even if it's not completely hammered out
for you there's lots of guys you can

read
who will kind of give you a good idea of

68

who will kind of give you a good idea of
 

69
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,270
who will kind of give you a good idea of
the philosophy and on the other side

70
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
the philosophy and on the other side
 

71
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,430
the philosophy and on the other side
we have the techniques figured out right

72
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
we have the techniques figured out right
 

73
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,670
we have the techniques figured out right
so we have tons of teachers talking

74
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
so we have tons of teachers talking
 

75
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,070
so we have tons of teachers talking
about technical details of shionage or

76
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
about technical details of shionage or
 

77
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,870
about technical details of shionage or
ikyo

things so we have tons of people talking
 

83
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,750
things so we have tons of people talking
about what the technical details of

84
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
about what the technical details of
 

85
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,550
about what the technical details of
aikido are

86
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
aikido are
 

87
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,469
aikido are
the problem is there's a giant field in

88
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479
the problem is there's a giant field in
 

89
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,390
the problem is there's a giant field in
the middle that exists that we don't

90
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
the middle that exists that we don't
 

91
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,550
the middle that exists that we don't
really know anything about

92
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
really know anything about
 

93
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,350
really know anything about
so my approach to aikido what i've spent

94
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
so my approach to aikido what i've spent
 

95
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,030
so my approach to aikido what i've spent
a lot of my time doing is trying to fill

96
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
a lot of my time doing is trying to fill
 

97
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,590
a lot of my time doing is trying to fill
in that

98
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
in that
 

99
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,990
in that
middle section right so how do we make

100
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
middle section right so how do we make
 

101
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,109
middle section right so how do we make
those techniques

102
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
those techniques
 

103
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,510
those techniques
fit our philosophy and why does our

104
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
fit our philosophy and why does our
 

105
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,590
fit our philosophy and why does our
philosophy need to have those techniques

106
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
philosophy need to have those techniques
 

107
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,230
philosophy need to have those techniques
so

108
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
so
 

109
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,149
so
why what's all that stuff in the middle

110
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
why what's all that stuff in the middle
 

111
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,830
why what's all that stuff in the middle
and through my years of working with

112
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
and through my years of working with
 

113
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,550
and through my years of working with
aikido

114
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
aikido
 

115
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,469
aikido
i found that the two connect up very

116
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
i found that the two connect up very
 

117
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,069
i found that the two connect up very
naturally and very easily

118
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
naturally and very easily
 

119
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,230
naturally and very easily
but we're missing all that middle stuff

120
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
but we're missing all that middle stuff
 

121
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,670
but we're missing all that middle stuff
and i was missing that middle stuff for

122
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
and i was missing that middle stuff for
 

123
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,149
and i was missing that middle stuff for
years

124
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
years
 

125
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,510
years
so this is going to be a short video

126
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
so this is going to be a short video
 

127
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,350
so this is going to be a short video
series just talking about what is all

128
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
series just talking about what is all
 

129
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,590
series just talking about what is all
that middle ground that exists between

130
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
that middle ground that exists between
 

131
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,510
that middle ground that exists between
aikido techniques and aikido philosophy

132
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
aikido techniques and aikido philosophy
 

133
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,270
aikido techniques and aikido philosophy
and how do we marry the two and what do

134
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
and how do we marry the two and what do
 

135
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,870
and how do we marry the two and what do
we need to do in order to get the two

136
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
we need to do in order to get the two
 

137
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,670
we need to do in order to get the two
together

138
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
together
 

139
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,749
together
