top and at the bottom
if you're unsure how to do a figure

14
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
if you're unsure how to do a figure
 

15
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,470
if you're unsure how to do a figure
eight both forwards and backwards on

16
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480
eight both forwards and backwards on
 

17
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,990
eight both forwards and backwards on
both the left and right hand side

00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
both the left and right hand side
 

19
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,749
both the left and right hand side
i suggest going to see my previous video

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,920
if you're okay with that though let's
 

27
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,920
if you're okay with that though let's
get into it

28
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:20,930
get into it

so there's so many different types of

32
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:26,960
so there's so many different types of
 

33
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,550
so there's so many different types of
hand transfers that we can do in this

34
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
hand transfers that we can do in this
 

35
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,669
hand transfers that we can do in this
video i'm going to be showing you one of

36
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
video i'm going to be showing you one of
 

37
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,429
video i'm going to be showing you one of
the basic ones i'll also be giving you

38
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
the basic ones i'll also be giving you
 

39
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,590
the basic ones i'll also be giving you
some ideas and concepts to play with

40
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
some ideas and concepts to play with
 

41
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,190
some ideas and concepts to play with
and focus more on principles than

42
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
and focus more on principles than
 

43
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,790
and focus more on principles than
actually specific techniques

44
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
actually specific techniques
 

45
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,150
actually specific techniques
so the stuff that i'm using today has

46
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
so the stuff that i'm using today has
 

47
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,910
so the stuff that i'm using today has
got a nice marker in the middle showing

48
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
got a nice marker in the middle showing
 

49
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,350
got a nice marker in the middle showing
us where the center point is this is

50
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,360
us where the center point is this is
 

51
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,110
us where the center point is this is
really important to know

52
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
really important to know
 

53
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,190
really important to know
when we're gripping it if i'm gripping

54
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
when we're gripping it if i'm gripping
 

55
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,950
when we're gripping it if i'm gripping
either side i could have both palms

56
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:46,960
either side i could have both palms
 

57
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,590
either side i could have both palms
facing down i could have one up one down

58
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
facing down i could have one up one down
 

59
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,670
facing down i could have one up one down
i could have both up or i could have the

60
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
i could have both up or i could have the
 

61
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,590
i could have both up or i could have the
opposite of one up and one down

62
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
opposite of one up and one down
 

63
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,270
opposite of one up and one down
this also applies when my arms are

64
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
this also applies when my arms are
 

65
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,110
this also applies when my arms are
crossed i could have one or four one

66
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
crossed i could have one or four one
 

67
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,590
crossed i could have one or four one
down

68
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
down
 

69
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,830
down
i could have both up and down this could

70
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840
i could have both up and down this could
 

71
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,110
i could have both up and down this could
be either

72
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
be either
 

73
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,430
be either
either hand on top or i could have it

74
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
either hand on top or i could have it
 

75
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,390
either hand on top or i could have it
the opposite way around with both hands

76
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
the opposite way around with both hands
 

77
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,830
the opposite way around with both hands
palms facing up so you have all these

78
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
palms facing up so you have all these
 

79
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,270
palms facing up so you have all these
different permutations

80
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
different permutations
 

81
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,750
different permutations
the other thing to consider is that when

82
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
the other thing to consider is that when
 

83
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,870
the other thing to consider is that when
you're gripping the stuff and you're

84
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
you're gripping the stuff and you're
 

85
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,230
you're gripping the stuff and you're
doing a figure eight

86
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
doing a figure eight
 

87
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,870
doing a figure eight
are you gripping it just below the

88
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
are you gripping it just below the
 

89
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,230
are you gripping it just below the
center point

90
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
center point
 

91
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,469
center point
in which case this side is the short

92
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
in which case this side is the short
 

93
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,270
in which case this side is the short
side

94
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
side
 

95
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,149
side
and the end if you like the thumb side

96
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
and the end if you like the thumb side
 

97
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,910
and the end if you like the thumb side
my thumb was pointing out

98
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
my thumb was pointing out
 

99
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,710
my thumb was pointing out
is the the long side so if i was doing a

100
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
is the the long side so if i was doing a
 

101
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,990
is the the long side so if i was doing a
forward figure eight you can see the

102
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
forward figure eight you can see the
 

103
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,789
forward figure eight you can see the
long side

104
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
long side
 

105
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,590
long side
is the one that's leading and then if i

106
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
is the one that's leading and then if i
 

107
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,910
is the one that's leading and then if i
was to do a backwards figure eight

108
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
was to do a backwards figure eight
 

109
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,950
was to do a backwards figure eight
it'd be the short side that's leading in

110
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
it'd be the short side that's leading in
 

111
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,990
it'd be the short side that's leading in
the spin

112
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
the spin
 

113
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,870
the spin
i could also grab from the top side just

114
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
i could also grab from the top side just
 

115
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,389
i could also grab from the top side just
above the center point

116
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
above the center point
 

117
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,710
above the center point
so when i do a forwards figure eight

118
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
so when i do a forwards figure eight
 

119
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,749
so when i do a forwards figure eight
it's the short side that's leading

120
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
it's the short side that's leading
 

121
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,429
it's the short side that's leading
or if i'm going in a backwards figure

122
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
or if i'm going in a backwards figure
 

123
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,310
or if i'm going in a backwards figure
eight it's the long side that's lady

124
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320

 

125
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,590

so the reason this is relevant is

126
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
so the reason this is relevant is
 

127
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,789
so the reason this is relevant is
because depending on where my hand

128
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
because depending on where my hand
 

129
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,550
because depending on where my hand
placement is depends on the type of hand

130
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
placement is depends on the type of hand
 

131
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,149
placement is depends on the type of hand
transfer i do

132
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
transfer i do
 

133
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,149
transfer i do
so for example if i was to do a figure

134
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
so for example if i was to do a figure
 

135
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,510
so for example if i was to do a figure
eight here

136
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,520
eight here
 

137
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,350
eight here
with the back end are holding the back

just sweep down
 

147
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,589
just sweep down
into this position notice depending on

148
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
into this position notice depending on
 

149
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,030
into this position notice depending on
where i've got this hand it could be

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
where i've got this hand it could be
 

151
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,110
where i've got this hand it could be
underneath or it could be on top

underneath or it could be on top
 

153
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,710
underneath or it could be on top
this hand here is facing facing down

154
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
this hand here is facing facing down
 

155
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,190
this hand here is facing facing down
if i was to have it palm up that means

156
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
if i was to have it palm up that means
 

157
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,750
if i was to have it palm up that means
the

158
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
the
 

159
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,589
the
this end of the staff crosses over in

160
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
this end of the staff crosses over in
 

161
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,949
this end of the staff crosses over in
which case then i need to receive it

162
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
which case then i need to receive it
 

163
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,470
which case then i need to receive it
into a cross grip

164
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,480
into a cross grip
 

165
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,589
into a cross grip
like this if however i was to grab

166
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
like this if however i was to grab
 

167
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,070
like this if however i was to grab
rather than behind the center point

168
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
rather than behind the center point
 

169
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,790
rather than behind the center point
above

170
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
above
 

171
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,270
above
so then i'd have the longer end trailing

172
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
so then i'd have the longer end trailing
 

173
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,270
so then i'd have the longer end trailing
behind in a forward figure eight

174
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
behind in a forward figure eight
 

175
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,350
behind in a forward figure eight
and then i was to change over i could

176
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
and then i was to change over i could
 

177
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,270
and then i was to change over i could
either receive it with my hands crossed

178
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
either receive it with my hands crossed
 

179
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,910
either receive it with my hands crossed
or if i was to turn it over see now my

180
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
or if i was to turn it over see now my
 

181
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,309
or if i was to turn it over see now my
palm

182
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
palm
 

183
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,589
palm
is facing up and this hand could be in

184
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:55,599
is facing up and this hand could be in
 

185
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,350
is facing up and this hand could be in
any of these permutations

186
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
any of these permutations
 

187
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,270
any of these permutations
and i could transfer here and then

188
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
and i could transfer here and then
 

189
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,070
and i could transfer here and then
continue into a backwards figure

190
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
continue into a backwards figure
 

191
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,509
continue into a backwards figure
probably the most basic and practical

192
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
probably the most basic and practical
 

193
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,509
probably the most basic and practical
way to receive the stuff is to have one

194
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
way to receive the stuff is to have one
 

195
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,750
way to receive the stuff is to have one
palm facing down and one palm facing up

196
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
palm facing down and one palm facing up
 

197
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,910
palm facing down and one palm facing up
so if i stick my thumbs out both thumbs

198
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
so if i stick my thumbs out both thumbs
 

199
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,750
so if i stick my thumbs out both thumbs
are facing the same direction

200
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
are facing the same direction
 

201
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,430
are facing the same direction
that could be in that position or it

202
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
that could be in that position or it
 

203
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,270
that could be in that position or it
could be in this position here

204
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
could be in this position here
 

205
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,869
could be in this position here
personally this type of grip i think has

206
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
personally this type of grip i think has
 

207
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,390
personally this type of grip i think has
more of a martial application which i'll

208
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
more of a martial application which i'll
 

209
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,589
more of a martial application which i'll
cover in a later video

210
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
cover in a later video
 

211
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,350
cover in a later video
so before i explain how we go from force

212
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
so before i explain how we go from force
 

213
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,430
so before i explain how we go from force
to backwards we'll cover the pendulum

214
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
to backwards we'll cover the pendulum
 

215
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:23,830
to backwards we'll cover the pendulum
swing

216
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
swing
 

217
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,830
swing
just from side to side just doing this

218
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
just from side to side just doing this
 

219
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,350
just from side to side just doing this
basic hand transfer

220
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
basic hand transfer
 

221
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,830
basic hand transfer
from one hand to the other so the way we

222
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
from one hand to the other so the way we
 

223
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,630
from one hand to the other so the way we
can do this if we hold the staff out

224
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
can do this if we hold the staff out
 

225
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,229
can do this if we hold the staff out
and the short side is behind

226
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
and the short side is behind
 

227
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,430
and the short side is behind
as we swing down here i receive it

228
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
as we swing down here i receive it
 

229
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,949
as we swing down here i receive it
with my palm facing up

230
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
with my palm facing up
 

231
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,430
with my palm facing up
this palms facing down let's swap it

232
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
this palms facing down let's swap it
 

233
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,070
this palms facing down let's swap it
over

234
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
over
 

235
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,270
over
my hands cross over and then i take it

236
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
my hands cross over and then i take it
 

237
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,630
my hands cross over and then i take it
to the opposite side

238
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
to the opposite side
 

239
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,149
to the opposite side
you'll notice here i'm grabbing above

240
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
you'll notice here i'm grabbing above
 

241
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,550
you'll notice here i'm grabbing above
the center point so in one hand it's

242
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
the center point so in one hand it's
 

243
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,149
the center point so in one hand it's
going to be above the center point

244
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
going to be above the center point
 

245
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,429
going to be above the center point
as i change it back over here stop in

246
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
as i change it back over here stop in
 

247
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,789
as i change it back over here stop in
the middle

248
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
the middle
 

249
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,030
the middle
you see now i'm grabbing below the

250
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
you see now i'm grabbing below the
 

251
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,949
you see now i'm grabbing below the
center point

252
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
center point
 

253
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,869
center point
so one side above the center point

254
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
so one side above the center point
 

255
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,750
so one side above the center point
the other side below the center pump

256
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
the other side below the center pump
 

257
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,030
the other side below the center pump
we can also then change this over

258
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
we can also then change this over
 

259
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,909
we can also then change this over
so now it's the opposite so as i swing

260
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
so now it's the opposite so as i swing
 

261
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,110
so now it's the opposite so as i swing
this out

262
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
this out
 

263
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,990
this out
you see here now i'm below the center

264
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
you see here now i'm below the center
 

265
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,070
you see here now i'm below the center
point on my left hand side

266
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
point on my left hand side
 

267
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,590
point on my left hand side
as i bring it to the other side i'm now

268
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
as i bring it to the other side i'm now
 

269
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,830
as i bring it to the other side i'm now
above the center point on my opposite

270
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
above the center point on my opposite
 

271
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,270
above the center point on my opposite
side

272
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280

 

273
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,150

then from here you can just switch

274
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
then from here you can just switch
 

275
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,510
then from here you can just switch
whichever grip

276
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
whichever grip
 

277
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,070
whichever grip
you want just by sliding your hands over

278
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
you want just by sliding your hands over
 

279
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,350
you want just by sliding your hands over
so if we were to hold in the center of

280
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
so if we were to hold in the center of
 

281
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,870
so if we were to hold in the center of
the staff the same hand transfer could

282
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
the staff the same hand transfer could
 

283
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,830
the staff the same hand transfer could
be used

284
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
be used
 

285
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,870
be used
as i swing my hands down

286
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
as i swing my hands down
 

287
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,950
as i swing my hands down
instead of gripping at the side i let my

288
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
instead of gripping at the side i let my
 

289
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,230
instead of gripping at the side i let my
hand slide over the other hand

290
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
hand slide over the other hand
 

291
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,790
hand slide over the other hand
and it kind of palms over from one side

292
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
and it kind of palms over from one side
 

293
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,990
and it kind of palms over from one side
to the other

294
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
to the other
 

295
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,469
to the other
and it just creates a smooth hand

296
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
and it just creates a smooth hand
 

297
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,270
and it just creates a smooth hand
transfer from side to side

298
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
transfer from side to side
 

299
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,870
transfer from side to side
the reason i like this type of hand

300
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
the reason i like this type of hand
 

301
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,950
the reason i like this type of hand
transfer is because it can be applied

302
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
transfer is because it can be applied
 

303
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,150
transfer is because it can be applied
with other things

304
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
with other things
 

305
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,629
with other things
such as clubs

306
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639

 

307
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,230

so the same concept applies when we're

308
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
so the same concept applies when we're
 

309
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,070
so the same concept applies when we're
changing above our head if i take this

310
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
changing above our head if i take this
 

311
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,870
changing above our head if i take this
grip

312
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
grip
 

313
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,110
grip
and take it above my head the same thing

314
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
and take it above my head the same thing
 

315
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,990
and take it above my head the same thing
applies if i

316
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
applies if i
 

317
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,189
applies if i
open out i change into this grip

318
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
open out i change into this grip
 

319
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,870
open out i change into this grip
let it turn over you can see the same

320
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
let it turn over you can see the same
 

321
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:39,110
let it turn over you can see the same
idea applies if it's above my head

322
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
idea applies if it's above my head
 

323
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,870
idea applies if it's above my head
if i let this continue i can continue

324
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
if i let this continue i can continue
 

325
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,710
if i let this continue i can continue
the momentum all the way around so it

326
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
the momentum all the way around so it
 

327
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,629
the momentum all the way around so it
completes a circle

328
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
completes a circle
 

329
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,310
completes a circle
so i'm changing at the bottom and

330
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
so i'm changing at the bottom and
 

331
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,310
so i'm changing at the bottom and
changing at the top as well

332
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
changing at the top as well
 

333
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,189
changing at the top as well
it's using that same hand transfer the

334
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
it's using that same hand transfer the
 

335
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,590
it's using that same hand transfer the
same

336
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
same
 

337
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,230
same
idea of transferring like this i use it

338
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
idea of transferring like this i use it
 

339
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,590
idea of transferring like this i use it
at the top

340
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
at the top
 

341
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,710
at the top
transfer at the top transfer other one

342
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
transfer at the top transfer other one
 

343
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,029
transfer at the top transfer other one
and i'm actually transitioning through a

344
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
and i'm actually transitioning through a
 

345
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:03,749
and i'm actually transitioning through a
figure eight

346
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
figure eight
 

347
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,510
figure eight
here so at any point i could stop

348
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
here so at any point i could stop
 

349
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,510
here so at any point i could stop
so for example here i could stop and go

350
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
so for example here i could stop and go
 

351
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,590
so for example here i could stop and go
into a ford's figure eight

352
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
into a ford's figure eight
 

353
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,189
into a ford's figure eight
or if i continue it round i could stop

354
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
or if i continue it round i could stop
 

355
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:15,990
or if i continue it round i could stop
here

356
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
here
 

357
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,510
here
and continue with the backless figure

358
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
and continue with the backless figure
 

359
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,749
and continue with the backless figure
right

360
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:19,759
right
 

361
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,350
right
obviously we can do this both directions

362
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
obviously we can do this both directions
 

363
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,270
obviously we can do this both directions
so i could do the forwards figure eight

364
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
so i could do the forwards figure eight
 

365
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,469
so i could do the forwards figure eight
on this side and then continue

366
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
on this side and then continue
 

367
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,309
on this side and then continue
down and take it up to the top

368
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
down and take it up to the top
 

369
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,189
down and take it up to the top
so now on my right hand side i'm doing a

370
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
so now on my right hand side i'm doing a
 

371
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,670
so now on my right hand side i'm doing a
backwards figure right there

372
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
backwards figure right there
 

373
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,790
backwards figure right there
the other way to understand how the

374
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
the other way to understand how the
 

375
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,230
the other way to understand how the
forwards and backwards figure eight fit

376
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
forwards and backwards figure eight fit
 

377
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,029
forwards and backwards figure eight fit
together

378
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
together
 

379
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,909
together
is if you look at where the transition

380
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
is if you look at where the transition
 

381
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,710
is if you look at where the transition
happens

382
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
happens
 

383
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,990
happens
on the front plane here the circle that

384
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
on the front plane here the circle that
 

385
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,430
on the front plane here the circle that
i'm creating here

386
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
i'm creating here
 

387
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,189
i'm creating here
actually becomes the backward circle

388
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
actually becomes the backward circle
 

389
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,070
actually becomes the backward circle
on the other side the same for the

390
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
on the other side the same for the
 

391
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,430
on the other side the same for the
backward circle

392
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
backward circle
 

393
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,790
backward circle
as i create this large circle here

394
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
as i create this large circle here
 

395
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,510
as i create this large circle here
if i was to transition here i'm going

396
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
if i was to transition here i'm going
 

397
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,790
if i was to transition here i'm going
into a forward

398
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
into a forward
 

399
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,790
into a forward
figure right there but instead of just

400
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
figure right there but instead of just
 

401
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,950
figure right there but instead of just
remaining

402
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
remaining
 

403
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,990
remaining
with the same using the same hand

404
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
with the same using the same hand
 

405
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,469
with the same using the same hand
i actually transition into the other

406
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
i actually transition into the other
 

407
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,430
i actually transition into the other
hand

so once you understand the principles of

410
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
so once you understand the principles of
 

411
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,870
so once you understand the principles of
how hand transfers work you could try

412
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
how hand transfers work you could try
 

413
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,629
how hand transfers work you could try
other ideas such as having both palms

414
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
other ideas such as having both palms
 

415
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,110
other ideas such as having both palms
facing

416
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
facing
 

417
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,189
facing
upwards and you can do the same thing

418
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
upwards and you can do the same thing
 

419
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,189
upwards and you can do the same thing
changing at the top like this

420
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
changing at the top like this
 

421
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,909
changing at the top like this
and changing at the bottom you could

422
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
and changing at the bottom you could
 

423
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:26,550
and changing at the bottom you could
also try

424
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
also try
 

425
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,830
also try
from side to side so changing at the

426
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
from side to side so changing at the
 

427
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,830
from side to side so changing at the
sides

428
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
sides
 

429
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,629
sides
and then alternating from side to side

430
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
and then alternating from side to side
 

431
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,790
and then alternating from side to side
and again all these linked together

432
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
and again all these linked together
 

433
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,749
and again all these linked together
we could then link it to the top hand

434
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
we could then link it to the top hand
 

435
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,029
we could then link it to the top hand
transfer

436
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
transfer
 

437
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,150
transfer
and then to the side transfer

438
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
and then to the side transfer
 

439
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,990
and then to the side transfer
okay there's some ideas to play with

this time introducing body movement and

452
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
this time introducing body movement and
 

453
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,670
this time introducing body movement and
being able to turn from side to side

454
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
being able to turn from side to side
 

455
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,150
being able to turn from side to side
and then transition from hand to hand

456
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
and then transition from hand to hand
 

457
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,510
