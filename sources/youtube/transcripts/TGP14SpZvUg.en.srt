adding his

8
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
adding his

00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:30,119
add for
 

19
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,549
add for
okay so here in other words here's his

20
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:33,559
okay so here in other words here's his
 

21
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:37,069
okay so here in other words here's his
spinal displacement right it has a place

22
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:37,079
spinal displacement right it has a place
 

23
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,270
spinal displacement right it has a place
where it is trying to get

24
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:40,280
where it is trying to get
 

25
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,630
where it is trying to get
to so we'll represent that by

26
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
to so we'll represent that by
 

27
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,029
to so we'll represent that by
his by this hand pushing okay and you

28
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
his by this hand pushing okay and you
 

29
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,389
his by this hand pushing okay and you
pretend on there got it and you would

30
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
pretend on there got it and you would
 

31
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,310
pretend on there got it and you would
push like you normally do for spinal

32
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
push like you normally do for spinal
 

33
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,349
push like you normally do for spinal
displacement so it has the end now it it

34
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:57,359
displacement so it has the end now it it
 

35
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,189
displacement so it has the end now it it
gets intense to that end it's increasing

36
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
gets intense to that end it's increasing
 

37
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,109
gets intense to that end it's increasing
pressure and then once it passes that in

38
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:04,119
pressure and then once it passes that in
 

39
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:06,950
pressure and then once it passes that in
it starts to go off you get it and

40
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:06,960
it starts to go off you get it and
 

41
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,789
it starts to go off you get it and
that's because it's

42
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
that's because it's
 

43
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,749
that's because it's
fine um in other words stay there if I

going like in iido la la land do you

54
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:28,600
going like in iido la la land do you

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,320
point and so what I want to understand
 

59
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,870
point and so what I want to understand
is at that end

60
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:37,880
is at that end
 

61
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,870
is at that end
point the power that I feel in his hands

62
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:41,880
point the power that I feel in his hands
 

63
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,069
point the power that I feel in his hands
is actually going to be reduced and the

65
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,149
is actually going to be reduced and the
mechanical advantage of being at the

mechanical advantage of being at the
 

67
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,510
mechanical advantage of being at the
distal end of the lever is going to

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,550
distal end of the lever is going to
become mine if I can get to that end

00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:44,590
the deltoid the outer deltoid all right
here's the second Point uh the lifting

168
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:44,600
here's the second Point uh the lifting
 

169
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,870
here's the second Point uh the lifting
of the arm is never like this I let it

170
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:47,880
of the arm is never like this I let it
 

171
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,029
of the arm is never like this I let it
be like that so we just simplify the

172
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:50,039
be like that so we just simplify the
 

173
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,870
be like that so we just simplify the
first lesson but we already know that

174
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
first lesson but we already know that
 

175
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,550
first lesson but we already know that
the arm has to pass through the

176
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,560
the arm has to pass through the
 

177
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,870
the arm has to pass through the
phases okay it's not going to be as big

178
00:04:59,870 --> 00:04:59,880
phases okay it's not going to be as big
 

179
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,790
phases okay it's not going to be as big
a phase as you're used to so come to

180
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:03,800
a phase as you're used to so come to
 

181
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,350
a phase as you're used to so come to
this

182
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
this
 

183
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,110
this
side in other words I'm not going to go

184
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,120
side in other words I'm not going to go
 

185
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,230
side in other words I'm not going to go
get on CH on J I'm not going to do that

186
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
get on CH on J I'm not going to do that
 

187
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,710
get on CH on J I'm not going to do that
it's very small it's very

188
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:15,720
it's very small it's very
 

189
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,390
it's very small it's very
small very small that was

190
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
small very small that was
 

191
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,350
small very small that was
it this

192
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,360
it this
 

193
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,230
it this
one not this one you see that just very

194
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:27,240
one not this one you see that just very
 

195
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,270
one not this one you see that just very
small Slow Down slow down slow down

196
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,280
small Slow Down slow down slow down
 

197
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,350
small Slow Down slow down slow down
that way if you pay attention that's how

198
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
that way if you pay attention that's how
 

199
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,390
that way if you pay attention that's how
I pass this wrist here okay if I kept

200
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:37,400
I pass this wrist here okay if I kept
 

201
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,430
I pass this wrist here okay if I kept
making it big I'm going to turn him

202
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
making it big I'm going to turn him
 

203
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,550
making it big I'm going to turn him
because he keeps his palms it's going to

204
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:41,560
because he keeps his palms it's going to
 

205
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,230
because he keeps his palms it's going to
turn him you see and he's not going to

206
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:43,240
turn him you see and he's not going to
 

207
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:51,590
turn him you see and he's not going to
be there so it's a very small

208
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600

 

209
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,230

inside and that means at the end then

210
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,240
inside and that means at the end then
 

211
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,070
inside and that means at the end then
it's not going to be pal

212
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,080
it's not going to be pal
 

213
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:05,670
it's not going to be pal
up it's Jon h okay so the elbows

214
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680

 

215
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,510

down and I'm going to do this

216
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
down and I'm going to do this
 

217
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,790
down and I'm going to do this
version going forward so you can feel

218
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
version going forward so you can feel
 

219
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:24,909
version going forward so you can feel
how you are going around his

220
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:24,919

 

221
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:30,070

hands and allowing when you work at that

222
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
hands and allowing when you work at that
 

223
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,909
hands and allowing when you work at that
edge of his power Arc and you do this

224
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
edge of his power Arc and you do this
 

225
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,670
edge of his power Arc and you do this
movement you allow the center to come

226
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:36,680
movement you allow the center to come
 

227
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,270
movement you allow the center to come
underneath it but not the top of his

228
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
underneath it but not the top of his
 

229
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,110
underneath it but not the top of his
body and that's why I can keep walking

230
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,120
body and that's why I can keep walking
 

231
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,230
body and that's why I can keep walking
forward he's still pushing me there's

232
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:47,240
forward he's still pushing me there's
 

233
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,830
forward he's still pushing me there's
pressure there or I just go around that

234
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:50,840
pressure there or I just go around that
 

235
00:06:50,840 --> 00:07:04,390
pressure there or I just go around that
pressure on the top side of this

236
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400

 

237
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,869

careful in this that you don't get the

238
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:07,879
careful in this that you don't get the
 

239
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,150
careful in this that you don't get the
deltoid because you over exaggerate get

240
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,160
deltoid because you over exaggerate get
 

241
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,790
deltoid because you over exaggerate get
on and Cheon it's very

242
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
on and Cheon it's very
 

243
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,909
on and Cheon it's very
small very

244
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:16,919

 

245
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,150

small okay let's try it

246
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
small okay let's try it
 

247
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,749
small okay let's try it
just okay that that is the of course

248
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
just okay that that is the of course
 

249
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,430
just okay that that is the of course
there's an external to aikido's

250
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:26,440
there's an external to aikido's
 

251
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,670
there's an external to aikido's
architecture that's the external

252
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:30,680
architecture that's the external
 

253
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,110
architecture that's the external
um most people they don't even do that

254
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,120
um most people they don't even do that
 

255
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,230
um most people they don't even do that
but if you are working on it and you

256
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:37,240
but if you are working on it and you
 

257
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,309
but if you are working on it and you
only have the

258
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:39,319
only have the
 

259
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:48,990
only have the
external you you end up looking like

260
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,000

 

261
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,189

this on

262
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:52,199
this on
 

263
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,950
this on
you to me you to me you look like

264
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
you to me you to me you look like
 

265
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,710
you to me you to me you look like
this I'll try to make it look like a a

266
00:07:59,710 --> 00:07:59,720
this I'll try to make it look like a a
 

267
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:23,550
this I'll try to make it look like a a
ferite okay an external

268
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:23,560

 

269
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,950

ferite well what if I asked you to do it

270
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:25,960
ferite well what if I asked you to do it
 

271
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,790
ferite well what if I asked you to do it
like

272
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
like
 

273
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:38,550
like
this you couldn't do it

274
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560

 

275
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,670

couldn't do

276
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:40,680
couldn't do
 

277
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,509
couldn't do
it and if you looked at the two versions

278
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
it and if you looked at the two versions
 

279
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,910
it and if you looked at the two versions
there's way less tension in the body in

280
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:46,920
there's way less tension in the body in
 

281
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,070
there's way less tension in the body in
the second

282
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
the second
 

283
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,110
the second
version and most

284
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
version and most
 

285
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,829
version and most
importantly there's way

286
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:53,839
importantly there's way
 

287
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,550
importantly there's way
more tilt in his body because his Center

288
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
more tilt in his body because his Center
 

289
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,590
more tilt in his body because his Center
can come more

290
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600

 

291
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,870

forward and that's where the throw

292
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:03,880
forward and that's where the throw
 

293
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,910
forward and that's where the throw
happens because the throw is a matter of

294
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:06,920
happens because the throw is a matter of
 

295
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,750
happens because the throw is a matter of
his line of

296
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:08,760
his line of
 

297
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,430
his line of
gravity moving

298
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
gravity moving
 

299
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,030
gravity moving
rearward and falling outside his Bas of

300
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
rearward and falling outside his Bas of
 

301
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,350
rearward and falling outside his Bas of
support that's why he falls but the

302
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,360
support that's why he falls but the
 

303
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,509
support that's why he falls but the
Marshall application is the reason he

304
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
Marshall application is the reason he
 

305
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,750
Marshall application is the reason he
doesn't stick his feet back underneath

306
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
doesn't stick his feet back underneath
 

307
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,310
doesn't stick his feet back underneath
his line of gravity is because they're

308
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
his line of gravity is because they're
 

309
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,910
his line of gravity is because they're
occupied with forward progress

310
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
occupied with forward progress
 

311
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,389
occupied with forward progress
okay and that's the difference so when I

312
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:33,399
okay and that's the difference so when I
 

313
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,870
okay and that's the difference so when I
go stiff you pay attention you see how I

314
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:35,880
go stiff you pay attention you see how I
 

315
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,630
go stiff you pay attention you see how I
stop him from coming his whole body

316
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:37,640
stop him from coming his whole body
 

317
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,790
stop him from coming his whole body
stops him from coming in and then I just

318
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:39,800
stops him from coming in and then I just
 

319
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,150
stops him from coming in and then I just
enter and

320
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
enter and
 

321
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,110
enter and
push but on the other one it's so soft

322
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
push but on the other one it's so soft
 

323
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,069
push but on the other one it's so soft
look

324
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:46,079
look
 

325
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:49,350
look
how much it comes in and most

326
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
how much it comes in and most
 

327
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,310
how much it comes in and most
importantly it's inertia is pinning it

328
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
importantly it's inertia is pinning it
 

329
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,269
importantly it's inertia is pinning it
in

00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:58,680
okay so I can't you have to develop the
 

335
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,750
okay so I can't you have to develop the
internal to do this I know it happens

336
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:02,760
internal to do this I know it happens
 

337
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,750
internal to do this I know it happens
out at the edge of the power Arc I know

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:04,760
out at the edge of the power Arc I know
 

339
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,670
out at the edge of the power Arc I know
I don't use the deltoids I know I do

340
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
I don't use the deltoids I know I do
 

341
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,670
I don't use the deltoids I know I do
have an external spiral of the

342
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:10,680
have an external spiral of the
 

343
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,829
have an external spiral of the
arm um but there's still a matter of

344
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
arm um but there's still a matter of
 

345
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,910
arm um but there's still a matter of
young aspect being

346
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
young aspect being
 

347
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,389
young aspect being
internalized alchemically treated by

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,069
being bounced off the
ground and then admitted in this case at

352
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:23,079
ground and then admitted in this case at
 

353
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,269
ground and then admitted in this case at
a higher y value than the contact point

354
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:26,279
a higher y value than the contact point
 

355
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,430
a higher y value than the contact point
at the contact point But at the center

356
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:30,440
at the contact point But at the center
 

357
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,389

it's allowed to keep going

358
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
it's allowed to keep going
 

359
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,350
it's allowed to keep going
in okay and I don't want to keep it out

360
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
in okay and I don't want to keep it out
 

361
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,350
in okay and I don't want to keep it out
and tension keeps it

362
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:38,360
and tension keeps it
 

363
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,550
and tension keeps it
out so as we do the

364
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560

00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:10,440
I can use it in different ways so I know
 

423
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,350
I can use it in different ways so I know
martially I want to change the center of

gravity shoulder relationship okay and I

426
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:18,519
gravity shoulder relationship okay and I
 

427
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,670
gravity shoulder relationship okay and I
know that I want his feet occupied with

428
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:22,680
know that I want his feet occupied with
 

429
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,269
know that I want his feet occupied with

going to just Rel on those

434
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:30,920
going to just Rel on those
 

435
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,790
going to just Rel on those
physics that he can't get his feed back

436
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:33,800
physics that he can't get his feed back
 

437
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,550
physics that he can't get his feed back
under him let's move this

438
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
under him let's move this
 

439
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,910
under him let's move this
way okay because highly super athletic

440
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:40,920
way okay because highly super athletic
 

441
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,389
way okay because highly super athletic
people can do it so I'm going to this is

442
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
people can do it so I'm going to this is
 

443
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,629
people can do it so I'm going to this is
going to represent occupying him with

444
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
going to represent occupying him with
 

445
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,629
going to represent occupying him with
forward inertia this this shoulder plane

446
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
forward inertia this this shoulder plane
 

447
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,550
forward inertia this this shoulder plane
is good to go okay and I'm going to push

448
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
is good to go okay and I'm going to push
 

449
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,110
is good to go okay and I'm going to push
you're going to you're going to do your

450
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:56,120
you're going to you're going to do your
 

451
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,350
you're going to you're going to do your
monkey get your feet back under you

452
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:58,360
monkey get your feet back under you
 

453
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,230
monkey get your feet back under you
okay

454
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,240

 

455
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,509

I think you could do it without pulling

456
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:02,519
I think you could do it without pulling
 

457
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,189
I think you could do it without pulling
your Center up I know it's weird but

458
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:04,199
your Center up I know it's weird but
 

459
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:05,550
your Center up I know it's weird but
you'll be able to do it you don't have

460
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:05,560
you'll be able to do it you don't have
 

461
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,990
you'll be able to do it you don't have
to give me that much that doesn't happen

462
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,000
to give me that much that doesn't happen
 

463
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,389
to give me that much that doesn't happen
in the technique okay

464
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:11,399

 

465
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,750

good so what I'm going to do is on this

466
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
good so what I'm going to do is on this
 

467
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,150
good so what I'm going to do is on this
forward hand although it is pushing this

468
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,160
forward hand although it is pushing this
 

469
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,990
forward hand although it is pushing this
way taking the shoulder further out of

470
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
way taking the shoulder further out of
 

471
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,829
way taking the shoulder further out of
the same vertical plane with the center

472
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:24,839
the same vertical plane with the center
 

473
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,710
the same vertical plane with the center
it's pushing down don't don't lean there

474
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:27,720
it's pushing down don't don't lean there
 

475
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,110
it's pushing down don't don't lean there
you go okay it's not just going this

476
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
you go okay it's not just going this
 

477
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,710
you go okay it's not just going this
way it is going that way but there's a

478
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
way it is going that way but there's a
 

479
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,590
way it is going that way but there's a
downward to it on his feet

480
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:40,600
downward to it on his feet
 

481
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,629
downward to it on his feet
okay and that stops his

482
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:43,639
okay and that stops his
 

483
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,110
okay and that stops his
feet from being able to go back under

484
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
feet from being able to go back under
 

485
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,990
feet from being able to go back under
him so here I am I'm going completely

486
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
him so here I am I'm going completely
 

487
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,189
him so here I am I'm going completely
over it and affecting the shoulders but

488
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
over it and affecting the shoulders but
 

489
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,910
over it and affecting the shoulders but
he can move his feet

490
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:56,920

 

491
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,110

backwards here's that same angle

492
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,120
backwards here's that same angle
 

493
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,150
backwards here's that same angle
physical angle but you'll feel that you

494
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,160
physical angle but you'll feel that you
 

495
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,829
physical angle but you'll feel that you
feel that pressure on your feet now okay

496
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
feel that pressure on your feet now okay
 

497
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,990
feel that pressure on your feet now okay
and so now I'll just leave this amount

498
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
and so now I'll just leave this amount
 

499
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,389
and so now I'll just leave this amount
of pressure and you move your feet

500
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
of pressure and you move your feet
 

501
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,749
of pressure and you move your feet
backwards and you'll see it's a little

502
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:12,759
backwards and you'll see it's a little
 

503
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:17,110
backwards and you'll see it's a little
harder for him okay and every movement

504
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
harder for him okay and every movement
 

505
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,710
harder for him okay and every movement
that he tries to make to get his feet

506
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:19,720
that he tries to make to get his feet
 

507
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,509
that he tries to make to get his feet
back under him I keep 90° modulation on

508
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:23,519
back under him I keep 90° modulation on
 

509
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,069
back under him I keep 90° modulation on
that and it adds to the throat okay so

510
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:27,079
that and it adds to the throat okay so
 

511
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,189
that and it adds to the throat okay so
in other words don't come over the top

512
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199
in other words don't come over the top
 

513
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,269
in other words don't come over the top
your you just keep knocking it Knocking

514
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:32,279
your you just keep knocking it Knocking
 

515
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,389
your you just keep knocking it Knocking
him down you have to pin is you feel the

516
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:35,399
him down you have to pin is you feel the
 

517
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,150
him down you have to pin is you feel the
pin

518
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,160
pin
 

519
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,150
pin
now your feet get pinned and the only

520
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
now your feet get pinned and the only
 

521
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,670
now your feet get pinned and the only
way I can do that is with the internal

522
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:42,680
way I can do that is with the internal
 

523
00:14:42,680 --> 00:15:03,590
way I can do that is with the internal
skill

524
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600

 

525
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,749

you feel it on your feet not just

526
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:08,759

 

527
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,030

Che on your

528
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,040
Che on your
 

529
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,910
Che on your
feet so the second I going through and

530
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
feet so the second I going through and
 

531
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,990
feet so the second I going through and
around and I get any

532
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,000
around and I get any
 

533
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,110
around and I get any
see any angle variation between the

534
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
see any angle variation between the
 

535
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,030
see any angle variation between the
shoulder plane and the center plane once

536
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,040
shoulder plane and the center plane once
 

537
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,509
shoulder plane and the center plane once
I get that I now start attacking the

538
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
I get that I now start attacking the
 

539
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:39,189
I get that I now start attacking the
feet you feel that okay that's what I'm

540
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199

 

541
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,509

attacking so you pay attention there's a

542
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:41,519
attacking so you pay attention there's a
 

543
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,430
attacking so you pay attention there's a
more of a downward miss a

544
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:46,440

 

545
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,430

549
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:04,350

down okay try it

550
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:04,360

 

551
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,069

all right so in in the

00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:07,079
all right so in in the
 

553
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,990
all right so in in the

version that I do again remember you're

556
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
version that I do again remember you're
 

557
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,870
version that I do again remember you're
going to work the diagonals if he's got

558
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
going to work the diagonals if he's got
 

559
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,990
going to work the diagonals if he's got
a

560
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
a
 

561
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,430
a
linear thrust energy you you always work

562
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
linear thrust energy you you always work
 

563
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,670
linear thrust energy you you always work
the diagonals to start the fight

564
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
the diagonals to start the fight
 

565
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,710

rotating just in his desire to complete

566
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:27,720
rotating just in his desire to complete
 

567
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,470
rotating just in his desire to complete
that linear thrust okay um that so even

568
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:31,480
that linear thrust okay um that so even
 

569
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,309
that linear thrust okay um that so even
if you do the tencom version you can't

570
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:34,319
if you do the tencom version you can't
 

571
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:37,470
if you do the tencom version you can't
tenom from

572
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:37,480

 

573
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,470

here you have to first

574
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:43,480

 

575
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,749

enter you can do uh an ashido ten

576
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
enter you can do uh an ashido ten
 

577
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,350
enter you can do uh an ashido ten
conversion so that's the one that I did

578
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:50,360
conversion so that's the one that I did
 

579
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,590
conversion so that's the one that I did
so I came this

580
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600

 

581
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,590

way but whatever your goal

582
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:56,600
way but whatever your goal
 

583
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,069
way but whatever your goal
is once you start SP we're rotating the

584
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
is once you start SP we're rotating the
 

585
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,670
is once you start SP we're rotating the

586
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
overall pairing the overall UK Dynamic
 

587
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,069
overall pairing the overall UK Dynamic
you want to try to get that centrifugal

588
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
you want to try to get that centrifugal
 

589
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,549
you want to try to get that centrifugal
energy because it is a throw and we

590
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
energy because it is a throw and we
 

591
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,829
energy because it is a throw and we
utilize the centrifugal energy um to add

592
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:12,839
utilize the centrifugal energy um to add
 

593
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,029
utilize the centrifugal energy um to add
to all the mechanics that we just went

594
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
to all the mechanics that we just went
 

595
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,829
to all the mechanics that we just went
over okay so as I go just relax let go

596
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:20,839
over okay so as I go just relax let go
 

597
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,949
over okay so as I go just relax let go
as I'm moving over

598
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
as I'm moving over
 

599
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,510
as I'm moving over
here I start that centrifugal energy and

600
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:26,520
here I start that centrifugal energy and
 

601
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,510
here I start that centrifugal energy and
I can now do everything that I just did

602
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520
I can now do everything that I just did
 

603
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,669
I can now do everything that I just did
on that line there which is where that

604
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:32,679
on that line there which is where that
 

605
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:35,230
on that line there which is where that
centrifical energy is is going to pull

606
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:35,240
centrifical energy is is going to pull
 

607
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,750
centrifical energy is is going to pull
in

608
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:36,760
in
 

609
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,630
in
okay the hard part of this is that once

610
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:39,640
okay the hard part of this is that once
 

611
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,830
okay the hard part of this is that once
you start a turn people tend to use

612
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:43,840
you start a turn people tend to use
 

613
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,350
you start a turn people tend to use
their arms to turn and now you have your

614
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,360
their arms to turn and now you have your
 

615
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,710
their arms to turn and now you have your
deltoid doing this

616
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:51,720

 

617
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,789

thing so you have to keep your arm in

618
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
thing so you have to keep your arm in
 

619
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,430
thing so you have to keep your arm in
the same straight position the same

620
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:58,440
the same straight position the same
 

621
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,830
the same straight position the same
straight

622
00:17:59,830 --> 00:17:59,840
straight
 

623
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:19,190
straight
position and you do the

624
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200

 

625
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,789

turn don't come

626
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:25,799

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,310
side don't try to bring them in
and L so you have to still stay at the

630
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
and L so you have to still stay at the
 

631
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,990
and L so you have to still stay at the
edge of the power

632
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000

635
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,149

thech and the technique because you've

636
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:53,159
thech and the technique because you've
 

637
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:55,350
thech and the technique because you've
added another Force the centrifugal

638
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,360
added another Force the centrifugal
 

639
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,470
added another Force the centrifugal
force it should all become easier but

640
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
force it should all become easier but
 

641
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,350
force it should all become easier but
don't don't capitalize upon the

642
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:00,360
don't don't capitalize upon the
 

643
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,310
don't don't capitalize upon the
centrifical energy there's still the

644
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,320
centrifical energy there's still the
 

645
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:52,910
centrifical energy there's still the
internal aspect that you're doing

646
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:52,920

 

647
00:19:52,920 --> 00:20:24,909

649
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:40,920

okay try it

650
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:40,930

okay so

654
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
okay so
 

655
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,870

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,549
on the standard Emi
is it's not doable you're either going

678
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:31,559
is it's not doable you're either going
 

679
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,789
is it's not doable you're either going
to hurt

680
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
to hurt
 

681
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,789
to hurt
someone

682
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
someone
 

683
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,190
someone
um or you're just not going to do the

684
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,200
um or you're just not going to do the
 

685
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,350
um or you're just not going to do the
technique so you don't hurt them

686
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:40,360
technique so you don't hurt them
 

687
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,549
technique so you don't hurt them
okay uh or or and even in not doing the

688
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
okay uh or or and even in not doing the
 

689
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,430
okay uh or or and even in not doing the
technique you could also not do the

690
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:46,440
technique you could also not do the
 

691
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,230
technique you could also not do the
technique because you have to change the

692
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
technique because you have to change the
 

693
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,149
technique because you have to change the
technique because they change the energy

694
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:52,159
technique because they change the energy
 

695
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,070
technique because they change the energy
cue as you K okay they're going to

696
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,080
cue as you K okay they're going to
 

697
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,590
cue as you K okay they're going to
change the energy

698
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,600
change the energy
 

699
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,149
change the energy
Cube so we know how this technique

700
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
Cube so we know how this technique
 

701
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,830
Cube so we know how this technique

711
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,549

okay so if he's here and I do

712
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:18,559
okay so if he's here and I do
 

713
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,269
okay so if he's here and I do
that

714
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:21,279
that
 

715
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,430
that
okay and he's got to do a back RF fall

716
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,440
okay and he's got to do a back RF fall
 

717
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,750
okay and he's got to do a back RF fall
now

718
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:30,760

 

719
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,470

okay and we'll do it

720
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:35,480

 

721
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,750

again and he ended up doing what did you

722
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:40,760
again and he ended up doing what did you
 

723
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,269
again and he ended up doing what did you
do I feel like I had to take a step you

724
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:43,279
do I feel like I had to take a step you
 

725
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,630
do I feel like I had to take a step you
took a step

726
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:45,640
took a step
 

727
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,190
took a step
okay

728
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,200
okay
 

729
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,669
okay
um can you take a step in the

730
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
um can you take a step in the
 

731
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,909
um can you take a step in the
technique no okay why because my feet

732
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:54,919
technique no okay why because my feet
 

733
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:57,630
technique no okay why because my feet
are his feet are preoccupied with the

734
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:57,640
are his feet are preoccupied with the
 

735
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,470
are his feet are preoccupied with the
forward iner and they're being pinned

736
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
forward iner and they're being pinned
 

737
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,549
forward iner and they're being pinned
okay so let's add that okay got it so

738
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:05,559
okay so let's add that okay got it so
 

739
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:09,470
okay so let's add that okay got it so
here's the plane and now

740
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:09,480
here's the plane and now
 

741
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,789
here's the plane and now
it's and you can see now that you're

742
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
it's and you can see now that you're
 

743
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,470
it's and you can see now that you're
falling flatter and flatter as we go

744
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
falling flatter and flatter as we go
 

745
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,430
falling flatter and flatter as we go
okay um and that's nowhere near the

746
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:20,440
okay um and that's nowhere near the
 

747
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,510
okay um and that's nowhere near the
inertial values of the of the technique

748
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:24,520
inertial values of the of the technique
 

749
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,590
inertial values of the of the technique
okay so what usually happens is because

750
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:28,600
okay so what usually happens is because
 

751
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,950
okay so what usually happens is because
again Sean has a lot of years of a lot

752
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:31,960
again Sean has a lot of years of a lot
 

753
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,470
again Sean has a lot of years of a lot
of early years of fedorite training okay

754
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:35,480
of early years of fedorite training okay
 

755
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,630
of early years of fedorite training okay
and what you get in the beginning just

756
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:37,640
and what you get in the beginning just
 

757
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,029
and what you get in the beginning just
like kids it kind of sticks deeper okay

758
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
like kids it kind of sticks deeper okay
 

759
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,430
like kids it kind of sticks deeper okay
so when you

760
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:42,440
so when you
 

761
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,510
so when you
do your back rate fall you're you want

762
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:46,520
do your back rate fall you're you want
 

763
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,549
do your back rate fall you're you want
to always bring your hips back in

764
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:49,559
to always bring your hips back in
 

765
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,789
to always bring your hips back in
alignment with your shoulders okay uh

766
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
alignment with your shoulders okay uh
 

767
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,750
alignment with your shoulders okay uh
don't do the Contracting Center back

768
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:54,760
don't do the Contracting Center back
 

769
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,190
don't do the Contracting Center back
breakfall which I know you can do under

770
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
breakfall which I know you can do under
 

771
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,190
breakfall which I know you can do under
idealized conditions but always in the

772
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:00,200
idealized conditions but always in the
 

773
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,510
idealized conditions but always in the
technique you do the

774
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,520
technique you do the
 

775
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,350
technique you do the
bonai um back breakfall which requires

776
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
bonai um back breakfall which requires
 

777
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,630
bonai um back breakfall which requires
the the shoulders and the hips to come

778
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:09,640
the the shoulders and the hips to come
 

779
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,029
the the shoulders and the hips to come
back in alignment okay so you just do a

780
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039
back in alignment okay so you just do a
 

781
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,630
back in alignment okay so you just do a
normal back

782
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:14,640
normal back
 

783
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:26,789
normal back
rle there you go

784
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:26,799

 

785
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,350

Okay so if I were to put him in this

786
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,360
Okay so if I were to put him in this
 

787
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,510
Okay so if I were to put him in this
position and now he does that normal

788
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:32,520
position and now he does that normal
 

789
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,830
position and now he does that normal
back Rak fall you'll see that he puts

790
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:34,840
back Rak fall you'll see that he puts
 

791
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,269
back Rak fall you'll see that he puts
his hips back underneath his shoulders

792
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:37,279
his hips back underneath his shoulders
 

793
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:48,389
his hips back underneath his shoulders
and the

794
00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:48,399

 

795
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:51,830

B and the bom ey back breakfall this one

796
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:51,840
B and the bom ey back breakfall this one
 

797
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,190
B and the bom ey back breakfall this one
is by far better than the standard IAI

798
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
is by far better than the standard IAI
 

799
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,590
is by far better than the standard IAI
back breakfall okay because in the

800
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600
back breakfall okay because in the
 

801
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,630
back breakfall okay because in the
standard I kback breakfall they will sit

802
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,640
standard I kback breakfall they will sit
 

803
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,430
standard I kback breakfall they will sit
their butt back behind their shoulders

804
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
their butt back behind their shoulders
 

805
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,070
their butt back behind their shoulders
do you see and then they won't go to the

806
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
do you see and then they won't go to the
 

807
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,549
do you see and then they won't go to the
side they just go straight by

808
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:09,559
side they just go straight by
 

809
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:13,870
side they just go straight by
okay so if you are in an a standard IAI

810
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:13,880
okay so if you are in an a standard IAI
 

811
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,750
okay so if you are in an a standard IAI
dojo and you're going to put your butt

812
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:16,760
dojo and you're going to put your butt
 

813
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,350
dojo and you're going to put your butt
behind your shoulders do you see

814
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
behind your shoulders do you see
 

815
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,190
behind your shoulders do you see
that it's going to be very hard to take

816
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,200
that it's going to be very hard to take
 

817
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,430
that it's going to be very hard to take
this youi okay uh if you're even a bonai

818
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:28,440
this youi okay uh if you're even a bonai
 

819
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,830
this youi okay uh if you're even a bonai
uh person you're going to also have a

820
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:31,840
uh person you're going to also have a
 

821
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,230
uh person you're going to also have a
hard time we're going to have to train

822
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:33,240
hard time we're going to have to train
 

823
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,389
hard time we're going to have to train
slow and you're going to do this you see

824
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:36,399
slow and you're going to do this you see
 

825
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:39,269
slow and you're going to do this you see
that and then you go back

826
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279
that and then you go back
 

827
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,750
that and then you go back
now the person that is going to try to

828
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:42,760
now the person that is going to try to
 

829
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,149
now the person that is going to try to
get their hips either behind their

830
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:45,159
get their hips either behind their
 

831
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:48,630
get their hips either behind their
shoulders in standard IAI or in

832
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640
shoulders in standard IAI or in
 

833
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,590
shoulders in standard IAI or in
alignment with their shoulders with

834
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
alignment with their shoulders with
 

835
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,389
alignment with their shoulders with
bonai they know they in their mind they

836
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:55,399
bonai they know they in their mind they
 

837
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:57,590
bonai they know they in their mind they
know they have to do that so what they

838
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,600
know they have to do that so what they
 

839
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,430
know they have to do that so what they
start to do is less and less allow for

840
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:02,440
start to do is less and less allow for
 

841
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,549
start to do is less and less allow for
the deplaning of the shoulders and the

842
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:05,559
the deplaning of the shoulders and the
 

843
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:09,230
the deplaning of the shoulders and the
hips do you see and they start resisting

844
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:09,240
hips do you see and they start resisting
 

845
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,990
hips do you see and they start resisting
the

846
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000
the
 

847
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,750
the
technique okay this is not Emi that it

848
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:13,760
technique okay this is not Emi that it
 

849
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,590
technique okay this is not Emi that it
is resistance you're countering the

850
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
is resistance you're countering the
 

851
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,590
is resistance you're countering the
technique the technique is allowing your

852
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
technique the technique is allowing your
 

853
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,430
technique the technique is allowing your
hips to go forward you're like no I'm

854
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
hips to go forward you're like no I'm
 

855
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,470
hips to go forward you're like no I'm
going to counter it uh by not letting

856
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:22,480
going to counter it uh by not letting
 

857
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,430
going to counter it uh by not letting
myself go forward

858
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:24,440
myself go forward
 

859
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,950
myself go forward
okay

860
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:25,960
okay
 

861
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,710
okay
um and so let's say I'm I'm here here

862
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
um and so let's say I'm I'm here here
 

863
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,549
um and so let's say I'm I'm here here
you're grabbing okay and I go and he is

864
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559
you're grabbing okay and I go and he is
 

865
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,630
you're grabbing okay and I go and he is
not going to let those hips go forward

866
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,640
not going to let those hips go forward
 

867
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,389
not going to let those hips go forward
but if you pay

868
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:36,399
but if you pay
 

869
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:39,350
but if you pay
attention as my arm goes

870
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,360
attention as my arm goes
 

871
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,230
attention as my arm goes
up you

872
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:41,240
up you
 

873
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,669
up you
see you you have to be able to get

874
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:43,679
see you you have to be able to get
 

875
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,630
see you you have to be able to get
closer to me you see that and so there's

876
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:46,640
closer to me you see that and so there's
 

877
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,669
closer to me you see that and so there's
that tilt okay you got it and now if I

878
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:50,679
that tilt okay you got it and now if I
 

879
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:53,230
that tilt okay you got it and now if I
do this in the timing you'd have this

880
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:53,240
do this in the timing you'd have this
 

881
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,190
do this in the timing you'd have this
going and you have no means of uh you

882
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:56,200
going and you have no means of uh you
 

883
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,029
going and you have no means of uh you
still countered it did everyone see

884
00:26:58,029 --> 00:26:58,039
still countered it did everyone see
 

885
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:01,510
still countered it did everyone see
right what did he do Taylor he turned he

886
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
right what did he do Taylor he turned he
 

887
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,230
right what did he do Taylor he turned he
turned around the technique you see

888
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:03,240
turned around the technique you see
 

889
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,110
turned around the technique you see
which is possible going slow because he

890
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,120
which is possible going slow because he
 

891
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,430
which is possible going slow because he
can uh counter the inertia but going

892
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:10,440
can uh counter the inertia but going
 

893
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,029
can uh counter the inertia but going
fast which I'm going here do you see and

894
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:14,039
fast which I'm going here do you see and
 

895
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,190
fast which I'm going here do you see and
this all goes

896
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,200
this all goes
 

897
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,190
this all goes
into and then he falls flat okay you do

898
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
into and then he falls flat okay you do
 

899
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,750
into and then he falls flat okay you do
that over and over they're going to stop

900
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:21,760
that over and over they're going to stop
 

901
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,830
that over and over they're going to stop
coming in it just aren't going to like

902
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:23,840
coming in it just aren't going to like
 

903
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,950
coming in it just aren't going to like
it

904
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:24,960
it
 

905
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,870
it
okay now to answer your question

906
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:28,880
okay now to answer your question
 

907
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,669
okay now to answer your question
what was happening is as Tristan's

908
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:31,679
what was happening is as Tristan's
 

909
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,190
what was happening is as Tristan's
having you here and you take your hips

910
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,200
having you here and you take your hips
 

911
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,230
having you here and you take your hips
back into that PL the wrist gets exposed

912
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
back into that PL the wrist gets exposed
 

913
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,269
back into that PL the wrist gets exposed
you see and so that's why you're feeling

914
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:40,279
you see and so that's why you're feeling
 

915
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:40,990
you see and so that's why you're feeling
the

916
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,000
the
 

917
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,190
the
need that would be a way like okay I

918
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:44,200
need that would be a way like okay I
 

919
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,430
need that would be a way like okay I
can't practice this K on this he changed

920
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:48,440
can't practice this K on this he changed
 

921
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,750
can't practice this K on this he changed
the technique now I have to change the

922
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:50,760
the technique now I have to change the
 

923
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,990
the technique now I have to change the
technique I end up in the N okay and

924
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,000
technique I end up in the N okay and
 

925
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,789
technique I end up in the N okay and
that's what you were feeling okay if we

926
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:56,799
that's what you were feeling okay if we
 

927
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,110
that's what you were feeling okay if we
watch

928
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,120

 

929
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,630

Tristan's

930
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:01,640
Tristan's
 

931
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,789
Tristan's
Uki because his Center stays engaged as

mechanical what seems impossible to the

940
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,000
mechanical what seems impossible to the
 

941
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,230
mechanical what seems impossible to the
bonai or the IAI how do I get down from

942
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:21,240
bonai or the IAI how do I get down from
 

943
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,909
bonai or the IAI how do I get down from
here do do you get it and if that's why

944
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:24,919
here do do you get it and if that's why
 

945
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,549
here do do you get it and if that's why
he's he's so springy he's so springy

946
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:28,559
he's he's so springy he's so springy
 

947
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,509
he's he's so springy he's so springy
brings out now if you watch his feet

948
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:33,519
brings out now if you watch his feet
 

949
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,230
brings out now if you watch his feet
right they don't step cuz he can't step

950
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:37,240
right they don't step cuz he can't step
 

951
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,350
right they don't step cuz he can't step
but he still finds the fault his feet

952
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:39,360
but he still finds the fault his feet
 

953
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,590
but he still finds the fault his feet
stay where they are

954
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:41,600
stay where they are
 

955
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,350
stay where they are
okay

956
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,360
okay
 

957
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,909
okay
um and I don't think you can practice

958
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919
um and I don't think you can practice
 

959
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,190
um and I don't think you can practice
this technique on the other person

960
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:48,200
this technique on the other person
 

961
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,669
this technique on the other person
that's doing the other ukemi okay and

962
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:51,679
that's doing the other ukemi okay and
 

963
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,909
that's doing the other ukemi okay and
because you're in that dilemma okay I'm

964
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:54,919
because you're in that dilemma okay I'm
 

965
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,789
because you're in that dilemma okay I'm
going to hurt you or I don't hurt you in

966
00:28:58,789 --> 00:28:58,799
going to hurt you or I don't hurt you in
 

967
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,789
going to hurt you or I don't hurt you in
other words I I go slow enough to allow

968
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:01,799
other words I I go slow enough to allow
 

969
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,549
other words I I go slow enough to allow
you to counter the inertia and the

970
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:04,559
you to counter the inertia and the
 

971
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,789
you to counter the inertia and the
momentum uh but now I have to do a

972
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:06,799
momentum uh but now I have to do a
 

973
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,789
momentum uh but now I have to do a
different technique I have to do Niko

974
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
different technique I have to do Niko
 

975
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,430
different technique I have to do Niko
instead of the K okay to me that's very

976
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:12,440
instead of the K okay to me that's very
 

977
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,870
instead of the K okay to me that's very
problematic because these are not

978
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:14,880
problematic because these are not
 

979
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,389
problematic because these are not
Marshall techniques these are um

980
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:18,399
Marshall techniques these are um
 

981
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,710
Marshall techniques these are um
energetic techniques and within them you

982
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:21,720
energetic techniques and within them you
 

983
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,950
energetic techniques and within them you
are working those purification rituals

984
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:24,960
are working those purification rituals
 

985
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,549
are working those purification rituals
of alchemically modifying Yang aspect so

986
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:28,559
of alchemically modifying Yang aspect so
 

987
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,669
of alchemically modifying Yang aspect so
a better

988
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:29,679
a better
 

989
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,230
a better
solution is to teach them thei okay and

990
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,240
solution is to teach them thei okay and
 

991
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,310
solution is to teach them thei okay and
so what we do is he's going to lean back

992
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,320
so what we do is he's going to lean back
