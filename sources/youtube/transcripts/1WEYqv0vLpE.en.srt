and what does that have to do with
 

43
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,170
and what does that have to do with
Aikido now if you hear something like

44
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:53,180
Aikido now if you hear something like
 

45
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,700
Aikido now if you hear something like
that you know the founder of the the

46
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:54,710
that you know the founder of the the
 

47
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,710
that you know the founder of the the
system saying that ninety percent of the

48
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:56,720
system saying that ninety percent of the
 

49
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,110
system saying that ninety percent of the
system is about striking then you would

50
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
system is about striking then you would
 

51
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,880
system is about striking then you would
think wolven Aikido must be a boxing

52
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:00,890
think wolven Aikido must be a boxing
 

53
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,500
think wolven Aikido must be a boxing
system or at least must be really good

54
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:02,510
system or at least must be really good
 

55
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,020
system or at least must be really good
at dealing with boxing I think he had

56
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,030
at dealing with boxing I think he had
 

57
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,429
at dealing with boxing I think he had
something a little different in mind and

58
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:06,439
something a little different in mind and
 

59
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,260
something a little different in mind and
we'll kind of hit on that in an episode

60
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,270
we'll kind of hit on that in an episode
 

61
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,630
we'll kind of hit on that in an episode
here but mostly right now we're gonna

62
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
here but mostly right now we're gonna
 

63
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,980
here but mostly right now we're gonna
talk about the traditional trikes you

64
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:11,990
talk about the traditional trikes you
 

65
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,569
talk about the traditional trikes you
see in Aikido and why they exist and

66
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:13,579
see in Aikido and why they exist and
 

67
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:15,219
see in Aikido and why they exist and
those can be really hard to understand

68
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:15,229
those can be really hard to understand
 

69
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:16,960
those can be really hard to understand
because they look silly until you put

70
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:16,970
because they look silly until you put
 

71
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,340
because they look silly until you put
them in the right context and in this

72
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:18,350
them in the right context and in this
 

73
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,410
them in the right context and in this
video I will show you before the video

74
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:20,420
video I will show you before the video
 

75
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,240
video I will show you before the video
is over how they will look completely

76
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,250
is over how they will look completely
 

77
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,130
is over how they will look completely
normal and you'll say oh I think the

78
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:24,140
normal and you'll say oh I think the
 

79
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,930
normal and you'll say oh I think the
strikes actually happen all over the

80
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:25,940
strikes actually happen all over the
 

81
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,490
strikes actually happen all over the
place right so people go oh man those

82
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:27,500
place right so people go oh man those
 

83
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,230
place right so people go oh man those
strikes look silly and no one ever uses

strikes look silly and no one ever uses
that and techniques need to be

86
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:30,590
that and techniques need to be
 

87
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,590
that and techniques need to be
modernized and updated that's not true

88
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:32,600
modernized and updated that's not true
 

89
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,359
modernized and updated that's not true
the techniques that are using iq2 for
