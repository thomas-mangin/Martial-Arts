510
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,270

511
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,490

maybe take this arm hold there move up

maybe take this arm hold there move up
 

513
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,830

right maybe I give him my arm and I'm

00:24:59,830 --> 00:24:59,840
right maybe I give him my arm and I'm
 

515
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,850

going to continue that same movement

going to continue that same movement
 

517

I'll stay connected and he can stop

529
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:19,600

fill the space do you see how I'm doing

530
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:19,610
fill the space do you see how I'm doing
 

531
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,870
fill the space do you see how I'm doing

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880

533
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:30,250

537
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,780

have to give me the in space up and I'm
 

539
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,060

543
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,790

understand that and then get back to cut

544
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:43,800

00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:27,410
structural integrity to make myself move
 

693
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:30,070
structural integrity to make myself move

doing this stuff already there is a

704
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:48,640
doing this stuff already there is a
 

705
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,940
doing this stuff already there is a
capacity to generate the friction it is

706
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:51,950
capacity to generate the friction it is
 

707
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:58,690

a friction that's happening I have and
 

713
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:14,440
a friction that's happening I have and
it comes from the relaxation so you know

714
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:14,450
it comes from the relaxation so you know
 

715
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,270
it comes from the relaxation so you know
how sometimes you guys your guys don't

cuz there's the kind of stickiness this
 

723
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:28,450
cuz there's the kind of stickiness this
is stickiness that's happening and that

724
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:28,460
is stickiness that's happening and that
 

725
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:33,820
is stickiness that's happening and that
only comes from that relaxed structure

726
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:33,830
only comes from that relaxed structure
 

727
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,160
only comes from that relaxed structure
do you understand okay so we're going

728
