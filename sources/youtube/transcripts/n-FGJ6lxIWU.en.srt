there's a very important point that you

40
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
there's a very important point that you
 

41
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,190
there's a very important point that you
need to understand

need to understand
this is technically

44
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560

 

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,590

here

46
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
here
 

47

on the whole length of your ken it's not

178
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
on the whole length of your ken it's not
 

179
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,070
on the whole length of your ken it's not
just

180
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
just
 

181
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,749
just
not just parts

182
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759

 

183
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,030

the whole length of the ken

184
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
the whole length of the ken
 

185
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,030
the whole length of the ken
that second cabin tattoo first weapons

186
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
that second cabin tattoo first weapons
 

187
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,990
that second cabin tattoo first weapons
uh

188
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
uh
 

189
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,990
uh
variation yuck

190
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000

 

191
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,510

and you just think everything parallel

192
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
and you just think everything parallel
 

193
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,710
and you just think everything parallel
right down then

194
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720

 

195
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:00,310

the next one's interesting

196
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320

 

197
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,550

you press it on their stomach

198
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
you press it on their stomach
 

199
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,909
you press it on their stomach
like that

200
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
like that
 

201
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,390
like that
and so you don't go wrong and turn the

202
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
and so you don't go wrong and turn the
 

203
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,590
and so you don't go wrong and turn the
wrong way you just keep pushing

204
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
wrong way you just keep pushing
 

205
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,270
wrong way you just keep pushing
and pushing and pushing and pushing and

206
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
and pushing and pushing and pushing and
 

207
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,510
and pushing and pushing and pushing and
pushing

208
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
pushing
 

209
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,590
pushing
and it will turn it into exactly where

210
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
and it will turn it into exactly where
 

211
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:31,909
and it will turn it into exactly where
it needs to be

212
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919

 

213
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,150

those who think that you can get high

214
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
those who think that you can get high
 

215
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,590
those who think that you can get high
remember you're going to chase partners

216
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
remember you're going to chase partners
 

217
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,550
remember you're going to chase partners
again

218
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
again
 

219
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,230
again
so it's always going to be difficult

220
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
so it's always going to be difficult
 

221
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,990
so it's always going to be difficult
because you've got someone new to blend

222
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
because you've got someone new to blend
 

223
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,950
because you've got someone new to blend
to

224
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
to
 

225
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,110
to
so the challenge today really is in that

226
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
so the challenge today really is in that
 

227
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,070
so the challenge today really is in that
as well

228
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080

 

229
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:58,950

yup

230
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960

 

231
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,270

it doesn't actually hit the chest

232
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
it doesn't actually hit the chest
 

233
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,749
it doesn't actually hit the chest
but for you to get the direction i'd

234
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
but for you to get the direction i'd
 

235
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,990
but for you to get the direction i'd
like you to put it on there and keep

236
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
like you to put it on there and keep
 

237
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,189
like you to put it on there and keep
pushing it so that it

238
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
pushing it so that it
 

239
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,270
pushing it so that it
it shows you where it needs to go

240
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
it shows you where it needs to go
 

241
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,350
it shows you where it needs to go
and you cut the back of their head they

242
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
and you cut the back of their head they
 

243
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,629
and you cut the back of their head they
say the shoulder i don't care what it is

244
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
say the shoulder i don't care what it is
 

245
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,870
say the shoulder i don't care what it is
as long as you end up in the right place

246
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
as long as you end up in the right place
 

247
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:28,070
as long as you end up in the right place
at

248
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080

 

249
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,309

it's very simple

250
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
it's very simple
 

251
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:40,230
it's very simple
it's not so simple is it

252
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240

 

253
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,469

just made it
so you get

298
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
so you get
 

299
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,550
so you get
here

300
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560

your end up so you don't really know

304
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
your end up so you don't really know
 

305
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,950
your end up so you don't really know
where you're going

306
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960

 

307
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,350

the closer i get to him

308
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
the closer i get to him
 

309
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,670
the closer i get to him
hard you you should all know this they

00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
hard you you should all know this they
 

311
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,830
hard you you should all know this they
can't punch you if you're that close

312
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840

 

313
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,070

so watch where i go this isn't the

314
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
so watch where i go this isn't the
 

315
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:25,510
so watch where i go this isn't the
second kim attack somehow

316
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520

 

317
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,950

all right

318
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
all right
 

319
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,950
all right
i put myself in the middle and show you

320
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
i put myself in the middle and show you
 

321
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,350
i put myself in the middle and show you
what i put myself in the middle

322
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
what i put myself in the middle
 

323
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:40,709
what i put myself in the middle
because i need him to have a target

324
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719

 

325
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,589

now i vanish

326
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599

 

327
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:57,350

so where is that in this

328
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360

 

329
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,030

i have to leave

330
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
i have to leave
 

331
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,710
i have to leave
i could be here

332
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
i could be here
 

333
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,430
i could be here
so that

334
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440

 

335
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,350

he can see me

336
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
he can see me
 

337
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,550
he can see me
i mustn't not let him see me

338
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
i mustn't not let him see me
 

339
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,070
i mustn't not let him see me
until

340
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
until
 

341
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,389
until
it starts to cut and then i i know it's

342
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
it starts to cut and then i i know it's
 

343
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,310
it starts to cut and then i i know it's
safe to go

344
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
safe to go
 

345
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,230
safe to go
so there is a lot in there

346
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240

 

347
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,269

yuck

348
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
yuck
 

349
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,710
yuck
ah

350
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720

 

351
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,790

if you're not at this angle

352
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
if you're not at this angle
 

353
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,590
if you're not at this angle
if you're around here that's too far

354
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
if you're around here that's too far
 

355
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,070
if you're around here that's too far
you should be cutting

356
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080

 

357
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:48,710

you should be cutting

358
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720

 

359
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,710

this is what you do without you knowing

360
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
this is what you do without you knowing
 

361
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,630
this is what you do without you knowing
it you actually

362
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
it you actually
 

363
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,790
it you actually
almost do what he does so you see the

364
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
almost do what he does so you see the
 

365
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,110
almost do what he does so you see the
distance between me and his chest

366
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
distance between me and his chest
 

367
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,030
distance between me and his chest
so when you go to then put it on his

368
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
so when you go to then put it on his
 

369
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,150
so when you go to then put it on his
chest

370
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160

 

371
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,389

it's a really big jump you go

372
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
it's a really big jump you go
 

373
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,630
it's a really big jump you go
cool i had a really big jump to get

374
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
cool i had a really big jump to get
 

375
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,230
cool i had a really big jump to get
around the back there

376
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
around the back there
 

377
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,150
around the back there
and it's because

378
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160

 

379
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,750

i've seen you know when you see these

380
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
i've seen you know when you see these
 

381
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,590
i've seen you know when you see these
illusionists they

382
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
illusionists they
 

383
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,630
illusionists they
they'll

384
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
they'll
 

385
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,590
they'll
make a

386
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
make a
 

387
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,750
make a
jumper jumping jet

388
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
jumper jumping jet
 

389
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,790
jumper jumping jet
vanish

390
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
vanish
 

391
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,110
vanish
we go it was out there it's an illusion

392
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
we go it was out there it's an illusion
 

393
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,590
we go it was out there it's an illusion
i still haven't worked it out

394
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
i still haven't worked it out
 

395
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,670
i still haven't worked it out
so here

396
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
so here
 

397
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,710
so here
here

398
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
here
 

399
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,750
here
this tip when he lifts i actually don't

400
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
this tip when he lifts i actually don't
 

401
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,509
this tip when he lifts i actually don't
take off i actually go underneath him

402
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
take off i actually go underneath him
 

403
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,389
take off i actually go underneath him
so when he releases me

404
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
so when he releases me
 

405
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,230
so when he releases me
i actually

406
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
i actually
 

407
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,030
i actually
go to him and that never comes back that

408
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
go to him and that never comes back that
 

409
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,630
go to him and that never comes back that
way again that way

410
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
way again that way
 

411
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,430
way again that way
he does the bigger jump

412
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
he does the bigger jump
 

413
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,829
he does the bigger jump
and i do a small jump

414
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
and i do a small jump
 

415
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,750
and i do a small jump
because i don't have to go through the

416
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
because i don't have to go through the
 

417
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,110
because i don't have to go through the
effort right

418
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
effort right
 

419
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,910
effort right
so again it's a it's a bit lift lifted

420
00:10:59,910 --> 00:10:59,920
so again it's a it's a bit lift lifted
 

421
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,150
so again it's a it's a bit lift lifted
it's a bit like a

422
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
it's a bit like a
 

423
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,910
it's a bit like a
if you go like that

424
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:03,920
if you go like that
 

425
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,110
if you go like that
already

426
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
already
 

427
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,630
already
i've got am i going to get from here to

428
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
i've got am i going to get from here to
 

429
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,110
i've got am i going to get from here to
behind him because i've stopped him i've

430
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
behind him because i've stopped him i've
 

431
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,670
behind him because i've stopped him i've
slowed him up so he'll just do a perhaps

432
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
slowed him up so he'll just do a perhaps
 

433
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,949
slowed him up so he'll just do a perhaps
a half step or something he won't do a

434
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
a half step or something he won't do a
 

435
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,550
a half step or something he won't do a
big step

436
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
big step
 

437
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:27,430
big step
so my attempt he wasn't made

438
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440

 

439
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,150

so

440
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160

 

441
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,069

you can only do this by repetition

442
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
you can only do this by repetition
 

443
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,670
you can only do this by repetition
overnight what you want to do is you

444
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
overnight what you want to do is you
 

445
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,230
overnight what you want to do is you
want to get your best mate if you can or

446
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
want to get your best mate if you can or
 

447
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,110
want to get your best mate if you can or
your worst enemy somebody and just do it

448
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
your worst enemy somebody and just do it
 

449
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,949
your worst enemy somebody and just do it
and do it and do it and do it

450
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
and do it and do it and do it
 

451
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,150
and do it and do it and do it
but then when you've done it lots and

452
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
but then when you've done it lots and
 

453
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,389
but then when you've done it lots and
lots of times and video yourself and

454
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
lots of times and video yourself and
 

455
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,750
lots of times and video yourself and
then look at all the things you've done

456
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
then look at all the things you've done
 

457
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,760
then look at all the things you've done
wrong
