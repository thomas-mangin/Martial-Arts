you see it's a exact same move there's

82
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,040
you see it's a exact same move there's
 

83
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,470
you see it's a exact same move there's
only one move in iido it's this it's

84
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
only one move in iido it's this it's
 

85
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,229
only one move in iido it's this it's
just that because in if you define IO

86
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
just that because in if you define IO
 

87
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,990

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,000
was Kona there's only one move in the
 

89
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,630
was Kona there's only one move in the
application of kona it's that okay

90
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:53,640
application of kona it's that okay
 

91
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,830
application of kona it's that okay
because this is non-c contestation

92
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
because this is non-c contestation
 

93
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,830
because this is non-c contestation
because this is the uh Genesis and Regen

94
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
because this is the uh Genesis and Regen

that's all you have okay and it
 

99
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,910
that's all you have okay and it
works

100
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
works
 

101
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,949
works
um here's though what what deceives

102
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959

 

103
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,390

so all the lineage okay all that lineage

110
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
so all the lineage okay all that lineage
 

111
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,630
so all the lineage okay all that lineage
too

112
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640
too
 

113
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,429
too
again they're doing this

114
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:32,439
again they're doing this
 

115
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,990
again they're doing this
shape

116
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
shape
 

117
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,869
shape
okay

118
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:35,879
okay
 

119
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,910
okay
is again looking at the there's the top

120
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
is again looking at the there's the top
 

121
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,509
is again looking at the there's the top
view of the head and the top view of the

122
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:42,519
view of the head and the top view of the
 

123
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,949
view of the head and the top view of the
spine then it hits the nogget line

124
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:45,959
spine then it hits the nogget line
 

125
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,390
spine then it hits the nogget line
here's the top view of the

126
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
here's the top view of the
 

127
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,910
here's the top view of the
head I'm sorry of the spine and then

128
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
head I'm sorry of the spine and then
 

129
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,910
head I'm sorry of the spine and then
here's the top view of the head they get

130
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
here's the top view of the head they get
 

131
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,670
here's the top view of the head they get
that L shape they bend them over you see

132
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:56,680
that L shape they bend them over you see
 

133
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,910
that L shape they bend them over you see
and then we know eventually they're

134
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
and then we know eventually they're
 

135
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,229
and then we know eventually they're
going to bring them up and then they're

136
00:03:59,229 --> 00:03:59,239
going to bring them up and then they're
 

137
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,350
going to bring them up and then they're
going to bring them down like that okay

138
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:02,360
going to bring them down like that okay
 

139
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,990
going to bring them down like that okay
So eventually this comes back here the

140
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
So eventually this comes back here the
 

141
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,270
So eventually this comes back here the
head comes back over and then the head

142
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:08,280
head comes back over and then the head
 

143
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,789
head comes back over and then the head
goes behind the spine they're now going

144
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
goes behind the spine they're now going
 

145
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,030
goes behind the spine they're now going
backwards so let's let's look at that

146
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
backwards so let's let's look at that
 

147
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,590
backwards so let's let's look at that
point right there okay so we're now

148
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:16,600
point right there okay so we're now
 

149
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,590
point right there okay so we're now
two-dimensional here's the lower part of

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:18,600
two-dimensional here's the lower part of
 

151
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,789
two-dimensional here's the lower part of
the

152
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799

 

153
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,230

154
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,240
body and here's the upper part of the
 

155
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,510
body and here's the upper part of the
body going

156
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520

 

157
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,909

backwards and Naga is now going this way

158
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:30,919
backwards and Naga is now going this way
 

159
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:34,189
