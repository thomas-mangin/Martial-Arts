00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,350
the space and this side fill the space
 

67
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:18,960
the space and this side fill the space
mmm show the space okay let's try this

okay let's go so we already have some
 

209
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,580
okay let's go so we already have some
deviation but the concepts remain the

210
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:19,590
deviation but the concepts remain the
 

211
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,840
deviation but the concepts remain the
same so first thing is we're not doing

212
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:23,850
same so first thing is we're not doing
