00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,430

fall does he come up yes but does he

176
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:16,440
fall does he come up yes but does he
 

177
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,990
fall does he come up yes but does he
turn no does he turn himself no okay on

178
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,000
turn no does he turn himself no okay on
 

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,070
turn no does he turn himself no okay on
this one I'm going to turn him with this

180
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
this one I'm going to turn him with this
 

181
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,589
this one I'm going to turn him with this
maneuver

182
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599

 

183
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,589

yes because the hands the same does he

yes because the hands the same does he
 

185
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,909
yes because the hands the same does he
come forward is is Chris's pressure here

186
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
come forward is is Chris's pressure here
 

187
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,149
come forward is is Chris's pressure here
you see yes

188
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:41,159
you see yes
 

189
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,990
you see yes
okay but now I take the B leg and move

190
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,000
okay but now I take the B leg and move
 

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,590
okay but now I take the B leg and move
it around you see I don't move

192
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:48,600
it around you see I don't move
 

193
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,230
it around you see I don't move
his I don't let his front

194
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,240
his I don't let his front
 

195
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,910
his I don't let his front
leg turn all right like that nor do I

196
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:56,920
leg turn all right like that nor do I
 

197
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,590
leg turn all right like that nor do I
let him do that okay I don't make I

let him do that okay I don't make I
 

199
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,630
let him do that okay I don't make I
don't let him do that he can't do it so

200
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
don't let him do that he can't do it so
 

201
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,350
don't let him do that he can't do it so
he comes forward there's the front leg

202
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:06,360
he comes forward there's the front leg
 

203
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,389
he comes forward there's the front leg
then I turn

204
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:09,399

 

205
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:21,710

him you're

206
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:21,720

 

207
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,310

turning you can talk this on the way

208
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
turning you can talk this on the way
 

209
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:33,949
turning you can talk this on the way
down

210
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:33,959

 

211
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,949

and

212
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959

 

213
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,430

she P

214
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:40,440

 

215
00:09:40,440 --> 00:10:08,350

you okay try it

216
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:08,360

 

217
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,790

all right so again we're trying to see

218
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
all right so again we're trying to see
 

219
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,310
all right so again we're trying to see
the difference between the koku hand and

220
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,320
the difference between the koku hand and
 

221
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,470
the difference between the koku hand and
the and the tenin hand so my Earth

222
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:17,480
the and the tenin hand so my Earth
 

223
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,110
the and the tenin hand so my Earth
hand yes he's spal displacing so yes

224
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
hand yes he's spal displacing so yes
 

225
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,030
hand yes he's spal displacing so yes
there's a Yin yield but I'm also I want

226
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040
there's a Yin yield but I'm also I want
 

227
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,110
there's a Yin yield but I'm also I want
you to

228
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,120
you to
 

229
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,470
you to
feel that in here there's like a four

230
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
feel that in here there's like a four
 

231
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:37,110
feel that in here there's like a four
that's bringing you in got it is a force

232
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120

 

233
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,430

here so on the I'm not just getting out

234
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:40,440
here so on the I'm not just getting out
 

235
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,590
here so on the I'm not just getting out
of the way it's moving you do you see

236
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
of the way it's moving you do you see
 

237
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,030
of the way it's moving you do you see
there's

238
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040

 

239
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,190

teni it's on the inside and it's a

240
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,200
teni it's on the inside and it's a
 

241
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,269
teni it's on the inside and it's a
bigger spiral but do do you feel that

242
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
bigger spiral but do do you feel that
 

243
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,629
bigger spiral but do do you feel that
Force

is going to turn and get his elbow St

250
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
is going to turn and get his elbow St
 

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,389
is going to turn and get his elbow St
and you're going to get his elbow the

and you're going to get his elbow the
 

253
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,030
and you're going to get his elbow the
counter force is here going this

254
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040

just brings you in and this one gets
 

259
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,790
just brings you in and this one gets
your elbow and brings that elbow

260
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:21,800
your elbow and brings that elbow
 

261
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,590
your elbow and brings that elbow
in so that's where you need to feel it

262
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:24,600
in so that's where you need to feel it
 

263
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,069
in so that's where you need to feel it
you you can't just get out of the way

264
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
you you can't just get out of the way
 

265
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,470
you you can't just get out of the way
get out of the way okay you're inside

266
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
get out of the way okay you're inside
 

267
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,990
get out of the way okay you're inside
here on the grip right here that's where

268
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,000
here on the grip right here that's where
 

269
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,190
here on the grip right here that's where
you move him

270
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
you move him
 

271
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,030
you move him
forward and on the other one it's on his

272
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,040
forward and on the other one it's on his
 

273
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,870
forward and on the other one it's on his
elbow that moves him forward

274
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:43,880
elbow that moves him forward
 

275
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,470
elbow that moves him forward
okay likewise on on these Heaven

276
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:47,480
okay likewise on on these Heaven
 

277
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,069
okay likewise on on these Heaven
hands when you are

278
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:51,079
hands when you are
 

279
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:55,470
hands when you are
here they don't do the C you on the same

280
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:55,480
here they don't do the C you on the same
 

281
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,310
here they don't do the C you on the same
part of his body okay so I was using

282
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
part of his body okay so I was using
 

283
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,870
part of his body okay so I was using
that to bring him

284
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
that to bring him
 

285
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,710
that to bring him
forward and it's not going to work going

286
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:05,720
forward and it's not going to work going
 

287
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,269
forward and it's not going to work going
the other way okay and that's why you

288
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
the other way okay and that's why you
 

289
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,190
the other way okay and that's why you
changed your adhesion point so your

290
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,200
changed your adhesion point so your
 

291
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,230
changed your adhesion point so your
adhesion point is no not in his group

292
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:15,240
adhesion point is no not in his group
 

293
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,430
adhesion point is no not in his group
anymore it's on his

294
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:20,440

 

295
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,310

head so

296
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
head so
 

297
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,389
head so
ten is going to use this kind of energy

298
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:27,399
ten is going to use this kind of energy
 

299
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,550
ten is going to use this kind of energy
and then this energy

300
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
and then this energy
 

301
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,710
and then this energy
making a circle in between so they're

302
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
making a circle in between so they're
 

303
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,550
making a circle in between so they're
they're not conflicting okay so you you

304
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:35,560
they're not conflicting okay so you you
 

305
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,230
they're not conflicting okay so you you
can feel it then I'm here there's the

306
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:39,240
can feel it then I'm here there's the
 

307
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,910
can feel it then I'm here there's the
circle on your face right such that for

308
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
circle on your face right such that for
 

309
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,509
circle on your face right such that for
example they can let go he's not holding

310
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:48,519
example they can let go he's not holding
 

311
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,990
example they can let go he's not holding
and I'll still get that you see and he

312
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,000
and I'll still get that you see and he
 

313
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,069
and I'll still get that you see and he
can take his arm off

314
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:53,079
can take his arm off
 

315
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:55,590
can take his arm off
completely the technique still has his

316
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
completely the technique still has his
 

317
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,389
completely the technique still has his
contact points okay

318
00:12:59,389 --> 00:12:59,399
contact points okay
 

319
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,750
contact points okay
on the

320
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:00,760
on the
 

321
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,629
on the
Kos it's in his elbow that I want okay

322
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:05,639
Kos it's in his elbow that I want okay
 

323
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,710
Kos it's in his elbow that I want okay
so I go to his elbow to bring him

324
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:07,720
so I go to his elbow to bring him
 

325
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,870
so I go to his elbow to bring him
forward not not his grip his

326
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:11,880
forward not not his grip his
 

327
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,829
forward not not his grip his
elbow is bringing him forward like

328
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
elbow is bringing him forward like
 

329
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,870
elbow is bringing him forward like
that from this adhesion

330
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
that from this adhesion
 

331
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,150
that from this adhesion
Point okay now once you get here this

332
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,160
Point okay now once you get here this
 

333
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,670
Point okay now once you get here this
does not go up to the head because he's

334
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:26,680
does not go up to the head because he's
 

335
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,269
does not go up to the head because he's
turning under it there's really no

336
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
turning under it there's really no
 

337
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,550
turning under it there's really no
pressure

338
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:31,560
pressure
 

339
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,710
pressure
