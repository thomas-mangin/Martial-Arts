1
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,830

can you see this

2
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:56,840
can you see this
 

3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,670
can you see this
part okay so

4
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
part okay so
 

5
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,349
part okay so
you want to

6
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
you want to
 

7
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,149
you want to
avoid that 45 degree angle because

8
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
avoid that 45 degree angle because
 

9
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,390
avoid that 45 degree angle because
that's where all my attacks are

10
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
that's where all my attacks are
 

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,070
that's where all my attacks are
okay

12
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
okay
 

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,030
okay
and

14
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
and
 

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,590
and
if you need to sometimes you can't

16
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
if you need to sometimes you can't
 

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,469
if you need to sometimes you can't
identify 45 degree angle

18
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479
identify 45 degree angle
 

19
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,950
identify 45 degree angle
try to keep your shoulders below

20
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:16,960
try to keep your shoulders below
 

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,510
try to keep your shoulders below
or on that side of where my belt is

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
or on that side of where my belt is
 

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,749
or on that side of where my belt is
okay so if you do that again

24
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
okay so if you do that again
 

25
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,030
okay so if you do that again
and you see

26
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
and you see
 

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,230
and you see
you're right there

28
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
you're right there
 

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,870
you're right there
okay and as you went up

30
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
okay and as you went up
 

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,789
okay and as you went up
dude do the mistake again

32
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
dude do the mistake again
 

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,030
dude do the mistake again
go we'll say you see

34
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
go we'll say you see
 

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,789
go we'll say you see
do it again right there and that's when

36
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
do it again right there and that's when
 

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:43,429
do it again right there and that's when
i can do the knee pull

38
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439

 

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,350

you're off to the races okay

40
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
you're off to the races okay
 

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,109
you're off to the races okay
so

42
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119

 

43
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,030

as you're doing the drill don't just go

44
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
as you're doing the drill don't just go
 

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,270
as you're doing the drill don't just go
through it and take advantage of

46
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
through it and take advantage of
 

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,590
through it and take advantage of
a lot of stuff's been taken out keep

48
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
a lot of stuff's been taken out keep
 

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,830
a lot of stuff's been taken out keep
those caveats in mind

50
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
those caveats in mind
 

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,030
those caveats in mind
okay

52
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040

 

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,109

and then on this

54
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
and then on this
 

55
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,350
and then on this
now this is a little different from what

56
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
now this is a little different from what
 

57
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,429
now this is a little different from what
you're doing okay

58
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
you're doing okay
 

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,389
you're doing okay
so

60
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
so
 

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,790
so
what what you don't want

62
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
what what you don't want
 

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,229
what what you don't want
is for him to snag your foot

64
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
is for him to snag your foot
 

65
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,550
is for him to snag your foot
right into half guard

66
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
right into half guard
 

67
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,589
right into half guard
you see

68
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
you see
 

69
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,390
you see
and what actually gives them that

70
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
and what actually gives them that
 

71
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,110
and what actually gives them that
is that knee there

72
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
is that knee there
 

73
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,910
is that knee there
so

74
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
so
 

75
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,990
so
you're smelling the

76
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
you're smelling the
 

77
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,750
you're smelling the
the mouth too

78
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
the mouth too
 

79
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,630
the mouth too
much

80
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
much
 

81
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,350
much
and that's where it gets it

82
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360

 

83
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,710

so this technique

84
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
so this technique
 

85
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,790
so this technique
i'm going to open it up

86
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
i'm going to open it up
 

87
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,390
i'm going to open it up
you're going to kind of pass through a

88
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
you're going to kind of pass through a
 

89
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,309
you're going to kind of pass through a
modified neon belly you see

90
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
modified neon belly you see
 

91
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,190
modified neon belly you see
and then the knee slides down

92
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,200
and then the knee slides down
 

93
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,990
and then the knee slides down
here

94
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
here
 

95
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,910
here
you have to watch because you you think

96
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
you have to watch because you you think
 

97
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,470
you have to watch because you you think
you're doing it but you actually pivoted

98
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
you're doing it but you actually pivoted
 

99
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,070
you're doing it but you actually pivoted
on this side

100
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080

 

101
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,390

and that's going to give him that hook

102
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
and that's going to give him that hook
 

103
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,470
and that's going to give him that hook
when he tries to get it you're going to

104
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
when he tries to get it you're going to
 

105
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,670
when he tries to get it you're going to
get it

106
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
get it
 

107
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,550
get it
and you're good it's over here

108
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
and you're good it's over here
 

109
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,309
and you're good it's over here
so leaving it open

110
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
so leaving it open
 

111
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,470
so leaving it open
this technique goes like this

112
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480

 

113
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,630

okay you see that difference

114
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
okay you see that difference
 

115
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,990
okay you see that difference
oh

116
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
oh
 

117
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,830
oh
i'm

118
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
i'm
 

119
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,750
i'm
here move

120
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
here move
 

121
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,030
here move
pop

122
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040

 

123
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:43,190

okay

124
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200

 

125
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:57,270

shoulder shoulder line shoulder line

126
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280

 

127
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,350

cook with that other leg cook with your

128
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
cook with that other leg cook with your
 

129
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,550
cook with that other leg cook with your
left leg too

130
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
left leg too
 

131
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,910
left leg too
grab them

132
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920

 

133
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:26,070

shoulder line

134
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080

 

135
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,870

so

136
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
so
 

137
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,870
so
working my technique

138
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880

 

139
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,510

this this hand this hand

140
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
this this hand this hand
 

141
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,189
this this hand this hand
isn't just for me

142
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
isn't just for me
 

143
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,870
isn't just for me
okay

144
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
okay
 

145
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,189
okay
um

146
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
um
 

147
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,710
um
a lot of people

148
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
a lot of people
 

149
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,469
a lot of people
have a training scar

150
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
have a training scar
 

151
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,070
have a training scar
and he's going to stay on the ground

152
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
and he's going to stay on the ground
 

153
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,909
and he's going to stay on the ground
and then that leads to another training

154
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
and then that leads to another training
 

155
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,790
and then that leads to another training
scar

156
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
scar
 

157
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,950
scar
that i don't have to try to keep him on

158
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
that i don't have to try to keep him on
 

159
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,110
that i don't have to try to keep him on
the ground to get that

160
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
the ground to get that
 

161
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,350
the ground to get that
so

162
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360

 

163
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,350

we don't we don't really have that

164
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
we don't we don't really have that
 

165
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,430
we don't we don't really have that
problem here because

166
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
problem here because
 

167
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,430
problem here because
when we start going

168
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
when we start going
 

169
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,990
when we start going
a little more live he wants to try to

170
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
a little more live he wants to try to
 

171
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,310
a little more live he wants to try to
get off the ground you see that

172
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
get off the ground you see that
 

173
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,029
get off the ground you see that
um but in these drills at the beginner

174
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
um but in these drills at the beginner
 

175
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,469
um but in these drills at the beginner
levels he's not he's being constrained

176
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
levels he's not he's being constrained
 

177
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,629
levels he's not he's being constrained
to stay in position and then you're

178
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
to stay in position and then you're
 

179
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,909
to stay in position and then you're
milking it

180
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919

do you understand that and the first

606
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
do you understand that and the first
 

607
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,430
do you understand that and the first
part

00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,440
part
 

609
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,269
part
the first thing you have to do

610
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
the first thing you have to do
 

611
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,310
the first thing you have to do
is to realize that your mind is is

612
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
is to realize that your mind is is
 

613

form it sees the world like that okay
and so the first tool you want to use is

618
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
and so the first tool you want to use is
 

619
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,350
and so the first tool you want to use is
pay attention

620
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
pay attention
 

621
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,389
pay attention
to

622
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
to
 

623
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,269
to
the

624
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279
the
 

625
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,750
the
silence between the notes

626
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,760
silence between the notes
 

627
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,629
silence between the notes
okay the silence between the notes so

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,790

but that makes sense only because of the

632
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800
but that makes sense only because of the
 

633
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,269
but that makes sense only because of the
silence no one ever goes

634
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
silence no one ever goes

this silent part between the mountains
is killing me do you and then that's

704
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
is killing me do you and then that's
 

705
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,430
is killing me do you and then that's
much easier to mount when the person

706
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
much easier to mount when the person
 

707
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,590
much easier to mount when the person

1053
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,270
thing you want to get in position
incrementally okay what you want to do

1054
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
incrementally okay what you want to do
 

1055
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,950
incrementally okay what you want to do
what you want to do is have faith in

1056
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:18,960
what you want to do is have faith in
 

1057
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,350
what you want to do is have faith in
this technique that i'm here like this

1058
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,360
this technique that i'm here like this
 

1059
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,149
this technique that i'm here like this
and i'm stuck on him okay

1060
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
and i'm stuck on him okay
 

1061
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,950
and i'm stuck on him okay
uh with my leverage okay so i don't have

1062
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:28,960
uh with my leverage okay so i don't have
 

1063
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,510
uh with my leverage okay so i don't have
uh any of the bass and let's say he

1064
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
uh any of the bass and let's say he
 

1065
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,070
uh any of the bass and let's say he
wants to push me off do you see but i'm

1066
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
wants to push me off do you see but i'm
 

1067
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,950
wants to push me off do you see but i'm
gonna just do it like this so just go

1068
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
gonna just do it like this so just go
 

1069
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,510
gonna just do it like this so just go
ahead there's some resistance

1070
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,520
ahead there's some resistance
 

1071
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,190
ahead there's some resistance
that i'm offering just with my

1072
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
that i'm offering just with my
 

1073
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,870
that i'm offering just with my
positioning you see

1074
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:42,880
positioning you see
 

1075
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,990
positioning you see
but the weight is on on him

1076
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,000
but the weight is on on him
 

1077
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,669
but the weight is on on him
so when i go

1078
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
so when i go
 

1079
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,470
so when i go
i'm going to trust all of that

1080
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,480
i'm going to trust all of that
 

1081
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,230
i'm going to trust all of that
and not

1082
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
and not
 

1083
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,230
and not
post

1084
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
post
 

1085
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,630
post
you trust all all of that

1086
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,640
you trust all all of that
 

1087
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,310
you trust all all of that
is on him

1088
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,320
is on him
 

1089
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,590
is on him
so the butt stays down on him

1090
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:01,600
so the butt stays down on him
 

1091
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,549
so the butt stays down on him
okay

1092
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:02,559
okay
 

1093
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,549
okay
and you don't

1094
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
and you don't
 

1095
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,630
and you don't
come to your knees

1096
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:06,640
come to your knees
 

1097
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,470
come to your knees
do you see that okay

1098
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,480
do you see that okay
 

1099
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,590
do you see that okay
so

1100
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:09,600
so
 

1101
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,669
so
the weight

1102
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:11,679
the weight
 

1103
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,590
the weight
is on him

1104
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,600
is on him
 

1105
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,470
is on him
your hands are doing other things

1106
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
your hands are doing other things
 

1107
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,710
your hands are doing other things
widening your base

1108
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:18,720
widening your base
 

1109
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,590
widening your base
keeping the underhooks in place

1110
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,600
keeping the underhooks in place
 

1111
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,669
keeping the underhooks in place
other attacks right

1112
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
other attacks right
 

1113
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,909
other attacks right
because they're not holding you up and

1114
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
because they're not holding you up and
 

1115
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,149
because they're not holding you up and
your knees are not holding you up okay

1116
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159

 

1117
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,549

learn to

1118
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:32,559

 

1119
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,430

see him as the mat what you want to do

1120
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:35,440
see him as the mat what you want to do
 

1121
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,710
see him as the mat what you want to do
with the map

1122
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:36,720
with the map
 

1123
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,990
with the map
do with him

1124
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,000
do with him
 

1125
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,710
do with him
okay

1126
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:40,720

 

1127
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,110

so again just just play with it

1128
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120

 

1129
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,190

he's the mat

1130
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
he's the mat
 

1131
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:54,070
he's the mat
he's the matt

1132
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,080

 

1133
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,830

the lower lower lower get your get your

1134
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
the lower lower lower get your get your
 

1135
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:13,350
the lower lower lower get your get your
body down

1136
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360

 

1137
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,549

he's the mat

1138
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559

 

1139
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,470

i wouldn't let go of that under hook on

1140
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
i wouldn't let go of that under hook on
 

1141
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,390
i wouldn't let go of that under hook on
the other side so he doesn't tap your

1142
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,400
the other side so he doesn't tap your
 

1143
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:30,070
the other side so he doesn't tap your
knee and you could set up other things

1144
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080

 

1145
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,190

on him on him this leg is just

1146
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,200
on him on him this leg is just
 

1147
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,470
on him on him this leg is just
hanging and

1148
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,480
hanging and
 

1149
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,630
hanging and
not lifting it's just resting right now

1150
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:36,640
not lifting it's just resting right now
 

1151
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,990
not lifting it's just resting right now
it's not being used

1152
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,000
it's not being used
 

1153
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,149
it's not being used
everything's on him okay

1154
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:40,159
everything's on him okay
 

1155
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,750
everything's on him okay
and then we came around we'll do the

1156
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
and then we came around we'll do the
 

1157
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,750
and then we came around we'll do the
turn we're going to stay at this angle

1158
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:43,760
turn we're going to stay at this angle
 

1159
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,750
turn we're going to stay at this angle
because the camera's there okay

1160
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,760
because the camera's there okay
 

1161
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,350
because the camera's there okay
so i have this

1162
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,360
so i have this
 

1163
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,070
so i have this
hook

1164
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,080
hook
 

1165
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,269
hook
you get it

1166
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:49,279
you get it
 

1167
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,149
you get it
all right

1168
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:52,159

 

1169
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,230

this arm

1170
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
this arm
 

1171
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,269
this arm
okay the first it's it's very simple

1172
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:57,279
okay the first it's it's very simple
 

1173
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,510
okay the first it's it's very simple
this is energy

1174
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
this is energy
 

1175
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,510
this is energy
and you're gonna go around the energy so

1176
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520
and you're gonna go around the energy so
 

1177
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,390
and you're gonna go around the energy so
don't you don't push into his energy

1178
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400
don't you don't push into his energy
 

1179
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,269
don't you don't push into his energy
okay

1180
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:05,279
okay
 

1181
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,789
okay
you're gonna do clearing techniques but

1182
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:06,799
you're gonna do clearing techniques but
 

1183
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,230
you're gonna do clearing techniques but
i would

1184
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:08,240
i would
 

1185
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,750
i would
if you do clearing techniques with

1186
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:09,760
if you do clearing techniques with
 

1187
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,230
if you do clearing techniques with
understanding how to create an angle of

1188
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,240
understanding how to create an angle of
 

1189
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,190
understanding how to create an angle of
deviation so angle deviation plus angle

1190
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
deviation so angle deviation plus angle
 

1191
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,990
deviation so angle deviation plus angle
of deflection is the best versus one or

1192
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,000
of deflection is the best versus one or
 

1193
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,710
of deflection is the best versus one or
the other okay so as he's pushing he's

1194
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:20,720
the other okay so as he's pushing he's
 

1195
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,870
the other okay so as he's pushing he's
trying to stop you from doing that i'm

1196
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
trying to stop you from doing that i'm
 

1197
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,630
trying to stop you from doing that i'm
just going to roll

1198
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:24,640
just going to roll
 

1199
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,110
just going to roll
around his heel palm because it's not

1200
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,120
around his heel palm because it's not
 

1201
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,190
around his heel palm because it's not
it's not his fingers it's his heel palm

1202
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,200
it's not his fingers it's his heel palm
 

1203
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,350
it's not his fingers it's his heel palm
that he's pushing with so i'm gonna go

1204
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
that he's pushing with so i'm gonna go
 

1205
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,909
that he's pushing with so i'm gonna go
ahead and push i'm gonna roll over the

1206
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:35,919
ahead and push i'm gonna roll over the
 

1207
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,750
ahead and push i'm gonna roll over the
heel palm

1208
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:37,760
heel palm
 

1209
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,029
heel palm
and push hard

1210
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:39,039
and push hard
 

1211
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,110
and push hard
until i'm on the fingers

1212
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,120
until i'm on the fingers
 

1213
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,830
until i'm on the fingers
and it'll be like he's not even

1214
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
and it'll be like he's not even
 

1215
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,430
and it'll be like he's not even
there

1216
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,440
there
 

1217
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,190
there
do you understand

1218
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,200
do you understand
 

1219
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,630
do you understand
what's going to happen is you're going

1220
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640

1566
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,000
things with that note okay all right
 

1567
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,870
things with that note okay all right
let's try it again i'm gonna do it again

1568
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:40,880
let's try it again i'm gonna do it again
 

1569
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,029
let's try it again i'm gonna do it again
okay so again he's just using the

1570
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:43,039
okay so again he's just using the
 

1571
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,789
okay so again he's just using the
principle he's doing things with the

1572
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:44,799
principle he's doing things with the
 

1573
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,230
principle he's doing things with the
note so

1574
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,240
note so
 

1575
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,230
note so
in order to get his hip

1576
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
in order to get his hip
 

1577
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,350
in order to get his hip
past the heel palm he he's gonna do a

1578
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,360
past the heel palm he he's gonna do a
 

1579
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,590
past the heel palm he he's gonna do a
back step that's what he like to do it's

1580
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:53,600
back step that's what he like to do it's
 

1581
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,630
back step that's what he like to do it's
the same note

1582
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:56,640

 

1583
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,909

you see same exact note okay did you see

1584
00:33:59,909 --> 00:33:59,919
you see same exact note okay did you see
 

1585
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:07,830
you see same exact note okay did you see
it that time okay

1586
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840

 

1587
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,470

okay so i i got around

1588
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,480
okay so i i got around
 

1589
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,510
okay so i i got around
and he's got that resistance

1590
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:13,520
and he's got that resistance
 

1591
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,869
and he's got that resistance
and again

1592
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:14,879
and again
 

1593
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,990
and again
i the angle deviation always sets up

1594
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,000
i the angle deviation always sets up
 

1595
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,669
i the angle deviation always sets up
angle of deflection

1596
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:19,679
angle of deflection
 

1597
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,589
angle of deflection
it's always a beginner mistake to go to

1598
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:21,599
it's always a beginner mistake to go to
 

1599
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,629
it's always a beginner mistake to go to
the deflection part first okay so for

1600
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:24,639
the deflection part first okay so for
 

1601
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,869
the deflection part first okay so for
example you know look

1602
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:26,879
example you know look
 

1603
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,869
example you know look
okay but it's much easier with the

1604
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:28,879
okay but it's much easier with the
 

1605
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,750
okay but it's much easier with the
deviation do you see how i did that

1606
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:31,760
deviation do you see how i did that
 

1607
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,950
deviation do you see how i did that
so

1608
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:32,960
so
 

1609
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,629
so
here i'm still gonna go around it

1610
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:36,639
here i'm still gonna go around it
 

1611
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,629
here i'm still gonna go around it
but i'm gonna he's gonna he's gonna be

1612
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:38,639
but i'm gonna he's gonna he's gonna be
 

1613
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,310
but i'm gonna he's gonna he's gonna be
pushing

1614
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,320
pushing
 

1615
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,109
pushing
you ha you're gonna go around it

1616
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:43,119
you ha you're gonna go around it
 

1617
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,190
you ha you're gonna go around it
you got it and then this knee comes here

1618
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,200
you got it and then this knee comes here
 

1619
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,510
you got it and then this knee comes here
and then clears it

1620
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:49,520
and then clears it
 

1621
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,349
and then clears it
and i'm going to take

1622
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:51,359
and i'm going to take
 

1623
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,750
and i'm going to take
uh

1624
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:53,760

 

1625
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,270

advantage

1626
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,280
advantage
 

1627
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,870
advantage
of him isolating the arm on his own

1628
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:58,880
of him isolating the arm on his own
 

1629
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,069
of him isolating the arm on his own
do you get it which helps me

1630
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:02,079
do you get it which helps me
 

1631
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,430
do you get it which helps me
so

1632
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,440
so
 

1633
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,230
so
i got i'll end up with one arm isolated

1634
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
i got i'll end up with one arm isolated
 

1635
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,870
i got i'll end up with one arm isolated
you can't do this maneuver if you don't

1636
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:08,880
you can't do this maneuver if you don't
 

1637
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,790
you can't do this maneuver if you don't
do the deviation okay

1638
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:10,800
do the deviation okay
 

1639
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,109
do the deviation okay
so i can't get it there

1640
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:13,119
so i can't get it there
 

1641
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,349
so i can't get it there
but with a slight deviation i can get it

1642
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:15,359
but with a slight deviation i can get it
 

1643
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,870
but with a slight deviation i can get it
there we'll

1644
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:16,880
there we'll
 

1645
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,190
there we'll
clear it

1646
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
clear it
 

1647
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,950
clear it
and now i have

1648
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:20,960
and now i have
 

1649
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,510
and now i have
two arms isolated which means this arm

1650
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:23,520
two arms isolated which means this arm
 

1651
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,190
two arms isolated which means this arm
is very

1652
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,200
is very
 

1653
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,230
is very
vulnerable

1654
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,240

 

1655
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,829

i

1656
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:29,839
i
 

1657
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:30,790
i
okay

1658
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:30,800
okay
 

1659
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,870
okay
which also means i can set up my angles

1660
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:32,880
which also means i can set up my angles
 

1661
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,470
which also means i can set up my angles
of attack

1662
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:34,480
of attack
 

1663
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,910
of attack
here

1664
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:35,920
here
 

1665
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,430
here
boom

1666
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:37,440
boom
 

1667
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,349
boom
okay

1668
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:39,359
okay
 

1669
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,150
okay
uh

1670
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,160
uh
 

1671
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,109
uh
let's see if the angle of

1672
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:43,119
let's see if the angle of
 

1673
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,870
let's see if the angle of
deflection

1674
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:44,880
deflection
 

1675
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,670
deflection
will do what it does on most beginners

1676
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,680
will do what it does on most beginners
 

1677
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,710
will do what it does on most beginners
it detracts from the angle of deviation

1678
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:50,720
it detracts from the angle of deviation
 

1679
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,990
it detracts from the angle of deviation
so let's just start from the knee slice

1680
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,000
so let's just start from the knee slice
 

1681
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,790
so let's just start from the knee slice
and

1682
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:54,800
and
 

1683
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,710
and
really give them something

1684
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:56,720
really give them something
 

1685
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,950
really give them something
and see if they can find a way of

1686
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:58,960
and see if they can find a way of
 

1687
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,030
and see if they can find a way of
gaining that and maintaining that angle

1688
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,040
gaining that and maintaining that angle
 

1689
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,710
gaining that and maintaining that angle
of deflection without having to force it

1690
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:04,720
of deflection without having to force it
 

1691
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,950
of deflection without having to force it
okay let's try

1692
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:08,960

 

1693
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,510

take some yeah there you go

1694
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:11,520
take some yeah there you go
 

1695
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,589
take some yeah there you go
good isolate it go to the figure four

1696
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:13,599
good isolate it go to the figure four
 

1697
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,589
good isolate it go to the figure four
let's go let's go

1698
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:15,599
let's go let's go
 

1699
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:36,630
let's go let's go
pull that in

1700
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:36,640

 

1701
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,829

that's enough good get it good pass it

1702
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:39,839
that's enough good get it good pass it
 

1703
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,950
that's enough good get it good pass it
good

1704
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:42,960

 

1705
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,030

get your elbow in there

1706
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,040
get your elbow in there
 

1707
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,589
get your elbow in there
get your elbow in his neck there you go

1708
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:47,599
get your elbow in his neck there you go
 

1709
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:57,270
get your elbow in his neck there you go
let's smooth that out i tried again

1710
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,280

 

1711
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:12,310

that's it

1712
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:12,320

 

1713
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,790

good

1714
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:14,800

 

1715
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:25,430

get your head down do it again

1716
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,440

 

1717
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,030

pull it in

1718
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,040
pull it in
 

1719
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,829
pull it in
good

1720
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:27,839
good
 

1721
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,150
good
i'll always start with the first uh

1722
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,160
i'll always start with the first uh
 

1723
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,150
i'll always start with the first uh
catch wrestling move and then go to the

1724
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,160
catch wrestling move and then go to the
 

1725
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,950
catch wrestling move and then go to the
figure four got it

1726
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:34,960
figure four got it
 

1727
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,510
figure four got it
okay take off that resistance dude don't

1728
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:37,520
okay take off that resistance dude don't
 

1729
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,430
okay take off that resistance dude don't
push into it so you're gonna rotate

1730
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:39,440
push into it so you're gonna rotate
 

1731
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,430
push into it so you're gonna rotate
around the heel palm maybe you need the

1732
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:41,440
around the heel palm maybe you need the
 

1733
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,030
around the heel palm maybe you need the
back step right

1734
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,040
back step right
 

1735
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,670
back step right
rotate around don't don't go for the

1736
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:45,680
rotate around don't don't go for the
 

1737
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,910
rotate around don't don't go for the
angle of deflection until you take some

1738
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:47,920
angle of deflection until you take some
 

1739
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,430
angle of deflection until you take some
heat off of that

1740
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:49,440
heat off of that
 

1741
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,750
heat off of that
pressure point

1742
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:51,760
pressure point
 

1743
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,710
pressure point
turn your hips is how you do it

1744
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:56,720

 

1745
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,550

no you missed

1746
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:58,560
no you missed
 

1747
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:08,790
no you missed
okay

1749
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,190

don't don't start don't try using it yet

1750
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,200
don't don't start don't try using it yet
 

1751
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,030
don't don't start don't try using it yet
just lay it in place

1752
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,040
just lay it in place
 

1753
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,829
just lay it in place
don't

1754
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:13,839
don't
 

1755
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,510
don't
don't try using it it's just laying

1756
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:15,520
don't try using it it's just laying
 

1757
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,190
don't try using it it's just laying
there

1758
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,200
there
 

1759
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:25,510
there
start to turn your hips

1760
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:25,520

 

1761
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,510

pass it to the other leg step over the

1762
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:27,520
pass it to the other leg step over the
 

1763
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,190
pass it to the other leg step over the
forearm with your left

1764
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,200
forearm with your left
 

1765
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,630
forearm with your left
shin

1766
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:30,640
shin
 

1767
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,950
shin
let's go

1768
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:32,960
let's go
 

1769
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,870
let's go
oh you had lost that underhook didn't

1770
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:34,880
oh you had lost that underhook didn't
 

1771
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,670
oh you had lost that underhook didn't
you

1772
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:35,680
you
 

1773
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,990
you
you had to go chase that arm

1774
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000

 

1775
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,510

pull it in first

1776
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:47,520

 

1777
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,349

you're here

1778
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:49,359
you're here
 

1779
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,310
you're here
again

1780
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:50,320
again
 

1781
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,589
again
you'll have to watch it later because

1782
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:51,599
you'll have to watch it later because
 

1783
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,870
you'll have to watch it later because
you

1784
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:52,880
you
 

1785
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,430
you
you guys made the mistake of

1786
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:55,440
you guys made the mistake of
 

1787
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,670
you guys made the mistake of
having the angled deflection take away

1788
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:57,680
having the angled deflection take away
 

1789
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,069
having the angled deflection take away
from your angle of deviation so this is

1790
00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:00,079
from your angle of deviation so this is
 

1791
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,430
from your angle of deviation so this is
for those these guys okay so

1792
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:03,440
for those these guys okay so
 

1793
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,589
for those these guys okay so
he's pushing he's pushing he's pushing

i'm gonna go
under the other way

1798
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:09,599
under the other way
 

1799
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,030
under the other way
he's pushing

1800
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,040
he's pushing
 

1801
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,630
he's pushing
i'll go here

1802
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:12,640
i'll go here
 

1803
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,870
i'll go here
you see how i did that

1804
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:14,880
you see how i did that
 

1805
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,630
you see how i did that
he's driving driving

1806
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:16,640
he's driving driving
 

1807
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,589
he's driving driving
oh

1808
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:17,599
oh
 

1809
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,430
oh
under it

1810
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:19,440
under it
 

1811
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,589
under it
and now you're in them

1812
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:25,599

 

1813
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,870

again

1814
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:26,880
again
 

1815
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,710
again
his my fear cycles

1816
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:30,720
his my fear cycles
 

1817
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,790
his my fear cycles
but as he goes so i'm coming around

1818
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:32,800
but as he goes so i'm coming around
 

1819
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,589
but as he goes so i'm coming around
right

1820
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:33,599
right
 

1821
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,750
right
and he's gonna find the hip

1822
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:35,760
and he's gonna find the hip
 

1823
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,150
and he's gonna find the hip
and you you will think that he never

1824
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,160
and you you will think that he never
 

1825
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,630
and you you will think that he never
pushed on me do you see how it was

1826
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:40,640
pushed on me do you see how it was
 

1827
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,630
pushed on me do you see how it was
that smooth okay

1828
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:42,640
that smooth okay
 

1829
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,270
that smooth okay
it's the same thing

1830
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,280
it's the same thing
 

1831
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,510
it's the same thing
if he's he's here like this and he's

1832
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:47,520
if he's he's here like this and he's
 

1833
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,430
if he's he's here like this and he's
doing a push

1834
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:49,440
doing a push
 

1835
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,589
doing a push
you can tell he was pushing on but he

1836
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:51,599
you can tell he was pushing on but he
 

1837
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,750
you can tell he was pushing on but he
pushes and you can't tell and everyone

1838
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:53,760
pushes and you can't tell and everyone
 

1839
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,430
pushes and you can't tell and everyone
goes oh that's fake do you understand

1840
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,440
goes oh that's fake do you understand
 

1841
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,750
goes oh that's fake do you understand
he wasn't pushing he was i just wasn't

1842
00:39:59,750 --> 00:39:59,760
he wasn't pushing he was i just wasn't
 

1843
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,790
he wasn't pushing he was i just wasn't
there

1844
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:00,800
there
 

1845
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,430
there
to manifest his push okay

1846
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,440
to manifest his push okay
 

1847
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,870
to manifest his push okay
and so as we're coming around

1848
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:06,880
and so as we're coming around
 

1849
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,270
and so as we're coming around
he's he's really driving i'm gonna come

1850
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:09,280
he's he's really driving i'm gonna come
 

1851
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,150
he's he's really driving i'm gonna come
around he's really driving you can't

1852
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,160
around he's really driving you can't
 

1853
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,270
around he's really driving you can't
tell that they already got disneyland

1854
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:15,280
tell that they already got disneyland
 

1855
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,630
tell that they already got disneyland
you see that

1856
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
you see that
 

1857
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,670
you see that
okay so

1858
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:17,680
okay so
 

1859
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,230
okay so
uh you guys will work on that the rest

1860
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,240
uh you guys will work on that the rest
 

1861
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,870
uh you guys will work on that the rest
of you will continue trying to

1862
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:22,880
of you will continue trying to
 

1863
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,190
of you will continue trying to
keep the angle deviation manifested with

1864
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:25,200
keep the angle deviation manifested with
 

1865
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,390
keep the angle deviation manifested with
the angle of deflection

1866
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:30,400

 

1867
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,069

okay so just on the figure four part

1868
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:36,079

 

1869
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,670

so the first thing

1870
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:37,680
so the first thing
 

1871
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,390
so the first thing
that i'm going to try to do is get that

1872
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,400
that i'm going to try to do is get that
 

1873
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,349
that i'm going to try to do is get that
ball and socket lock okay so i'm moving

1874
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:43,359
ball and socket lock okay so i'm moving
 

1875
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,470
ball and socket lock okay so i'm moving
this in

1876
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:44,480
this in
 

1877
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,430
this in
this way

1878
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,440

 

1879
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,109

that's the first thing i try to do okay

1880
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:51,119
that's the first thing i try to do okay
 

1881
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,430
that's the first thing i try to do okay
i don't try to go here

1882
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,440
i don't try to go here
 

1883
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,670
i don't try to go here
i don't want her to extend her arm she

1884
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:55,680
i don't want her to extend her arm she
 

1885
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,510
i don't want her to extend her arm she
still has a lot of leverage yeah yes

1886
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:57,520
still has a lot of leverage yeah yes
 

1887
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,829
still has a lot of leverage yeah yes
i'll have other techniques

1888
00:40:59,829 --> 00:40:59,839
i'll have other techniques
 

1889
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,589
i'll have other techniques
but it's better to find those other

1890
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:01,599
but it's better to find those other
 

1891
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,470
but it's better to find those other
techniques when she's deep in

1892
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:04,480
techniques when she's deep in
 

1893
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,790
techniques when she's deep in
the do you get it so

1894
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:06,800
the do you get it so
 

1895
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,190
the do you get it so
when when i'm trying this and she's

1896
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,200
when when i'm trying this and she's
 

1897
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,190
when when i'm trying this and she's
strong enough to blow through it wow

1898
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:11,200
strong enough to blow through it wow
 

1899
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,349
strong enough to blow through it wow
it's gonna be that much better on do you

1900
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:13,359
it's gonna be that much better on do you
 

1901
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,670
it's gonna be that much better on do you
understand then if i'm here

1902
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
understand then if i'm here
 

1903
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,550
understand then if i'm here
and she goes up

1904

so always have them deep in the weeds
 

1907
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,510
so always have them deep in the weeds
and they have to try to escape from deep

1908
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:23,520
and they have to try to escape from deep
 

1909
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,030
and they have to try to escape from deep
in the weeds okay so the first move this

1910
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,040
in the weeds okay so the first move this
 

1911
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,630
in the weeds okay so the first move this
whole thing comes in home this way and

1912

whole thing comes in home this way and
 

1913
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,630
whole thing comes in home this way and
again a lot of people will tap out on

1914
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:32,640
again a lot of people will tap out on

and you see how when i
first grab it i haven't grabbed i just

1940
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:01,920
first grab it i haven't grabbed i just
 

1941
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,069
first grab it i haven't grabbed i just
have it locked cause i'm way over the

1942
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:04,079
have it locked cause i'm way over the
 

1943
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,430
have it locked cause i'm way over the
the uh

1944
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:05,440
the uh
 

1945
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,630
the uh
the axis

1946
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:06,640
the axis
 

1947
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,109
the axis
okay the apex on the circumference

1948
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:09,119
okay the apex on the circumference
 

1949
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,230
okay the apex on the circumference
and so it kind of is doing

1950
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,240
and so it kind of is doing
 

1951
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,349
and so it kind of is doing
the same thing all right but if you're

1952
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:15,359
the same thing all right but if you're
 

1953
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,790
the same thing all right but if you're
here like this

1954
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:16,800
here like this
 

1955
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,309
here like this
you'll turn it it'll bring it in you

1956
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:18,319
you'll turn it it'll bring it in you
 

1957
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,870
you'll turn it it'll bring it in you
bring that in first and then you start

1958
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:20,880
bring that in first and then you start
 

1959
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,030
bring that in first and then you start
going through the technique okay

1960
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,040
going through the technique okay
 

1961
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,589
going through the technique okay
um

1962
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:25,599

 

1963
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,430

do you understand no nobody should be at

1964
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:27,440
do you understand no nobody should be at
 

1965
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,750
do you understand no nobody should be at
this perfect right angle no you

1966
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:29,760
this perfect right angle no you
 

1967
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,510
this perfect right angle no you
shouldn't have that that we're trying to

1968
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:31,520
shouldn't have that that we're trying to
 

1969
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,430
shouldn't have that that we're trying to
move past this okay

1970
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:33,440
