59
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,710
encouraged me to open a small school in
my hometown where i got a small group of

60
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
my hometown where i got a small group of
 

61
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,149
my hometown where i got a small group of
guys and we pounded each other against

62
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
guys and we pounded each other against
 

63
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,230
guys and we pounded each other against
the walls repeatedly until we figured

64
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
the walls repeatedly until we figured
 

65
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,630
the walls repeatedly until we figured
out what aikido was about and then this

66
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,640
out what aikido was about and then this
 

67
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,469
out what aikido was about and then this
part of the series is talking about my

68
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479
part of the series is talking about my
 

69
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,630
part of the series is talking about my
continuation from there

70
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
continuation from there
 

71
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,550
continuation from there
so at this point i kind of thought

72
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
so at this point i kind of thought
 

73
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,429
so at this point i kind of thought
aikido was a mobile weapon platform and

74
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:21,439
aikido was a mobile weapon platform and
 

75
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,950
aikido was a mobile weapon platform and
that's a really weird name and i still

76
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
that's a really weird name and i still
 

77
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,789
that's a really weird name and i still
don't know a better thing to call it but

78
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
don't know a better thing to call it but
 

79
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,789
don't know a better thing to call it but
aikido is kind of unlike a lot of other

80
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
aikido is kind of unlike a lot of other
 

81
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,550
aikido is kind of unlike a lot of other
martial arts in my opinion in the fact

82
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
martial arts in my opinion in the fact
 

83
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,190
martial arts in my opinion in the fact
that the idea of aikido is mostly just

84
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
that the idea of aikido is mostly just
 

85
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,190
that the idea of aikido is mostly just
to keep you free right so being able to

86
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
to keep you free right so being able to
 

87
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,109
to keep you free right so being able to
move around free and if you can move

88
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
move around free and if you can move
 

89
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,109
move around free and if you can move
around free then you could stack a

90
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
around free then you could stack a
 

91
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,789
around free then you could stack a
weapon platform on top of that to

92
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
weapon platform on top of that to
 

93
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,469
weapon platform on top of that to
increase your odds of doing well in

94
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
increase your odds of doing well in
 

95
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,149
increase your odds of doing well in
conflict so meaning you know someone

96
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
conflict so meaning you know someone
 

97
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,069
conflict so meaning you know someone
wants to get me my idea is just to stay

98
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079

102
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
stay free and then if the engagement's
 

103
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,069
stay free and then if the engagement's
really serious i could use a weapon on

104
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
really serious i could use a weapon on
 

105
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,429
really serious i could use a weapon on
top of that so i could use a weapon to

106
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
top of that so i could use a weapon to
 

107
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,990
top of that so i could use a weapon to
keep myself free now this mobile weapon

108
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
keep myself free now this mobile weapon
 

109
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,550
keep myself free now this mobile weapon

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,109
platform idea while it sounds good for a
survival situation it doesn't sound much

how do they jive together
 

123
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,029
how do they jive together
at this time when i kind of figured this

124
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
at this time when i kind of figured this
 

125
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,030
at this time when i kind of figured this
out so probably around 2010 that this

126
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
out so probably around 2010 that this
 

127
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,630
out so probably around 2010 that this
idea the mobile weapon platform started

128
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
idea the mobile weapon platform started
 

129
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,309
idea the mobile weapon platform started
to cement for me

130
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
to cement for me
 

131
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,270
to cement for me
i didn't really care i just liked that

132
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
i didn't really care i just liked that
 

133
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,190
i didn't really care i just liked that
the aikido techniques had functionality

134
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
the aikido techniques had functionality
 

135
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,390
the aikido techniques had functionality
and i could see them coming off

136
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
and i could see them coming off
 

137
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,990
and i could see them coming off
regularly and i thought that was really

138
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
regularly and i thought that was really
 

139
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,990
regularly and i thought that was really
cool and all the technical stuff i

140
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
cool and all the technical stuff i
 

141
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,309
cool and all the technical stuff i
learned in aikido worked out for me and

142
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
learned in aikido worked out for me and
 

143
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,229
learned in aikido worked out for me and
so ikea there's a mobile weapon platform

144
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
so ikea there's a mobile weapon platform
 

145
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,070
so ikea there's a mobile weapon platform
and not an art of peace at that time i

146
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
and not an art of peace at that time i
 

147
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,830
and not an art of peace at that time i
didn't really care and and to tell you

148
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
didn't really care and and to tell you
 

149
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,270
didn't really care and and to tell you
the truth at that time i really wasn't

150
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
the truth at that time i really wasn't
 

151
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,869
the truth at that time i really wasn't
that interested in an art of peace

152
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879
that interested in an art of peace
 

153
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,949
that interested in an art of peace
anyway so that's cool to me you know

154
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
anyway so that's cool to me you know
 

155
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,710
anyway so that's cool to me you know
it's a mobile weapon platform

156
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
it's a mobile weapon platform
 

157
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,509
it's a mobile weapon platform
so

158
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
so
 

159
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,710
so

00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
now knowing it's a mobile weapon
 

161
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,990
now knowing it's a mobile weapon
platform and knowing that the heart of

162
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000

real emphasis of aikido now that might
 

513
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,710
real emphasis of aikido now that might
be the emphasis that i had early on or

514
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
be the emphasis that i had early on or

the emphasis of that a lot of aikido
 

517
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,990
the emphasis of that a lot of aikido
teachers had when they were young and

518
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
teachers had when they were young and
 

519
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,509
teachers had when they were young and
they were really excited about learning

520
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
they were really excited about learning
 

521
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,630
they were really excited about learning
aikido and they wanted to learn how to

522
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
aikido and they wanted to learn how to
 

523
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,710
aikido and they wanted to learn how to
fight and become a tough person and

524
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
fight and become a tough person and
 

525
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,070
fight and become a tough person and
through all their training they might

526
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
through all their training they might
 

527
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,590
through all their training they might
have learned to fight and become a tough

528
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
have learned to fight and become a tough
 

529
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,750
have learned to fight and become a tough
person but the martial art of aikido is

530
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
person but the martial art of aikido is
 

531
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,070
person but the martial art of aikido is
actually about making accords and the

532
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
actually about making accords and the
 

533
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,910
actually about making accords and the
more i gave to that the more aikido

534
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
more i gave to that the more aikido
 

535
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,990
more i gave to that the more aikido
seemed to make sense i started to

536
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
seemed to make sense i started to
 

537
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,389
seemed to make sense i started to
realize that aikido's first goal

538
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
realize that aikido's first goal
 

539
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,110
realize that aikido's first goal
is to be aware of what's going on and

540
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
is to be aware of what's going on and
 

541
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,750
is to be aware of what's going on and
mentally not allow a situation to form

542
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
mentally not allow a situation to form
 

543
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,910
mentally not allow a situation to form
that would be dangerous for us if that

544
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
that would be dangerous for us if that
 

545
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,470
that would be dangerous for us if that
situation forms anyways our next idea is

546
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
situation forms anyways our next idea is
 

547
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,070
situation forms anyways our next idea is
to keep distance from it and keep them

548
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
to keep distance from it and keep them
 

549
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,310
to keep distance from it and keep them
from getting too close to hurt us

550
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
from getting too close to hurt us
 

551
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,070
from getting too close to hurt us
if we can't manage keep distance well

552
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
if we can't manage keep distance well
 

553
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,750
if we can't manage keep distance well
then we want to suppress them and stay

554
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
then we want to suppress them and stay
 

555
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,190
then we want to suppress them and stay
off of the line

556
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
off of the line
 

557
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,269
off of the line
and if we can't do that well then there

558
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
and if we can't do that well then there
 

559
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,110
and if we can't do that well then there
is some struggle at the very end but

560
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
is some struggle at the very end but
 

561
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,870
is some struggle at the very end but
that's the last part of aikido and not

562
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
that's the last part of aikido and not
 

563
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,110
that's the last part of aikido and not
the ideal part of aikido now i

564
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
the ideal part of aikido now i
 

565
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,710
the ideal part of aikido now i
understand that this is something that

566
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
understand that this is something that
 

567
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,630
understand that this is something that
most people probably don't want to hear

568
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
most people probably don't want to hear
 

569
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,389
most people probably don't want to hear
and i don't expect that this video is

570
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
and i don't expect that this video is
 

571
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,870
and i don't expect that this video is
going to do too well because it isn't

572
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
going to do too well because it isn't
 

573
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,630
going to do too well because it isn't
about dominating and beating someone up

574
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
about dominating and beating someone up
 

575
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,870
about dominating and beating someone up
or having magic powers but it's about

576
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
or having magic powers but it's about
 

577
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,470
or having magic powers but it's about
realistically looking at the world we

578
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
realistically looking at the world we
 

579
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,230
realistically looking at the world we
live in and realizing the most

580
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
live in and realizing the most
 

581
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,310
live in and realizing the most
successful strategy you can possibly

582
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
successful strategy you can possibly
 

583
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,030
successful strategy you can possibly
have is to not get in fights at all so

if you can master not getting in fights
 

587
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,990
if you can master not getting in fights
then that is the best strategy you can

588
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
then that is the best strategy you can
 

589
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,310
then that is the best strategy you can
have aikido can be a part of that and it
