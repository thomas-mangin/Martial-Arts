playing with the numbers kind of
 

47
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,790
playing with the numbers kind of
constantly as I get new students who are

48
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
constantly as I get new students who are
 

49
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,470
constantly as I get new students who are
like oh it's hard for them to get this

be more focused on here so that's why
 

55
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,229
be more focused on here so that's why
the numberings change around I wouldn't

56
00:00:59,229 --> 00:00:59,239
the numberings change around I wouldn't
 

57
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,430
the numberings change around I wouldn't
worry about it too much um uh this is

58
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440

80
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:26,439
um so this is the first form the way I
 

81
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,670
um so this is the first form the way I
have them oriented where we are down in

82
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
have them oriented where we are down in
 

83
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,429
have them oriented where we are down in
uh jokai and dealing with someone who's

84
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
uh jokai and dealing with someone who's

87
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,670
not in jokai who's about to attack us um
I used to have these later I think these

88
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:36,680
I used to have these later I think these
 

89
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,469
I used to have these later I think these
actually has the cleverest and best

90
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:39,479
actually has the cleverest and best
 

91
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,429
actually has the cleverest and best
answer for a Thrust coming in while

92
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
answer for a Thrust coming in while
 

93
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,270
answer for a Thrust coming in while
you're in jamai and I used to think of

94
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
you're in jamai and I used to think of
 

95
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,550
you're in jamai and I used to think of
it more well it's Advanced so it should

96
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
it more well it's Advanced so it should
 

97
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,830
it more well it's Advanced so it should
be later in the forums but now I think

98
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
be later in the forums but now I think
 

99
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,270
be later in the forums but now I think
it's just the best first thing to learn

100
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
it's just the best first thing to learn
 

101
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,910
it's just the best first thing to learn
and so that's why we're learning it also

102
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:48,920
and so that's why we're learning it also
 

103
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,709
and so that's why we're learning it also
has really good set of answers for um

104
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:51,719
has really good set of answers for um
 

105
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:54,310
has really good set of answers for um
them transitioning and also has the

106
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
them transitioning and also has the
 

107
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,389
them transitioning and also has the
remainder of the grappling stuff so uh

108
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
remainder of the grappling stuff so uh
 

109
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,950
remainder of the grappling stuff so uh
four and five will have the remainder of

110
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:57,960
four and five will have the remainder of
 

111
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,469
four and five will have the remainder of
our grappling stuff uh for the the Joe

112
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
our grappling stuff uh for the the Joe
 

113
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,109
our grappling stuff uh for the the Joe
so I think this is a good place right

114
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:02,119
so I think this is a good place right
 

115
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,230
so I think this is a good place right
after we get through the with the heads

116
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,240
after we get through the with the heads
 

117
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,990
after we get through the with the heads
up we start getting into this uh all

118
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,000
up we start getting into this uh all
 

119
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,709
up we start getting into this uh all
right so let's switch positions actually

120
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
right so let's switch positions actually
 

121
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,270
right so let's switch positions actually
all right so in this form and the

122
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
all right so in this form and the
 

123
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,190
all right so in this form and the
remainder of these forms I'll be in Joe

124
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
remainder of these forms I'll be in Joe
 

125
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,510
remainder of these forms I'll be in Joe
kamine and so this situation simple I

126
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
kamine and so this situation simple I
 

127
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,589
kamine and so this situation simple I
wasn't ready for any kind of fight or

128
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:16,599
wasn't ready for any kind of fight or
 

129
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,150
wasn't ready for any kind of fight or
exchange and this guy is ready and he's

130
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,160
exchange and this guy is ready and he's
 

131
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,470
exchange and this guy is ready and he's
going to attack me right so I'm just

132
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
going to attack me right so I'm just
 

133
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,670
going to attack me right so I'm just
hanging out here okay now Josh and we're

134
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:22,680
hanging out here okay now Josh and we're
 

135
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,229
hanging out here okay now Josh and we're
in Josh's range right so if Josh steps

136
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
in Josh's range right so if Josh steps
 

137
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,710
in Josh's range right so if Josh steps
in he can easily get me right so no

138
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:25,720
in he can easily get me right so no
 

139
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,309
in he can easily get me right so no
problem there um as he comes in with the

140
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
problem there um as he comes in with the
 

141
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,509
problem there um as he comes in with the
thrust I'm going to deal with it by

142
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:29,519
thrust I'm going to deal with it by
 

143
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,430
thrust I'm going to deal with it by
doing this now look this is the simplest

144
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
doing this now look this is the simplest
 

145
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,869
doing this now look this is the simplest
in my opinion best way to handle it

146
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:33,879
in my opinion best way to handle it
 

147
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,070
in my opinion best way to handle it
because it's the least likely to fail

148
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
because it's the least likely to fail
 

149
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,630
because it's the least likely to fail
now look a lot of times especially

150
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:37,640
now look a lot of times especially
 

151
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,350
now look a lot of times especially
because we love to hit sticks uh when

152
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
because we love to hit sticks uh when
 

153
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,990
because we love to hit sticks uh when
they come in we like to see this ah and

154
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,000
they come in we like to see this ah and
 

155
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,229
they come in we like to see this ah and
that's really great and and that is

156
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
that's really great and and that is
 

157
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,910
that's really great and and that is
something that can happen but it's bad

158
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
something that can happen but it's bad
 

159
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,589
something that can happen but it's bad
because of this right okay and also bad

160
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
because of this right okay and also bad
 

161
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,350
because of this right okay and also bad
because of this right he's already hit

162
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
because of this right he's already hit
 

163
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,149
because of this right he's already hit
me and then I hit him later right so so

164
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:51,159
me and then I hit him later right so so
 

165
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,149
me and then I hit him later right so so
those things are both sucky right so I

166
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:53,159
those things are both sucky right so I
 

167
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,149
those things are both sucky right so I
could just miss him on the thrust and he

168
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:55,159
could just miss him on the thrust and he
 

169
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,110
could just miss him on the thrust and he
stabs me or I could go too late and he

170
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
stabs me or I could go too late and he
 

171
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,229
stabs me or I could go too late and he
stabs me so those are bad however if I

172
00:02:59,229 --> 00:02:59,239
stabs me so those are bad however if I
 

173
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:00,589
stabs me so those are bad however if I
leave the weapon right in front of my

174
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:00,599
leave the weapon right in front of my
 

175
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,309
leave the weapon right in front of my
body and as he comes in I just do this

176
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:03,319
body and as he comes in I just do this
 

177
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,110
body and as he comes in I just do this
uh that's a really simple deflection

178
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
uh that's a really simple deflection
 

179
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,869
uh that's a really simple deflection
very unlikely to miss that um the only

180
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:07,879
very unlikely to miss that um the only
 

181
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,030
very unlikely to miss that um the only
thing that could happen is I could end

182
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
thing that could happen is I could end
 

183
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,830
thing that could happen is I could end
up on the other side of his body and I

184
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:10,840
up on the other side of his body and I
 

185
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,630
up on the other side of his body and I
could turn slightly to deal with that

186
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
could turn slightly to deal with that
 

187
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,270
could turn slightly to deal with that
right and that's not that likely to

188
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:14,280
right and that's not that likely to
 

189
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,070
right and that's not that likely to
happen now when I'm doing this I'm not

190
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
happen now when I'm doing this I'm not
 

191
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,390
happen now when I'm doing this I'm not
targeting his stick I'm actually

192
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,400
targeting his stick I'm actually
 

193
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,110
targeting his stick I'm actually
targeting his front hand so as he comes

194
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
targeting his front hand so as he comes
 

195
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,070
targeting his front hand so as he comes
in I'm driving to his thumb now here's

196
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,080
in I'm driving to his thumb now here's
 

197
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,470
in I'm driving to his thumb now here's
another thing if I hit that thumb really

198
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:22,480
another thing if I hit that thumb really
 

199
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,509
another thing if I hit that thumb really
hard I might jam it mess it up and make

200
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:24,519
hard I might jam it mess it up and make
 

201
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:25,750
hard I might jam it mess it up and make
it difficult for him to deal with his

202
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
it difficult for him to deal with his
 

203
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,270
it difficult for him to deal with his
weapon which would be a nice exchange

204
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
weapon which would be a nice exchange
 

205
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,350
weapon which would be a nice exchange
for me right so as this guy's coming in

206
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
for me right so as this guy's coming in
 

207
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,949
for me right so as this guy's coming in
all I'm is aiming for that hand and I

208
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
all I'm is aiming for that hand and I
 

209
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,190
all I'm is aiming for that hand and I
push it to the side so it's not a big

210
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,200
push it to the side so it's not a big
 

211
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,390
push it to the side so it's not a big
hit just Glide it off to the side okay

212
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
hit just Glide it off to the side okay
 

213
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,030
hit just Glide it off to the side okay
now what would I do from here could do a

214
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
now what would I do from here could do a
 

215
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,509
now what would I do from here could do a
ton of stuff I can hit him with one hand

216
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:38,519
ton of stuff I can hit him with one hand
 

217
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:39,589
ton of stuff I can hit him with one hand
I can hit him from underneath with one

218
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
I can hit him from underneath with one
 

219
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,429
I can hit him from underneath with one
hand I can transition myself into attack

220
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:41,439
hand I can transition myself into attack
 

221
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,949
hand I can transition myself into attack
him all kinds of stuff now look if I

222
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
him all kinds of stuff now look if I
 

223
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,589
him all kinds of stuff now look if I
transition in to attack him we're

224
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:44,599
transition in to attack him we're
 

225
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,309
transition in to attack him we're
actually flip rolled for second form so

226
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:47,319
actually flip rolled for second form so
 

227
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,830
actually flip rolled for second form so
look we're close quarters and I go here

228
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:48,840
look we're close quarters and I go here
 

229
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,110
look we're close quarters and I go here
and if he did a mhi barai to get back

230
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
and if he did a mhi barai to get back
 

231
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,670
and if he did a mhi barai to get back
bang now we're in second form right so

232
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:52,680
bang now we're in second form right so
 

233
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,990

00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
you can see second form immediately
 

235
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,390
you can see second form immediately
attaches to these forms as well okay so

236
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
attaches to these forms as well okay so
 

237
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,429
attaches to these forms as well okay so
I'm here what's Josh probably going to

238
00:03:58,429 --> 00:03:58,439
I'm here what's Josh probably going to
 

239
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,949
I'm here what's Josh probably going to
likely want to do any of those well with

240
00:03:59,949 --> 00:03:59,959
likely want to do any of those well with
 

241
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,869
likely want to do any of those well with
Close Quarters so if he could transition

242
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:01,879
Close Quarters so if he could transition
 

243
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,750
Close Quarters so if he could transition
long distance by using jod and guch then

244
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
long distance by using jod and guch then
 

245
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,149
long distance by using jod and guch then
he's going to have an advantage over me

246
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:07,159
he's going to have an advantage over me
 

247
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,350
he's going to have an advantage over me
cuz I'm definitely in a crippled

248
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:08,360
cuz I'm definitely in a crippled
 

249
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,949
cuz I'm definitely in a crippled
position here if we stay close quarters

250
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
position here if we stay close quarters
 

251
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,750
position here if we stay close quarters
it the stick's about as good for me as

252
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:12,760
it the stick's about as good for me as
 

253
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,030

it is for him he's a little bit of an
advantage but not a huge Advantage so

256
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:15,159
advantage but not a huge Advantage so
 

257
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,390
advantage but not a huge Advantage so
he'd want to get a bigger Advantage all

258
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
he'd want to get a bigger Advantage all
 

259
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,990
he'd want to get a bigger Advantage all
right so this form notices that he is

260
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000
right so this form notices that he is
 

261
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,990
right so this form notices that he is
going up and sticks to those elbows and

262
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,000
going up and sticks to those elbows and
 

263
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,230

right so I want to push him off of me
 

267
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,710
right so I want to push him off of me
now pyto Sensei shows this with a step

268
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
now pyto Sensei shows this with a step
 

269
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,270
now pyto Sensei shows this with a step
on the foot which I think a good idea

270
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,280
on the foot which I think a good idea
 

271
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,550
on the foot which I think a good idea
there's nothing wrong with that idea and

272
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:31,560
there's nothing wrong with that idea and
 

273
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,310
there's nothing wrong with that idea and
that's just real simple as he goes back

274
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:33,320
that's just real simple as he goes back
 

275
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,110
that's just real simple as he goes back
I go here boom and he's trying to step

276
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
I go here boom and he's trying to step
 

277
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,230
I go here boom and he's trying to step
back and you know jacks up his ankle or

278
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,240
back and you know jacks up his ankle or
 

279
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,390
back and you know jacks up his ankle or
whatever as I shove him back that's

280
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
whatever as I shove him back that's
 

281
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,550
whatever as I shove him back that's
really cool but honestly just shove him

282
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
really cool but honestly just shove him
 

283
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,230
really cool but honestly just shove him
way away that's the answer okay so I

284
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:43,240
way away that's the answer okay so I
 

285
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,070
way away that's the answer okay so I
shove him really far off of me so that

286
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,080
shove him really far off of me so that
 

287
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,350
shove him really far off of me so that
way his transition gets screwed up okay

288
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:48,360
way his transition gets screwed up okay
 

289
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,270
way his transition gets screwed up okay
now in this though when I go to shove

290
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,280
now in this though when I go to shove
 

291
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,990
now in this though when I go to shove
him away the form makes this guy a lot

292
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,000
him away the form makes this guy a lot
 

293
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,110
him away the form makes this guy a lot
stronger than me so I can't right I

294
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
stronger than me so I can't right I
 

295
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,189
stronger than me so I can't right I
tried to push him away but I can't push

296
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
tried to push him away but I can't push
 

297
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,270
tried to push him away but I can't push
him away so he's still coming in so as

298
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
him away so he's still coming in so as
 

299
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,749
him away so he's still coming in so as
he comes in I rotate to the other side

300
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
he comes in I rotate to the other side
 

301
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,430
he comes in I rotate to the other side
bang bang bang now in this form we're

302
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:06,440
bang bang bang now in this form we're
 

303
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,550
bang bang bang now in this form we're
opposite side of the way we ended three

304
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:09,560
opposite side of the way we ended three
 

305
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,909
opposite side of the way we ended three
so I'm opposite side of three but in a

306
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
so I'm opposite side of three but in a
 

307
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,230
so I'm opposite side of three but in a
very similar position to three right so

308
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
very similar position to three right so
 

309
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,189
very similar position to three right so
three I'd be over there uh this form I'm

310
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:16,199
three I'd be over there uh this form I'm
 

311
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,790
three I'd be over there uh this form I'm
over here right so if I was doing three

312
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
over here right so if I was doing three
 

313
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,270
over here right so if I was doing three
I would be over here and I would go into

314
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
I would be over here and I would go into
