00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
of the material in 1 two and three
 

11
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,430
of the material in 1 two and three
there's lots of other little lessons you

12

there's lots of other little lessons you
 

13
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,590
there's lots of other little lessons you
need but mostly the Lessons Learned in

Form 1 2 and 3 are repeated over and

16
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
Form 1 2 and 3 are repeated over and
 

17
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,790
Form 1 2 and 3 are repeated over and
over again in the other forms because

00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
over again in the other forms because
 

19
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,990
over again in the other forms because
Form 1 2 and 3 basically talk about

20
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
Form 1 2 and 3 basically talk about
 

21
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,029
Form 1 2 and 3 basically talk about
transitioning kinai and Skai and why you

22
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
transitioning kinai and Skai and why you
 

23
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,630
transitioning kinai and Skai and why you
would transition kinai and Skai and how

24
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:29,640
would transition kinai and Skai and how
 

25
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,709
would transition kinai and Skai and how
you would deal with a person being in

00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
you would deal with a person being in
 

27
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,990
you would deal with a person being in
either or transitioning to either um

either or transitioning to either um
when a situation arises so one two and

30
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
when a situation arises so one two and
 

31
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,110
when a situation arises so one two and
three really deal with a lot of the meat

32
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,120
three really deal with a lot of the meat

of what I think the Kumi Joe are

34
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
of what I think the Kumi Joe are
 

35
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,590
of what I think the Kumi Joe are
teaching I think cyto Sensei Kumi Joe

36
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:44,600
teaching I think cyto Sensei Kumi Joe
 

37
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,310
teaching I think cyto Sensei Kumi Joe
are basically talking for the most part

38
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:47,320
are basically talking for the most part
 

39
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,630
are basically talking for the most part
about how to get a distance Advantage

40
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
about how to get a distance Advantage
 

41
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,830
about how to get a distance Advantage
whether that be close-up dist advantage

42
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:52,840
whether that be close-up dist advantage
 

43
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,029
whether that be close-up dist advantage
or long- range distance Advantage how

44
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
or long- range distance Advantage how
 

45
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,150
or long- range distance Advantage how
you transition to that advantage and how

46
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,160
you transition to that advantage and how
 

47
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,110
you transition to that advantage and how
you deal with someone transitioning to

48
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
you deal with someone transitioning to
 

49
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,670
you deal with someone transitioning to
an advantage and I think that's the

50
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:00,680
an advantage and I think that's the
 

51
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,310
an advantage and I think that's the
majority of material years ago as I

52
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
majority of material years ago as I
 

53
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,790
majority of material years ago as I
started pulling it apart I realized I

54
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:03,800
started pulling it apart I realized I
 

55
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,789
started pulling it apart I realized I
was like oh this is what this is really

56
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:05,799
was like oh this is what this is really
 

57
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,670
was like oh this is what this is really
about there are some other things right

58
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
about there are some other things right
 

59
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,990
about there are some other things right
how you would deal with someone if you

60
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,000
how you would deal with someone if you
 

61
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,830
how you would deal with someone if you
were not in a ready to fight position

62
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,840
were not in a ready to fight position
 

63
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,070
were not in a ready to fight position
and that's what a lot of the other forms

64
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
and that's what a lot of the other forms
 

65
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,670
and that's what a lot of the other forms
talk about in fact after we get past one

66
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
talk about in fact after we get past one
 

67
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,630
talk about in fact after we get past one
two and three they all describe that

68
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:15,640
two and three they all describe that
 

69
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,350
two and three they all describe that
kind of situation so there's a lot of

70
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
kind of situation so there's a lot of
 

71
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,590
kind of situation so there's a lot of
that in there too but the main ideas are

72
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
that in there too but the main ideas are
 

73
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,749
that in there too but the main ideas are
how we deal with distancing and that's

74
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
how we deal with distancing and that's
 

75
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,749
how we deal with distancing and that's
something that I feel like I didn't

76
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:22,759
something that I feel like I didn't
 

77
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,510
something that I feel like I didn't
learn in the traditionally ew system

78
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:24,520
learn in the traditionally ew system
 

79
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,109
learn in the traditionally ew system
even though it was built into the system

80
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:26,119
even though it was built into the system
 

81
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,149
even though it was built into the system
it wasn't until later that I had those

82
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
it wasn't until later that I had those
 

83
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,510
it wasn't until later that I had those
problems with distancing that I was like

84
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
problems with distancing that I was like
 

85
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,789
problems with distancing that I was like
oh this is actually explained to me in

86
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
oh this is actually explained to me in
 

87
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,550
oh this is actually explained to me in
the form I just was too dumb to realize

88
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
the form I just was too dumb to realize
 

89
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,950
the form I just was too dumb to realize
it so anyway so we're going to talk

90
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:33,960
it so anyway so we're going to talk
 

91
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,830
it so anyway so we're going to talk
about one two and three I'm going get

92
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:34,840
about one two and three I'm going get
 

93
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,590
about one two and three I'm going get
Josh out here we to work

94
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:40,600

 

95
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,870

Josh all right so let's talk about uh

Josh all right so let's talk about uh
 

97
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,709
Josh all right so let's talk about uh
first form second form third form and

98
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:46,719
first form second form third form and
 

99
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,630
first form second form third form and
what they're doing um so first off uh

100
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
what they're doing um so first off uh
 

101
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,230
what they're doing um so first off uh
first form second form third form are

102
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
first form second form third form are
 

103
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,550
first form second form third form are
the only three forms that are a heads up

104
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
the only three forms that are a heads up
 

105
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,389
the only three forms that are a heads up
situation and what I mean is we both

106
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
situation and what I mean is we both
 

107
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,190
situation and what I mean is we both
know we're engaged in a fight everything

108
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,200
know we're engaged in a fight everything
 

109
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,789
know we're engaged in a fight everything
else is going to be one person not ready

110
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
else is going to be one person not ready
 

111
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,389
else is going to be one person not ready
for some kind of exchange um but these

112
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:03,399
for some kind of exchange um but these
 

113
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,990
for some kind of exchange um but these
all three are ready for an exchange so

114
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
all three are ready for an exchange so
 

115
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,510
all three are ready for an exchange so
actually let's switch directions here

116
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,520
actually let's switch directions here
 

117
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,270
actually let's switch directions here
okay

118
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
okay
 

119
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,510
okay
so one of the most important things

120
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
so one of the most important things
 

121
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,390
so one of the most important things
taught here and taught in all these Kumi

122
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:13,400
taught here and taught in all these Kumi
 

123
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,030
taught here and taught in all these Kumi
Joe is transitioning jod guch and why

124
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
Joe is transitioning jod guch and why
 

125
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,990
Joe is transitioning jod guch and why
one would transition jodan guch so in

126
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
one would transition jodan guch so in
 

127
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,150
one would transition jodan guch so in
the first form we have out of distance

128
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,160
the first form we have out of distance
 

129
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,790
the first form we have out of distance
and Josh is going to transition Jordan

130
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
and Josh is going to transition Jordan
 

131
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,589
and Josh is going to transition Jordan
guch and he's doing that for a reason

132
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:26,599
guch and he's doing that for a reason
 

133
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,509
guch and he's doing that for a reason
because by transitioning jodan guch he

134
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:28,519
because by transitioning jodan guch he
 

135
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:30,790
because by transitioning jodan guch he
can cover the distance he needs to cover

136
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
can cover the distance he needs to cover
 

137
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,869
can cover the distance he needs to cover
here in order to hit me so we're out of

138
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
here in order to hit me so we're out of
 

139
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,910
here in order to hit me so we're out of
distance go back we're out of distance

140
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:34,920
distance go back we're out of distance
 

141
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,830
distance go back we're out of distance
for ski Kamai uh you're fine uh we're

142
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:37,840
for ski Kamai uh you're fine uh we're
 

143
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,350
for ski Kamai uh you're fine uh we're
out of distance for ski Kamai here so

144
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
out of distance for ski Kamai here so
 

145
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,910
out of distance for ski Kamai here so
meaning if I took a regular ski Kamai I

146
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:40,920
meaning if I took a regular ski Kamai I
 

147
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,949
meaning if I took a regular ski Kamai I
don't get Josh and the same would be

148
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:41,959
don't get Josh and the same would be
 

149
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,550
don't get Josh and the same would be
true for him he wouldn't get me but if

150
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:43,560
true for him he wouldn't get me but if
 

151
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,110
true for him he wouldn't get me but if
he transitions jodan Gayu he's covering

152
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,120
he transitions jodan Gayu he's covering
 

153
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,030
he transitions jodan Gayu he's covering
that distance and hitting me now look

154
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,040
that distance and hitting me now look
 

155
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,470
that distance and hitting me now look
that's what you want to be doing when

156
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
that's what you want to be doing when
 

157
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,750
that's what you want to be doing when
you're making a distance change is you

158
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:52,760
you're making a distance change is you
 

159
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,630
you're making a distance change is you
want to be actively making them do

160
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
want to be actively making them do
 

161
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,470
want to be actively making them do
something as well otherwise you're just

162
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
something as well otherwise you're just
 

163
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,190
something as well otherwise you're just
giving them more time to prepare for

164
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,200
giving them more time to prepare for
 

165
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,350
giving them more time to prepare for
what you're about to do so he doesn't

166
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:00,360
what you're about to do so he doesn't
 

167
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,270
what you're about to do so he doesn't
want to give me prep time as he moves in

168
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,280
want to give me prep time as he moves in
 

169
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,550
want to give me prep time as he moves in
he's going to be hitting me and that at

170
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:03,560
he's going to be hitting me and that at
 

171
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,149
he's going to be hitting me and that at
least makes me have to defend the shot

172
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:05,159
least makes me have to defend the shot
 

173
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,509
least makes me have to defend the shot
or whatever else I'm doing so that's one

174
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
or whatever else I'm doing so that's one
 

175
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,750
or whatever else I'm doing so that's one
way we can use it okay now in second

176
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
way we can use it okay now in second
 

177
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,430
way we can use it okay now in second
form we're in close so in uh second form

178
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:14,440
form we're in close so in uh second form
 

179
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,910
form we're in close so in uh second form
we're at a close range like this and as

180
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:16,920
we're at a close range like this and as
 

181
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,630
we're at a close range like this and as
Josh comes to get me I deal with this

182
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
Josh comes to get me I deal with this
 

183
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,390
Josh comes to get me I deal with this
with the mawashi barai now I can use the

184
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
with the mawashi barai now I can use the
 

185
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,869
with the mawashi barai now I can use the
ideas of first form here as well right

186
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
ideas of first form here as well right
 

187
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,229
ideas of first form here as well right
so meaning if Josh took that transition

188
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:29,239
so meaning if Josh took that transition
 

189
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,229
so meaning if Josh took that transition
so because were close if Josh took that

190
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:31,239
so because were close if Josh took that
 

191
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:33,190
so because were close if Josh took that
transition and tried to jod and G I

192
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
transition and tried to jod and G I
 

193
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,030
transition and tried to jod and G I
could hit him here and then cover right

194
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
could hit him here and then cover right
 

195
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,030
could hit him here and then cover right
so that's what first form teaches us and

196
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
so that's what first form teaches us and
 

197
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,190
so that's what first form teaches us and
I can use that idea in second form okay

198
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,200
I can use that idea in second form okay
 

199
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,350
I can use that idea in second form okay
also though I can use or Josh can use

200
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
also though I can use or Josh can use
 

201
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,750
also though I can use or Josh can use
that in order to avoid this right so see

202
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
that in order to avoid this right so see
 

203
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,070
that in order to avoid this right so see
he's pulling back from that so in first

204
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
he's pulling back from that so in first
 

205
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,710
he's pulling back from that so in first
form we have that idea that I can thrust

206
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
form we have that idea that I can thrust
 

207
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,390
form we have that idea that I can thrust
him on the offbeat while he's prepping

208
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
him on the offbeat while he's prepping
 

209
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,390
him on the offbeat while he's prepping
the high action and then still defend my

210
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
the high action and then still defend my
 

211
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,550
the high action and then still defend my
head but Josh can now use that same idea

212
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:57,560
head but Josh can now use that same idea
 

213
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,350
head but Josh can now use that same idea
the transition J to make this instead of

214
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:00,360
the transition J to make this instead of
 

215
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,429
the transition J to make this instead of
come in and so if I tried that idea here

216
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
come in and so if I tried that idea here
 

217
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,270
come in and so if I tried that idea here
he could pull back boom and I'm not

218
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
he could pull back boom and I'm not
 

219
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,270
he could pull back boom and I'm not
going to be able to get him right so

220
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
going to be able to get him right so
 

221
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,149
going to be able to get him right so
this is where we see first form and

222
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:09,159
this is where we see first form and
 

223
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,830
this is where we see first form and
second form inform each other right so

224
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:10,840
second form inform each other right so
 

225
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,949
second form inform each other right so
they're informing each other about what

226
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:11,959
they're informing each other about what
 

227
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,750
they're informing each other about what
we could do if at any point Josh felt

228
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
we could do if at any point Josh felt
 

229
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,949
we could do if at any point Josh felt
like I was going to hit him on the low

230
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
like I was going to hit him on the low
 

231
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,710
like I was going to hit him on the low
line using joden guch he could pull back

232
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:17,720
line using joden guch he could pull back
 

233
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,909
line using joden guch he could pull back
okay now we get how do I cover that

234
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
okay now we get how do I cover that
 

235
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,749
okay now we get how do I cover that
distance in second form teaches us how

236
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
distance in second form teaches us how
 

237
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,390
distance in second form teaches us how
we cover the distance if he tries to

238
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:23,400
we cover the distance if he tries to
 

239
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,510
we cover the distance if he tries to
back off right so in second form here

240
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:26,520
back off right so in second form here
 

241
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,230
back off right so in second form here
now look if I just shot here he'd pull

242
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
now look if I just shot here he'd pull
 

243
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,870
now look if I just shot here he'd pull
up but if I come up underneath I cover a

244
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
up but if I come up underneath I cover a
 

245
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,590
up but if I come up underneath I cover a
huge amount of distance and I do it in a

246
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:32,600
huge amount of distance and I do it in a
 

247
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,189
huge amount of distance and I do it in a
protected position so meaning if he was

248
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:34,199
protected position so meaning if he was
 

249
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,629
protected position so meaning if he was
fast I'm in Boni noay that entire time

250
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
fast I'm in Boni noay that entire time
 

251
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,990
fast I'm in Boni noay that entire time
to protect myself so these two inform

252
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,000
to protect myself so these two inform
 

253
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,950
to protect myself so these two inform
each other immediately about things that

254
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
each other immediately about things that
 

255
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,749
each other immediately about things that
are going on right okay now when we get

256
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
are going on right okay now when we get
 

257
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,469
are going on right okay now when we get
to third form we're seeing what happens

258
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
to third form we're seeing what happens
 

259
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,150
to third form we're seeing what happens
if you get crowded from the kinai

260
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,160
if you get crowded from the kinai
 

261
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,230
if you get crowded from the kinai
position which is usually off of the

262
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,240
position which is usually off of the
 

263
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,629
position which is usually off of the
transition the other two forms off the

264
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
transition the other two forms off the
 

265
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,150
transition the other two forms off the
transition but let's say I'm in kinai

266
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,160
transition but let's say I'm in kinai
 

267
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,390
transition but let's say I'm in kinai
okay and so this guy's coming in so now

268
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:57,400
okay and so this guy's coming in so now
 

269
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,270
okay and so this guy's coming in so now
look The Stance wise what's happening is

270
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
look The Stance wise what's happening is
 

271
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,029
look The Stance wise what's happening is
we're close range and Josh is in the

272
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:02,039
we're close range and Josh is in the
 

273
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,469
we're close range and Josh is in the
superior Kamai for close range my

274
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
superior Kamai for close range my
 

275
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,870
superior Kamai for close range my
weapons over here to the side which

276
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:05,880
weapons over here to the side which
 

277
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,270
weapons over here to the side which
means if I wanted to use this to defend

278
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
means if I wanted to use this to defend
 

279
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,870
means if I wanted to use this to defend
myself it'd be kind of difficult and

280
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
myself it'd be kind of difficult and
 

281
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,430
myself it'd be kind of difficult and
yeah I could Whack Him but what good

282
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:10,440
yeah I could Whack Him but what good
 

283
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,590
yeah I could Whack Him but what good
would the whack do cuz I'm still going

284
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
would the whack do cuz I'm still going
 

285
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,830
would the whack do cuz I'm still going
to get gotten right so how can I change

286
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:14,840
to get gotten right so how can I change
 

287
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,629
to get gotten right so how can I change
the way I'm using this weapon so now if

288
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:17,639
the way I'm using this weapon so now if
 

289
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,510
the way I'm using this weapon so now if
I was the one transitioning into longer

290
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
I was the one transitioning into longer
 

291
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,390
I was the one transitioning into longer
distance stance how can I use as he

292
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:21,400
distance stance how can I use as he
 

293
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,830
distance stance how can I use as he
comes in the backside to defend myself

294
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
comes in the backside to defend myself
 

295
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,350
comes in the backside to defend myself
right so this if I'm in Kenai and we're

296
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:26,360
right so this if I'm in Kenai and we're
 

297
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,870
right so this if I'm in Kenai and we're
close range how can I defend myself

298
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:27,880
close range how can I defend myself
 

299
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,749
close range how can I defend myself
close range this is how right okay now

300
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:30,759
close range this is how right okay now
 

301
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,510
close range this is how right okay now
what this does and so there's lots of

302
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:32,520
what this does and so there's lots of
 

303
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,749
what this does and so there's lots of
ways I could attack from here but the

304
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
ways I could attack from here but the
 

305
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,110
ways I could attack from here but the
form teaches us to turn it all the way

306
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,120
form teaches us to turn it all the way
 

307
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,950
form teaches us to turn it all the way
around now what's cool about that is

308
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:37,960
around now what's cool about that is
 

309
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,230
around now what's cool about that is
this turning also puts me back in this

310
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
this turning also puts me back in this
 

311
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,830
this turning also puts me back in this
position so if I wanted to use it for

312
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
position so if I wanted to use it for
 

313
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,070
position so if I wanted to use it for
either first form or second form I could

314
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
either first form or second form I could
 

315
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,230
either first form or second form I could
so watch what I mean by this it's really

316
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,240
so watch what I mean by this it's really
 

317
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,590
so watch what I mean by this it's really
cool so after I hit Josh He transitions

318
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
cool so after I hit Josh He transitions
 

319
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,070
cool so after I hit Josh He transitions
juch right so let's say he transition go

320
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
juch right so let's say he transition go
 

321
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,350
juch right so let's say he transition go
ahead and comes here and hits me all

322
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
ahead and comes here and hits me all
 

323
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,909
ahead and comes here and hits me all
right now if I'm faster than him I can

324
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919
right now if I'm faster than him I can
 

325
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,430
right now if I'm faster than him I can
use first form boom right okay faster

326
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:58,440
use first form boom right okay faster
 

327
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,909
use first form boom right okay faster
than him first form first use first form

328
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:00,919
than him first form first use first form
 

329
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:03,670
than him first form first use first form
if he detects that and go backs up then

330
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
if he detects that and go backs up then
 

331
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,390
if he detects that and go backs up then
I can use second form to come in after

332
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:05,400
I can use second form to come in after
 

333
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,390
I can use second form to come in after
him right so I can deal with him whether

334
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
him right so I can deal with him whether
 

335
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,670
him right so I can deal with him whether
he's backing up or crowding me with

336
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:10,680
he's backing up or crowding me with
 

337
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,150
he's backing up or crowding me with
first and second form so are there any

338
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:13,160
first and second form so are there any
 

339
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,830
first and second form so are there any
other ideas yes and this form teaches us

340
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
other ideas yes and this form teaches us
 

341
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,670
other ideas yes and this form teaches us
the third idea in there which is after

342
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:18,680
the third idea in there which is after
 

343
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,469
the third idea in there which is after
this defense I can still go here and

344
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:21,479
this defense I can still go here and
 

345
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,070
this defense I can still go here and
that's if he's too quick for me to do

346
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,080
that's if he's too quick for me to do
 

347
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,830
that's if he's too quick for me to do
either of those other two ideas right

348
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:24,840
either of those other two ideas right
 

349
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,870
either of those other two ideas right
those other two ideas require me to get

350
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
those other two ideas require me to get
 

351
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,510
those other two ideas require me to get
here to stab but if I get here and I'm

352
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
here to stab but if I get here and I'm
 

353
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,749
here to stab but if I get here and I'm
kind of junked up then as he comes

354
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
kind of junked up then as he comes
 

355
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,790
kind of junked up then as he comes
around I can just use this to just knock

356
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:33,800
around I can just use this to just knock
 

357
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,390
around I can just use this to just knock
it away right so it's a crude Parry but

358
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
it away right so it's a crude Parry but
 

359
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,189
it away right so it's a crude Parry but
that is another idea that I might get if

360
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:38,199
that is another idea that I might get if
 

361
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,670
that is another idea that I might get if
I'm not quick enough to turn those other

362
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
I'm not quick enough to turn those other
 

363
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,309
I'm not quick enough to turn those other
two over so in third form if we get here

364
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
two over so in third form if we get here
 

365
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,790
two over so in third form if we get here
and as he slow down a little for me as

366
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:45,800
and as he slow down a little for me as
 

367
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,070
and as he slow down a little for me as
he's transitioning I'm quicker than him

368
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
he's transitioning I'm quicker than him
 

369
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,790
he's transitioning I'm quicker than him
I can get him here if I'm quicker than

370
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
I can get him here if I'm quicker than
 

371
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,550
I can get him here if I'm quicker than
him and he detects that so he starts to

372
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
him and he detects that so he starts to
 

373
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,629
him and he detects that so he starts to
back off I got to be a little slower

374
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
back off I got to be a little slower
 

375
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,150
back off I got to be a little slower
than that I got to I'm going to come up

376
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
than that I got to I'm going to come up
 

377
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,430
than that I got to I'm going to come up
from underneath him right does that make

378
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
from underneath him right does that make
 

379
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,869
from underneath him right does that make
sense so either way I can can deal with

380
00:06:59,869 --> 00:06:59,879
sense so either way I can can deal with
 

381
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,710
sense so either way I can can deal with
those two situations now if I'm not able

382
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:01,720
those two situations now if I'm not able
 

383
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,150
those two situations now if I'm not able
to do either one of those so I'm not

384
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,160
to do either one of those so I'm not
 

385
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,189
to do either one of those so I'm not
quicker than him then what happens is I

386
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
quicker than him then what happens is I
 

387
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,710
quicker than him then what happens is I
can use this side to defend myself right

388
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:07,720
can use this side to defend myself right
 

389
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,189
can use this side to defend myself right
now once I get over here if he R in zoku

390
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
now once I get over here if he R in zoku
 

391
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,070
now once I get over here if he R in zoku
I could do either of those things again

392
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,080
I could do either of those things again
 

393
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,230
I could do either of those things again
right so if I'm quicker than him I can

394
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
right so if I'm quicker than him I can
 

395
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,869
right so if I'm quicker than him I can
go here and defend first form okay if he

396
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:16,879
go here and defend first form okay if he
 

397
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,029
go here and defend first form okay if he
detects you got to slow down as if he

398
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
detects you got to slow down as if he
 

399
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,990
detects you got to slow down as if he
detects that and backs up for me I can

400
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,000
detects that and backs up for me I can
 

401
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,230
detects that and backs up for me I can
track him down and Whack Him from

402
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
track him down and Whack Him from
 

403
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,629
track him down and Whack Him from
underneath right so I could do those

404
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:23,639
underneath right so I could do those
 

405
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,350
underneath right so I could do those
same things on the other side as well

406
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
same things on the other side as well
 

407
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,510
same things on the other side as well
and this perform shows you how to set up

408
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
and this perform shows you how to set up
 

409
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,790
and this perform shows you how to set up
to do both of those things now now what

410
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:29,800
to do both of those things now now what
 

411
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,909
to do both of those things now now what
happens third answer again if I'm not

412
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
happens third answer again if I'm not
 

413
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,710
happens third answer again if I'm not
fast enough doing either of those as he

414
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:33,720
fast enough doing either of those as he
 

415
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,390
fast enough doing either of those as he
comes in I whack him here boom okay now

416
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:37,400
comes in I whack him here boom okay now
 

417
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,990
comes in I whack him here boom okay now

because I can take the lessons of I can

580
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
because I can take the lessons of I can

transition back or forward Nei one of

582
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,000
transition back or forward Nei one of
 

583
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,310
transition back or forward Nei one of
those how do we adapt to that when it

584
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:35,320
those how do we adapt to that when it
 

585
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,030
those how do we adapt to that when it
can happen what are the counters for

586
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
can happen what are the counters for
 

587
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,509
can happen what are the counters for
that and what are the grappling

588
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:38,519
that and what are the grappling
 

589
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,150
that and what are the grappling
situations that are likely to happen

590
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
situations that are likely to happen
 

591
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,949
situations that are likely to happen
after that so we get a ton in first

592
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:41,959
after that so we get a ton in first
 

593
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,910
after that so we get a ton in first
second and third form um the next two

594
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
second and third form um the next two
 

595
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,829
second and third form um the next two
forms are going to be really important

596
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
forms are going to be really important
 

597
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:45,870
forms are going to be really important
they're all important and they teach

598
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:45,880
they're all important and they teach
 

599
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,389
they're all important and they teach
different things but to me you could

600
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:47,399
different things but to me you could
 

601
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,949
different things but to me you could
probably get you know 70 80% of all the

602
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
probably get you know 70 80% of all the
 

603
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,269
probably get you know 70 80% of all the
work from first second and third form so

604
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
work from first second and third form so
 

605
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,670
work from first second and third form so
I think they're highly important okay

606
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:54,680
I think they're highly important okay
 

607
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,550
I think they're highly important okay
