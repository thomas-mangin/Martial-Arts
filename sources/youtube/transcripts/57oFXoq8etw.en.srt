1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,070

all right uh we're going to go to the

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,080
all right uh we're going to go to the
 

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,670
all right uh we're going to go to the
fifth Li lift in air quotes there uh I

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:06,680
fifth Li lift in air quotes there uh I
 

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,509
fifth Li lift in air quotes there uh I
just don't have time to do the deadlift

6
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:08,519
just don't have time to do the deadlift
 

7
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,190
just don't have time to do the deadlift
and the and the back squats yet we'll

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
and the and the back squats yet we'll
 

9
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,350
and the and the back squats yet we'll
get there okay so this is the fifth one

10
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:14,360
get there okay so this is the fifth one
 

11
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,390
get there okay so this is the fifth one
and this fifth one is really

12
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:17,400
and this fifth one is really
 

13
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,109
and this fifth one is really
not uh necessarily a strength gaining

14
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
not uh necessarily a strength gaining
 

15
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,670
not uh necessarily a strength gaining
exercise like the other four R but we

16
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:24,680
exercise like the other four R but we
 

17
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,830
exercise like the other four R but we
use it uh for a couple reasons uh one

18
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
use it uh for a couple reasons uh one
 

19
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,389
use it uh for a couple reasons uh one
it's going to I your

20
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:31,399
it's going to I your
 

21
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:35,510
it's going to I your
biceps uh and in a fight uh you're you'd

22
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
biceps uh and in a fight uh you're you'd
 

23
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,110
biceps uh and in a fight uh you're you'd
rather have a strong arm than a weak

24
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,120
rather have a strong arm than a weak
 

25
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,310
rather have a strong arm than a weak
arms so this is a way of getting your

26
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,320
arms so this is a way of getting your
 

27
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,590
arms so this is a way of getting your
arms uh your forearms your grip strength

28
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:44,600
arms uh your forearms your grip strength
 

29
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,229
arms uh your forearms your grip strength
H your biceps and of course the lats uh

30
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
H your biceps and of course the lats uh
 

31
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,709
H your biceps and of course the lats uh
condition so I prefer the chinups over

32
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
condition so I prefer the chinups over
 

33
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,349
condition so I prefer the chinups over
the pull-ups uh because it hits more of

34
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:54,359
the pull-ups uh because it hits more of
 

35
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,750
the pull-ups uh because it hits more of
your fighting muscles than just your

36
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:56,760
your fighting muscles than just your
 

37
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,150
your fighting muscles than just your
your um your lats okay so we do the

38
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
your um your lats okay so we do the
 

39
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,069
your um your lats okay so we do the
chinups and then uh primarily though why

40
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:03,079
chinups and then uh primarily though why
 

41
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,070
chinups and then uh primarily though why
we use the chinups is it is indicating

42
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:07,080
we use the chinups is it is indicating
 

43
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,469
we use the chinups is it is indicating
or indicative of the quality of your

44
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:09,479
or indicative of the quality of your
 

45
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,550
or indicative of the quality of your
strength to weight ratio okay so um we

46
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
strength to weight ratio okay so um we
 

47
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,469
strength to weight ratio okay so um we
do have an objective strength goal but

48
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
do have an objective strength goal but
 

49
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,149
do have an objective strength goal but
we are not going to be weightlifters or

50
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:21,159
we are not going to be weightlifters or
 

51
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,030
we are not going to be weightlifters or
powerlifters that's not our Sport and

52
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:24,040
powerlifters that's not our Sport and
 

53
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,190
powerlifters that's not our Sport and
our sport is combat per se and towards

54
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:28,200
our sport is combat per se and towards
 

55
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,390
our sport is combat per se and towards
that end we have to prioritize ize uh

56
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:31,400
that end we have to prioritize ize uh
 

57
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,350
that end we have to prioritize ize uh
Mobility so we prioritize Mobility

58
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:34,360
Mobility so we prioritize Mobility
 

59
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,670
Mobility so we prioritize Mobility
slightly over strength and that means

60
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:36,680
slightly over strength and that means
 

61
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,830
slightly over strength and that means
that I can't just be this big huge

62
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
that I can't just be this big huge
 

63
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,350
that I can't just be this big huge
strong tubble Ard on the mat I got to be

64
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,360
strong tubble Ard on the mat I got to be
 

65
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,870
strong tubble Ard on the mat I got to be
agile and quick uh as well as strong so

66
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:45,880
agile and quick uh as well as strong so
 

67
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,190
agile and quick uh as well as strong so
chinups are very indicative of that and

68
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
chinups are very indicative of that and
 

69
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,870
chinups are very indicative of that and
what we deem as

70
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:51,880
what we deem as
 

71
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,230
what we deem as
acceptable is that you can do a 5x5 with

72
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,240
acceptable is that you can do a 5x5 with
 

73
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,950
acceptable is that you can do a 5x5 with
your chinups uh you'll see that we have

74
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:57,960
your chinups uh you'll see that we have
 

75
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,830
your chinups uh you'll see that we have
people at the dojo that are really wrong

76
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:00,840
people at the dojo that are really wrong
 

77
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,950
people at the dojo that are really wrong
and uh they might have to up this all

78
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
and uh they might have to up this all
 

79
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,029
and uh they might have to up this all
the way up to between 7 and 10 uh no

80
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:06,039
the way up to between 7 and 10 uh no
 

81
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,110
the way up to between 7 and 10 uh no
problem and I mainly don't want their um

82
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
problem and I mainly don't want their um
 

83
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,030
problem and I mainly don't want their um
I don't want too much rest from the

84
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
I don't want too much rest from the
 

85
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,030
I don't want too much rest from the
other exercises so for example if we

86
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
other exercises so for example if we
 

87
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,869
other exercises so for example if we
were doing a hit uh workout and they

88
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:17,879
were doing a hit uh workout and they
 

89
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,910
were doing a hit uh workout and they
could sit up here on chinups all day but

90
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
could sit up here on chinups all day but
 

91
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,910
could sit up here on chinups all day but
their legs are getting too much rest so

92
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
their legs are getting too much rest so
 

93
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,550
their legs are getting too much rest so
it's more like I don't like to see them

94
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:23,560
it's more like I don't like to see them
 

95
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,910
it's more like I don't like to see them
do more than seven or 10 in a hit

96
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
do more than seven or 10 in a hit
 

97
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,190
do more than seven or 10 in a hit
workout but we don't want to see less

98
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,200
workout but we don't want to see less
 

99
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,670
workout but we don't want to see less
than five so if we see that you're

100
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:30,680
than five so if we see that you're
 

101
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,190
than five so if we see that you're
working less than five you need to rest

102
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
working less than five you need to rest
 

103
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,949
working less than five you need to rest
in between five you're just too heavy uh

104
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
in between five you're just too heavy uh
 

105
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,070
in between five you're just too heavy uh
for your strength or the other way to

106
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,080
for your strength or the other way to
 

107
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,830
for your strength or the other way to
look at it is you're just too weak okay

108
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
look at it is you're just too weak okay
 

109
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,110
look at it is you're just too weak okay
so here's how we do the chinups first um

110
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,120
so here's how we do the chinups first um
 

111
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,430
so here's how we do the chinups first um
you're going to put your palms facing

112
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:48,440
you're going to put your palms facing
 

113
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,390
you're going to put your palms facing
you and your hands are shoulder width

114
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:51,400
you and your hands are shoulder width
 

115
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,309
you and your hands are shoulder width
apart so he's a little narrow there

116
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:55,319
apart so he's a little narrow there
 

117
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,830
apart so he's a little narrow there
there we go and they're what we call

118
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:58,840
there we go and they're what we call
 

119
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,270
there we go and they're what we call
strict chinups so don't do it yet he's

120
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
strict chinups so don't do it yet he's
 

121
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,110
strict chinups so don't do it yet he's
going to take all his weight off his

122
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120
going to take all his weight off his
 

123
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,270
going to take all his weight off his
legs and hang at the bottom some elbow

124
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
legs and hang at the bottom some elbow
 

125
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,270
legs and hang at the bottom some elbow
flexion is fine because different joints

126
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:14,280
flexion is fine because different joints
 

127
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,270
flexion is fine because different joints
have different level of integrity and I

128
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,280
have different level of integrity and I
 

129
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,990
have different level of integrity and I
don't want anyone hyperextending okay uh

130
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
don't want anyone hyperextending okay uh
 

131
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,990
don't want anyone hyperextending okay uh
and then he'll go up with no Kipping at

132
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,000
and then he'll go up with no Kipping at
 

133
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,110
and then he'll go up with no Kipping at
all he'll just go straight up get his

134
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
all he'll just go straight up get his
 

135
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,309
all he'll just go straight up get his
chin over the bar with no Chin lifting

136
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
chin over the bar with no Chin lifting
 

137
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,789
chin over the bar with no Chin lifting
and then he comes back down for a set of

138
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
and then he comes back down for a set of
 

139
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,429
and then he comes back down for a set of
five so now you'll do it with me he'll

140
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:33,439
five so now you'll do it with me he'll
 

141
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,990
five so now you'll do it with me he'll
take his weight off his feet and then he

142
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
take his weight off his feet and then he
 

143
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,509
take his weight off his feet and then he
does strict five go and he's just going

144
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:40,519
does strict five go and he's just going
 

145
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,149
does strict five go and he's just going
he always comes back you got a little

146
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
he always comes back you got a little
 

147
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,910
he always comes back you got a little
too much elbow flexion there you go okay

148
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
too much elbow flexion there you go okay
 

149
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,830
too much elbow flexion there you go okay
and he would do that 5 by five so here

150
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:48,840
and he would do that 5 by five so here
 

151
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,869
and he would do that 5 by five so here
we'll have uh Ronin come in and he

152
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:51,879
we'll have uh Ronin come in and he
 

153
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,110
we'll have uh Ronin come in and he
weighs a a lot more uh I still think

154
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
weighs a a lot more uh I still think
 

155
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,069
weighs a a lot more uh I still think
he's relatively a lot stronger than

156
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:57,079
he's relatively a lot stronger than
 

157
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,149
he's relatively a lot stronger than
Tristan uh but he still has the capacity

158
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
