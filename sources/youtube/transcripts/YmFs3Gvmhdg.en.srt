1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:06,710

okay so now you get the best bit you

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:06,720

 

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,430

get

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:08,440
get
 

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,110
get
first it's the third

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,120

 

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,150

kimitachi first

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:17,160

 

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,509

variation second

10
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:19,519
variation second
 

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,550
variation second
variation I'm going to do it in slow

12
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:21,560
variation I'm going to do it in slow
 

13
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,740
variation I'm going to do it in slow
motion so you can

14
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:23,750
motion so you can
 

15
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,950
motion so you can
[Music]

16
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960

 

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,269

see so that I'm strong you know because

18
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:32,279
see so that I'm strong you know because
 

19
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,150
see so that I'm strong you know because
if I'm there you might HED it and then

20
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,160
if I'm there you might HED it and then
 

21
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,389
if I'm there you might HED it and then
as it comes down I come down with

22
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
as it comes down I come down with
 

23
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,190
as it comes down I come down with
it the timing is you know very difficult

24
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:42,200
it the timing is you know very difficult
 

25
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,790
it the timing is you know very difficult
but but that's what you're looking for

26
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:43,800
but but that's what you're looking for
 

27
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,950
but but that's what you're looking for
so

28
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
so
 

29
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,310
so
here you have to pick this one up

30
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:47,320
here you have to pick this one up
 

31
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,990
here you have to pick this one up
because it's not it can't slide so this

32
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000
because it's not it can't slide so this
 

33
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,430
because it's not it can't slide so this
one you pick up but you got to be

34
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
one you pick up but you got to be
 

35
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,189
one you pick up but you got to be
careful you don't go like that it's got

36
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:54,199
careful you don't go like that it's got
 

37
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:56,670
careful you don't go like that it's got
to slide past the other hand there's so

38
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:56,680
to slide past the other hand there's so
 

39
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,229
to slide past the other hand there's so
much detail it that's what I like about

40
00:00:59,229 --> 00:00:59,239
much detail it that's what I like about
 

41
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,869
much detail it that's what I like about
it but

42
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879

 

43
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,030

it's you need the roof of the house

44
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,040
it's you need the roof of the house
 

45
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,630
it's you need the roof of the house
since you used to always say you know

46
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:07,640
since you used to always say you know
 

47
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,230
since you used to always say you know
the roof of a house will keep you safe

48
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
the roof of a house will keep you safe
 

49
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,710
the roof of a house will keep you safe

50
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:11,720
you know this won't cuz your head's
 

51
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,910
you know this won't cuz your head's
above the roof so so why I like this

52
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:16,920
above the roof so so why I like this
 

53
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,630
above the roof so so why I like this
particular kimitachi is

54
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:23,640

 

55
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,270

because once you do the variations you

56
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,280
because once you do the variations you
 

57
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,830
because once you do the variations you
really start to see

58
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:28,840
really start to see
 

59
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,950
really start to see
that

60
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:31,960

 

61
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:38,670

this roof of the

62
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:38,680

 

63
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,109

house all right if you don't like you

64
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
house all right if you don't like you
 

65
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,910
house all right if you don't like you
was under it a bit that's what happens

66
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
was under it a bit that's what happens
 

67
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,870
was under it a bit that's what happens
if if you're too narrow you end up going

68
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
if if you're too narrow you end up going
 

69
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,030
if if you're too narrow you end up going
oh I only just got out the way that time

70
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,040
oh I only just got out the way that time
 

71
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,149
oh I only just got out the way that time
but if you got the house you know that

72
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
but if you got the house you know that
 

73
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,870
but if you got the house you know that
you're always safe under it easier said

74
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
you're always safe under it easier said
 

75
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,709
you're always safe under it easier said
and done isn't it okay so one person

76
