and that's likely to do with the fact

and that's likely to do with the fact

so if there was any potential strikes

34
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079
so if there was any potential strikes
 

35
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,229
so if there was any potential strikes
here it could easily

36
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
here it could easily

just come straight out of your hand

important to know and i have mentioned

58
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
important to know and i have mentioned
 

59
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,430
important to know and i have mentioned
this in previous videos that ideally

60
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
this in previous videos that ideally
 

61
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,590

from a martial perspective you really

62
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
from a martial perspective you really
 

63
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,109
from a martial perspective you really
want both homes point in the same

64
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
want both homes point in the same
 

65
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,190
want both homes point in the same
direction and the reason for this is

66
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
direction and the reason for this is
 

67
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,950
direction and the reason for this is
because it creates more stability and

68
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
because it creates more stability and
 

69
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,870
because it creates more stability and
it's easier to transition

70
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
it's easier to transition
 

71
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,870
it's easier to transition
into other movements

72
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
into other movements
 

73
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,030
into other movements
and to other positions

74
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
and to other positions
 

75
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,789
and to other positions
that being said we do utilize this grip

76
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
that being said we do utilize this grip
 

77
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,230
that being said we do utilize this grip
so why not potentially look at other

78
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
so why not potentially look at other
 

79
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,630
so why not potentially look at other
ideas of what could possibly work so

80
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,640
ideas of what could possibly work so

going back to what i was saying

if you take a look at those two parries

84
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:23,840
if you take a look at those two parries
 

85
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,230

that i showed previously

that i showed previously
the reason that this one works is

88
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
the reason that this one works is
 

89
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,710
the reason that this one works is
because the hand here isn't rolled

90
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
because the hand here isn't rolled
 

91

like i said at the beginning this
exposes the weak part of the grip it's

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
exposes the weak part of the grip it's
 

97
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,350
exposes the weak part of the grip it's
actually rolled outwards creating this

lock this straight out by hand so if we
