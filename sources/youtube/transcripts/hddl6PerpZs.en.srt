165
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,190
directional cut they'll also shia laggy
so you see the forms and the techniques

166
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
so you see the forms and the techniques
 

167
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,270
so you see the forms and the techniques
are the same

168
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
are the same
 

169
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,350
