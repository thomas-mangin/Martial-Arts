00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,030
to the end he's gonna resist I project
that forward but I don't stay still

172
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,040
that forward but I don't stay still
 

173
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,570
that forward but I don't stay still
though I project not moving myself

174
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:47,580
though I project not moving myself
 

175
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,749
though I project not moving myself
at a ring and in a space where I can

176
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:50,759
at a ring and in a space where I can
 

177
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,570
at a ring and in a space where I can
keep projecting and all my hand is doing

178
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:53,580
keep projecting and all my hand is doing
 

179
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,890
keep projecting and all my hand is doing
is staying up with him

180
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:56,900
is staying up with him
 

181
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,830
is staying up with him
so any any projection you can't project

182
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:00,840
so any any projection you can't project
 

183
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,170
so any any projection you can't project
with your fingertips so he goes to stand

184
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:03,180
with your fingertips so he goes to stand
 

185
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,629
with your fingertips so he goes to stand
up you can keep projecting but I can't

186
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:05,639
up you can keep projecting but I can't
 

187
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,450
up you can keep projecting but I can't
stay still or my hat will come off so he

188
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:08,460
stay still or my hat will come off so he
 

189
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,969
stay still or my hat will come off so he
goes to stand up I project I project I

190
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:10,979
goes to stand up I project I project I
 

191
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,010
goes to stand up I project I project I
reject I project and it's just with

00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:16,740

 

195
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,510

same thing here I'll give a an egregious

196
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:20,520
same thing here I'll give a an egregious
 

197
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,510
same thing here I'll give a an egregious
example which is very common here

198
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
example which is very common here
 

199
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,650
example which is very common here
oh yeah

200
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:24,660
oh yeah
 

201
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,529
oh yeah
you see I'm pulling it

202
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:30,539

 

203
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,570

okay

204
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:32,580
okay
 

205
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,390
okay
he summoned me

206
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,400
he summoned me
 

207
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,070
he summoned me
and his energy is going forward

208
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080

 

209
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,890

all right energy is going that way

210
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:42,900
all right energy is going that way
 

211
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,930
all right energy is going that way
and I'm gonna pull

212
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:44,940
and I'm gonna pull
 

213
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:52,790
and I'm gonna pull
no no I'm not I'm not gonna okay

214
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800

 

215
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,370

so instead

216
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:55,380
so instead
 

217
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,529
so instead
let's say

218
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:57,539
let's say
 

219
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,710
let's say
I'm here and again you see the

220
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
I'm here and again you see the
 

221
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,909
I'm here and again you see the
fingertips and his energy is going

222
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:04,919
fingertips and his energy is going
 

223
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,010
fingertips and his energy is going
forward and each one I just keep

224
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:07,020
forward and each one I just keep
 

225
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,629
forward and each one I just keep
projecting you see

226
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
projecting you see
 

227
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,390
projecting you see
each little increment he'll resist again

228
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:11,400
each little increment he'll resist again
 

229
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,150
each little increment he'll resist again
and I keep projecting and what I'm doing

230
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
and I keep projecting and what I'm doing
 

231
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,110
and I keep projecting and what I'm doing
with my turning is staying so my is

232
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,120
with my turning is staying so my is
 

233
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,590
with my turning is staying so my is
moving at a rate and at a rotation that

234
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600
moving at a rate and at a rotation that
 

235
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,370
moving at a rate and at a rotation that
my hand stays in place it's not that I'm

236
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:28,380

 

237
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,249

so for example let's say I don't even

238
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:31,259
so for example let's say I don't even
 

239
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,029
so for example let's say I don't even
know if this will work you come here

on that energy going forward so he's
 

285
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,490
on that energy going forward so he's
going forward and I keep moving it off

286
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:43,500
going forward and I keep moving it off
 

287
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,670
going forward and I keep moving it off
the ground now it's done he's gonna get

Yin phase okay and that should be where

294
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:53,880
Yin phase okay and that should be where
 

295
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,210

the second hand comes over but now the

296
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,220
the second hand comes over but now the

shove them down
so for example if he does not fall down

304
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:05,400
so for example if he does not fall down
 

305
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,850
so for example if he does not fall down
and he's resisted

306
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:07,860
and he's resisted
 

307
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,129
and he's resisted
well nothing's gonna happen if he's

308
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:10,139
well nothing's gonna happen if he's
 

309
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,290
well nothing's gonna happen if he's
resisting and he's stronger than me but

310
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:12,300
resisting and he's stronger than me but
 

311
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,270
resisting and he's stronger than me but
it's nothing's gonna happen but if I

312
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:14,280
it's nothing's gonna happen but if I
 

313
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,330
it's nothing's gonna happen but if I
keep taking his resistance go and I

314
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:17,340
keep taking his resistance go and I
 

315
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,390
keep taking his resistance go and I

trying to be strong that's it and I just
 

429
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,230
trying to be strong that's it and I just
keep projecting to the ground projecting

430
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:09,240
keep projecting to the ground projecting
 

431
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,870
keep projecting to the ground projecting

projecting to the ground projecting to
 

435
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,690
projecting to the ground projecting to
the ground okay now

436
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:17,700
the ground okay now
 

437
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,210

instead of letting you

438
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,220
instead of letting you
 

439
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,150
instead of letting you
uh Fallout

440
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,160
uh Fallout
 

441
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,069
uh Fallout
where you'll see I want to point it out

442
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:25,079
where you'll see I want to point it out
 

443
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,650
where you'll see I want to point it out
to you resist boom there's the

444
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:27,660
to you resist boom there's the
 

445
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,230
to you resist boom there's the
projection instead of here you're

446
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
projection instead of here you're
 

447
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,910
projection instead of here you're
falling you see that

448
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
falling you see that
 

449
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,790
falling you see that
I use that falling energy to keep it

450
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
I use that falling energy to keep it
 

451
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,470
I use that falling energy to keep it
going this way

452
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
going this way
 

453
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,030
going this way
see that difference

454
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,040
see that difference
 

455
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,310
see that difference
so I don't I'm not going to let you fall

456
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
so I don't I'm not going to let you fall
 

457
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,870
so I don't I'm not going to let you fall
out free hi

458
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880

 

459
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,170

your energy I keep using

460
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,180
your energy I keep using
 

461
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,710
your energy I keep using
you get it to go this way okay all right

462
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:51,720
you get it to go this way okay all right
 

463
00:11:51,720 --> 00:12:00,829
you get it to go this way okay all right
try it again

464
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:00,839

 

465
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,389

okay so on the initial prescribed

466
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:05,399
okay so on the initial prescribed
 

467
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,449
okay so on the initial prescribed
energy print that okay has energy linear

468
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:08,459
energy print that okay has energy linear
 

469
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,730
energy print that okay has energy linear
going in the opposite direction that I

470
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:10,740
going in the opposite direction that I
 

471
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,190
going in the opposite direction that I
was going okay so I would be over here

472
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
was going okay so I would be over here
 

473
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,130
was going okay so I would be over here
so it's coming towards me okay and on

474
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,140
so it's coming towards me okay and on
 

475
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,710
so it's coming towards me okay and on
the first kazushi

476
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
the first kazushi
 

477
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,650
the first kazushi
it's the fact that that energy keeps

478
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:21,660
it's the fact that that energy keeps
 

479
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,590
it's the fact that that energy keeps
going that way that when I create a turn

480
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600

 

481
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,569

this energy is still going that way

482
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:29,579
this energy is still going that way
 

483
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,430
this energy is still going that way
still going that way still going that

484
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
still going that way still going that
 

485
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,650
still going that way still going that
way through the incremental rotation

486
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:33,660
way through the incremental rotation
 

487
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,910
way through the incremental rotation
that's what allows him to stick to uh my

488
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:37,920
that's what allows him to stick to uh my
 

489
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,009
that's what allows him to stick to uh my
curvature that's why I don't have to

490
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:40,019
curvature that's why I don't have to
 

491
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,910
curvature that's why I don't have to
pull his uh collar or anything weird

492
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
pull his uh collar or anything weird
 

493
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,310
pull his uh collar or anything weird
like that okay so I'll show you what

494
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
like that okay so I'll show you what
 

495
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,590
like that okay so I'll show you what
that means that that's this is why in

496
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:48,600
that means that that's this is why in
 

497
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,769
that means that that's this is why in
that one example when Tristan pulls

498
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:51,779
that one example when Tristan pulls
 

499
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,329
that one example when Tristan pulls
ronin's

500
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:53,339
ronin's
 

501
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,009
ronin's
further that way it generated more

502
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:57,019
further that way it generated more
 

503
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:59,629
further that way it generated more
pressure at your neck remember and I

504
00:12:59,629 --> 00:12:59,639
pressure at your neck remember and I
 

505
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,670
pressure at your neck remember and I
said look listen to your voice my

506
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
said look listen to your voice my
 

507
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,850
said look listen to your voice my
fingers are digging into you which they

508
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:04,860
fingers are digging into you which they
 

509
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,430
fingers are digging into you which they
can't if I'm just on the side but

510
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
can't if I'm just on the side but
 

511
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,769
can't if I'm just on the side but
because I'm turning and you're pulling

512
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:09,779
because I'm turning and you're pulling
 

513
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,990
because I'm turning and you're pulling
against this centripetal you're you're

514
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
against this centripetal you're you're
 

515
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,730
against this centripetal you're you're
actually generating this centripetal

516
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:13,740
actually generating this centripetal
 

517
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,949
actually generating this centripetal
energy in an equal and opposite way okay

518
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:15,959
energy in an equal and opposite way okay
 

519
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:21,410
energy in an equal and opposite way okay
so as his energies going that way

520
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:21,420

 

521
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,670

and if I take his uh that energy that's

522
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
and if I take his uh that energy that's
 

523
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,430
and if I take his uh that energy that's
going that way and I just am

524
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:28,440
going that way and I just am
 

525
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,610
going that way and I just am
incrementally it keeps going that way

526
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:30,620
incrementally it keeps going that way
 

527
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,629
incrementally it keeps going that way
incrementally you feel the pressure on

528
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
incrementally you feel the pressure on
 

529
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,629
incrementally you feel the pressure on
your neck you see that if I stop it and

530
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:35,639
your neck you see that if I stop it and
 

531
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,050
your neck you see that if I stop it and
pull it back there's it's not possible

532
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:39,060
pull it back there's it's not possible
 

533
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,110
pull it back there's it's not possible
if I try to shove it really fast past

534
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:42,120
if I try to shove it really fast past
 

535
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,009
if I try to shove it really fast past
its value it will lose it I do it at a

536
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:46,019
its value it will lose it I do it at a
 

537
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,610
its value it will lose it I do it at a
rate that is utilizing the energy that's

538
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:49,620
rate that is utilizing the energy that's
 

539
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,470
rate that is utilizing the energy that's
going that way so he's going that way

540
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:51,480
going that way so he's going that way
 

541
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,449
going that way so he's going that way
and I can keep pulling it you see

542
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:53,459
and I can keep pulling it you see
 

543
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,650
and I can keep pulling it you see
you see

544
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:54,660
you see
 

545
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:01,069
you see
you all right okay

546
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:01,079

 

547
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,530

how you what how you do that energy

548
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:03,540
how you what how you do that energy
 

549
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,690
how you what how you do that energy
though

550
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:05,700
though
 

551
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,949
though
because you're going to want to just

552
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
because you're going to want to just
 

553
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,389
because you're going to want to just
pull you're going to want to just pull

pull you're going to want to just pull
 

555
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,250
pull you're going to want to just pull
this down okay how you do that energy is

556
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:12,260
this down okay how you do that energy is
 

557
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,350
this down okay how you do that energy is
that energy that I feel on my fingertips

558
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360
that energy that I feel on my fingertips
 

559
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,850
that energy that I feel on my fingertips
I am rotating it but every single pull

560
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:19,860
I am rotating it but every single pull
 

561
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,850
I am rotating it but every single pull
that he does I ground I ground it's

it's not that I'm going like this you
 

569
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,230
it's not that I'm going like this you
won't get it that way okay it's the same

570
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
won't get it that way okay it's the same
 

571
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,829
won't get it that way okay it's the same
thing he's here okay and I ground to

572
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:39,839
thing he's here okay and I ground to
 

573
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,530

project you can do it uh

574
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:42,540
project you can do it uh
 

575
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,230
project you can do it uh
he'll pull and I'll ground off the front

576
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:45,240
he'll pull and I'll ground off the front
 

577

kazushi
he's gonna stand up for prescription in

588
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:05,579
he's gonna stand up for prescription in
 

589
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,329
he's gonna stand up for prescription in
the form okay he's gonna try to stand up

590
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:08,339
the form okay he's gonna try to stand up
 

591
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,170
the form okay he's gonna try to stand up
all right so as he stands up

592
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:12,180
all right so as he stands up
 

593
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,930
all right so as he stands up
that's where I make another of one of

594
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:14,940
that's where I make another of one of
 

595
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,250
that's where I make another of one of
those curves

596
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:16,260
those curves
 

597
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,509
those curves
and it's his his desire to stand up

598
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:20,519
and it's his his desire to stand up
 

599
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,569
and it's his his desire to stand up
that I keep projecting back down to the

600
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:23,579
that I keep projecting back down to the
 

601
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,610
that I keep projecting back down to the
ground and that creates that ikey

602
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:25,620
ground and that creates that ikey
 

603
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,069
ground and that creates that ikey
adhesion where I again don't have to

604
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
adhesion where I again don't have to
 

605
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,210
adhesion where I again don't have to
pull him

606
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:29,220
pull him
 

607
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,730
pull him
he stuck to me

608
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:31,740
he stuck to me
 

609
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,730
he stuck to me
and he is moving from projection to

610
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:34,740
and he is moving from projection to
 

611
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,590
and he is moving from projection to
projection to projection

612
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:36,600
projection to projection
 

613
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,870
projection to projection
so we got the first one we'll just get

614
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
so we got the first one we'll just get
 

615
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,050
so we got the first one we'll just get
there okay

616
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,060

 

617
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,110

here's his energy standing up do you see

618
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
here's his energy standing up do you see
 

619
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,870
here's his energy standing up do you see
and that energy standing up

620
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:47,880
and that energy standing up
 

621
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,250
and that energy standing up
occurred

622
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:49,260
occurred
 

623
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,670
occurred
on that same energy as he's going up I

624
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:52,680
on that same energy as he's going up I
 

625
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,889
on that same energy as he's going up I
keep uh

626
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:54,899
keep uh
 

627
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,530
keep uh
this curve here

628
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:57,540
this curve here
 

629
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,530
this curve here
okay uh but it's not that I'm moving my

630
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:00,540
okay uh but it's not that I'm moving my
 

631
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,710
okay uh but it's not that I'm moving my
arm externally he stands up and IT

632
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:03,720
arm externally he stands up and IT
 

633
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,050
arm externally he stands up and IT
projects you see he stands up IT

634
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,060
projects you see he stands up IT
 

635
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,110
projects you see he stands up IT
projects he stand up a little there up

636
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
projects he stand up a little there up
 

637
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,730
projects he stand up a little there up
and IT projects

638
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:10,740
and IT projects
 

639
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,490
and IT projects
that's what creates the IQ adhesion so

640
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:13,500
that's what creates the IQ adhesion so
 

641
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,370
that's what creates the IQ adhesion so
he goes warm and I keep this to here you

642
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:16,380
he goes warm and I keep this to here you
 

643
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,870
he goes warm and I keep this to here you
see

644
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:17,880
see
 

645
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,990
see
so it was your energy to the contrary

646
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,000
so it was your energy to the contrary
 

647
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,470
so it was your energy to the contrary
that I curved and now used to generate

648
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
that I curved and now used to generate
 

649
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,129
that I curved and now used to generate
the adhesion or friction at my touch

650
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:28,139
the adhesion or friction at my touch
 

651
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:38,269
the adhesion or friction at my touch
Point okay

652
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:38,279

 

653
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,030

then that Kazuki is going to pass into

654
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040
then that Kazuki is going to pass into
 

655
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,710
then that Kazuki is going to pass into
yitz Yin phase on the other arm interest

656
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:45,720
yitz Yin phase on the other arm interest
 

657
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,490
yitz Yin phase on the other arm interest
into its yawn phase okay and that person

658
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:49,500
into its yawn phase okay and that person
 

659
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,590
into its yawn phase okay and that person
is resisting

660
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
is resisting
 

661
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,509
is resisting
so they have an energy that's going this

662
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:56,519
so they have an energy that's going this
 

663
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,470
so they have an energy that's going this
way

664
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:57,480
way
 

665
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,949
way
the on the other ones I had a kind of uh

666
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
the on the other ones I had a kind of uh
 

667
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,970
the on the other ones I had a kind of uh
inward orientation to my IQ adhesion and

668
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:04,980
inward orientation to my IQ adhesion and
 

669
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,350
inward orientation to my IQ adhesion and
this one's going to be an outward

670
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:06,360
this one's going to be an outward
 

671
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,610
this one's going to be an outward
orientation okay because my curve is now

672
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:10,620
orientation okay because my curve is now
 

673
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,169
orientation okay because my curve is now
going this way

674
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:12,179
going this way
 

675
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,929
going this way
okay and their energy is going into it

676
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:14,939
okay and their energy is going into it
 

677
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,689
okay and their energy is going into it
so every time they project they get

678
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:17,699
so every time they project they get
 

679
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,210
so every time they project they get
stuck on my inner arm

680
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:20,220
stuck on my inner arm
 

681
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,030
stuck on my inner arm
I take that energy I ground it I ground

682
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,040
I take that energy I ground it I ground
 

683
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,470
I take that energy I ground it I ground
it and that's what moves it

684
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
it and that's what moves it
 

685
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,710
it and that's what moves it
incrementally through the throat

686
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720

 

687
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,549

689
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,850

so here we are this is why I don't have

690
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:37,860
so here we are this is why I don't have
 

691
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,850
so here we are this is why I don't have
to pull him I don't need to crank this

692
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:40,860
to pull him I don't need to crank this
 

693
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,390
to pull him I don't need to crank this
this arm's done this arm is now it okay

694
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
this arm's done this arm is now it okay
 

695
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,529
this arm's done this arm is now it okay
so this arm has the adhesion

696
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:48,539
so this arm has the adhesion
 

697
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:52,310
so this arm has the adhesion
this does it I'm not knocking them down

698
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
this does it I'm not knocking them down
 

699
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,529
this does it I'm not knocking them down
his Mass

700
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:54,539
his Mass
 

701
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:58,210
his Mass
has energy and that energy I ground

702
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:58,220
has energy and that energy I ground
 

703
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,430
has energy and that energy I ground
which gets Amplified on the person that

704
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
which gets Amplified on the person that
 

705
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,070
which gets Amplified on the person that
is resisting so he resists well that

706
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080
is resisting so he resists well that
 

707
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,029
is resisting so he resists well that
makes more energy that I can both

708
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:08,039
makes more energy that I can both
 

709
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,970
makes more energy that I can both
to his arm he's using that arm you could

710
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:10,980
to his arm he's using that arm you could
 

711
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,070
to his arm he's using that arm you could
do it it doesn't matter he's using that

712
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,080
do it it doesn't matter he's using that
 

713
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,090
do it it doesn't matter he's using that
arm to base okay so push and I use that

714
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:17,100
arm to base okay so push and I use that
 

715
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,549
arm to base okay so push and I use that
arm and I project the arm out you see

716
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:19,559
arm and I project the arm out you see
 

717
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,350
arm and I project the arm out you see
that all right

718
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
that all right
 

719
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,049
that all right
so we're here but now you can feel that

720
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:24,059
so we're here but now you can feel that
 

721
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,970
so we're here but now you can feel that
it's starting to go off there's a little

722
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:25,980
it's starting to go off there's a little
 

723
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,130
it's starting to go off there's a little
bit you see but it's starting to go off

724
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,140
bit you see but it's starting to go off
 

725
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:37,970
bit you see but it's starting to go off
do you feel that right okay

726
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:37,980

 

727
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,370

in the why is it going off it's

728
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,380
in the why is it going off it's
 

729
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,049
in the why is it going off it's
because you're starting to fall

730
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:42,059
because you're starting to fall
 

731
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,630
because you're starting to fall
you're you're no longer offering that

732
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
you're you're no longer offering that
 

733
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,330
you're you're no longer offering that
resistance to this curve you're starting

734
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:47,340
resistance to this curve you're starting
 

735
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,289
resistance to this curve you're starting
to fall out of it so as we get further

736
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:50,299
to fall out of it so as we get further
 

737
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:53,630
to fall out of it so as we get further
up this increment gravity is starting to

738
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:53,640
up this increment gravity is starting to
 

739
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,549
up this increment gravity is starting to
generate another energy where you start

740
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:55,559
generate another energy where you start
 

741
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,710
generate another energy where you start
to fall this way start to fall down

742
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:57,720
to fall this way start to fall down
 

743
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,909
to fall this way start to fall down
towards the ground

744
00:18:58,909 --> 00:18:58,919
towards the ground
 

745
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:05,690
towards the ground
okay

746
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:05,700

 

747
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,669

well

748
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
well
 

749
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,730
well
I can use that energy

750
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:10,740
I can use that energy
 

751
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,070
I can use that energy
to pass through

752
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,080
to pass through
 

753
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,630
to pass through
a young face into a Yin phase and now it

754
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:17,640
a young face into a Yin phase and now it
 

755
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,510
a young face into a Yin phase and now it
can still do the same thing as it's

756
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:20,520
can still do the same thing as it's
 

757
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,450
can still do the same thing as it's
pushing here

758
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:23,460

 

759
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,810

you get about an inch or two more

760
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:26,820
you get about an inch or two more
 

761
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,250
you get about an inch or two more
projection but again in combat inches

762
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:31,260
projection but again in combat inches
 

763
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,830
projection but again in combat inches
are Miles okay

764
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
are Miles okay
 

765
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,130
are Miles okay
so uh I want you you'll you'll feel I'll

766
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:37,140
so uh I want you you'll you'll feel I'll
 

767
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,710
so uh I want you you'll you'll feel I'll
try to tell you when to feel okay so

768
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:39,720
try to tell you when to feel okay so
 

769
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,529
try to tell you when to feel okay so
your energy is going that way that's

770
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:42,539
your energy is going that way that's
 

771
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,230
your energy is going that way that's
that friction point energy is coming up

772
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:45,240
that friction point energy is coming up
 

773
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,150
that friction point energy is coming up
that's that friction point you feel the

774
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:47,160
that's that friction point you feel the
 

775
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,090
that's that friction point you feel the
pulls on your finger okay then here is

776
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:50,100
pulls on your finger okay then here is
 

777
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,690
pulls on your finger okay then here is
that you feel that okay now as you start

778
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:53,700
that you feel that okay now as you start
 

779
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,850
that you feel that okay now as you start
to fall out of it you see how it went

780
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:55,860
to fall out of it you see how it went
 

781
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,990
to fall out of it you see how it went
off

782
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,000
off
 

783
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,590
off
but I can use this downward energy to

784
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:00,600
but I can use this downward energy to
 

785
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,950
but I can use this downward energy to
keep the same friction going

786
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:03,960
keep the same friction going
 

787
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,650
keep the same friction going
feel that

788
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:06,660

 

789
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,750

and what we tend to do is the guy's

790
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:08,760
and what we tend to do is the guy's
 

791
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,190
and what we tend to do is the guy's
falling and then we let them fall

792
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200

 

793
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,830

but if you were to do an inward spiral

794
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840

 

795
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,870

here

796
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
here
 

797
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,529
here
so is the same thing it doesn't stop

798
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:24,539
so is the same thing it doesn't stop
 

799
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,510
so is the same thing it doesn't stop
here it doesn't stop here

800
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:26,520
here it doesn't stop here
 

801
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,390
here it doesn't stop here
keeps going

802
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
keeps going
 

803
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,490
keeps going
and you watch his head you can see his

and you watch his head you can see his
 

805
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,230

okay they're here it's in the center you

808
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000
okay they're here it's in the center you
 

809
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,110
okay they're here it's in the center you
wash his head all exaggerated

810
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,120
wash his head all exaggerated

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,750
okay this is the external this is that
the external yield to take energy off

836
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
the external yield to take energy off
 

837
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,010
the external yield to take energy off
right and then the up to to push them

838
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:40,020
right and then the up to to push them
 

839
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,690
right and then the up to to push them
away okay if I was doing it internally I

840
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:44,700
away okay if I was doing it internally I
 

841
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,149
away okay if I was doing it internally I
would sink down and I wouldn't have to

842
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:47,159
would sink down and I wouldn't have to
 

843
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,070
would sink down and I wouldn't have to
take energy off because the energy is

844
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,080
take energy off because the energy is
 

845
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,010
take energy off because the energy is
passing in between me so to get you on

846
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:52,020
passing in between me so to get you on
 

847
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,810
passing in between me so to get you on
the same page or for those who didn't

848
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:53,820
the same page or for those who didn't
 

849
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,490
the same page or for those who didn't
see it coming around

850
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:57,500

 

851
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,970

boom there's a lot of home you see and

852
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:01,980
boom there's a lot of home you see and
 

853
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,669
boom there's a lot of home you see and
you're gonna go around it you see the

854
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:04,679
you're gonna go around it you see the
 

855
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:13,310
you're gonna go around it you see the
yield right there and then in here

856
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:13,320

 

857
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,090

it's it's good to know but you want to

858
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:17,100
it's it's good to know but you want to
 

859
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,990
it's it's good to know but you want to
try to gain the internal aspect okay so

860
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,000
try to gain the internal aspect okay so
 

861
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,549
try to gain the internal aspect okay so
as as we already saw for example uh

862
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:25,559
as as we already saw for example uh
 

863
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,789
as as we already saw for example uh
you guys have seen he both both of my

864
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
you guys have seen he both both of my
 

865
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,090
you guys have seen he both both of my
sons now lift way more than me okay

866
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:32,100
sons now lift way more than me okay
 

867
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,010
sons now lift way more than me okay
um

868
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:34,020
um
 

869
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,230
um
so if I take

870
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,240
so if I take
 

871
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,169
so if I take
if I have one person even if I don't

872
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:39,179
if I have one person even if I don't
 

873
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,149
if I have one person even if I don't
keep racing angles you see last time he

874
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:41,159
keep racing angles you see last time he
 

875
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,130
keep racing angles you see last time he
used his bracelet I don't give him any

876
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:43,140
used his bracelet I don't give him any
 

877
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,529
used his bracelet I don't give him any
bracing angle

878
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:45,539
bracing angle
 

879
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:49,850
bracing angle
he resists I cannot do it I cannot do it

880
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:49,860
he resists I cannot do it I cannot do it
 

881
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,409
he resists I cannot do it I cannot do it
and if I do that

882
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:51,419
and if I do that
 

883
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,370
and if I do that
that Yin that external Yin yield it

884
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:55,380
that Yin that external Yin yield it
 

885
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,890
that Yin that external Yin yield it
creates a weakness here that no now he's

886
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:57,900
creates a weakness here that no now he's
 

887
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,669
creates a weakness here that no now he's
got me using

888
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679

 

889
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,590

so

890
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:03,600
so
 

891
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,770
so
I have to just like the shiho Nagin I

892
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:06,780
I have to just like the shiho Nagin I
 

893
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,490
I have to just like the shiho Nagin I
have to take his resistance and keep

894
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:10,500
have to take his resistance and keep
 

895
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,710
have to take his resistance and keep
bouncing it through me it has to pass

896
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:12,720
bouncing it through me it has to pass
 

897
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,350
bouncing it through me it has to pass
through me in which case I can't go up

898
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
through me in which case I can't go up
 

899
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,230
through me in which case I can't go up
okay and in which case I can't do a

900
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
okay and in which case I can't do a
 

901
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,789
okay and in which case I can't do a
yield okay

902
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:19,799
yield okay
 

903
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,169
yield okay
so

904
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:21,179
so
 

905
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:22,070
so
um

906
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
um
 

907
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,730
um
just so you can say so be strong be

908
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:25,740
just so you can say so be strong be
 

909
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,770
just so you can say so be strong be
strong don't let me throw you don't want

910
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:27,780
strong don't let me throw you don't want
 

911
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,350
strong don't let me throw you don't want
me for you

912
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:30,360

 

913
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,049

there's just no there's no way my arm is

914
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:33,059
there's just no there's no way my arm is
 

915
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,090
there's just no there's no way my arm is
not strong enough okay

916
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:35,100
not strong enough okay
 

917
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,950
not strong enough okay
but again if you take the same he pushes

918
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:39,960
but again if you take the same he pushes
 

919
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,529
but again if you take the same he pushes
right and I take that energy I release

920
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:42,539
right and I take that energy I release
 

921
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,950
right and I take that energy I release
it down and I project it out you see I'm

922
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:45,960
it down and I project it out you see I'm
 

923
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,169
it down and I project it out you see I'm
projecting it out projecting it out

924
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:48,179
projecting it out projecting it out
 

925
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:51,590
projecting it out projecting it out
projecting the balance

926
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,600

 

927
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,590

if you add

928
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:54,600
if you add
 

929
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,149
if you add
his energy to it you see

930
00:23:59,149 --> 00:23:59,159

 

931
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,909

same thing there's no way I'm strong

932
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
same thing there's no way I'm strong
 

933
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,669
same thing there's no way I'm strong
enough but I can keep projecting keep

934
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:04,679
enough but I can keep projecting keep
 

935
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,049
enough but I can keep projecting keep
projecting

936
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:06,059
projecting
 

937
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:12,049
projecting
keep projecting that energy

938
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:12,059

 

939
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:15,110

when the guy is standing

940
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,120
when the guy is standing
 

941
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,270
when the guy is standing
it's even tougher

942
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,280
it's even tougher
 

943
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,430
it's even tougher
because he has so much of his leg

944
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
because he has so much of his leg
 

945
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,630
because he has so much of his leg
strength

946
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
strength
 

947
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,070
strength
do you think

948
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,080
do you think
 

949
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,149
do you think
is like oh God no okay

950
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:26,159
is like oh God no okay
 

951
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,430
is like oh God no okay
and I want to know how to connect his

952
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:28,440
and I want to know how to connect his
 

953
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,450
and I want to know how to connect his
Center because I don't want my throw to

954
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:32,460
Center because I don't want my throw to
 

955
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,630
Center because I don't want my throw to
come from a pulling there's no pulling

956
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:35,640
come from a pulling there's no pulling
 

957
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,130
come from a pulling there's no pulling
you can't pull people

958
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:37,140
you can't pull people
 

959
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,169
you can't pull people
I wanted to come from moving his center

960
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:41,179
I wanted to come from moving his center
 

961
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,770
I wanted to come from moving his center
around itself okay so if he resist an

962
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:45,780
around itself okay so if he resist an
 

963
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,130
around itself okay so if he resist an
incredible now and I try to shop right

964
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:49,140
incredible now and I try to shop right
 

965
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,610
incredible now and I try to shop right
he'll move his feet no

966
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:52,620
he'll move his feet no
 

967
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,830
he'll move his feet no
but if he resists

968
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:54,840
but if he resists
 

969
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,930
but if he resists
I can turn him

970
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:56,940
I can turn him
 

971
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,090
I can turn him
doing the same thing that we drew on the

972
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,100
doing the same thing that we drew on the
 

973
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,909
doing the same thing that we drew on the
board so I use the same thing I'm going

974
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
board so I use the same thing I'm going
 

975
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,370
board so I use the same thing I'm going
to spin his center around by grounding

976
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:04,380
to spin his center around by grounding
 

977
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,430
to spin his center around by grounding
it

978
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:10,440

 

979
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,110

there we are

980
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,120
there we are
 

981
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,370
there we are
okay I have this energy and I'm going to

982
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:16,380
okay I have this energy and I'm going to
 

983
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,289
okay I have this energy and I'm going to
make it go on a circle

984
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:18,299
make it go on a circle
 

985
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,289
make it go on a circle
oh he's strong strong he's not going to

986
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:21,299
oh he's strong strong he's not going to
 

987
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:29,510
oh he's strong strong he's not going to
bend for me but I can spin it

988
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520

 

989
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,970

boom here

990
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:31,980
boom here
 

991
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,590
boom here
pop

992
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
pop
 

993
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,230
pop
every every resistance every strength he

994
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
every every resistance every strength he
 

995
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,950
every every resistance every strength he
does I ground

996
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:38,960
does I ground
 

997
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,130
does I ground
to spin him

998
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,140

 

999
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,690

okay so if we're doing swadiwasa

1000
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:47,700
okay so if we're doing swadiwasa
 

1001
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,669
okay so if we're doing swadiwasa
don't milk

1002
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:49,679
