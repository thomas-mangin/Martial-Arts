19
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,630

so it's pinching

20
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
so it's pinching
 

21
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,110
so it's pinching
here and dropping here and then I push

22
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
here and dropping here and then I push
 

23
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,950
here and dropping here and then I push
this hand this hand will only drop as

24
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
this hand this hand will only drop as
 

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,350
this hand this hand will only drop as
much as this lowers in the ten con it's

26
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:46,360
much as this lowers in the ten con it's
 

27
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,950
much as this lowers in the ten con it's
not cutting down that would be pulling

28
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:49,960
not cutting down that would be pulling
 

29
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,630
not cutting down that would be pulling
and as I said as I'm trying to pull

30
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:53,640
and as I said as I'm trying to pull

32
00:00:57,389 --> 00:00:57,399
in and when I ten con they're pulling
 

33
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,670
in and when I ten con they're pulling
away from each

34
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:58,680
away from each
 

35
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,150
away from each
other well I push

36
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
other well I push
 

37
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,109
other well I push
in it's moving with me okay so I know it

38

45
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,590
hand so if I go here is a pretty weak I
adhesion you see because it's so

46
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
adhesion you see because it's so
 

47
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,469

parallel to the to his arm we're almost

48
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
parallel to the to his arm we're almost
 

49
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,190
parallel to the to his arm we're almost
like

50
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:26,200
like
 

51
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,190
like
this so but when I when I try to close

52
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:30,200
this so but when I when I try to close
 

53
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,149
this so but when I when I try to close
this in that fashion then this hand is

54
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:33,159
this in that fashion then this hand is
 

55
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,670
this in that fashion then this hand is
here and now they're not they're not

56
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:36,680
here and now they're not they're not
 

57
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,230
here and now they're not they're not
parallel his pulling out is working

58
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:39,240
parallel his pulling out is working
 

59
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,069
parallel his pulling out is working
against that you

60
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
against that you
 

61
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,789
against that you
see here it's

62
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:45,799
see here it's
 

63
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,590
see here it's
not okay so the mechanism isn't this

64
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
not okay so the mechanism isn't this
 

65
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,310
not okay so the mechanism isn't this
cuts down it's that this pushes in this

66
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,320
cuts down it's that this pushes in this
 

67
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:01,190
cuts down it's that this pushes in this
is doing this

68
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200

 

69
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,910

looking there there he
 

321
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,829
looking there there he
is he can't go here if I throw him here

322
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:26,839
is he can't go here if I throw him here
 

323
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:28,790
is he can't go here if I throw him here
well if I bring him forward for let's do

324
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
well if I bring him forward for let's do
 

325
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,990
well if I bring him forward for let's do
the worst one

326
