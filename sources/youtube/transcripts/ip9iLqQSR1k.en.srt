I'll still be back waited here at the

92
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:42,069
I'll still be back waited here at the
 

93
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll still be back waited here at the
end of this then I will shift into the

94
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,010
end of this then I will shift into the
 

95
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,990
end of this then I will shift into the
front weight and I would step forward to

96
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,000
front weight and I would step forward to
 

97
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,720
front weight and I would step forward to
also turn here

98
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:51,730

dancers think about otherwise actually
just happens by itself because it

132
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:42,519
just happens by itself because it
 

133
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,330
just happens by itself because it
becomes a natural part of a movement and

134
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:45,340
becomes a natural part of a movement and
 

135

00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:54,819
you can see the bigger picture of the
 

143
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,900
you can see the bigger picture of the

201
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,650
posture of the shomenuchi it's just
about those shomenuchi and then I come

202
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:18,660
about those shomenuchi and then I come
 

203
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,930
about those shomenuchi and then I come
in here okay and that kind of fixes his

204
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:20,940
in here okay and that kind of fixes his
 

205
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,690
in here okay and that kind of fixes his
his thought patterns of this position so

so it sort of sets it up a bit and
 

213
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,360
so it sort of sets it up a bit and
that's really good as far like I'm

214
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,370
that's really good as far like I'm
 

215
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,580
that's really good as far like I'm
concerned how that works it's just a

concerned how that works it's just a
 

217
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,600
concerned how that works it's just a
