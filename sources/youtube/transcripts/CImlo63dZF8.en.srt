because we'll ask this question
 

1449
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:09,870
because we'll ask this question
now which hand has more mass in it this

1450
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:09,880
now which hand has more mass in it this
 

1451
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,430
now which hand has more mass in it this
one or this

1452

one
 

1455
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,229
one
why cuz my Mass is closer to the to this

1456
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:19,239
why cuz my Mass is closer to the to this
 

1457

the right foot is supposed to move with
 

1917
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:22,830
the right foot is supposed to move with
the right hand okay cool but um how much

1918
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:22,840
the right hand okay cool but um how much
 

1919
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,310
the right hand okay cool but um how much
it moves

1920
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:24,320
it moves
 

1921
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,109
it moves
is going to be different every time

1922
01:34:26,109 --> 01:34:26,119
is going to be different every time
 

1923
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:29,550
is going to be different every time
because no UK can ever repeat the exact

Kam see this and

1960
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:33,480
Kam see this and
 

1961
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:39,310
Kam see this and
now my foot can it's going to go

1962
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:39,320

 

1963
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:42,950

less if I put my foot closer even with

1964
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:42,960
less if I put my foot closer even with
 

1965
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,830
less if I put my foot closer even with
that I can go

1966
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:44,840
that I can go
 

1967
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:51,109
that I can go
fur this is a strategy that is

1968
01:35:51,109 --> 01:35:51,119

 

1969
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:54,470

used indeterminate inititive

1970
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:54,480

I'll I'll lie about them life okay so if

1972
01:35:58,629 --> 01:35:58,639
I'll I'll lie about them life okay so if
 

1973
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:00,990
I'll I'll lie about them life okay so if
I I'll have them used to me in this

1974
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:01,000
I I'll have them used to me in this
 

1975
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,910
I I'll have them used to me in this
sense see this foot and he learns he's

1976
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:04,920
sense see this foot and he learns he's
 

1977
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:07,430
sense see this foot and he learns he's
got about that much but at a certain

1978
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:07,440
got about that much but at a certain
 

1979
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:10,790
got about that much but at a certain
point I'll fake that that foot up do you

1980
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:10,800
point I'll fake that that foot up do you
 

1981
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,910
point I'll fake that that foot up do you
see and then usually I would use it when

1982
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:14,920
see and then usually I would use it when
 

1983
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:17,910
see and then usually I would use it when
he threw something I say do whatever and

1984
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:17,920
he threw something I say do whatever and
 

1985
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,510
he threw something I say do whatever and
he realizes he's not going to punch and

1986
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:20,520
he realizes he's not going to punch and
 

1987
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:24,669
he realizes he's not going to punch and
I do that a few times you see

1988
01:36:24,669 --> 01:36:24,679
I do that a few times you see
 

1989
01:36:24,679 --> 01:36:28,510
I do that a few times you see
so on one time I'm he goes and I'm here

1990
01:36:28,510 --> 01:36:28,520
so on one time I'm he goes and I'm here
 

1991
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,950
so on one time I'm he goes and I'm here
you see and when he goes back then I'm

1992
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:30,960
you see and when he goes back then I'm
 

1993
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:35,030
you see and when he goes back then I'm
right on him from that okay so how far

1994
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:35,040
right on him from that okay so how far
 

1995
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,070
right on him from that okay so how far
apart your back foot is from the front

1996
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:37,080
apart your back foot is from the front
 

1997
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:41,030
apart your back foot is from the front
foot will have how much penetration do

1998
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:41,040
foot will have how much penetration do
 

1999
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,350
foot will have how much penetration do
okay that's the first thing the second

2000
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:43,360
okay that's the first thing the second
 

2001
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,229
okay that's the first thing the second
thing

2002
01:36:45,229 --> 01:36:45,239
thing
 

2003
01:36:45,239 --> 01:36:49,910
thing
is the push drag is further than the set

2004
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:49,920
is the push drag is further than the set
 

2005
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,910
is the push drag is further than the set
TR okay so you're going to open your

2006
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:53,920
TR okay so you're going to open your
 

2007
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,109
TR okay so you're going to open your
legs about that

2008
01:36:56,109 --> 01:36:56,119
legs about that
 

2009
01:36:56,119 --> 01:37:01,390
legs about that
far but you can push past that you see

2010
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:01,400
far but you can push past that you see
 

2011
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,709
far but you can push past that you see
so I was able to open

2012
01:37:04,709 --> 01:37:04,719
so I was able to open
 

2013
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:07,070
so I was able to open
it

2014
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:07,080
it
 

2015
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,430
it
right and I

2016
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:09,440
right and I
 

2017
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,870
right and I
can push past it so on this last move

2018
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:12,880
can push past it so on this last move
 

2019
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:18,590
can push past it so on this last move
you wore a little shy on the penetration

2020
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:18,600
you wore a little shy on the penetration
 

2021
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,149
you wore a little shy on the penetration
okay so it's fine it

2022
01:37:21,149 --> 01:37:21,159
okay so it's fine it
 

2023
01:37:21,159 --> 01:37:24,390
okay so it's fine it
doesn't and it had to do

2024
01:37:24,390 --> 01:37:24,400
doesn't and it had to do
 

2025
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:29,669
doesn't and it had to do
that when he came up you were

2026
01:37:29,669 --> 01:37:29,679

 

2027
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:35,189

here he comes up you're stuff in like

2028
01:37:35,189 --> 01:37:35,199
here he comes up you're stuff in like
 

2029
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:42,070
here he comes up you're stuff in like
that but he comes up shift my weight

2030
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:42,080

 

2031
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:44,510

push uh and it's just one of those

2032
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:44,520
push uh and it's just one of those
 

2033
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:47,270
push uh and it's just one of those
things I mean I imagine if you were to

2034
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:47,280
things I mean I imagine if you were to
 

2035
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:50,149
things I mean I imagine if you were to
calculate it your legs are your leg

2036
01:37:50,149 --> 01:37:50,159
calculate it your legs are your leg
 

2037
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:53,550
calculate it your legs are your leg
length you know what I mean so I imagine

2038
01:37:53,550 --> 01:37:53,560
length you know what I mean so I imagine
 

2039
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:56,950
length you know what I mean so I imagine
I could probably go past that line but

2040
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:56,960
I could probably go past that line but
 

2041
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,510
I could probably go past that line but
it gets obviously mechanically unsound

2042
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:00,520
it gets obviously mechanically unsound
 

2043
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:02,709
it gets obviously mechanically unsound
you see and so you don't do it you you

2044
01:38:02,709 --> 01:38:02,719
you see and so you don't do it you you
 

2045
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:05,229
you see and so you don't do it you you
go to here whereas the other one remains

2046
01:38:05,229 --> 01:38:05,239
go to here whereas the other one remains
 

2047
01:38:05,239 --> 01:38:07,430
go to here whereas the other one remains
mechanically sound and you can get

2048
01:38:07,430 --> 01:38:07,440
mechanically sound and you can get
 

2049
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,149
mechanically sound and you can get
across so it's the difference between

2050
01:38:10,149 --> 01:38:10,159
across so it's the difference between
 

2051
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:13,350
across so it's the difference between
the push driver of the

2052
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:13,360
the push driver of the
 

2053
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,990
the push driver of the
step

2054
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:16,000
step
 

2055
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,550
step
um and I think there's a lot of step

2056
01:38:19,550 --> 01:38:19,560
um and I think there's a lot of step
 

2057
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,189
um and I think there's a lot of step

right choice between those two things
 

2145
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,910
right choice between those two things
and then you ask this question and then
