it's in the right place because to have

it's in the right place because to have
 

241
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,170
it's in the right place because to have
the push pull on the arm that we've

242
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:18,180
the push pull on the arm that we've
 

243
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,969
the push pull on the arm that we've
talked about so he cannot post that hand

his wrist is at this angle
so that's why if I move it over here

248
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:29,099
so that's why if I move it over here
 

249
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,969
so that's why if I move it over here
it's going to be in the field without
