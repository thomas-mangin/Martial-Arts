do you see that why does he fall like a
 

419
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,610
do you see that why does he fall like a
board because on the impact he tensed up

00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,870
and you get swept that way okay it's
used against you

504
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
used against you
 

505
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,569
used against you
again as I mentioned only untrained

506
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:23,579
again as I mentioned only untrained
 

507
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,970
again as I mentioned only untrained
people do that so I I don't care if you

508
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:25,980
people do that so I I don't care if you
 

509
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,490
people do that so I I don't care if you
actually wear aquava

510
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:28,500
actually wear aquava
 

511
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,130
actually wear aquava
right and you're at a dojo and you train

512
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:31,140
right and you're at a dojo and you train
 

513
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,250
right and you're at a dojo and you train
it in an art what I mean by untrained is

514
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:34,260
it in an art what I mean by untrained is
 

515
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,710
it in an art what I mean by untrained is
you are still unconsciously controlled

516
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
you are still unconsciously controlled
 

517
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,269
you are still unconsciously controlled
by that concentric ego tripartite

518
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:40,279
by that concentric ego tripartite
 

519
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,670
by that concentric ego tripartite
grouping okay

520
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:43,680
grouping okay
 

521
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,990
grouping okay
um

522
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,000
um
 

523
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,629
um
so it's not uncommon as I saw for

524
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:47,639
so it's not uncommon as I saw for
 

525
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,790
so it's not uncommon as I saw for
example

526
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
example
 

527
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,250
example
a a video where you unders where that

528
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:52,260
a a video where you unders where that
 

529
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,410
a a video where you unders where that
was understood

530
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:54,420
was understood
 

531
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,290
was understood
not in this way but understood enough

532
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:57,300
not in this way but understood enough
 

533
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,290
not in this way but understood enough
that if I hit something that he will

534
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:00,300
that if I hit something that he will
 

535
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,790
that if I hit something that he will
tense up

536
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:01,800
tense up
 

537
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,990
tense up
okay

538
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,000
okay
 

539
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,710
okay
so I'm going to I'll I'll hit and it

540
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
so I'm going to I'll I'll hit and it
 

541
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,970
so I'm going to I'll I'll hit and it
makes his arm tense okay most people not

542
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:10,980
makes his arm tense okay most people not
 

543
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,030
makes his arm tense okay most people not
trained people most people boom I hit

544
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,040
trained people most people boom I hit
 

545
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,610
trained people most people boom I hit
his arm there'll be attention boom and

546
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:16,620
his arm there'll be attention boom and
 

547
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,569
his arm there'll be attention boom and
then you can do a sumitosh variation but

548
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:20,579
then you can do a sumitosh variation but
 

549
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:24,110
then you can do a sumitosh variation but
do you understand okay so it's got to be

550
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,120
do you understand okay so it's got to be
 

551
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,970
do you understand okay so it's got to be
a two beat

552
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:25,980
a two beat
 

553
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,790
a two beat
right if I just go here I kind of maybe

554
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
right if I just go here I kind of maybe
 

555
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,949
right if I just go here I kind of maybe
I got it because he's holding it himself

556
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
I got it because he's holding it himself
 

557
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,710
I got it because he's holding it himself
if you want you can relax and I'll lose

558
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:33,720
if you want you can relax and I'll lose
 

559
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,129
if you want you can relax and I'll lose
it okay but I hit boom and then you can

560
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:37,139
it okay but I hit boom and then you can
 

561
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,069
it okay but I hit boom and then you can
get it to go do you understand okay so

562
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
get it to go do you understand okay so
 

563
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,069
get it to go do you understand okay so
your goal of hitting is not to knock it

564
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:43,079
your goal of hitting is not to knock it
 

565
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,710
your goal of hitting is not to knock it
down your goal of hitting is just to

566
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:45,720
down your goal of hitting is just to
 

567
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,829
down your goal of hitting is just to
spark that tension in his body and then

568
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:48,839
spark that tension in his body and then
 

569
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,430
spark that tension in his body and then
use that tension to utilize this ledge

570
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:52,440
use that tension to utilize this ledge
 

571
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,710
use that tension to utilize this ledge
here do you understand

572
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
here do you understand
 

573
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,810
here do you understand
for you to push

574
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:56,820
for you to push
 

575
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,550
for you to push
okay try it

576
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
okay try it
 

577
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,449
okay try it
answer questions okay

578
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:02,459

 

579
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,030

so I saw that I was able to take his

580
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
so I saw that I was able to take his
 

581
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,550
so I saw that I was able to take his
balance right to shikaku and just

582
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:07,560
balance right to shikaku and just
 

583
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,470
balance right to shikaku and just
dipping the elbow out and you're gonna

584
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:09,480
dipping the elbow out and you're gonna
 

585
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,690
dipping the elbow out and you're gonna
get his balance in sumitosh right corner

586
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:11,700
get his balance in sumitosh right corner
 

587
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,290
get his balance in sumitosh right corner
drops okay now let's understanding the

588
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:15,300
drops okay now let's understanding the
 

589
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,389
drops okay now let's understanding the
concentric grouping

590
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:17,399
concentric grouping
 

591
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,269
concentric grouping
what allowed that to mechanically

592
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:20,279
what allowed that to mechanically
 

593
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,470
what allowed that to mechanically
function

594
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:21,480
function
 

595
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,730
function
you guys tell

596
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:28,740

 

597
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,590

you got to go deeper because it's a

598
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:30,600
you got to go deeper because it's a
 

599
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,810
you got to go deeper because it's a
concentric group

600
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:32,820
concentric group
 

601
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,750
concentric group
what allowed that to happen you see

602
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
what allowed that to happen you see
 

603
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,090
what allowed that to happen you see
the rising simultaneously with it

604
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,100
the rising simultaneously with it
 

605
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,150
the rising simultaneously with it
becoming a leverage point

606
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,160
becoming a leverage point
 

607
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,730
becoming a leverage point
okay

608
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:43,740

 

609
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,069

in other words it's not a leverage Point

610
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,079
in other words it's not a leverage Point
 

611
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,410
in other words it's not a leverage Point
If It Moves In Space

612
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:48,420
If It Moves In Space
 

613
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,329
If It Moves In Space
do you understand so something kept it

614
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:50,339
do you understand so something kept it
 

615
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,509
do you understand so something kept it
in space

616
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:52,519
in space
 

617
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,530
in space
simultaneously with it becoming a

618
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:54,540
simultaneously with it becoming a
 

619
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,550
simultaneously with it becoming a
leverage point what else happened

620
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:57,560
leverage point what else happened
 

621
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,290
leverage point what else happened
yeah the tension in his body and

622
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:00,300
yeah the tension in his body and
 

623
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,389
yeah the tension in his body and
simultaneously with the tension in his

624
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
simultaneously with the tension in his
 

625
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,670
simultaneously with the tension in his
body the fear the fear do you see that

626
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:04,680
body the fear the fear do you see that
 

627
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,569
body the fear the fear do you see that
and simultaneously with the fear

628
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:08,579

 

629
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,090

okay he's on that behavioral pattern of

630
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:11,100
okay he's on that behavioral pattern of
 

631
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,490
okay he's on that behavioral pattern of
avoidance and desire right he was

632
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:13,500
avoidance and desire right he was
 

633
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,550
avoidance and desire right he was
Desiring to not go down that made him

634
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
Desiring to not go down that made him
 

635
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,730
Desiring to not go down that made him
push back on it okay uh he's attracted

636
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:19,740
push back on it okay uh he's attracted
 

637
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,210
push back on it okay uh he's attracted
to uh uh so he's attracted to not going

638
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:23,220
to uh uh so he's attracted to not going
 

639
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,550
to uh uh so he's attracted to not going
down and he's trying to avoid going down

640
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:25,560
down and he's trying to avoid going down
 

641
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,650
down and he's trying to avoid going down
and it brought tension into his body

642
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:27,660
and it brought tension into his body
 

643
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,710
and it brought tension into his body
okay and then what else is also

644
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
okay and then what else is also
 

645
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,050
okay and then what else is also
simultaneously happening once you have

646
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:33,060
simultaneously happening once you have
 

647
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,810
simultaneously happening once you have
all those things as an aggregate as a

648
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:35,820
all those things as an aggregate as a
 

649
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,670
all those things as an aggregate as a
combination of things

650
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
combination of things
 

651
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,790
combination of things
how do I describe that

652
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:39,800
how do I describe that
 

653
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,310
how do I describe that
the ego tripartite mind is functioning

654
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:43,320
the ego tripartite mind is functioning
 

655
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,329
the ego tripartite mind is functioning
fully okay uh if you look and again as I

656
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:47,339
fully okay uh if you look and again as I
 

657
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,810
fully okay uh if you look and again as I
said it's untrained people who do that

658
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:50,820
said it's untrained people who do that
 

659
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,689
said it's untrained people who do that
okay that's a fear response that's an

660
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:53,699
okay that's a fear response that's an
 

661
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,750
okay that's a fear response that's an
untrained body mind okay our our

662
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:56,760
untrained body mind okay our our
 

663
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,230
untrained body mind okay our our
reduction to the ego tripartite mind is

664
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,240
reduction to the ego tripartite mind is
 

665
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,750
reduction to the ego tripartite mind is
an untrained person that's what it means

666
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:02,760
an untrained person that's what it means
 

667
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,269
an untrained person that's what it means
by definition okay it doesn't have

668
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
by definition okay it doesn't have
 

669
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,670
by definition okay it doesn't have
anything to do with your right or how

670
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
anything to do with your right or how
 

671
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,530
anything to do with your right or how
many techniques you study or how much

672
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:09,540
many techniques you study or how much
 

673
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,009
many techniques you study or how much
you go you're currently untrained

674
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:13,019
you go you're currently untrained
 

675
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,689
you go you're currently untrained
got it okay uh because you if you take

676
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:17,699
got it okay uh because you if you take
 

677
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:20,509
got it okay uh because you if you take
away

678
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:20,519

 

679
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,750

even one segment of that aggregate it

680
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:23,760
even one segment of that aggregate it
 

681
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,370
even one segment of that aggregate it
all goes away

682
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:25,380
all goes away
 

683
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,009
all goes away
because it's concentric it all goes away

684
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:28,019
because it's concentric it all goes away
 

685
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,670
because it's concentric it all goes away
okay so if you look at it and he goes to

686
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
okay so if you look at it and he goes to
 

687
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,650
okay so if you look at it and he goes to
hit it

688
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:36,660

 

689
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,009

it's The Three Stooges

690
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:40,019
it's The Three Stooges
 

691
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,769
it's The Three Stooges
do you understand it's my it's my

692
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:42,779
do you understand it's my it's my
 

693
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:46,490
do you understand it's my it's my
reaction that I give it just enough that

694
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:46,500
reaction that I give it just enough that
 

695
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,129
reaction that I give it just enough that
he can start leveraging them it's the

696
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:49,139
he can start leveraging them it's the
 

697
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,689
he can start leveraging them it's the
same thing when he goes to push the

698
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:50,699
same thing when he goes to push the
 

699
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:53,030
same thing when he goes to push the
shoulder a little cross push he goes to

700
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
shoulder a little cross push he goes to
 

701
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,090
shoulder a little cross push he goes to
push the shoulder I step backward if you

702
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,100
push the shoulder I step backward if you
 

703
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,210
push the shoulder I step backward if you
paid attention there was a moment I got

704
00:16:59,210 --> 00:16:59,220
paid attention there was a moment I got
 

705
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,269

heal waited you see and that had to

706
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:02,279
heal waited you see and that had to
 

707
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,230
heal waited you see and that had to
impact on my line of gravity

708
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:05,240
impact on my line of gravity
 

709
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,530
impact on my line of gravity
why did I do that because I have tensed

710
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:09,540
why did I do that because I have tensed
 

711
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,270
why did I do that because I have tensed
up and resisted

712
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,280
up and resisted
 

713
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,909
up and resisted
If he if I don't resist and I let him

714
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
If he if I don't resist and I let him
 

715
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,110
If he if I don't resist and I let him
push me

716
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
push me
 

717
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,510
push me
it just triggers the other movement you

718
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
it just triggers the other movement you
 

719
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,750
it just triggers the other movement you
see you guys see that okay this is one

720
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:20,760
see you guys see that okay this is one
 

721
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,390
see you guys see that okay this is one
reason why

722
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:23,400
reason why
 

723
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,710
reason why
from Campo to my Aikido you always work

724
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:27,720
from Campo to my Aikido you always work
 

725
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,049
from Campo to my Aikido you always work
with the angle cancellation

726
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:30,059
with the angle cancellation
 

727
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:35,150
with the angle cancellation
so you would not hit down because you're

728
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,160
so you would not hit down because you're
 

729
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,409
so you would not hit down because you're
not checking Heights do you understand

730
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:38,419
not checking Heights do you understand
 

731
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:41,390
not checking Heights do you understand
and the same thing you would not so you

732
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:41,400
and the same thing you would not so you
 

733
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,070
and the same thing you would not so you
would not hit in one dimension because

734
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,080
would not hit in one dimension because
 

735
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,289
would not hit in one dimension because
you don't check the other aspect of that

736
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:45,299
you don't check the other aspect of that
 

737
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,049
you don't check the other aspect of that
Dimension and then same thing here he's

738
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:48,059
Dimension and then same thing here he's
 

739
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,570
Dimension and then same thing here he's
going horizontal you don't check the

740
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:50,580
going horizontal you don't check the
 

741
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,430
going horizontal you don't check the
other side of that Dimension which would

742
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:52,440
other side of that Dimension which would
 

743
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,330
other side of that Dimension which would
be my cross lateral side okay so

744
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:56,340
be my cross lateral side okay so
 

745
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,750
be my cross lateral side okay so
um when you go for example we're here

746
00:17:59,750 --> 00:17:59,760
um when you go for example we're here
 

747
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,330
um when you go for example we're here
and I go I go to here do you understand

748
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:05,340

 

749
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,870

I have to understand one there's that

750
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
I have to understand one there's that
 

751
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,850
I have to understand one there's that
high and I'm not going to let that arm

752
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:10,860
high and I'm not going to let that arm
 

753
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,130
high and I'm not going to let that arm
Escape so that it goes down and around

754
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:13,140
Escape so that it goes down and around
 

755
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,010
Escape so that it goes down and around
and hits me back so I have a check here

756
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,020
and hits me back so I have a check here
 

757
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,570
and hits me back so I have a check here
right and my cut has that little jerk

758
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:20,580
right and my cut has that little jerk
 

759
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,710
right and my cut has that little jerk
you see when I take his height it's boom

760
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720
you see when I take his height it's boom
 

761
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,770
you see when I take his height it's boom
simultaneously out so I get that cross

762
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:27,780
simultaneously out so I get that cross
 

763
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,090
simultaneously out so I get that cross
battle aside and then here is where you

764
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:31,100
battle aside and then here is where you
 

765
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,890
battle aside and then here is where you
would do your attack you get do you

766
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:33,900
would do your attack you get do you
 

767
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,330
would do your attack you get do you
understand that everyone makes sense

768
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:35,340
understand that everyone makes sense
 

769
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,630
understand that everyone makes sense
okay uh if we bring that angle

770
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
okay uh if we bring that angle
 

771
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,370
okay uh if we bring that angle
cancellation that's what we call it

772
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,380
cancellation that's what we call it
 

773
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,110
cancellation that's what we call it
where you're cutting diagonals through

774
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,120
where you're cutting diagonals through
 

775
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,330
where you're cutting diagonals through
height width and depth we bring that

776
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:44,340
height width and depth we bring that
 

777
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,370
height width and depth we bring that
into every single Technique we do here

778
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:46,380
into every single Technique we do here
 

779
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,150
into every single Technique we do here
so you look for it every time okay

780
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
so you look for it every time okay
 

781
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,630
so you look for it every time okay
all right

782
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:53,640

 

783
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,890

there are other ways without it being a

784
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:57,900
there are other ways without it being a
 

785
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,669
there are other ways without it being a
matter of a fear generated response that

786
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:01,679
matter of a fear generated response that
 

787
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,210
matter of a fear generated response that
you can have this work as a leverage

788
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:05,220
you can have this work as a leverage
 

789
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,650
you can have this work as a leverage
point

790
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:06,660
point
 

791
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,909
point
okay

792
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
okay
 

793
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,710
okay
the first way is he's actually lifting

794
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
the first way is he's actually lifting
 

795
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,390
the first way is he's actually lifting
up his arm

796
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400
up his arm
 

797
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,230
up his arm
so you have your knife

798
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:21,240

 

799
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,529

right so you can do a step two his arm

800
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:24,539
right so you can do a step two his arm
 

801
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,810
right so you can do a step two his arm
is lifting the elbow's lifting do you

802
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:26,820
is lifting the elbow's lifting do you
 

803
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,730
is lifting the elbow's lifting do you
see that

804
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:28,740
see that
 

805
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,190
see that
so as it's lifting

806
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
so as it's lifting
 

807
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,850
so as it's lifting
in his intention to lift the knife it

808
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:34,860
in his intention to lift the knife it
 

809
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,070
in his intention to lift the knife it
creates The Leverage there and we want

810
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,080
creates The Leverage there and we want
 

811
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,350
creates The Leverage there and we want
to understand okay

812
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
to understand okay
 

813
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,390
to understand okay
uh another way is that youth rotation to

814
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,400
uh another way is that youth rotation to
 

815
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,950
uh another way is that youth rotation to
generate

816
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:45,960
generate
 

817
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,590
generate
that positional Integrity that you could

818
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:48,600
that positional Integrity that you could
 

819
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,570
that positional Integrity that you could
use okay so uh the first one as he's

820
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:53,580
use okay so uh the first one as he's
 

821
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,770
use okay so uh the first one as he's
coming up

822
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:54,780
coming up
 

823
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,230
coming up
you're going to take it out so let me

824
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,240
you're going to take it out so let me
 

825
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,110
you're going to take it out so let me
show you I'm not hitting it first I'm

826
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,120
show you I'm not hitting it first I'm
 

827
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,630
show you I'm not hitting it first I'm
not going boom and then out

828
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:02,640
not going boom and then out
 

829
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,970
not going boom and then out
as it's coming in

830
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:04,980
as it's coming in
 

831
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,669
as it's coming in
I'm kicking it out

832
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
I'm kicking it out
 

833
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,289
I'm kicking it out
got it in and mix admit I miss its

834
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:12,299
got it in and mix admit I miss its
 

835
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,450
got it in and mix admit I miss its
intention to come up and stick it

836
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:14,460
intention to come up and stick it
 

837
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,010
intention to come up and stick it
so it's in who

838
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,020

 

839
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,430

then the other one is the inertia so

840
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:22,440
then the other one is the inertia so
 

841
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,789
then the other one is the inertia so
he's going that way do you see

842
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:25,799
he's going that way do you see
 

843
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,549
he's going that way do you see
I keep on going that way and as I turn

844
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:28,559
I keep on going that way and as I turn
 

845
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,669
I keep on going that way and as I turn
it and now I'm doing the same thing

846
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
it and now I'm doing the same thing
 

847
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,950
it and now I'm doing the same thing
it's going forward and out on the

848
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:33,960
it's going forward and out on the
 

849
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,370
it's going forward and out on the
rotation therefore as I go rearwarded in

850
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:37,380
rotation therefore as I go rearwarded in
 

851
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,270
rotation therefore as I go rearwarded in
it has positional Integrity to my Ed me

852
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280
it has positional Integrity to my Ed me
 

853
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,789
it has positional Integrity to my Ed me
okay everyone with me so I'll do it one

854
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:43,799
okay everyone with me so I'll do it one
 

855
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:47,029
okay everyone with me so I'll do it one
more time boom

856
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
more time boom
 

857
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,409
more time boom
on the other one this way move

858
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:51,419
on the other one this way move
 

859
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,690
on the other one this way move
okay and I want you to feel

860
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:53,700
okay and I want you to feel
 

861
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,270
okay and I want you to feel
oh it doesn't have anything to do with

862
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:56,280
oh it doesn't have anything to do with
 

863
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,610
oh it doesn't have anything to do with

inability to free himself from his ego
 

867
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,430
inability to free himself from his ego
tripartite line okay we're operating one

868
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:04,440
tripartite line okay we're operating one
 

869
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,090
tripartite line okay we're operating one
at the level and tension and two we're

870
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,100
at the level and tension and two we're
 

871
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,810
at the level and tension and two we're
using rotational inertia to give the L

872
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:11,820
using rotational inertia to give the L
 

873

positional Integrity for projection we

874
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,640
positional Integrity for projection we
 

875
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,850
positional Integrity for projection we
are increasing the Yong aspect that's

876
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:16,860
are increasing the Yong aspect that's
 

877
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,650
are increasing the Yong aspect that's
what we're doing that's what I mean by

878
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:18,660
what we're doing that's what I mean by
 

879
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,810
what we're doing that's what I mean by
positional Integrity so that I can use

880
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:20,820
positional Integrity so that I can use
 

881
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,690
positional Integrity so that I can use
it to throw okay try it so let's go back

there's there's two ways of doing this

886
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:29,580
there's there's two ways of doing this
 

887
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,010
there's there's two ways of doing this
with two different Force engines okay

888
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:33,020
with two different Force engines okay
 

889
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,070
with two different Force engines okay
uh there's the first one where you hit

890
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,080
uh there's the first one where you hit
 

891
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,610

you wait for a reaction and then you've
increased the young so you have

894
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:42,840
increased the young so you have
 

895
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,870
increased the young so you have

um
why did it work because the fear

934
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:41,640
why did it work because the fear

external ledge that could be overpowered
 

945
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,870
external ledge that could be overpowered
and then take my Center that's what

946
00:22:59,870 --> 00:22:59,880
and then take my Center that's what
 

947
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,289
and then take my Center that's what
happened I did that externally okay

948
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:03,299
happened I did that externally okay
 

949
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,110
happened I did that externally okay
but what I said was there's young

950
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,120
but what I said was there's young
 

951
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,690

aspects already here

952
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:08,700
aspects already here
 

953
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,010
aspects already here
okay

954
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,020
okay
 

955
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,430
okay
and you can you just have to match it

956
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
and you can you just have to match it
 

957
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,169
and you can you just have to match it
that's all you have to do so you can

958
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:15,179
that's all you have to do so you can
 

959
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,570
that's all you have to do so you can
make your elbow loose your shoulder

960
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:17,580
make your elbow loose your shoulder
 

961
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,570
make your elbow loose your shoulder
loose if I overpower it that's how you

962
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:20,580
loose if I overpower it that's how you
 

963
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,029
loose if I overpower it that's how you
get that other stuff but if you don't

964
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:23,039
get that other stuff but if you don't
 

965
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,090
get that other stuff but if you don't
overpower it you can move him

966
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:29,100

 

967
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,970

so you won't loosen your arm just loosen

968
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:31,980
so you won't loosen your arm just loosen
 

969
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,190
so you won't loosen your arm just loosen
it and get out of it

970
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:34,200
it and get out of it
 

971
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,570
it and get out of it
but I keep it

972
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:38,580

 

973
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,730

you feel the friction go every time you

974
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:40,740
you feel the friction go every time you
 

975
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,730
you feel the friction go every time you
move I have to change it do you see that

976
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:43,740
move I have to change it do you see that
 

977
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,490
move I have to change it do you see that
because the tension goes somewhere else

978
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:46,500
because the tension goes somewhere else
 

979
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,669
because the tension goes somewhere else
I cannot overpower the young as in that

980
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:49,679
I cannot overpower the young as in that

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,830
I cannot overpower the young as in that
first engine otherwise you have to

00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
first engine otherwise you have to
 

983
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,450
first engine otherwise you have to
resort to those

984
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:53,460
resort to those

kind of matched that and you still will

1026
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:49,980
kind of matched that and you still will
 

1027
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,610
kind of matched that and you still will
get the effect on the center

1163
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,970

so in all of your Aikido it's not he

1164
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:16,980
so in all of your Aikido it's not he
 

1165
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,430
so in all of your Aikido it's not he
comes in and you do that

1166
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:19,440
comes in and you do that
 

1167
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,190
comes in and you do that
so the first let's go back

1168
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:22,200
so the first let's go back
 

1169
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,710
so the first let's go back
the first one keeps his hand coming in

1170
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
the first one keeps his hand coming in
 

1171
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,049
the first one keeps his hand coming in
and now he's pushed he's pushing on that

1172
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:27,059
and now he's pushed he's pushing on that
 

1173
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,570
and now he's pushed he's pushing on that
hat

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,230

I'm not gonna go here

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,240

 

1177
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,409

I let him push

1178
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:36,419
I let him push
 

1179
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,169
I let him push
so try to watch the path of my hand of

1180
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:39,179
so try to watch the path of my hand of
 

1181

do you understand
 

1213
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,690
do you understand
that that's not a good knife technique

1214
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:35,700
that that's not a good knife technique
 

1215
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,730
that that's not a good knife technique

00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:41,700
and do that kind of stuff you've got it
 

1221
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,210
and do that kind of stuff you've got it
okay same thing about this technique is

1222
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:44,220
okay same thing about this technique is
 

1223
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,630
okay same thing about this technique is
he's coming around the only reason

1224
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:47,640
he's coming around the only reason
 

1225
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,289
he's coming around the only reason
that you would go back to the inside is

1226
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:51,299
that you would go back to the inside is
 

1227
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,630
that you would go back to the inside is
because he passed he's passing the knife

1228
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:53,640
because he passed he's passing the knife
 

1229
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,669
because he passed he's passing the knife
he's coming around he's trying to take

1230
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679
he's coming around he's trying to take
 

1231
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:02,510
he's coming around he's trying to take
this one this one dude follow the energy

1233
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,950

you see

1234
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:03,960
you see
 

1235
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,830
you see
you get it

1236
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:06,840

 

1237
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,649

so you would feel that

1238
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:09,659
so you would feel that
 

1239
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,289
so you would feel that
rather than yawning here

1240
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:12,299
rather than yawning here
 

1241
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,590
rather than yawning here
you'd pass it boom you feel it boom you

1242
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:15,600
you'd pass it boom you feel it boom you
 

1243
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,230
you'd pass it boom you feel it boom you
let it go past you and then again you

1244
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
let it go past you and then again you
 

1245
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,769
let it go past you and then again you
would do boom

1246
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:21,779

 

1247
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,690

show you what

1248
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:23,700
show you what
 

1249
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,930
show you what
but energetically it brings up what was

1250
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:26,940
but energetically it brings up what was
 

1251
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,110
but energetically it brings up what was
happening on the head in 18 August

00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,210
happening on the head in 18 August
yesterday

1254

yesterday
 

1255
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,210
yesterday
how am I touching the head am I moving

1256
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:35,220
how am I touching the head am I moving
 

1257
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,950
how am I touching the head am I moving
the whole Center

1258
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:36,960
the whole Center
 

1259
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,710
the whole Center
here it's the elbow

1260
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:39,720
here it's the elbow
 

1261
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,029
here it's the elbow
do you understand

1262
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,039
do you understand
 

1263
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,909
do you understand
so I just feel the elbow I want to feel

1264
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:43,919
so I just feel the elbow I want to feel
 

1265
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,169
so I just feel the elbow I want to feel
that

1266
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:45,179
that
 

1267
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,669

you see

1268
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:46,679
you see
 

1269
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:53,690
you see
it did not let it go off

1270
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:53,700

 

1271
00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:01,510

feel it

1272
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:01,520

because they can be quick right you can

because they can be quick right you can
 

1279
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,710
because they can be quick right you can
do the same thing

1280
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:33,720
do the same thing
 

1281
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,389
do the same thing
same thing

same thing
 

1283
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,730
same thing
but I want you to feel the rotational

1284
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:37,740
but I want you to feel the rotational
 

1285
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,350
but I want you to feel the rotational
energy

1286
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360

1287
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,090

and lastly for a second if you paid

1288
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:41,100

00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,529

attention
 

1291
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:56,029

feel that

1292
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:56,039

 

1293
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,190

the hands are relevant whether it's a

00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:58,200
the hands are relevant whether it's a

00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:05,700

 

1301
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:11,630

so again as as I'm working the rotation

1302
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:11,640

 

1303
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,269

say that my feet have to be ground

00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:14,279
say that my feet have to be ground
 

1305
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:20,330
say that my feet have to be ground

1308
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:23,039
my external because you're almost you
 

1309
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,430
my external because you're almost you
have you have to over you have to over

1310
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,440
have you have to over you have to over
 

1311
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,310
have you have to over you have to over
yawn externally you have to that's why

1312
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,320
yawn externally you have to that's why
 

1313
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,310
yawn externally you have to that's why
the first solution was let me make his

1314
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:31,320
the first solution was let me make his
 

1315
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,810
the first solution was let me make his
yarn to young white at the 10th power do

1317
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,909
yarn to young white at the 10th power do
you know that's why you needed that you

1318
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:37,919
you know that's why you needed that you
 

1319
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,130
you know that's why you needed that you
can't deal with lower level energies

1320
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:40,140
can't deal with lower level energies
 

1321
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,870
can't deal with lower level energies
okay

1322
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:41,880
okay
 

1323
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,610
okay
um but you need to know how to deal with

1324
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:43,620
um but you need to know how to deal with
 

1325
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,009
um but you need to know how to deal with
lower lower level energy or lower level

1326
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:46,019
lower lower level energy or lower level
 

1327
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,470
lower lower level energy or lower level
young aspects because that's what people

1328
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,480
young aspects because that's what people
 

1329
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,789
young aspects because that's what people
counter with
