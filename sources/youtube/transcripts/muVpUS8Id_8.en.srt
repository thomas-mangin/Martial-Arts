1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,350

uh so he's she skis and you're coming

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:03,360
uh so he's she skis and you're coming
 

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:03,830
uh so he's she skis and you're coming
here

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,840
here
 

5
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,670
here
are you doing me you pass her

6
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
are you doing me you pass her
 

7
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,350
are you doing me you pass her
you see and now your choreography

8
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360
you see and now your choreography
 

9
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,310
you see and now your choreography
takes that step and then you shove them

10
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
takes that step and then you shove them
 

11
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,990
takes that step and then you shove them
straight forward

12
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000

 

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,029

again i pass the

14
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
again i pass the
 

15
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,670
again i pass the
i'm passing the rotation axis of the

16
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
i'm passing the rotation axis of the
 

17
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,189
i'm passing the rotation axis of the
technique

18
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
technique
 

19
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,310
technique
of the uke nage

20
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
of the uke nage
 

21
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,430
of the uke nage
dynamic okay i pass

22
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440
dynamic okay i pass
 

23
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,870
dynamic okay i pass
that axis of rotation

24
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:36,880
that axis of rotation
 

25
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,350
that axis of rotation
and then i just accelerate her i'm on

26
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
and then i just accelerate her i'm on
 

27
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,990
and then i just accelerate her i'm on
this side of the axis of rotation

28
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
this side of the axis of rotation
 

29
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,150
this side of the axis of rotation
and now i accelerate

30
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160

 

31
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,029

this does not work because it's just an

32
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
this does not work because it's just an
 

33
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,430
this does not work because it's just an
acceleration technique

34
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
acceleration technique
 

35
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,670
acceleration technique
and as you saw i pass it again

36
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
and as you saw i pass it again
 

37
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:04,310
and as you saw i pass it again
the athletic person just walks out

38
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320

 

39
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,950

that's not it so let's first find the

40
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:06,960
that's not it so let's first find the
 

41
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,630
that's not it so let's first find the
kazushi

42
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
kazushi
 

43
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,990
kazushi
let's look at the position okay

44
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000

 

45
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,270

the fight is going to rotate

46
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
the fight is going to rotate
 

47
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,149
the fight is going to rotate
here and i need this leg to come forward

48
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
here and i need this leg to come forward
 

49
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,990
here and i need this leg to come forward
this leg

50
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
this leg
 

51
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,710
this leg
try to find the access mundi of this

52
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
try to find the access mundi of this
 

53
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,429
try to find the access mundi of this
technique

54
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
technique
 

55
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,070
technique
it's already not back here it's already

56
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
it's already not back here it's already
 

57
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,510
it's already not back here it's already
it's already forward

58
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
it's already forward
 

59
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,710
it's already forward
okay she's gonna go forward

60
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
okay she's gonna go forward
 

61
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,710
okay she's gonna go forward
boom you see

62
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:38,720

 

63
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,670

that it's not here though it's not here

64
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
that it's not here though it's not here
 

65
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,749
that it's not here though it's not here
it's gonna keep going

66
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
it's gonna keep going
 

67
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,910
it's gonna keep going
you see you see it and now

68
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
you see you see it and now
 

69
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,030
you see you see it and now
their head goes this way and the hip

70
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
their head goes this way and the hip
 

71
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,310
their head goes this way and the hip
goes that way

72
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
goes that way
 

73
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:02,469
goes that way
okay there's no place for her foot to go

74
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479

 

75
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,389

look at it again

76
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399

 

77
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,749

she has to come forward but not directly

78
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
she has to come forward but not directly
 

79
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,910
she has to come forward but not directly
in front boom

80
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
in front boom
 

81
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,949
in front boom
then the energy boom

82
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959

 

83
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:30,790

she's going around she's gonna go around

84
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800

 

85
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,150

so i'm not just turning her and then

86
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
so i'm not just turning her and then
 

87
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,990
so i'm not just turning her and then
pushing her

88
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
pushing her
 

89
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:51,030
pushing her
i passed it it's working hard i don't

90
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
i passed it it's working hard i don't
 

91
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,949
i passed it it's working hard i don't
care about the technique now

92
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
care about the technique now
 

93
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:15,910
care about the technique now
just the poverty

94
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920

 

95
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,149

that's not the technique where i touch

96
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
that's not the technique where i touch
 

97
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,830
that's not the technique where i touch
that's the technique where the energy

98
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
that's the technique where the energy
 

99
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,390
that's the technique where the energy
goes

100
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
goes
 

101
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:30,789
goes
okay so i'm going to turn this

102
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799

 

103
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,550

head goes around me boom push

104
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
head goes around me boom push
 

105
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,830
head goes around me boom push
okay just learn the power get in the

106
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
okay just learn the power get in the
 

107
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,309
okay just learn the power get in the
place where the head can go around you

108
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
place where the head can go around you
 

109
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,750
place where the head can go around you
and you make the hip go

110
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760

 

111
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,789

12 30 12

112
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
12 30 12
 

113
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,070
12 30 12
1 area not where the head goes

114
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
1 area not where the head goes
 

115
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,190
1 area not where the head goes
okay try it the throws always

116
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
okay try it the throws always
 

117
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,990
okay try it the throws always
aikido throws the arms are redundant

118
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
aikido throws the arms are redundant
 

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,630
aikido throws the arms are redundant
stance is redundant to arms over down

120
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
stance is redundant to arms over down
 

121
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,949
stance is redundant to arms over down
which means one arm can do the throw by

122
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
which means one arm can do the throw by
 

123
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:01,830
which means one arm can do the throw by
itself

124
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
itself
 

125
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,390
itself
okay it's just not marginally valid to

126
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
okay it's just not marginally valid to
 

127
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,670
okay it's just not marginally valid to
not have redundancy

128
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
not have redundancy
 

129
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,110
not have redundancy
in your technique okay so let's look at

130
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
in your technique okay so let's look at
 

131
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,949
in your technique okay so let's look at
the arms doing that pattern i know i'm

132
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
the arms doing that pattern i know i'm
 

133
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,030
the arms doing that pattern i know i'm
just gonna grab her a collar this time

134
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
just gonna grab her a collar this time
 

135
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,589
just gonna grab her a collar this time
okay and i'm going to do one arm does

136
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
okay and i'm going to do one arm does
 

137
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,629
okay and i'm going to do one arm does
the pattern

138
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
the pattern
 

139
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,550
the pattern
just move yourself where the pattern is

140
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
just move yourself where the pattern is
 

141
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,909
just move yourself where the pattern is
going to be so

142
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
going to be so
 

143
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,509
going to be so
i'm going to make her come forward on

144
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
i'm going to make her come forward on
 

145
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,189
i'm going to make her come forward on
the other foot

146
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
the other foot
 

147
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:36,390
the other foot
and into the technique

148
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400

 

149
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,510

is moving forward hips forward

150
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
is moving forward hips forward
 

151
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,550
is moving forward hips forward
and around

152
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560

 

153
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,230

don't pull her back in so you go forward

154
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
don't pull her back in so you go forward
 

155
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,590
don't pull her back in so you go forward
you get back to balance

156
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600

 

157
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,070

the energy goes around

158
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080

 

159
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,670

so this forward energy is still going

160
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
so this forward energy is still going
 

161
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,629
so this forward energy is still going
forward

162
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
forward
 

163
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,710
forward
when i start to turn it do you see that

164
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
when i start to turn it do you see that
 

165
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,270
when i start to turn it do you see that
energy is still going forward

166
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280

 

167
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,830

just to make it work i have to get the

168
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
just to make it work i have to get the
 

169
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,870
just to make it work i have to get the
head below the hip

170
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
head below the hip
 

171
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,710
head below the hip
energy and then that creates a

172
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
energy and then that creates a
 

173
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,070
energy and then that creates a
topsy-turvy effect

174
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
topsy-turvy effect
 

175
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,909
topsy-turvy effect
so if i do the same thing here without

176
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
so if i do the same thing here without
 

177
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,550
so if i do the same thing here without
lowering it it doesn't do anything

178
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560

 

179
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,749

so i have to lower it at a rate where

180
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
so i have to lower it at a rate where
 

181
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,310
so i have to lower it at a rate where
the hip

182
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
the hip
 

183
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,990
the hip
energy the hip inertia is now traveling

184
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
energy the hip inertia is now traveling
 

185
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,629
energy the hip inertia is now traveling
and an x to the head and the head

186
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
and an x to the head and the head
 

187
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,270
and an x to the head and the head
inertia

188
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
inertia
 

189
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,590
inertia
going around me so

190
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600

 

191
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,189

and you'll get that same position

192
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
and you'll get that same position
 

193
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,029
and you'll get that same position
pattern okay so let's just

194
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
pattern okay so let's just
 

195
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,230
pattern okay so let's just
work on the arm portion

196
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
work on the arm portion
 

197
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,390
work on the arm portion
this part here but we're just going to

198
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
this part here but we're just going to
 

199
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,510
this part here but we're just going to
grab to do it

200
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
grab to do it
 

201
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,110
grab to do it
okay and you're going to start to

202
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
okay and you're going to start to
 

203
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,749
okay and you're going to start to
discover where do i have to be

204
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
discover where do i have to be
 

205
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,950
discover where do i have to be
for that to happen okay where do

206
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
for that to happen okay where do
 

207
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,670
for that to happen okay where do
i have to be in relationship to the

208
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
i have to be in relationship to the
 

209
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,390
i have to be in relationship to the
overall spiral between naga and nuclear

210
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
overall spiral between naga and nuclear
 

211
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,070
overall spiral between naga and nuclear
okay go

212
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
okay go
 

213
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,230
okay go
so if you watch this

214
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
so if you watch this
 

215
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,029
so if you watch this
is this the hand here this time oh

216
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
is this the hand here this time oh
 

217
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,350
is this the hand here this time oh
morning

218
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360

 

219
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,390

just working on that angle

220
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
just working on that angle
 

221
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,710
just working on that angle
if i'm too far forward i'm going to do

222
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
if i'm too far forward i'm going to do
 

223
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,909
if i'm too far forward i'm going to do
the same thing with my

224
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
the same thing with my
 

225
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,990
the same thing with my
arms the energy goes off too soon

226
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000

 

227
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:40,790

doesn't work too far forward

228
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800

 

229
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,469

you could exaggerate this and you could

230
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
you could exaggerate this and you could
 

231
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,150
you could exaggerate this and you could
see the back hair

232
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
see the back hair
 

233
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,510
see the back hair
it's not going to do anything it's not

234
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
it's not going to do anything it's not
 

235
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,510
it's not going to do anything it's not
going to do it okay

236
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
going to do it okay
 

237
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,990
going to do it okay
the technique the axis of rotation for

238
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
the technique the axis of rotation for
 

239
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,189
the technique the axis of rotation for
the whole technique

240
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
the whole technique
 

241
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,950
the whole technique
is not empty

242
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960

 

243
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,990

okay try it again all right and uh now

244
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
okay try it again all right and uh now
 

245
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,430
okay try it again all right and uh now
we'll do the front arm

246
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
we'll do the front arm
 

247
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,469
we'll do the front arm
okay so again if i

248
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
okay so again if i
 

249
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,950
okay so again if i
because it's a redundant system if i do

250
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
because it's a redundant system if i do
 

251
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,150
because it's a redundant system if i do
the front arm

252
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
the front arm
 

253
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,230
the front arm
and i'm in the box you're gonna run out

254
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
and i'm in the box you're gonna run out
 

255
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,270
and i'm in the box you're gonna run out
of steam

256
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
of steam
 

257
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,029
of steam
okay so the front arm has to do the same

258
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
okay so the front arm has to do the same
 

259
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:15,589
okay so the front arm has to do the same
thing

260
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
thing
 

261
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,230
thing
so it has to go this way

262
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240

 

263
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,029

okay

264
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039

 

265
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,909

can't go here that's just shoulder get

266
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
can't go here that's just shoulder get
 

267
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:35,830
can't go here that's just shoulder get
her hips moving

268
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840

 

269
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,830

so not this way she'll just run out run

270
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:42,840

 

271
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,469

out

272
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
out
 

273
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,749
out
this way

274
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759

 

275
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,469

okay okay now go slow enough that you

276
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
okay okay now go slow enough that you
 

277
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,230
okay okay now go slow enough that you
can catch

278
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
can catch
 

279
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,270
can catch
where you change the pattern okay so

280
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
where you change the pattern okay so
 

281
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,029
where you change the pattern okay so
she's doing ski to my face

282
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
she's doing ski to my face
 

283
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,350
she's doing ski to my face
not to my face through my face

284
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
not to my face through my face
 

285
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,150
not to my face through my face
right you go slow and do it and she's

286
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
right you go slow and do it and she's
 

287
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,790
right you go slow and do it and she's
going

288
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
going
 

289
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,550
going
and i'm doing the pattern

290
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560

 

291
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,629

you can see she's still falling on the

292
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
you can see she's still falling on the
 

293
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,469
you can see she's still falling on the
same geometry

294
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
same geometry
 

295
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:24,469
same geometry
in the same deconstruction of her face

296
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479

 

297
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,390

your arm goes dead that's why you come

298
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
your arm goes dead that's why you come
 

299
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,830
your arm goes dead that's why you come
in and get your leg

300
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
in and get your leg
 

301
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,230
in and get your leg
and you go put self protection or keep

302
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
and you go put self protection or keep
 

303
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,829
and you go put self protection or keep
your arm like you're going full speed

304
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:35,839

 

305
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:42,550

again you're very self-preserving

306
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560

 

307
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,910

okay try it again okay so yesterday

308
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
okay try it again okay so yesterday
 

309
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,750
okay try it again okay so yesterday
we had the guy question please get in

310
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
we had the guy question please get in
 

311
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,990
we had the guy question please get in
punching for me and we had the guys to

312
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
punching for me and we had the guys to
 

313
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,310
punching for me and we had the guys to
show

314
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
show
 

315
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,150
show
you uh that i'm not using their forward

316
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
you uh that i'm not using their forward
 

317
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,870
you uh that i'm not using their forward
progress

318
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
progress
 

319
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,509
progress
to do the technique okay so we had the

320
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
to do the technique okay so we had the
 

321
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,030
to do the technique okay so we had the
arm extended but they're

322
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
arm extended but they're
 

323
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,190
arm extended but they're
not going with me right remember that

324
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
not going with me right remember that
 

325
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,110
not going with me right remember that
they're bracing backwards

326
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
they're bracing backwards
 

327
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,910
they're bracing backwards
brace brace you got it they are doing

328
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
brace brace you got it they are doing
 

329
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,470
brace brace you got it they are doing
that

330
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
that
 

331
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,269
that
okay so she's bracing it doesn't matter

332
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
okay so she's bracing it doesn't matter
 

333
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,230
okay so she's bracing it doesn't matter
she's gonna go

334
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
she's gonna go
 

335
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,790
she's gonna go
you see i'm gonna show you another one

336
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
you see i'm gonna show you another one
 

337
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,110
you see i'm gonna show you another one
because now you think you need him to go

338
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
because now you think you need him to go
 

339
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,550
because now you think you need him to go
forward

340
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
forward
 

341
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,790
forward
she's not going forward i'm letting her

342
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
she's not going forward i'm letting her
 

343
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,990
she's not going forward i'm letting her
go forward

344
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
go forward
 

345
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,670
go forward
okay so uh she tries to go forward she

346
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
okay so uh she tries to go forward she
 

347
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,710
okay so uh she tries to go forward she
can't go forward

348
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
can't go forward
 

349
