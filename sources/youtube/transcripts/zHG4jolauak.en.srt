00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:02,240
simply
 

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,909
simply
you're in a situation where someone

4
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:03,919
you're in a situation where someone
 

5
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,389
you're in a situation where someone
wants to hurt you and they are better

6
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:06,399
wants to hurt you and they are better
 

7
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,710
wants to hurt you and they are better
than you there's more of them quite

8
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:08,720
than you there's more of them quite

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,950
than you there's more of them quite
possibly they're armed they're bigger

10
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
possibly they're armed they're bigger
 

11
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,549
possibly they're armed they're bigger
all the stuff they're they're better

00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
all the stuff they're they're better
 

13
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,910
all the stuff they're they're better
they're better at fighting than you

14
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
they're better at fighting than you
 

15
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,589
they're better at fighting than you
could be at fighting and so because

16
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,599
could be at fighting and so because
 

17
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,550
could be at fighting and so because
they're better at fighting than you

18
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:16,560
they're better at fighting than you
 

19
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,070
they're better at fighting than you
could be at fighting what are you going

00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080
could be at fighting what are you going
 

21
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,510
could be at fighting what are you going
to do

getting ready to go through a ton of
 

35
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,590
getting ready to go through a ton of
remodeling changes to help facilitate

36
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600
remodeling changes to help facilitate
 

37
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,270
remodeling changes to help facilitate
the new structure

38
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
the new structure
 

39
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,190
the new structure
through which i'm taking aikido so all

40
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
through which i'm taking aikido so all
 

41
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,110
through which i'm taking aikido so all
of this will change very soon and you

42
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
of this will change very soon and you
 

43
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,310
of this will change very soon and you
probably can't tell but we've already

got some painting done all kinds of
 

47
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,950
got some painting done all kinds of
things are going on so

48
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:46,960
things are going on so
 

49
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,950
things are going on so
um

what i'm trying to do is

52
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
what i'm trying to do is
 

53
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,630
what i'm trying to do is
understand aikido from the perspective

54
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
understand aikido from the perspective
 

55
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,029
understand aikido from the perspective
of someone who doesn't necessarily care

56
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,039
of someone who doesn't necessarily care
 

57
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,709
of someone who doesn't necessarily care
about aikido

58
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
about aikido
 

59
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,470
about aikido
my whole martial arts career my whole

60
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
my whole martial arts career my whole
 

61
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,549
my whole martial arts career my whole
aikido career up to this point has been

62
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
aikido career up to this point has been
 

63
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,910
aikido career up to this point has been
about understanding what aikido is from

64
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
about understanding what aikido is from
 

65
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,830
about understanding what aikido is from
the perspective of someone who knows the

66
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
the perspective of someone who knows the
 

67
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,910
the perspective of someone who knows the
system of aikido so i learned the system

68
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:09,920
system of aikido so i learned the system
 

69
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,670
system of aikido so i learned the system
of aikido a number of years ago and then

70
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680
of aikido a number of years ago and then
 

71
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,469
of aikido a number of years ago and then
i spent a long time trying to understand

72
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479
i spent a long time trying to understand
 

73
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,109
i spent a long time trying to understand
what that system was doing so how did

74
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
what that system was doing so how did
 

75
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,950
what that system was doing so how did
that system work

76
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
that system work
 

77
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,230
that system work
through this of course i discovered the

78
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
through this of course i discovered the
 

79
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,789
through this of course i discovered the
concept of context and i realized that

80
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
concept of context and i realized that
 

81
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,710
concept of context and i realized that
there was a context that aikido was

82
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
there was a context that aikido was
 

83
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,030
there was a context that aikido was
trying to answer and once i found what

84
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
trying to answer and once i found what
 

85
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,670
trying to answer and once i found what
the context was then all of a sudden all

86
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
the context was then all of a sudden all
 

87
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,510
the context was then all of a sudden all
the techniques in aikido just made sense

88
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
the techniques in aikido just made sense
 

89
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,350
the techniques in aikido just made sense
and and you could see them from a very

90
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
and and you could see them from a very
 

91
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,510
and and you could see them from a very
practical standpoint as to why they

92
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
practical standpoint as to why they
 

93
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,230
practical standpoint as to why they
exist and nothing seemed crazy or extra

94
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
exist and nothing seemed crazy or extra
 

95
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,590
exist and nothing seemed crazy or extra
and i've spent my career as a teacher

96
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
and i've spent my career as a teacher
 

97
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,389
and i've spent my career as a teacher
mostly trying to convey the system of

98
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
mostly trying to convey the system of
 

99
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,749
mostly trying to convey the system of
aikido and then at the same time convey

100
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
aikido and then at the same time convey
 

101
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,590
aikido and then at the same time convey
how the context works

102
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
how the context works
 

103
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,510
how the context works
however my approach

104
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
however my approach
 

105
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,550
however my approach
up to

106
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
up to
 

107
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,990
up to
this date is kind of clunky when you're

108
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
this date is kind of clunky when you're
 

109
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,749
this date is kind of clunky when you're
trying to understand it from the

110
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
trying to understand it from the
 

111
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,069
trying to understand it from the
perspective of someone who doesn't care

112
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
perspective of someone who doesn't care
 

113
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,109
perspective of someone who doesn't care
about aikido so if someone has no aikido

114
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
about aikido so if someone has no aikido
 

115
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,230
about aikido so if someone has no aikido
training

116
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
training
 

117
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,870
training
it's a clunky way to explain as i've

118
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
it's a clunky way to explain as i've
 

119
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,949
it's a clunky way to explain as i've
continued teaching i really would like

120
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
continued teaching i really would like
 

121
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,869
continued teaching i really would like
to be able to teach someone who doesn't

122
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
to be able to teach someone who doesn't
 

123
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,869
to be able to teach someone who doesn't
necessarily have any interest in aikido

124
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
necessarily have any interest in aikido
 

125
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,710
necessarily have any interest in aikido
but they're just interested in solving a

126
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
but they're just interested in solving a
 

127
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,710
but they're just interested in solving a
particular context and that context is

128
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
particular context and that context is
 

129
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,710
particular context and that context is
the same context that aikido has and the

130
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
the same context that aikido has and the
 

131
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,430
the same context that aikido has and the
context is simply you're in a situation

132
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
context is simply you're in a situation
 

133
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,510
context is simply you're in a situation
where someone wants to hurt you and they

134
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
where someone wants to hurt you and they
 

135
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,470
where someone wants to hurt you and they
are better than you there's more of them

136
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
are better than you there's more of them
 

137
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,470
are better than you there's more of them
quite possibly they're armed they're

138
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
quite possibly they're armed they're
 

139
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,150
quite possibly they're armed they're
bigger all the stuff they're they're

140
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
bigger all the stuff they're they're
 

141
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,670
bigger all the stuff they're they're
better they're better at fighting than

142
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
better they're better at fighting than
 

143
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,589
better they're better at fighting than
you could be at fighting and so because

144
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
you could be at fighting and so because
 

145
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,630
you could be at fighting and so because
they're better at fighting than you

146
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
they're better at fighting than you
 

147
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,150
they're better at fighting than you
could be at fighting what are you going

148
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
could be at fighting what are you going
 

149
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,270
could be at fighting what are you going
to do

150
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
to do
 

151
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,430
to do
now the answer of course is you're not

152
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
now the answer of course is you're not
 

153
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,030
now the answer of course is you're not
going to fight them but what are the

154
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
going to fight them but what are the
 

155
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,790
going to fight them but what are the
other options that are on the table for

156
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
other options that are on the table for
 

157
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,630
other options that are on the table for
you in a women's self-defense class the

158
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
you in a women's self-defense class the
 

159
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,150
you in a women's self-defense class the
people coming to me don't really care

160
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
people coming to me don't really care
 

161
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,670
people coming to me don't really care
about learning aikido they don't really

162
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
about learning aikido they don't really
 

163
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,990
about learning aikido they don't really
care about learning to wrestle or box or

164
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
care about learning to wrestle or box or
 

165
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,150
care about learning to wrestle or box or

205
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,350
say you know for every belt you can give
up about 10 pounds of physicality so

206
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
up about 10 pounds of physicality so
 

207
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,750
up about 10 pounds of physicality so
even a black belt really only has about

208
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
even a black belt really only has about
 

209
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,309
even a black belt really only has about
50 pounds of physical advantage in their

50 pounds of physical advantage in their
 

211
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,149
50 pounds of physical advantage in their
skill and so it's like if someone over

212
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
skill and so it's like if someone over
 

213
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,430
skill and so it's like if someone over
50 pounds is an athletic wants to fight

214
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
50 pounds is an athletic wants to fight
 

215
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,149
50 pounds is an athletic wants to fight
you

216
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
you
 

217
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,309
you
they're going to give you a really hard

218
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
they're going to give you a really hard
 

219
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,830
they're going to give you a really hard
situation right and that's not even

220
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
situation right and that's not even
 

221
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,670
situation right and that's not even
including contexts where you don't end

222
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
including contexts where you don't end
 

223
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,830
including contexts where you don't end
up on the ground right so

224
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
up on the ground right so
 

225
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,910
up on the ground right so
so you can't fight with someone who's

226
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
so you can't fight with someone who's
 

227
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,910
so you can't fight with someone who's
better at fighting than you and so

228
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
better at fighting than you and so
 

229
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,190
better at fighting than you and so
instead of

230
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
instead of
 

231
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,550
instead of
being aikido first my new and current

232
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
being aikido first my new and current
 

233
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,589
being aikido first my new and current
approach is to be context first and the

234
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
approach is to be context first and the
 

235
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,509
approach is to be context first and the
context is someone's better at fighting

236
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
context is someone's better at fighting
 

237
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,190
context is someone's better at fighting
than you can be at fighting what do you

238
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
than you can be at fighting what do you
 

239
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,110
than you can be at fighting what do you
do to physically deal with them when

240
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
do to physically deal with them when
 

241
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,270
do to physically deal with them when
they want to fight you well one we don't

242
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
they want to fight you well one we don't
 

243
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,630
they want to fight you well one we don't
get in a fight with them there's number

244
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
get in a fight with them there's number
 

245
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,710
get in a fight with them there's number
one right so what if that's off the

246
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
one right so what if that's off the
 

247
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,469
one right so what if that's off the
table well we keep our distance from

248
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
table well we keep our distance from
 

249
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,789
table well we keep our distance from
them as best we possibly can well what

250
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
them as best we possibly can well what
 

251
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,909
them as best we possibly can well what
if they can

252
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
if they can
 

253
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,069
if they can
bring the distance down well we try to

254
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
bring the distance down well we try to
 

255
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,830
bring the distance down well we try to
state angles where they can't hurt us

256
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
state angles where they can't hurt us
 

257
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,909
state angles where they can't hurt us
and suppress them in some way until we

258
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
and suppress them in some way until we
 

259
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,110
and suppress them in some way until we
can get away or help can arrive or

260
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
can get away or help can arrive or
 

261
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,189
can get away or help can arrive or
whatever right or we use a weapon right

262
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
whatever right or we use a weapon right
 

263
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,350
whatever right or we use a weapon right
so those are basically the answers that

264
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
so those are basically the answers that
 

265
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,590
so those are basically the answers that
you're going to use so

266
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
you're going to use so
 

267
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,270
you're going to use so
aikido has all those answers and it's

268
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
aikido has all those answers and it's
 

269
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,629
aikido has all those answers and it's
nicely outlined in aikido for aikido but

270
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
nicely outlined in aikido for aikido but
 

271
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,390
nicely outlined in aikido for aikido but
i think if you're a modern person

272
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
i think if you're a modern person
 

273
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,990
i think if you're a modern person
thinking about this it's a really clunky

274
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
thinking about this it's a really clunky
 

275
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,550
thinking about this it's a really clunky
way to kind of learn this so um i'm i'm

276
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
way to kind of learn this so um i'm i'm
 

277
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,390
way to kind of learn this so um i'm i'm
kind of teaching a a different way to

278
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
kind of teaching a a different way to
 

279
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,790
kind of teaching a a different way to
learn aikido now and and i would even be

280
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
learn aikido now and and i would even be
 

281
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,710
learn aikido now and and i would even be
hesitant to say it's aikido it's simply

282
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
hesitant to say it's aikido it's simply
 

283
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,469
hesitant to say it's aikido it's simply
my approach at this point that i'm

284
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
my approach at this point that i'm
 

285
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,030
my approach at this point that i'm
teaching my approach to the context

286
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
teaching my approach to the context
 

287
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,310
teaching my approach to the context
which you're going to get the same

288
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
which you're going to get the same
 

289
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,870
which you're going to get the same
answers as i could and i you know if if

290
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
answers as i could and i you know if if
 

291
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,629
answers as i could and i you know if if
i showed it and said hey this is chris

292
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
i showed it and said hey this is chris
 

293
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,390
i showed it and said hey this is chris
heinfuh or something and someone said

294
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
heinfuh or something and someone said
 

295
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,990
heinfuh or something and someone said
well it looks just like aikido i'd say

296
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
well it looks just like aikido i'd say
 

297
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,590
well it looks just like aikido i'd say
well of course it does because aikido

298
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
well of course it does because aikido
 

299
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,270
well of course it does because aikido
had all these answers and so there's

300
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
had all these answers and so there's
 

301
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,430
had all these answers and so there's
only so many answers to this context

302
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
only so many answers to this context
 

303
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,350
only so many answers to this context
however what's different is the way i'm

304
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
however what's different is the way i'm
 

305
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,670
however what's different is the way i'm
organizing it and and building it into a

306
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
organizing it and and building it into a
 

307
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,430
organizing it and and building it into a
context for people who don't already

308
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
context for people who don't already
 

309
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,469
context for people who don't already
know aikido or don't care about aikido

310
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
know aikido or don't care about aikido
 

311
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,510
know aikido or don't care about aikido
because a lot of people don't care about

312
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
because a lot of people don't care about
 

313
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,670
because a lot of people don't care about
aikido and so the context is still good

314
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
aikido and so the context is still good
 

315
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,199
aikido and so the context is still good
whether you care about ikea or not
