but if I go here so he that's why he's
 

493
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,330
but if I go here so he that's why he's
he's ready to push right he he can push

494
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:48,340
he's ready to push right he he can push
 

495
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,600
he's ready to push right he he can push
from where he's at right and as he has

496
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:51,610
from where he's at right and as he has
 

497
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,730
from where he's at right and as he has
the body released again where you're not

498
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:53,740
the body released again where you're not
 

499
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,070
the body released again where you're not
pushing but you had the body for pushing

500
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,080
pushing but you had the body for pushing
 

501
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,280
pushing but you had the body for pushing
right and I stay inside that that place

502
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,290
right and I stay inside that that place
 

503
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,010
right and I stay inside that that place
and just relax I'm gonna get him moving

504
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,020
and just relax I'm gonna get him moving
 

505
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:07,230
and just relax I'm gonna get him moving
in those subtle ways DC but

506
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:07,240

 

507
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,680

you have this disconnect and so you go

508
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:10,690
you have this disconnect and so you go
 

509
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,230
you have this disconnect and so you go
to push and we see you start to lean

510
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,240
to push and we see you start to lean
 

511
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,350
to push and we see you start to lean
okay say you're not ready you're not

512
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:16,360
okay say you're not ready you're not
 

513
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,230
okay say you're not ready you're not
ready to push so okay so the same thing

514
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:19,240
ready to push so okay so the same thing
 

515
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,020
ready to push so okay so the same thing
if I go if I go to push to you there's

516
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,030
if I go if I go to push to you there's
 

517
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,450
if I go if I go to push to you there's
there's a lag do you guys understand

518
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:24,460
there's a lag do you guys understand
 

519
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,120
there's a lag do you guys understand
that all right so it's not good training

520
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,130
that all right so it's not good training
 

521
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,919
that all right so it's not good training
for you for me it's joint training

522
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:28,929
for you for me it's joint training
 

523
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:30,870
for you for me it's joint training
because there are some people I don't

524
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
because there are some people I don't
 

525
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,270
because there are some people I don't
know they do do that all right so I

526
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280
know they do do that all right so I
 

527
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,669
know they do do that all right so I
still tasked myself with the same thing

528
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
still tasked myself with the same thing
 

529
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,130

going inside the fingers and the thumb

534
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:42,850
going inside the fingers and the thumb
 

535
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,780
going inside the fingers and the thumb
and she's gonna disconnect and so when

536
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:45,790
and she's gonna disconnect and so when
 

537
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,780
and she's gonna disconnect and so when
she just connects eventually she's gonna

538
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:48,790
she just connects eventually she's gonna
 

539
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,620

wait you have it Dixie and so when she
 

579
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,380
wait you have it Dixie and so when she
goes when she does start to tilt right

580
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:06,390
goes when she does start to tilt right
 

581
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,690
goes when she does start to tilt right
so I keep myself with my task that my

582

hey she's just she's disconnecting and

604
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:38,550
hey she's just she's disconnecting and
 

605
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,120
hey she's just she's disconnecting and
then you start finding it something

606
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,130
then you start finding it something
 

607
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,740

you're you're doing an obvious
biomechanical shift right

640
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:47,659
biomechanical shift right
 

641
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:50,049
biomechanical shift right
what I'm doing is exactly what you saw

642
