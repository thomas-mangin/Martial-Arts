now if you happen to have someone in
this position and you want to make the

130
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
this position and you want to make the
 

131
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,990
this position and you want to make the
takedown how does the takedown go

132
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
takedown how does the takedown go
 

133
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,230
takedown how does the takedown go
through now you should start with this

134
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
through now you should start with this
 

135
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,350
through now you should start with this
with the lead leg being on the outside

136
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
with the lead leg being on the outside
 

137
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,510
with the lead leg being on the outside
and the near leg the leg that's near him

138
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
and the near leg the leg that's near him
 

139
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,110
and the near leg the leg that's near him
being on the inside and the reason for

140
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
being on the inside and the reason for
 

141
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,589
being on the inside and the reason for
that is this makes it most difficult for

142
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
that is this makes it most difficult for
 

143
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,350
that is this makes it most difficult for
him to get a hold of my leg so if i had

144
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
him to get a hold of my leg so if i had
 

145
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,949
him to get a hold of my leg so if i had
his arm here decently if he goes to get

146
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
his arm here decently if he goes to get
 

147
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,470
his arm here decently if he goes to get
my legs you can see that leg's going to

148
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
my legs you can see that leg's going to
 

149
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,750
my legs you can see that leg's going to
cost him right he's going to fall down

150
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
cost him right he's going to fall down
 

151
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,589
cost him right he's going to fall down
for that leg if he reaches over for this

152
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
for that leg if he reaches over for this
 

153
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,190
for that leg if he reaches over for this
other leg it's real hard for him to get

154
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
other leg it's real hard for him to get
 

155
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,190
other leg it's real hard for him to get
and going to cost him okay however if i

156
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
and going to cost him okay however if i
 

157
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,030
and going to cost him okay however if i
have this leg forward he really easily

158
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
have this leg forward he really easily
 

159
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,390
have this leg forward he really easily
can sneak in and grab that leg and

160
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
can sneak in and grab that leg and
 

161
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,910
can sneak in and grab that leg and
that's going to give me trouble

162
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
that's going to give me trouble
 

163
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,470
that's going to give me trouble
so before i have this guy in a decent

164
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,480
so before i have this guy in a decent
 

165
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,390
so before i have this guy in a decent
control position i want to make sure my

166
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
control position i want to make sure my
 

167
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,030
control position i want to make sure my
near leg is back and my my outside leg

168
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
near leg is back and my my outside leg
 

169
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,670
near leg is back and my my outside leg
is the far forward leg okay now when i

170
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
is the far forward leg okay now when i
 

171
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,350
is the far forward leg okay now when i
want to get this guy down what am i

172
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
want to get this guy down what am i
 

173
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,509
want to get this guy down what am i
trying to do when he's like he is right

174
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
trying to do when he's like he is right
 

175
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,430
trying to do when he's like he is right
now so that other hand's not touching

176
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
now so that other hand's not touching
 

177
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,270
now so that other hand's not touching
that means he's balanced and can balance

178
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
that means he's balanced and can balance
 

179
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,509
that means he's balanced and can balance
on his feet i do not want to step in

180
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
on his feet i do not want to step in
 

181
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,990
on his feet i do not want to step in
until i take that balance away so i need

182
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
until i take that balance away so i need
 

183
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,150
until i take that balance away so i need
to in some way get him nudged forward to

184
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
to in some way get him nudged forward to
 

185
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,070
to in some way get him nudged forward to
do that now the second he touches he

186
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
do that now the second he touches he
 

187
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,869
do that now the second he touches he
needs three points to be balanced so in

188
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
needs three points to be balanced so in
 

189
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,949
needs three points to be balanced so in
this three point balance i can step

190
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
this three point balance i can step
 

191
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,470
this three point balance i can step
forward because if you were to grab my

192
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
forward because if you were to grab my
 

193
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,390
forward because if you were to grab my
leg here he's got no balance and he'll

194
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
leg here he's got no balance and he'll
 

195
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,790
leg here he's got no balance and he'll
fall down right so that's the time when

196
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
fall down right so that's the time when
 

197
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,949
fall down right so that's the time when
you can safely step in is once this hand

198
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
you can safely step in is once this hand
 

199
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,790
you can safely step in is once this hand
touches until that hand touches you

200
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
touches until that hand touches you
 

201
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,190
touches until that hand touches you
can't risk stepping in because most

202
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
can't risk stepping in because most
 

203
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,390
can't risk stepping in because most
likely he's going to he's going to be

204
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
likely he's going to he's going to be
 

205
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,470
likely he's going to he's going to be
able to get you now understand all this

206
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
able to get you now understand all this
 

207
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,070
able to get you now understand all this
is coming off of our aikido context i'm

208
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
is coming off of our aikido context i'm
 

209
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,270
is coming off of our aikido context i'm
not going to hit that in this video

210
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
not going to hit that in this video
 

211
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,790
not going to hit that in this video
right now because it'll take too long to

212
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
right now because it'll take too long to
 

213
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,030
right now because it'll take too long to
talk about but this came up because of

214
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
talk about but this came up because of
 

215
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,030
talk about but this came up because of
an inherent imbalance in whatever he was

216
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
an inherent imbalance in whatever he was
 

217
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,110
an inherent imbalance in whatever he was
doing and that's why this came up and

218
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
doing and that's why this came up and
 

219
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,750
doing and that's why this came up and
for some reason pinning him was a good

220
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
for some reason pinning him was a good
 

221
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,110
for some reason pinning him was a good
option and there's tons of reasons that

222
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
option and there's tons of reasons that
 

223
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,110
option and there's tons of reasons that
could be there's a situation i need to

224
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
could be there's a situation i need to
 

225
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,270
could be there's a situation i need to
control he's armed i need to save other

people all kinds of other stuff talk

228
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
people all kinds of other stuff talk
 

229
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,710
people all kinds of other stuff talk
about that in other videos but this is

230
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
about that in other videos but this is
 

231
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,869
about that in other videos but this is
coming off of the aikido context so i

232
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
coming off of the aikido context so i
 

233
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,430
coming off of the aikido context so i
want the outside leg forward near leg is

234
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
want the outside leg forward near leg is
 

235
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,070
want the outside leg forward near leg is
back until he touches once he touches i

236
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
back until he touches once he touches i
 

237
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,309
back until he touches once he touches i
can safely step in now this stepping in

238
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
can safely step in now this stepping in
 

239
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,910
can safely step in now this stepping in
is going to feel better to you because

240
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
is going to feel better to you because
 

241
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,670
is going to feel better to you because
now i have more weight over the top of

242
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
now i have more weight over the top of
 

243
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,110
now i have more weight over the top of
him so it's going to be easier for me to

244
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
him so it's going to be easier for me to
 

245
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,190
him so it's going to be easier for me to
control this guy now how do i get him

246
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
control this guy now how do i get him
 

247
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,830
control this guy now how do i get him
down if i'm lucky when i take my initial

248
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
down if i'm lucky when i take my initial
 

249
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,030
down if i'm lucky when i take my initial
step in

250
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
step in
 

251
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,710
step in
i will bump him off balance and he'll

252
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
i will bump him off balance and he'll
 

253
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,149
i will bump him off balance and he'll
pretty much get broken down at that

254
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
pretty much get broken down at that
 

255
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,429
pretty much get broken down at that
point right so that would be really

256
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
point right so that would be really
 

257
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,550
point right so that would be really
fantastic if my initial step is what hit

258
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
fantastic if my initial step is what hit
 

259
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,030
fantastic if my initial step is what hit
him so once he he touches there and i

260
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
him so once he he touches there and i
 

261
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,350
him so once he he touches there and i
step this leg in my goal is to try and

262
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
step this leg in my goal is to try and
 

263
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,190
step this leg in my goal is to try and
knock him straight back like that and if

264
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
knock him straight back like that and if
 

265
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,949
knock him straight back like that and if
i can break him down there then good and

266
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
i can break him down there then good and
 

267
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,069
i can break him down there then good and
i'll just work him the rest of the way

268
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
i'll just work him the rest of the way
 

269
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,909
i'll just work him the rest of the way
down i'll drop the inside leg here and

270
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
down i'll drop the inside leg here and
 

271
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,830
down i'll drop the inside leg here and
then i'll go into the pin from here

272
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840

 

273
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,310

if after i've got him to touch i step in

274
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
if after i've got him to touch i step in
 

275
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,310
if after i've got him to touch i step in
and he just adjusts by sticking his hand

276
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
and he just adjusts by sticking his hand
 

277
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,030
and he just adjusts by sticking his hand
out then i'm going to pull him this way

278
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
out then i'm going to pull him this way
 

279
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,590
out then i'm going to pull him this way
like this okay and he'll shoot his hand

280
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
like this okay and he'll shoot his hand
 

281
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,350
like this okay and he'll shoot his hand
i'll step in and and let me explain

282
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
i'll step in and and let me explain
 

283
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,710
i'll step in and and let me explain
what's going to go on this process all

284
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
what's going to go on this process all
 

285
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,230
what's going to go on this process all
right and josh is doing a lot of work

286
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
right and josh is doing a lot of work
 

287
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,790
right and josh is doing a lot of work
here he has to stay in this position so

288
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
here he has to stay in this position so
 

289
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,790
here he has to stay in this position so
once his hand touches

290
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
once his hand touches
 

291
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,150
once his hand touches
that's what's helping him balance over

292
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
that's what's helping him balance over
 

293
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,550
that's what's helping him balance over
there he's got nothing balancing over

294
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
there he's got nothing balancing over
 

295
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,830
there he's got nothing balancing over
here so if he's shot his hand out so far

296
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
here so if he's shot his hand out so far
 

297
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,350
here so if he's shot his hand out so far
that i didn't break his balance there

298
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
that i didn't break his balance there
 

299
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,590
that i didn't break his balance there
there's a possibility to pull him into

300
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
there's a possibility to pull him into
 

301
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,510
there's a possibility to pull him into
this gap here to break him down right

302
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
this gap here to break him down right
 

303
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,710
this gap here to break him down right
there and that's what i'd like to have

304
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
there and that's what i'd like to have
 

305
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,950
there and that's what i'd like to have
is have that little gap happen but he

306
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
is have that little gap happen but he
 

307
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,430
is have that little gap happen but he
can also shoot his hand out here to stop

308
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
can also shoot his hand out here to stop
 

309
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,510
can also shoot his hand out here to stop
that from happening but now he's not

310
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
that from happening but now he's not
 

311
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,350
that from happening but now he's not
balanced over there so i'll drive into

312
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
balanced over there so i'll drive into
 

313
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,749
balanced over there so i'll drive into
that right so what i'm trying to do when

314
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
that right so what i'm trying to do when
 

315
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,189
that right so what i'm trying to do when
i when i'm trying to get the take down

316
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
i when i'm trying to get the take down
 

317
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,909
i when i'm trying to get the take down
from here is move back and forth like

318
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
from here is move back and forth like
 

319
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,990
from here is move back and forth like
this so he only has one hand to balance

320
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
this so he only has one hand to balance

this elbow i'm already putting him into

346
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
this elbow i'm already putting him into
 

347
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,550
this elbow i'm already putting him into
a worse position so if i can stay on the

348
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
a worse position so if i can stay on the
 

349
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,909
a worse position so if i can stay on the
underside of the elbow it's going to be

350
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
underside of the elbow it's going to be
 

351
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,510
underside of the elbow it's going to be
a lot easier to control him for the

352
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
a lot easier to control him for the
 

353
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,830
a lot easier to control him for the
takedown than it is if i can't now he

354
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
takedown than it is if i can't now he
 

355
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,670
takedown than it is if i can't now he
might not like that so he very well

356
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
might not like that so he very well
 

357
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,670
might not like that so he very well
might straighten that elbow out and keep

358
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
might straighten that elbow out and keep
 

359
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,710
might straighten that elbow out and keep
me from doing that you're going to

one is nico we can get sankyo so we can
 

391
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,629
one is nico we can get sankyo so we can
go into a few different things here but

i can use the control at the wrist here

394
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
i can use the control at the wrist here
 

395
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,469

to try and get him to go where i want
 

397
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,550
to try and get him to go where i want
so ideally when i'm working this

398
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
so ideally when i'm working this
 

399
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,230
so ideally when i'm working this
breakdown here i would like to have this

400
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
breakdown here i would like to have this
 

401

elbow rolled but if i can't hold that
and he straightens it out i can drive

404
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
and he straightens it out i can drive
 

405
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,070
and he straightens it out i can drive
into the elbow itself i can drive into

406
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
into the elbow itself i can drive into
 

407
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,390
into the elbow itself i can drive into
the shoulder or i can control this hand

408
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
the shoulder or i can control this hand
 

409

the shoulder or i can control this hand
and go into the hand and i can use all

410
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
and go into the hand and i can use all
 

411
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,670
and go into the hand and i can use all
those things to help me start breaking

412
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
those things to help me start breaking
 

413
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,430
those things to help me start breaking
his balance because while that's going

414
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
his balance because while that's going
 

415
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,189
his balance because while that's going
on i'm going back and forth back and

416
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
on i'm going back and forth back and
 

417
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,550
on i'm going back and forth back and
forth back and forth trying to break his

418
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
forth back and forth trying to break his
 

419
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,749
forth back and forth trying to break his
balance down

420
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
balance down
 

421
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,029
balance down
let josh stand up here for a sec okay so

422
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
let josh stand up here for a sec okay so
 

423
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,749
let josh stand up here for a sec okay so
that's the objective i've driven into

424
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
that's the objective i've driven into
 

425
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,589
that's the objective i've driven into
him and i'm controlling his arm i want

426
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
him and i'm controlling his arm i want
 

427
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,990
him and i'm controlling his arm i want
to keep my near leg back until he's

428
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
to keep my near leg back until he's
 

429
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,150
to keep my near leg back until he's
touching once he touches i know that

430
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
touching once he touches i know that
 

431
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,230
touching once he touches i know that
he's not stable on just the two legs so

432
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
he's not stable on just the two legs so
 

433
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,230
he's not stable on just the two legs so
that means it's safe to step in when i

434
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
that means it's safe to step in when i
 

435
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,230
that means it's safe to step in when i
step in i want to step in dominantly and

436
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
step in i want to step in dominantly and
 

437
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,150
step in i want to step in dominantly and
ideally i'll just knock him down when i

438
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
ideally i'll just knock him down when i
 

439
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,909
ideally i'll just knock him down when i
do that if i don't do that i'm going to

440
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
do that if i don't do that i'm going to
 

441
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,309
do that if i don't do that i'm going to
immediately pull him back to this area

442
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
immediately pull him back to this area
 

443
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,309
immediately pull him back to this area
right here where he doesn't have a hand

444
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
right here where he doesn't have a hand
 

445
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,670
right here where he doesn't have a hand
so what he'll probably try to do is

446
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
so what he'll probably try to do is
 

447
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,710
so what he'll probably try to do is
shoot his hand over there to keep

448
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
shoot his hand over there to keep
 

449
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,629
shoot his hand over there to keep
himself from falling and then i'll drive

450
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
himself from falling and then i'll drive
 

451
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,990
himself from falling and then i'll drive
over here so basically what's happening

452
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
over here so basically what's happening
 

453
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,749
over here so basically what's happening
is i'm always pulling where his hand

454
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
is i'm always pulling where his hand
 

455
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,350
is i'm always pulling where his hand
isn't so if his hand was here i'm gonna

456
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
isn't so if his hand was here i'm gonna
 

457
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,710
isn't so if his hand was here i'm gonna
pull him this way when i pull him this

458
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
pull him this way when i pull him this
 

459
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,230
pull him this way when i pull him this
way he'll move his hand over here to

460
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
way he'll move his hand over here to
 

461
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,070
way he'll move his hand over here to
stop himself from falling that way then

462
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
stop himself from falling that way then
 

463
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,230
stop himself from falling that way then
i immediately push back here if he moves

464
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
i immediately push back here if he moves
 

465
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,909
i immediately push back here if he moves
his hand back here then i pull back so

466
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
his hand back here then i pull back so
 

467
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,189
his hand back here then i pull back so
back and forth i'm going back and forth

468
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
back and forth i'm going back and forth
 

469
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,390
back and forth i'm going back and forth
back and forth back and forth to break

470
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
back and forth back and forth to break
 

471
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,270
back and forth back and forth to break
him down

472
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
him down
 

473
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,189
him down
