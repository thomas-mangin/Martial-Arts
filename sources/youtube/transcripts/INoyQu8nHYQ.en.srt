00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,310

Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,320
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
 

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,590
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
going to talk a little bit about

4
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:03,600
going to talk a little bit about
 

5
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,230
going to talk a little bit about
adapting technique. I know I talk about

6
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,240
adapting technique. I know I talk about
 

7
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,470
adapting technique. I know I talk about
this a lot, but it's because I feel like

8
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
this a lot, but it's because I feel like
 

9
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,870
this a lot, but it's because I feel like
it's pivotal to understanding what's

10
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
it's pivotal to understanding what's
 

11
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,709
it's pivotal to understanding what's
going on in Iikido and yet most Iikido

12
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
going on in Iikido and yet most Iikido
 

13
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,430
going on in Iikido and yet most Iikido
schools never talk about adaptation of

14
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
schools never talk about adaptation of
 

15
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,230
schools never talk about adaptation of
techniques. Um, so that's that's it. I'm

16
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
techniques. Um, so that's that's it. I'm
 

17
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,950
techniques. Um, so that's that's it. I'm
gonna call Josh over here if you're

18
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960
gonna call Josh over here if you're
 

19
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,269
gonna call Josh over here if you're
ready to work.

20
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:24,279

 

21
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,870

Josh. All right. So, let's let's talk

22
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:26,880
Josh. All right. So, let's let's talk
 

23
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,870
Josh. All right. So, let's let's talk
about adapting technique. I have

24
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
about adapting technique. I have
 

25
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,790
about adapting technique. I have
probably you guys are probably like man

26
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
probably you guys are probably like man
 

27
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,549
probably you guys are probably like man
well we need another video on adapting

28
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
well we need another video on adapting
 

29
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,110
well we need another video on adapting
technique but I feel like when I started

30
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
technique but I feel like when I started
 

31
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,430
technique but I feel like when I started
realizing that techniques have to adapt

32
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
realizing that techniques have to adapt
 

33
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,549
realizing that techniques have to adapt
and like that's why I was doing

34
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:38,559
and like that's why I was doing
 

35
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,430
and like that's why I was doing
Brazilian jiu-jitsu when I was doing

36
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
Brazilian jiu-jitsu when I was doing
 

37
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,030
Brazilian jiu-jitsu when I was doing
Brazilian jitsu I understood I was like

38
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
Brazilian jitsu I understood I was like
 

39
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,750
Brazilian jitsu I understood I was like
oh yeah techniques have to adapt like

40
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:43,760
oh yeah techniques have to adapt like
 

41
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,350
oh yeah techniques have to adapt like
not just that I do something totally

42
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
not just that I do something totally
 

43
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,869
not just that I do something totally
different but that I adapt the technique

44
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
different but that I adapt the technique
 

45
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,229
different but that I adapt the technique
I'm doing and that's how I build a

46
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
I'm doing and that's how I build a
 

47
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,830
I'm doing and that's how I build a
really solid game. But when I started

48
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:49,840
really solid game. But when I started
 

49
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,510
really solid game. But when I started
realizing that for I kid I was like oh

50
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
realizing that for I kid I was like oh
 

51
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,430
realizing that for I kid I was like oh
man all the techniques really adapt

52
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
man all the techniques really adapt
 

53
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,189
man all the techniques really adapt
nicely like someone thought it out at

54
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
nicely like someone thought it out at
 

55
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,150
nicely like someone thought it out at
some point. Um and uh we need to have

56
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
some point. Um and uh we need to have
 

57
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,670
some point. Um and uh we need to have
all those techniques and the ways in

58
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
all those techniques and the ways in
 

59
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,069
all those techniques and the ways in
which those techniques adapt, right? So

60
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:02,079
which those techniques adapt, right? So
 

61
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,270
which those techniques adapt, right? So
let's look at something real real

62
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
let's look at something real real
 

63
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,549
let's look at something real real
simple. So actually let's let's look at

64
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
simple. So actually let's let's look at
 

65
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,310
simple. So actually let's let's look at
eekio and and I I've shown you the

66
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
eekio and and I I've shown you the
 

67
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,310
eekio and and I I've shown you the
urinote drill, I believe. So if you

68
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
urinote drill, I believe. So if you
 

69
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,469
urinote drill, I believe. So if you
haven't seen the uramote drill, um check

70
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
haven't seen the uramote drill, um check
 

71
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,789
haven't seen the uramote drill, um check
out that because it'll it'll talk a lot

72
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
out that because it'll it'll talk a lot
 

73
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,710
out that because it'll it'll talk a lot
about this. So the basic Udamote drill

74
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
about this. So the basic Udamote drill
 

75
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,190
about this. So the basic Udamote drill
is I come in to do eeky mote on Josh. If

76
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
is I come in to do eeky mote on Josh. If
 

77
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,390
is I come in to do eeky mote on Josh. If
he's easy to push, then I push him. If I

78
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
he's easy to push, then I push him. If I
 

79
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,870
he's easy to push, then I push him. If I
come in and I hit a roadblock, I go

80
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
come in and I hit a roadblock, I go
 

81
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,310
come in and I hit a roadblock, I go
urazo, right? I turn turn to the

82
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
urazo, right? I turn turn to the
 

83
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,270
urazo, right? I turn turn to the
backside. Okay? Okay. And you could do

84
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
backside. Okay? Okay. And you could do
 

85
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,789
backside. Okay? Okay. And you could do
that with edemia or sultamori. It

86
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
that with edemia or sultamori. It
 

87
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,910
that with edemia or sultamori. It
doesn't matter. Okay. So that is the

88
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
doesn't matter. Okay. So that is the
 

89
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,789
doesn't matter. Okay. So that is the
root of what's going on. I try one thing

90
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
root of what's going on. I try one thing
 

91
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,030
root of what's going on. I try one thing
and it doesn't work this way. So I just

92
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
and it doesn't work this way. So I just
 

93
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,270
and it doesn't work this way. So I just
immediately adapt to the next thing.

94
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
immediately adapt to the next thing.
 

95
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,230
immediately adapt to the next thing.
Right? And that's what you want to

96
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
Right? And that's what you want to
 

97
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,510
Right? And that's what you want to
always be able to do. And you want to be

98
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
always be able to do. And you want to be
 

99
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,510
always be able to do. And you want to be
able to do that on the drop of a dime.

100
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
able to do that on the drop of a dime.
 

101
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,350
able to do that on the drop of a dime.
The faster and more efficiently you can

102
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
The faster and more efficiently you can
 

103
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,870
The faster and more efficiently you can
adapt to the next technique when one's

104
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
adapt to the next technique when one's
 

105
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,630
adapt to the next technique when one's
not working, the more likely you are to

106
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
not working, the more likely you are to
 

107
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,950
not working, the more likely you are to
stay ahead of this guy. So understand if

108
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
stay ahead of this guy. So understand if
 

109
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,830
stay ahead of this guy. So understand if
I hit Josh, I'm already ahead, right?

110
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
I hit Josh, I'm already ahead, right?
 

111
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,149
I hit Josh, I'm already ahead, right?
I'm ahead. So, so whether he blocks, it

112
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
I'm ahead. So, so whether he blocks, it
 

113
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,830
I'm ahead. So, so whether he blocks, it
doesn't matter what he does, I'm ahead.

114
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
doesn't matter what he does, I'm ahead.
 

115
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,749
doesn't matter what he does, I'm ahead.
Even if he gets out of the way, I'm

116
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
Even if he gets out of the way, I'm
 

117
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,429
Even if he gets out of the way, I'm
still ahead because I'm dictating what

118
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
still ahead because I'm dictating what
 

119
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,310
still ahead because I'm dictating what
Josh does. So, I'm ahead of Josh in

120
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
Josh does. So, I'm ahead of Josh in
 

121
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,069
Josh does. So, I'm ahead of Josh in
time. Now, the more I can stay ahead of

122
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
time. Now, the more I can stay ahead of
 

123
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,070
time. Now, the more I can stay ahead of
Josh in time, the better it will turn

124
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
Josh in time, the better it will turn
 

125
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,990
Josh in time, the better it will turn
out for me. As I start to get behind

126
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
out for me. As I start to get behind
 

127
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,589
out for me. As I start to get behind
Josh in time, then Josh will be making

128
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
Josh in time, then Josh will be making
 

129
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,830
Josh in time, then Josh will be making
plans for me, and I'll be reactive to

130
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
plans for me, and I'll be reactive to
 

131
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,430
plans for me, and I'll be reactive to
Josh. And that means I always first have

132
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
Josh. And that means I always first have
 

133
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,270
Josh. And that means I always first have
to react to Josh, then I have to do

134
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
to react to Josh, then I have to do
 

135
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,790
to react to Josh, then I have to do
something to overcome and make Josh

136
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
something to overcome and make Josh
 

137
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,790
something to overcome and make Josh
react to me. So, it's it's complicated

138
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
react to me. So, it's it's complicated
 

139
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,070
react to me. So, it's it's complicated
and a pain in the butt, but this is the

140
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
and a pain in the butt, but this is the
 

141
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,309
and a pain in the butt, but this is the
way it always works. So, the faster I

142
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
way it always works. So, the faster I
 

143
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,630
way it always works. So, the faster I
can be at changing something, then the

144
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
can be at changing something, then the
 

145
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,990
can be at changing something, then the
harder it is for him to keep up with me

146
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
harder it is for him to keep up with me
 

147
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,350
harder it is for him to keep up with me
and the more likely I'll win. And this

148
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
and the more likely I'll win. And this
 

149
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,270
and the more likely I'll win. And this
goes back to um uh uh Boyd's uh loop

150
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
goes back to um uh uh Boyd's uh loop
 

151
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,430
goes back to um uh uh Boyd's uh loop
udaloop and and that whole idea and and

152
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
udaloop and and that whole idea and and
 

153
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,630
udaloop and and that whole idea and and
there's more videos coming on that

154
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
there's more videos coming on that
 

155
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,390
there's more videos coming on that
actually very soon. Um so, check that

156
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
actually very soon. Um so, check that
 

157
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,830
actually very soon. Um so, check that
out. But you just want to stay ahead of

158
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
out. But you just want to stay ahead of
 

159
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,110
out. But you just want to stay ahead of
the other guy. Okay. Now, in iikido, how

160
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
the other guy. Okay. Now, in iikido, how
 

161
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,309
the other guy. Okay. Now, in iikido, how
can that work? It can work a million

162
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
can that work? It can work a million
 

163
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,710
can that work? It can work a million
ways, right? So, let's say I'm up here

164
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
ways, right? So, let's say I'm up here
 

165
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,070
ways, right? So, let's say I'm up here
and like I said before, he pushed

166
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
and like I said before, he pushed
 

167
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,750
and like I said before, he pushed
against me. I could use the udrawaza,

168
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
against me. I could use the udrawaza,
 

169
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,589
against me. I could use the udrawaza,
right? Let's say I'm up here and he

170
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
right? Let's say I'm up here and he
 

171
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,190
right? Let's say I'm up here and he
starts wanting to drive his elbow down.

172
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
starts wanting to drive his elbow down.
 

173
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,190
starts wanting to drive his elbow down.
I could go into nikyo. Let's say I'm

174
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
I could go into nikyo. Let's say I'm
 

175
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,869
I could go into nikyo. Let's say I'm
right here and I can't push here and I

176
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
right here and I can't push here and I
 

177
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,030
right here and I can't push here and I
go urowaza and nothing happens. I can go

178
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
go urowaza and nothing happens. I can go
 

179
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,270
go urowaza and nothing happens. I can go
into sanio, right? Let's say I'm up here

180
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,280
into sanio, right? Let's say I'm up here
 

181
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,270
into sanio, right? Let's say I'm up here
and I need a little more oomph forward.

182
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
and I need a little more oomph forward.
 

183
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,910
and I need a little more oomph forward.
I can go into yonko. Uh let's say I'm up

184
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
I can go into yonko. Uh let's say I'm up
 

185
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,509
I can go into yonko. Uh let's say I'm up
here and he straightens his arm out. I

186
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
here and he straightens his arm out. I
 

187
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,750
here and he straightens his arm out. I
can go into rokyo, right? Um I I would

188
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
can go into rokyo, right? Um I I would
 

189
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,350
can go into rokyo, right? Um I I would
show a gokyo, but it doesn't happen real

190
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
show a gokyo, but it doesn't happen real
 

191
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,110
show a gokyo, but it doesn't happen real
nice from there. Okay.

192
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
nice from there. Okay.
 

193
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,589
nice from there. Okay.
So, anytime I adapt one technique into

194
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
So, anytime I adapt one technique into
 

195
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,750
So, anytime I adapt one technique into
the next, tons of techniques naturally

196
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
the next, tons of techniques naturally
 

197
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,589
the next, tons of techniques naturally
link really easily. And you should be

198
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
link really easily. And you should be
 

199
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,670
link really easily. And you should be
real familiar with those. For example,

200
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
real familiar with those. For example,
 

201
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,670
real familiar with those. For example,
Rokio, if he bends his arm to keep me

202
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
Rokio, if he bends his arm to keep me
 

203
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,149
Rokio, if he bends his arm to keep me
from rokoing him, turns into kagash and

204
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
from rokoing him, turns into kagash and
 

205
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,710
from rokoing him, turns into kagash and
kagash, if he's fighting me, will often

206
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
kagash, if he's fighting me, will often
 

207
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,070
kagash, if he's fighting me, will often
lock into royo, right? So, those two

208
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
lock into royo, right? So, those two
 

209
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,390
lock into royo, right? So, those two
link supernaturally together, right?

210
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
link supernaturally together, right?
 

211
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,550
link supernaturally together, right?
Supernaturally. So, they they they link

212
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
Supernaturally. So, they they they link
 

213
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,910
Supernaturally. So, they they they link
together in a really natural way. You

214
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
together in a really natural way. You
 

215
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,390
together in a really natural way. You
got to understand those naturally come

216
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
got to understand those naturally come
 

217
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,710
got to understand those naturally come
one and two like that, right? Most of

218
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
one and two like that, right? Most of
 

219
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,710
one and two like that, right? Most of
the the iikido techniques that sit side

220
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
the the iikido techniques that sit side
 

221
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,070
the the iikido techniques that sit side
by side in the kiosa echo through they

222
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
by side in the kiosa echo through they
 

223
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,990
by side in the kiosa echo through they
naturally turn one into the next really

224
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
naturally turn one into the next really
 

225
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,670
naturally turn one into the next really
nicely as well. So what you need to do

226
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
nicely as well. So what you need to do
 

227
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,750
nicely as well. So what you need to do
is familiarize yourself with all the

228
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
is familiarize yourself with all the
 

229
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,990
is familiarize yourself with all the
pairs that work really really well

230
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
pairs that work really really well
 

231
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,470
pairs that work really really well
together. Now most of the time iikido

232
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
together. Now most of the time iikido
 

233
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,470
together. Now most of the time iikido
techniques are given to us in that same

234
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
techniques are given to us in that same
 

235
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,710
techniques are given to us in that same
format. Right? So let's look at um

236
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
format. Right? So let's look at um
 

237
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,509
format. Right? So let's look at um
kitateori kitanag and there's the

238
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
kitateori kitanag and there's the
 

239
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,670
kitateori kitanag and there's the
uchimawari variation and the stoi

240
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
uchimawari variation and the stoi
 

241
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,990
uchimawari variation and the stoi
variation. Okay. Now in the the basic

242
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
variation. Okay. Now in the the basic
 

243
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,910
variation. Okay. Now in the the basic
idea for this technique is as I read it

244
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
idea for this technique is as I read it
 

245
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,229
idea for this technique is as I read it
is to hit him and escape. Boom. And get

246
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
is to hit him and escape. Boom. And get
 

247
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,550
is to hit him and escape. Boom. And get
out of there. Okay. But what if I hit

248
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
out of there. Okay. But what if I hit
 

249
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,710
out of there. Okay. But what if I hit
him and I don't escape? Well, the

250
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
him and I don't escape? Well, the
 

251
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,189
him and I don't escape? Well, the
natural thing to go is uchimari. Boom.

252
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
natural thing to go is uchimari. Boom.
 

253
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,110
natural thing to go is uchimari. Boom.
Now the kitanag would be if he kept

254
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
Now the kitanag would be if he kept
 

255
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,629
Now the kitanag would be if he kept
coming around to me and as he comes

256
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
coming around to me and as he comes
 

257
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,070
coming around to me and as he comes
around to me, boom. That sets up a

258
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
around to me, boom. That sets up a
 

259
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,110
around to me, boom. That sets up a
kitanag. That's how the uh uchim moari

260
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
kitanag. That's how the uh uchim moari
 

261
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,909
kitanag. That's how the uh uchim moari
kitanag from katadori sets up. But look,

262
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
kitanag from katadori sets up. But look,
 

263
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,550
kitanag from katadori sets up. But look,
watch what happens if I go here and I

264
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
watch what happens if I go here and I
 

265
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,629
watch what happens if I go here and I
go, oh, I'm going to sink under and he

266
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
go, oh, I'm going to sink under and he
 

267
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,909
go, oh, I'm going to sink under and he
blocks that. How would he block that?

268
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
blocks that. How would he block that?
 

269
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,189
blocks that. How would he block that?
That's how he would block it. And look

270
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
That's how he would block it. And look
 

271
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,110
That's how he would block it. And look
what I did. I did the sootari and the

272
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
what I did. I did the sootari and the
 

273
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,110
what I did. I did the sootari and the
same variation or the stoi variation

274
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
same variation or the stoi variation
 

275
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,390
same variation or the stoi variation
will come off that. So, same technique,

276
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
will come off that. So, same technique,
 

277
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,430
will come off that. So, same technique,
kiteag, different variation samorei. So,

278
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
kiteag, different variation samorei. So,
 

279
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,909
kiteag, different variation samorei. So,
the techniques are often given to us in

280
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
the techniques are often given to us in
 

281
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,990
the techniques are often given to us in
pairs. That's why we have and emote

282
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
pairs. That's why we have and emote
 

283
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,670
pairs. That's why we have and emote
techniques for so many things because

284
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
techniques for so many things because
 

285
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,070
techniques for so many things because
they're telling us what those opposing

286
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
they're telling us what those opposing
 

287
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,749
they're telling us what those opposing
and adapting methods are. Now, I

288
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
and adapting methods are. Now, I
 

289
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,030
and adapting methods are. Now, I
generally call these complatory

290
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
generally call these complatory
 

291
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,550
generally call these complatory
opposites. When I work one thing and

292
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
opposites. When I work one thing and
 

293
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,390
opposites. When I work one thing and
they block it, there will be a new set

294
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
they block it, there will be a new set
 

295
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,150
they block it, there will be a new set
of advantages on that one thing. And you

296
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
of advantages on that one thing. And you
 

297
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,550
of advantages on that one thing. And you
have to understand to the letter which

298
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
have to understand to the letter which
 

299
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,150
have to understand to the letter which
each one of those are. And it it will

300
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
each one of those are. And it it will
 

301
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,310
each one of those are. And it it will
become eventually it will become um

302
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
become eventually it will become um
 

303
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,990
become eventually it will become um
unconscious mind stuff and not conscious

304
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
unconscious mind stuff and not conscious
 

305
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,189
unconscious mind stuff and not conscious
mind stuff. But first work through it

306
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
mind stuff. But first work through it
 

307
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,870
mind stuff. But first work through it
consciously. You'll get good at that by

308
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880

00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
So forth, but understand that they're
 

331

pretty much already given to you. It's
 

333
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,990

just for me anyways, maybe you guys have
 

335
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,749
just for me anyways, maybe you guys have
figured this out, but for me, I was real

336
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
figured this out, but for me, I was real
 

337
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,430
figured this out, but for me, I was real
obtuse and didn't figure this out for a

338
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
obtuse and didn't figure this out for a
 

339
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,550
obtuse and didn't figure this out for a
long time till I was like, "Oh, they

340
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
long time till I was like, "Oh, they

long time till I was like, "Oh, they
tell us what those are all the time."

344
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
But all right, so I think that's that's
 

345
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,350
But all right, so I think that's that's
good. So that's that's basically

346
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
good. So that's that's basically
 

347
