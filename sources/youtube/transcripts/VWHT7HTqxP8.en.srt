face it's going to come back towards me
 

183
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,630
face it's going to come back towards me
you

184
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:37,640
you
 

185
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,230
you
see because I'm doing

186
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:41,240
see because I'm doing
 

187
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,310
see because I'm doing
R I have to

188
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:43,320
R I have to
 

189
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:50,509
R I have to
he this way boom there he

190
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:50,519

 

191
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:57,590

is this

192
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600

 

193
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:06,269

way this way

194
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:06,279

 

195
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,030

boom

196
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,040
boom
 

197
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,389
boom
bo my hand his contact Point comes to

198
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:13,399
bo my hand his contact Point comes to
 

199
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,230
bo my hand his contact Point comes to
that

200
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,240
that
 

201
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:26,990
that
midline this irrelevant

202
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,000

 

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:43,520

now here hand touch here this

204
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:43,530

 

205
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:51,190

[Music]

206
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200

 

207
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:59,470

line let's do a one handed for now

208
00:10:59,470 --> 00:10:59,480

 

209
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,949

all right so when I go here you you have

210
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
all right so when I go here you you have
 

211
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,389
all right so when I go here you you have
to stick here stick here don't shove

212
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
to stick here stick here don't shove
 

213
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,949
to stick here stick here don't shove
this down he'll fall out the

214
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
this down he'll fall out the
 

215
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,949
this down he'll fall out the
bottom you stick okay so I stick here I

216
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
bottom you stick okay so I stick here I
 

217
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,150
bottom you stick okay so I stick here I
stick here which means what what's my y

218
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,160
stick here which means what what's my y
 

219
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,350
stick here which means what what's my y
value it's it's matching his do you see

220
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:22,360
value it's it's matching his do you see
 

221
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,790
value it's it's matching his do you see
that so he tries to pull out it's stuck

222
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:25,800
that so he tries to pull out it's stuck
 

223
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,069
that so he tries to pull out it's stuck
it's stuck in there and now you start

224
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
it's stuck in there and now you start
 

225
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,110
it's stuck in there and now you start
adding the centrifugal energy right and

226
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
adding the centrifugal energy right and
 

227
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,389
adding the centrifugal energy right and
because I keep moving it forward the

228
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:33,399
because I keep moving it forward the
 

229
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,910
because I keep moving it forward the
bottom gets filled up right now if I'm

230
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
bottom gets filled up right now if I'm
 

231
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,110
bottom gets filled up right now if I'm
static he can't pull away pull that way

232
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,120
static he can't pull away pull that way
 

233
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,670
static he can't pull away pull that way
you can't pull away but he can go

234
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
you can't pull away but he can go
 

235
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,350
you can't pull away but he can go
under so that's why I'm

236
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:46,360
under so that's why I'm
 

237
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,550
under so that's why I'm
turning not not here here I'm turning

238
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
turning not not here here I'm turning
 

239
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,870
turning not not here here I'm turning
this constantly so as he tries to go

240
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
this constantly so as he tries to go
 

241
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,590
this constantly so as he tries to go
under he just is putting himself into

242
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
under he just is putting himself into
 

243
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,829
under he just is putting himself into
the braak

244
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:00,839

 

245
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,269

which means don't go here and maximize

246
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:04,279
which means don't go here and maximize
 

247
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,829
which means don't go here and maximize
this it's going to get under you need to

248
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:06,839
this it's going to get under you need to
 

249
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,069
this it's going to get under you need to
keep

250
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
keep
 

251
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,389
keep
him in the iades as you work at cental

252
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:13,399
him in the iades as you work at cental
 

253
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:40,870
him in the iades as you work at cental
centrifugal forces

254
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880

 

255
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,750

is where you want to end up turn the

256
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
is where you want to end up turn the
 

257
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,760
is where you want to end up turn the
braak
