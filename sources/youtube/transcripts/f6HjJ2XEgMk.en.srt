1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,470

all right so uh soncho 3 the first thing

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:04,480
all right so uh soncho 3 the first thing
 

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,390
all right so uh soncho 3 the first thing
is um don't fetishize the

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,400
is um don't fetishize the
 

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,910
is um don't fetishize the
form uh you want to in another you

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
form uh you want to in another you
 

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,190
form uh you want to in another you
instead you want to connect the form to

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,200
instead you want to connect the form to
 

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,630
instead you want to connect the form to
the truth and to the way don't reverse

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
the truth and to the way don't reverse
 

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,790
the truth and to the way don't reverse
that

12
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
that
 

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,990
that
um there's been a lot of crazy stuff

14
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
um there's been a lot of crazy stuff
 

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,990
um there's been a lot of crazy stuff
with cha sensei's weapons in my opinion

16
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:27,000
with cha sensei's weapons in my opinion
 

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,749
with cha sensei's weapons in my opinion
it's just my

18
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:28,759
it's just my
 

19
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:32,269
it's just my
opinion and and um there's like a big

20
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:32,279
opinion and and um there's like a big
 

21
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,310
opinion and and um there's like a big
telephone game like you know this person

22
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:35,320
telephone game like you know this person
 

23
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,229
telephone game like you know this person
showed it to that person so there's lots

24
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:37,239
showed it to that person so there's lots
 

25
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,190
showed it to that person so there's lots
of variation and that is Complicated by

26
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,200
of variation and that is Complicated by
 

27
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,869
of variation and that is Complicated by
the fact that Sensei was these a lot of

28
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:42,879
the fact that Sensei was these a lot of
 

29
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,350
the fact that Sensei was these a lot of
this stuff was Works in progress so if

30
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
this stuff was Works in progress so if
 

31
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,830
this stuff was Works in progress so if
you were introduced to it at one point

32
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
you were introduced to it at one point
 

33
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,029
you were introduced to it at one point
in its development you learned one way

34
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:50,039
in its development you learned one way
 

35
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,389
in its development you learned one way
and if you were introduced to it later

36
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
and if you were introduced to it later
 

37
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,310
and if you were introduced to it later
in its development you learned another

38
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
in its development you learned another
 

39
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,069
in its development you learned another
way okay so more reason not to go this

40
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
way okay so more reason not to go this
 

41
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,069
way okay so more reason not to go this
is what I was shown this is what the

42
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
is what I was shown this is what the
 

43
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,110
is what I was shown this is what the
form is keep it a living form all right

44
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
form is keep it a living form all right
 

45
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,429
form is keep it a living form all right
so the set revolves around ban versus

46
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
so the set revolves around ban versus
 

47
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,030
so the set revolves around ban versus
Joe and so there's certain fighting

48
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:10,040
Joe and so there's certain fighting
 

49
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,149
Joe and so there's certain fighting
principles because there's a physical

50
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
principles because there's a physical
 

51
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,230
principles because there's a physical
component to everything we're training

52
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
component to everything we're training
 

53
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,670
component to everything we're training
in and then there are certain energetic

54
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,680
in and then there are certain energetic
 

55
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,109
in and then there are certain energetic
components and those things help us

56
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
components and those things help us
 

57
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,950
components and those things help us
develop the spiritual components so the

58
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:21,960
develop the spiritual components so the
 

59
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,630
develop the spiritual components so the
physical components are some of the

60
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
physical components are some of the
 

61
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,870
physical components are some of the
things you're going to do is take

62
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
things you're going to do is take
 

63
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,030
things you're going to do is take
advantage of how much faster the sword

64
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
advantage of how much faster the sword
 

65
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,109
advantage of how much faster the sword
is to the Joe if you're in a particular

66
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
is to the Joe if you're in a particular
 

67
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,710
is to the Joe if you're in a particular
M so you're trying to get into that M

68
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:38,720
M so you're trying to get into that M
 

69
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,749
M so you're trying to get into that M
and then capitalize upon another

70
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:40,759
and then capitalize upon another
 

71
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,109
and then capitalize upon another
advantage that the sword has over the

72
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
advantage that the sword has over the
 

73
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,630
advantage that the sword has over the
Joe and that is that it is a blade and

74
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:45,640
Joe and that is that it is a blade and
 

75
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,670
Joe and that is that it is a blade and
not a stick okay so you'll follow a lot

76
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:48,680
not a stick okay so you'll follow a lot
 

77
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,069
not a stick okay so you'll follow a lot
of the fighting principles related to

78
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:51,079
of the fighting principles related to
 

79
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,149
of the fighting principles related to
blade for example there's a lot of

80
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
blade for example there's a lot of
 

81
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,590
blade for example there's a lot of
defanging the snake in s show 3 and

82
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:56,600
defanging the snake in s show 3 and
 

83
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,709
defanging the snake in s show 3 and
that's what you're trying to do if this

84
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
that's what you're trying to do if this
 

85
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,630
that's what you're trying to do if this
person is going going to uh stick his

86
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:01,640
person is going going to uh stick his
 

87
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,510
person is going going to uh stick his
hand in the middle of the fight which he

88
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
hand in the middle of the fight which he
 

89
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,590
hand in the middle of the fight which he
has to do to wield his longer weapon

90
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:06,600
has to do to wield his longer weapon
 

91
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,550
has to do to wield his longer weapon
then I'm going to cut his hand off that

92
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
then I'm going to cut his hand off that
 

93
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,550
then I'm going to cut his hand off that
is defanging the snake Okay that will

94
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:11,560
is defanging the snake Okay that will
 

95
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,710
is defanging the snake Okay that will
require less penetration of me which is

96
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
require less penetration of me which is
 

97
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,030
require less penetration of me which is
one of the advantages that the Joe has

98
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
one of the advantages that the Joe has
 

99
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,350
one of the advantages that the Joe has
over is the Joe can penetrate but at a

100
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:20,360
over is the Joe can penetrate but at a
 

101
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,750
over is the Joe can penetrate but at a
distance all right but there is a um

102
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:24,760
distance all right but there is a um
 

103
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,350
distance all right but there is a um
limit to how you play this m so there's

104
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
limit to how you play this m so there's
 

105
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,190
limit to how you play this m so there's
a particular M that this works and if

106
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,200
a particular M that this works and if
 

107
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,990
a particular M that this works and if
you close too much then the reverse side

108
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
you close too much then the reverse side
 

109
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,550
you close too much then the reverse side
of the Joe becomes relevant and is quite

110
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:37,560
of the Joe becomes relevant and is quite
 

111
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,470
of the Joe becomes relevant and is quite
potent as well so a lot of the set is

112
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
potent as well so a lot of the set is
 

113
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,190
potent as well so a lot of the set is
where do I hang out so I can defang the

114
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
where do I hang out so I can defang the
 

115
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,270
where do I hang out so I can defang the
snake and then the joe side a lot of

116
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,280
snake and then the joe side a lot of
 

117
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,190
snake and then the joe side a lot of
this set is how do I got get not get

118
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
this set is how do I got get not get
 

119
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,470
this set is how do I got get not get
deaged and bring this person into my

120
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
deaged and bring this person into my
 

121
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,949
deaged and bring this person into my
range um of what I need to do okay and

122
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
range um of what I need to do okay and
 

123
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,229
range um of what I need to do okay and
when it does that the way to take away

124
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
when it does that the way to take away
 

125
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,030
when it does that the way to take away
the blade advantage over the stick

126
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
the blade advantage over the stick
 

127
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,550
the blade advantage over the stick
Advantage is what you always do is

128
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:05,560
Advantage is what you always do is
 

129
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,990
Advantage is what you always do is
you're going to cut off all cuts at its

130
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
you're going to cut off all cuts at its
 

131
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,270
you're going to cut off all cuts at its
source that's what you're going to do

132
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,280
source that's what you're going to do
 

133
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,430
source that's what you're going to do
okay generally speaking so here we go

134
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
okay generally speaking so here we go
 

135
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,149
okay generally speaking so here we go
with the first

136
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:15,159
with the first
 

137
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,990
with the first
set my son does not know the set so I'll

138
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
set my son does not know the set so I'll
 

139
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,350
set my son does not know the set so I'll
be teaching him as a reviewing it for

140
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:20,360
be teaching him as a reviewing it for
 

141
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,190
be teaching him as a reviewing it for
those who do know it okay you don't

142
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
those who do know it okay you don't
 

143
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,830
those who do know it okay you don't
start at any kind of seon because you

144
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
start at any kind of seon because you
 

145
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,229
start at any kind of seon because you
got to obey that rule that he has what's

146
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:29,239
got to obey that rule that he has what's
 

147
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,509
got to obey that rule that he has what's
ideal for him so stand where you would

148
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
ideal for him so stand where you would

be ideal with your job if you were going
 

151
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,589
be ideal with your job if you were going
to ski me okay about that distance right

152
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:38,599
to ski me okay about that distance right
 

153
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,309
to ski me okay about that distance right
well I don't want to stand here because

154
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:41,319
well I don't want to stand here because
 

155
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,470
well I don't want to stand here because
that Advantage goes to him so I'm kind

156
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
that Advantage goes to him so I'm kind
 

157
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,390
that Advantage goes to him so I'm kind
of out further right and what I want to

158
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
of out further right and what I want to
 

159
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,789
of out further right and what I want to
try to do because I have the shorter uh

160
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:51,799
try to do because I have the shorter uh
 

161
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,429
try to do because I have the shorter uh
bladed weapon is I want him to stick his

162
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
bladed weapon is I want him to stick his
 

163
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,589
bladed weapon is I want him to stick his
weapon in the middle of the fight so

164
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
weapon in the middle of the fight so
 

165
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,110
weapon in the middle of the fight so
that I can clip his arm off okay and

166
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
that I can clip his arm off okay and
 

167
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,069
that I can clip his arm off okay and
real fencing if you clip this part off

168
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:05,079
real fencing if you clip this part off
 

169
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,670
real fencing if you clip this part off
the fight is over okay um so that is a

170
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:08,680
the fight is over okay um so that is a
 

171
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,630
the fight is over okay um so that is a
very realistic strategy so let's Scoot a

172
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:11,640
very realistic strategy so let's Scoot a
 

173
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,949
very realistic strategy so let's Scoot a
little this

174
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
little this
 

175
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,550
little this
way okay so first thing is where's that

176
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
way okay so first thing is where's that
 

177
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,030
way okay so first thing is where's that
my where I'm not in Joe Advantage range

178
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,040
my where I'm not in Joe Advantage range
 

179
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,350
my where I'm not in Joe Advantage range
okay so for example if we were doing

180
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:22,360
okay so for example if we were doing
 

181
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,909
okay so for example if we were doing
like a some weird seon put your Joe out

182
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:24,919
like a some weird seon put your Joe out
 

183
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,590
like a some weird seon put your Joe out
in the middle you see no but hold it

184
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
in the middle you see no but hold it
 

185
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,230
in the middle you see no but hold it
like you were going to fight with it no

186
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,240
like you were going to fight with it no
 

187
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,029
like you were going to fight with it no
pleas hold it normally please hold the

188
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:31,039
pleas hold it normally please hold the
 

189
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,870
pleas hold it normally please hold the
Joe normally stay there but stick the

190
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
Joe normally stay there but stick the
 

191
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,790
Joe normally stay there but stick the
weapon out here do you guys see this and

192
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:37,800
weapon out here do you guys see this and
 

193
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,350
weapon out here do you guys see this and
you were here because the length of his

194
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:40,360
you were here because the length of his
 

195
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,029
you were here because the length of his
weapon he has greater Advantage here so

196
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:43,039
weapon he has greater Advantage here so
 

197
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:46,870
weapon he has greater Advantage here so
we're not in any kind of seon and we're

198
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
we're not in any kind of seon and we're
 

199
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,350
we're not in any kind of seon and we're
not in Joe Advantage we're outside of

200
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:50,360
not in Joe Advantage we're outside of
 

201
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,390
not in Joe Advantage we're outside of
Joe Advantage when we line up here okay

202
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
Joe Advantage when we line up here okay
 

203
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,629
Joe Advantage when we line up here okay
and I have my Blade with no opening and

204
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
and I have my Blade with no opening and
 

205
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,430
and I have my Blade with no opening and
he has his weap weon guarding his Center

206
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
he has his weap weon guarding his Center
 

207
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,230
he has his weap weon guarding his Center
Line with no opening ready to go okay no

208
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
Line with no opening ready to go okay no
 

209
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,350
Line with no opening ready to go okay no
one can hit each other so that's the

210
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,360
one can hit each other so that's the
 

211
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,950
one can hit each other so that's the
first thing so scoop back so the first

212
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
first thing so scoop back so the first
 

213
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,550
first thing so scoop back so the first
thing is you set up that dilemma where

214
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
thing is you set up that dilemma where
 

215
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,430
thing is you set up that dilemma where
we're

216
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:14,440
we're
 

217
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,710
we're
here here this is too close and

218
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
here here this is too close and
 

219
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,430
here here this is too close and
obviously this was not set up any

220
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
obviously this was not set up any
 

221
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,590
obviously this was not set up any
motivation in him to strike so that I

222
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
motivation in him to strike so that I
 

223
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,870
motivation in him to strike so that I
could counter he would move forward so

224
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:27,880
could counter he would move forward so
 

225
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,670
could counter he would move forward so
this isn't hit either so we do it again

226
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:30,680
this isn't hit either so we do it again
 

227
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,629
this isn't hit either so we do it again
out and you come up and you learn where

228
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
out and you come up and you learn where
 

229
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,029
out and you come up and you learn where
I'm just out of Joe range okay all right

230
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:38,039
I'm just out of Joe range okay all right
 

231
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,710
I'm just out of Joe range okay all right
let's try that go all right so I want to

232
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
let's try that go all right so I want to
 

233
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,189
let's try that go all right so I want to
give you a metric on where is that space

234
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
give you a metric on where is that space
 

235
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,510
give you a metric on where is that space
eventually as you train uh with

236
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:46,520
eventually as you train uh with
 

237
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,189
eventually as you train uh with
intensity as we've showed you there's an

238
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
intensity as we've showed you there's an
 

239
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,070
intensity as we've showed you there's an
intensive variation of Keon which does

240
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
intensive variation of Keon which does
 

241
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,990
intensive variation of Keon which does
not use the embryonic timings okay uh So

242
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
not use the embryonic timings okay uh So
 

243
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,510
not use the embryonic timings okay uh So
eventually you'll learn where that is

244
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
eventually you'll learn where that is
 

245
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,189
eventually you'll learn where that is
cuz this guy keeps spearing the hell out

246
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
cuz this guy keeps spearing the hell out
 

247
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,189
cuz this guy keeps spearing the hell out
of you right so you're you're not in a

248
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
of you right so you're you're not in a
 

249
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,909
of you right so you're you're not in a
St there please you're not in normal

250
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:06,919
St there please you're not in normal
 

251
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,150
St there please you're not in normal
seon which you might think between the

252
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,160
seon which you might think between the
 

253
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,110
seon which you might think between the
two Joe's uh because my weapon is

254
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,120
two Joe's uh because my weapon is
 

255
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,710
two Joe's uh because my weapon is
shorter so I don't want to give that

256
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:13,720
shorter so I don't want to give that
 

257
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,350
shorter so I don't want to give that
Advantage okay so if you were to do

258
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:16,360
Advantage okay so if you were to do
 

259
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,350
Advantage okay so if you were to do
normal

260
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
normal
 

261
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,550
normal
ski and you would see that

262
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
ski and you would see that
 

263
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,510
ski and you would see that
easily he would I'm in his Advantage

264
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
easily he would I'm in his Advantage
 

265
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,270
easily he would I'm in his Advantage
range okay so we scoop back and so when

266
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
range okay so we scoop back and so when
 

267
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,110
range okay so we scoop back and so when
you get to that position you don't want

268
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,120
you get to that position you don't want
 

269
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,070
you get to that position you don't want
to be way out here because you do not

270
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,080
to be way out here because you do not
 

271
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,309
to be way out here because you do not
generate the intensity which is going to

272
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
generate the intensity which is going to
 

273
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,430
generate the intensity which is going to
generate his movement which is going to

274
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:38,440
generate his movement which is going to
 

275
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,550
generate his movement which is going to
allow me to counter his movement which

276
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
allow me to counter his movement which
 

277
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,950
allow me to counter his movement which
is how you rock a shorter weapon um from

278
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:43,960
is how you rock a shorter weapon um from
 

279
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,990
is how you rock a shorter weapon um from
out here there's no charge there that

280
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
out here there's no charge there that
 

281
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,950
out here there's no charge there that
would motivate him and I'll get there in

282
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:47,960
would motivate him and I'll get there in
 

283
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,510
would motivate him and I'll get there in
a second so I want to be in a place

284
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
a second so I want to be in a place
 

285
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,189
a second so I want to be in a place
where if he does a normal ski go ahead

286
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
where if he does a normal ski go ahead
 

287
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,350
where if he does a normal ski go ahead
I'm just right outside of it do you see

288
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,360
I'm just right outside of it do you see
 

289
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,629
I'm just right outside of it do you see
that that is is where I want to be okay

290
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:01,639
that that is is where I want to be okay
 

291
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,150
that that is is where I want to be okay
so he can't he's not going to penetrate

292
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
so he can't he's not going to penetrate
 

293
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,629
so he can't he's not going to penetrate
me from there without violation form but

294
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:07,639
me from there without violation form but
 

295
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,749
me from there without violation form but
there's no energy in that so there's his

296
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
there's no energy in that so there's his
 

297
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,909
there's no energy in that so there's his
good ski that's where I want to be and I

298
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:12,919
good ski that's where I want to be and I
 

299
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:14,350
good ski that's where I want to be and I
want to know that

300
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:14,360
want to know that
 

301
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,510
want to know that
intuitively eventually as I've trained a

302
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:16,520
intuitively eventually as I've trained a
 

303
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,629
intuitively eventually as I've trained a
lot of people they're kind of like way

304
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
lot of people they're kind of like way
 

305
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,070
lot of people they're kind of like way
here and then they're like here this is

306
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,080
here and then they're like here this is
 

307
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,469
here and then they're like here this is
not the same this is where you where you

308
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:23,479
not the same this is where you where you
 

309
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,790
not the same this is where you where you
want to be without him having thrown the

310
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:25,800
want to be without him having thrown the
 

311
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,790
want to be without him having thrown the
Joe okay so that is where go back now

312
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:29,800
Joe okay so that is where go back now
 

313
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,309
Joe okay so that is where go back now
that is where this form begins from

314
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:33,319
that is where this form begins from
 

315
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,710
that is where this form begins from
there okay all right let's try it again

316
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:35,720
there okay all right let's try it again
 

317
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,670
there okay all right let's try it again
okay uh generally if you're going to

318

okay uh generally if you're going to
watch this and you're going to want to

320
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
watch this and you're going to want to
 

321
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,430
watch this and you're going to want to
refine your form the most

322
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
refine your form the most
 

323
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,350
refine your form the most
common mistake I see is that the m is

324
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
common mistake I see is that the m is
 

325
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,469
common mistake I see is that the m is
always too short it's always too close

326
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
always too short it's always too close
 

327
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,070
always too short it's always too close
Okay it comes from we just ftiz the form

328
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,080
Okay it comes from we just ftiz the form
 

329
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,469
Okay it comes from we just ftiz the form
and we just touch sticks but the May is

330
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:57,479
and we just touch sticks but the May is
 

331
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,510
and we just touch sticks but the May is
wrong okay so people are Too Close um so

332
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
wrong okay so people are Too Close um so
 

333
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,149
wrong okay so people are Too Close um so
what I'm trying to do in the form with

334
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:04,159
what I'm trying to do in the form with
 

335
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:08,790
what I'm trying to do in the form with
this beginning m is uh ultimately bait

336
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
this beginning m is uh ultimately bait
 

337
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,510
this beginning m is uh ultimately bait
this guy all right but let's look at it

338
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
this guy all right but let's look at it
 

339
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,909
this guy all right but let's look at it
tactically a little bit his weapon has

340
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
tactically a little bit his weapon has
 

341
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,629
tactically a little bit his weapon has
to attack from the bottom up it cannot

342
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
to attack from the bottom up it cannot
 

343
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,670
to attack from the bottom up it cannot
attack from the top down because of how

344
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
attack from the top down because of how
 

345
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,710
attack from the top down because of how
he's using it defensively right now so

346
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:27,720
he's using it defensively right now so
 

347
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,589
he's using it defensively right now so
there's two things that you can do here

348
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:30,599
there's two things that you can do here
 

349
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,350
there's two things that you can do here
is one you can go from chudan to jodon

350
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
is one you can go from chudan to jodon
 

351
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,509
is one you can go from chudan to jodon
because if he's going to attack it's

352
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
because if he's going to attack it's
 

353
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,709
because if he's going to attack it's
going to come from the bottom do do you

354
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:39,719
going to come from the bottom do do you
 

355
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,469
going to come from the bottom do do you
guys see that so he could let's move

356
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
guys see that so he could let's move
 

357
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,030
guys see that so he could let's move
around from that ceiling he could spin

358
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
around from that ceiling he could spin
 

359
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,550
around from that ceiling he could spin
it around in other words spin around

360
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
it around in other words spin around
 

361
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,990
it around in other words spin around
yourself just go around it's fine but me

362
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
yourself just go around it's fine but me
 

363
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,070
yourself just go around it's fine but me
you want to

364
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
you want to
 

365
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,430
you want to
hit do you get it so it's going around

366
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
hit do you get it so it's going around
 

367
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,230
hit do you get it so it's going around
come on just bring it around don't give

368
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,240
come on just bring it around don't give
 

369
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,030
come on just bring it around don't give
a crap how do you see that he could then

370
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,040
a crap how do you see that he could then
 

371
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,470
a crap how do you see that he could then
it came from the top down but he's given

372
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:05,480
it came from the top down but he's given
 

373
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,310
it came from the top down but he's given
major opening as he goes there okay so

374
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
major opening as he goes there okay so
 

375
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,710
major opening as he goes there okay so
no not to not true if he wants to attack

376
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
no not to not true if he wants to attack
 

377
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,350
no not to not true if he wants to attack
for example ski the tip Came From The

378
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,360
for example ski the tip Came From The
 

379
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,990
for example ski the tip Came From The
Bottom upward do you guys see that okay

380
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
Bottom upward do you guys see that okay
 

381
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,910
Bottom upward do you guys see that okay
so to do that if you're here in your

382
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:24,920
so to do that if you're here in your
 

383
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,750
so to do that if you're here in your
little scalemate you could go dude I

384
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
little scalemate you could go dude I
 

385
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,590
little scalemate you could go dude I
know he's got to come from the top from

386
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
know he's got to come from the top from
 

387
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,670
know he's got to come from the top from
the bottom so I can take jodon and my

388
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:32,680
the bottom so I can take jodon and my
 

389
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,389
the bottom so I can take jodon and my
counter is going to be that much more

390
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
counter is going to be that much more
 

391
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,350
counter is going to be that much more
effective because I can hit him as he's

392
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:36,360
effective because I can hit him as he's
 

393
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,670
effective because I can hit him as he's
coming up okay or your reasoning for

394
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
coming up okay or your reasoning for
 

395
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,150
coming up okay or your reasoning for
this is going to be that he's going to

396
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,160
this is going to be that he's going to
 

397
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,069
this is going to be that he's going to
fill the y space so as my weapon goes up

398
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:49,079
fill the y space so as my weapon goes up
 

399
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:53,470
fill the y space so as my weapon goes up
he fills that space okay so we'll

400
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:53,480
he fills that space okay so we'll
 

401
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,110
he fills that space okay so we'll
demonstrate that

402
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,120

 

403
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,350

now so it's it's very subtle because

404
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
now so it's it's very subtle because
 

405
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,829
now so it's it's very subtle because
both happen so I'll talk us through it

406
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:03,839
both happen so I'll talk us through it
 

407
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,630
both happen so I'll talk us through it
again my son does not know the form okay

408
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
again my son does not know the form okay
 

409
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,949
again my son does not know the form okay
so he's in Chon

410
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
so he's in Chon
 

411
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,350
so he's in Chon
level and he's just out of my ski range

412
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
level and he's just out of my ski range
 

413
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,350
level and he's just out of my ski range
okay my weapon has to attack from the

414
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:16,360
okay my weapon has to attack from the
 

415
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,990
okay my weapon has to attack from the
bottom he notices that so he's going to

416
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
bottom he notices that so he's going to
 

417
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,350
bottom he notices that so he's going to
go to

418
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
go to
 

419
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,550
go to
jodon got it okay but I'm going to

420
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:25,560
jodon got it okay but I'm going to
 

421
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,590
jodon got it okay but I'm going to
counter his seeking of advantage by

422
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
counter his seeking of advantage by
 

423
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,750
counter his seeking of advantage by
following his weapon in don't move don't

424
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:32,760
following his weapon in don't move don't
 

425
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,069
following his weapon in don't move don't
worry okay and now I'm going to occupy

426
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
worry okay and now I'm going to occupy
 

427
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,670
worry okay and now I'm going to occupy
the center line This movement that

428
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:38,680
the center line This movement that
 

429
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,870
the center line This movement that
you're doing here you do it all the time

430
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
you're doing here you do it all the time
 

431
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,750
you're doing here you do it all the time
in sh manucci so for example look at our

432
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
in sh manucci so for example look at our
 

433
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,030
in sh manucci so for example look at our
shui EO videos the hand goes up and we

434
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,040
shui EO videos the hand goes up and we
 

435
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,870
shui EO videos the hand goes up and we
catch their weapon on the way up we

436
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
catch their weapon on the way up we
 

437
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,069
catch their weapon on the way up we
don't wait for it to come down okay so

438
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
don't wait for it to come down okay so
 

439
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,230
don't wait for it to come down okay so
if I stay here he goes up I just lost

440
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,240
if I stay here he goes up I just lost
 

441
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,550
if I stay here he goes up I just lost
all Advantage I've lost all Advantage

442
00:10:59,550 --> 00:10:59,560
all Advantage I've lost all Advantage
 

443
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,949
all Advantage I've lost all Advantage
cuz my weapon has to come from there uh

444
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:01,959
cuz my weapon has to come from there uh
 

445
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,790
cuz my weapon has to come from there uh
I would probably move out and try

446
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:03,800
I would probably move out and try
 

447
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,750
I would probably move out and try
dancing around this kind of thing cuz I

448
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
dancing around this kind of thing cuz I
 

449
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,710
dancing around this kind of thing cuz I
lost all Advantage so that's what he is

450
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
lost all Advantage so that's what he is
 

451
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,710
lost all Advantage so that's what he is
trying to do gain Advantage go back and

452
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
trying to do gain Advantage go back and
 

453
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,910
trying to do gain Advantage go back and
my first counter is as he tries to gain

454
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
my first counter is as he tries to gain
 

455
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,230
my first counter is as he tries to gain
Advantage I fill that Advantage up do

456
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:19,240
Advantage I fill that Advantage up do
 

457
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,310
Advantage I fill that Advantage up do
you see because I'm working with him and

458
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
you see because I'm working with him and
 

459
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,350
you see because I'm working with him and
I now dominate the center line his face

460
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
I now dominate the center line his face
 

461
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,430
I now dominate the center line his face
should be out of range if we had the

462
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
should be out of range if we had the
 

463
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,230
should be out of range if we had the
right mind okay but but I still want the

464
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
right mind okay but but I still want the
 

465
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,190
right mind okay but but I still want the
center line so again we're here and as

466
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:34,200
center line so again we're here and as
 

467
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,990
center line so again we're here and as
he goes up I come in and attack the

468
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,000
he goes up I come in and attack the
 

469
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,310
he goes up I come in and attack the
center line now his sword has to come

470
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
center line now his sword has to come
 

471
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,509
center line now his sword has to come
down somewhere to attack right and do

472
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:44,519
down somewhere to attack right and do
 

473
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,790
down somewhere to attack right and do
shui and here's go just slow just go

control of it so here if he pushes on it

648
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:08,360
control of it so here if he pushes on it

he just hits my grounding vectors do you

650
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:10,600
he just hits my grounding vectors do you
 

651
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,150
he just hits my grounding vectors do you
see and with those grounding vectors

652
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,160
see and with those grounding vectors
 

653
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,430
see and with those grounding vectors
that's where I can project him out so I

654
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:16,440
that's where I can project him out so I

I gave you a metric you should be just

694
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:11,319
I gave you a metric you should be just

I gave you a metric you should be just
out of ski range okay and then seek

696
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:15,880
out of ski range okay and then seek

out of ski range okay and then seek
advantage and then counter the seeking

line so it's really three things you're

702
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:22,520
line so it's really three things you're
