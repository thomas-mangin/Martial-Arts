Yokoi. Okay. Yokanucci. So in this
Mike's coming in to hit me on the side
of the head. Bang. That'd be a bad day
for me. So I step off, bring my hands
up, protect myself, and attack him at
the same time. Then this hand that's
attacking him slides down and cuts his
arm away from me. I come back behind,
grab the collar of the neck, bring my
hand up and step through. Bring him
down. One more time with speed.
