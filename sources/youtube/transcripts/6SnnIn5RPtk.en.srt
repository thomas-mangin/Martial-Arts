so when you go here

68
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
so when you go here
 

69
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,410

his shoulder
 

77
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,869
his shoulder
so this movement

78
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:17,879
so this movement
 

79
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,930
so this movement
comes around go ahead and go down like I

80
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:20,940
comes around go ahead and go down like I
 

81
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,770
comes around go ahead and go down like I
did it

82
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:21,780
did it
 

83
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,330
did it
and

84
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:23,340
and
 

85
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:30,890
and
goes right into the lot rewind

86
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:30,900

 

87
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,830

it's going to Corkscrew

88
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
it's going to Corkscrew
 

89
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,550
it's going to Corkscrew
and go right into the block

90
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:37,560

 

91
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,670

that gives the sensation of tightening

92
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:40,680
that gives the sensation of tightening
 

93
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,150
that gives the sensation of tightening
as opposed to down

94
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
as opposed to down
 

95
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,610
as opposed to down
then you brought it off and now you're

96
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:46,620
then you brought it off and now you're
 

97
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,009

going to put it on okay
 

99
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,830
going to put it on okay

101
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,270
so my recommendation
is

102
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
is
 

103
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,850

and use it
as

108
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:00,599
as
 

109
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,630
as
an yogic ritual to release because it is

all right
 

275
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,950
all right
okay so as as you're concentrically

276
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
okay so as as you're concentrically
 

277
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,430
okay so as as you're concentrically
doing all of those things uh and you're

278
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:10,440
doing all of those things uh and you're
 

279

00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:13,259
achieving that beauty
 

281
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,189
achieving that beauty
um you have to watch your undoing of

282
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:16,199
um you have to watch your undoing of
 

283

uh the technique is constantly going
inward on a spiral so you want to watch

288
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:23,099
inward on a spiral so you want to watch
 

289
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,770
inward on a spiral so you want to watch
your straight lines

290
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:24,780
your straight lines
 

291
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,589
your straight lines
and you want to watch your undoing of it

292
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
and you want to watch your undoing of it
 

293

around
 

299
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,550
around
pop

300
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:37,560
pop
 

301
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,130
pop

here see how it's still going that way
 

305
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,110

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
comes off at that point does it so for
 

311
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,750
comes off at that point does it so for
example let's unwind the film a little

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,570
yes come back
rewind the film all the way

354
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:50,580
rewind the film all the way
 

355
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,610
rewind the film all the way
okay

356
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:52,620
okay
 

357
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,829
okay
so we're gonna go down

358
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:54,839
so we're gonna go down
 

359
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,810
so we're gonna go down
and that shoulder is going to go right

360
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:56,820
and that shoulder is going to go right
 

361
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,870
and that shoulder is going to go right
to this knee right you see right to this

362
00:09:59,870 --> 00:09:59,880
to this knee right you see right to this
 

363
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,630
to this knee right you see right to this
knee and feel like your hand does not go

364
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
knee and feel like your hand does not go
 

365
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,250
knee and feel like your hand does not go
backwards hey

366
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,260
backwards hey
 

367
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:13,250
backwards hey
you see

368
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:13,260

 

369
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,670

oh another point I made again in your

370
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:16,680
oh another point I made again in your
 

371
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,829
oh another point I made again in your
body

372
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839

 

373
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,750

and it's right here

374
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:26,760

 

375
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,090

okay

376
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,100

 

377
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,449

okay so we go slow to demonstrate so you

378
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:35,459
okay so we go slow to demonstrate so you
 

379
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,210
okay so we go slow to demonstrate so you
can see and feel okay

380
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:38,220
can see and feel okay
 

381
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,730
can see and feel okay
um but the physics changes because the

382
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:40,740
um but the physics changes because the
 

383
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,009
um but the physics changes because the
inertia momentum values are all they're

384
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:43,019
inertia momentum values are all they're
 

385
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,829
inertia momentum values are all they're
lower you see that and then the UK will

386
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
lower you see that and then the UK will
 

387
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,069
lower you see that and then the UK will
milk the out of it and uh and then

388
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:49,079
milk the out of it and uh and then
 

389
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,190
milk the out of it and uh and then
you get a uh inaccurate understanding of

390
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,200
you get a uh inaccurate understanding of
 

391
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,230
you get a uh inaccurate understanding of
what is going on okay so we go okay and

392
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,240
what is going on okay so we go okay and
 

393
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,590
what is going on okay so we go okay and
you see how the arm is is more easily

394
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:00,600
you see how the arm is is more easily
 

395
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,630
you see how the arm is is more easily
extendable as you keep the energy going

396
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:05,640

 

397
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,370

when we go here and all I have is this

398
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:10,380
when we go here and all I have is this
 

399
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,829
when we go here and all I have is this
tiny lever of push pull you can put your

400
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839
tiny lever of push pull you can put your
 

401
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,350
tiny lever of push pull you can put your
hand on the mat come on make it go do

402
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
hand on the mat come on make it go do
 

403
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,530
hand on the mat come on make it go do
you see okay but when you add the energy

404
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:18,540
you see okay but when you add the energy
 

405
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,470
you see okay but when you add the energy
it's

406
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:21,480
it's
 

407
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,050
it's
it's not let that arm die as an example

408
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,060
it's not let that arm die as an example
 

409
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,069
it's not let that arm die as an example
this is

410
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:25,079
this is
 

411
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,490
this is
okay now we've covered

412
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:28,500
okay now we've covered
 

413
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,990
okay now we've covered
okay

414
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
okay
 

415
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,730
okay
and uh again she's all Slinky do you see

416
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:34,740
and uh again she's all Slinky do you see
 

417
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,329
and uh again she's all Slinky do you see
it's all Slinky do you get it go back

418
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:37,339
it's all Slinky do you get it go back
 

419
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:41,810
it's all Slinky do you get it go back
but I do the movement oh the whole body

420
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:41,820
but I do the movement oh the whole body
 

421
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,810
but I do the movement oh the whole body
moves all at once you get it okay so

422
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:44,820
moves all at once you get it okay so
 

423
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,870
moves all at once you get it okay so
look at your the length of your body all

424
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:47,880
look at your the length of your body all
 

425
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,530
look at your the length of your body all
right and then same thing here you were

426
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:51,540
right and then same thing here you were
 

427
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,750
right and then same thing here you were
able to put your knees under

428
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
able to put your knees under
 

429
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,449
able to put your knees under
and then we get in this weird position

430
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:56,459
and then we get in this weird position
 

431
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,550
and then we get in this weird position
go back where you were

432
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
go back where you were
 

433
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,009
go back where you were
all sprawled out

434
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:01,019
all sprawled out
 

435
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,550
all sprawled out
you get it we just threw her and I'm

436
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
you get it we just threw her and I'm
 

437
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,090
you get it we just threw her and I'm
gonna actually lengthen her more

438
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:08,100
gonna actually lengthen her more
 

439
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,730
gonna actually lengthen her more
you see she's not on her knees

440
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:10,740
you see she's not on her knees
 

441
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,130
you see she's not on her knees
you get it and so you're in this

442
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:13,140
you get it and so you're in this
 

443
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,389
you get it and so you're in this
position now

444
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
position now
 

445
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,370
position now
do you understand hey do you guys see

446
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:16,380
do you understand hey do you guys see
 

447
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,069
do you understand hey do you guys see
that okay so

448
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:19,079
that okay so
 

449
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,210
that okay so
if I if you're okay if we're going slow

450
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,220
if I if you're okay if we're going slow
 

451
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,650
if I if you're okay if we're going slow
go ahead you don't want to milk the

452
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:27,660
go ahead you don't want to milk the
 

453
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,130
go ahead you don't want to milk the
lower energetic values you keep the form

454
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:31,140
lower energetic values you keep the form
 

455
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,050
lower energetic values you keep the form
okay okay

456
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,060
okay okay
 

457
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,230
okay okay
well boom that's it

458
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
well boom that's it
 

459
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,350
well boom that's it
uh your body will move as a unit

460
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
uh your body will move as a unit
 

461
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,810
uh your body will move as a unit
all the way there you go

462
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:44,820

 

463
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,730

and then you have a more realistic

464
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:46,740
and then you have a more realistic
 

465
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,250
and then you have a more realistic
understanding of what that final move

466
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:49,260
understanding of what that final move
 

467
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,889
understanding of what that final move
does it takes the turtle out of them

468
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:51,899
does it takes the turtle out of them
 

469
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,370
does it takes the turtle out of them
okay that arm's not all lowered and

470
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:55,380
okay that arm's not all lowered and
 

471
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,329
okay that arm's not all lowered and
bunched up like that okay

472
00:12:58,329 --> 00:12:58,339
bunched up like that okay
 

473
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,370
bunched up like that okay
I'd still break that arm though if I had

474
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:01,380
I'd still break that arm though if I had
 

475
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,670
I'd still break that arm though if I had
okay so another common straight line as

476
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:04,680
okay so another common straight line as
 

477
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,090
okay so another common straight line as
you're going around

478
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:08,100

 

479
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:15,110

foreign

480
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120

 

481
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,970

I'll just leave your arm there for a

482
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:16,980
I'll just leave your arm there for a
 

483
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,889
I'll just leave your arm there for a
second this knee is going to go this way

484
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:18,899
second this knee is going to go this way
 

485
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,949
second this knee is going to go this way
that's a straight line you see that and

486
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:21,959
that's a straight line you see that and
 

487
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,930
that's a straight line you see that and
it was cutting across the circle that's

488
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:23,940
it was cutting across the circle that's
 

489
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,650
it was cutting across the circle that's
going this way so we rewind the film

490
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:27,660
going this way so we rewind the film
 

491
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,129
going this way so we rewind the film
okay here uh here

492
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:31,139
okay here uh here
 

493
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,769
okay here uh here
I'm gonna make this shoulder stay on the

494
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:33,779
I'm gonna make this shoulder stay on the
 

495
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,410
I'm gonna make this shoulder stay on the
circle and meet this knee over here as

496
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:36,420
circle and meet this knee over here as
 

497
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,690
circle and meet this knee over here as
opposed to put that shoulder down and my

498
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:38,700
opposed to put that shoulder down and my
 

499
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,269
opposed to put that shoulder down and my
knee goes to you all right so it goes in

500
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
knee goes to you all right so it goes in
 

501
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,530
knee goes to you all right so it goes in
the circle

502
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:44,540

 

503
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,829

that might make this other knee not

504
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:48,839
that might make this other knee not
 

505
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,090
that might make this other knee not
touch you that is not important okay the

506
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,100
touch you that is not important okay the
 

507
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,230
touch you that is not important okay the
shoulder pin is this knee stopping you

508
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:57,240
shoulder pin is this knee stopping you
 

509
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,190
shoulder pin is this knee stopping you
going forward all right you see hi

510
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,200
going forward all right you see hi
 

511
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,069
going forward all right you see hi
stop you going forward that's what adds

512
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
stop you going forward that's what adds
 

513
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,170
stop you going forward that's what adds
to the right to the dislocation but come

514
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:06,180
to the right to the dislocation but come
 

515
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,509
to the right to the dislocation but come
right there okay hi

516
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:08,519
right there okay hi
 

517
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,790
right there okay hi
so I would never

518
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
so I would never
 

519
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,769
so I would never
if you're down just

520
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:12,779
if you're down just
 

521
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,990
if you're down just
sometimes you'll hear

522
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,000
sometimes you'll hear
 

523
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,110
sometimes you'll hear
like I'm pinched High I'm pinching you

524
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,120
like I'm pinched High I'm pinching you
 

525
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,569
like I'm pinched High I'm pinching you
and I'm holding you

526
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:20,579
and I'm holding you
 

527
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,750
and I'm holding you
and don't know you're not stand up

528
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
and don't know you're not stand up
 

529
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,129
and don't know you're not stand up
that's not it okay

530
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:28,139

 

531
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,810

so it's

532
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:29,820
so it's
 

533
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,470
so it's
bring his shoulder into this knee in the

534
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:33,480
bring his shoulder into this knee in the
 

535
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,170
bring his shoulder into this knee in the
arm into the spine

536
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:36,180
arm into the spine
 

537
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,110
arm into the spine
same thing going back to you lace when

538
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,120
same thing going back to you lace when
 

539
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,889
same thing going back to you lace when
you get here right you were here

540
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:42,899
you get here right you were here
 

541
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,410
you get here right you were here
and say you're fine

542
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:45,420
and say you're fine
 

543
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,769
and say you're fine
don't have your hands

544
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:48,779
don't have your hands
 

545
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:53,329
don't have your hands
undo the spiral

546
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:53,339

 

547
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,790

your hands will continue to do the

548
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:55,800
your hands will continue to do the
 

549
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,689
your hands will continue to do the
circle so push down and this hand is

550
00:14:59,689 --> 00:14:59,699
circle so push down and this hand is
 

551
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,370
circle so push down and this hand is
going to come around

552
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:01,380
going to come around
 

553
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,850
going to come around
this way not a straight line

554
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:04,860
this way not a straight line
 

555
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,990
this way not a straight line
so we're here right if this hand is

556
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,000
so we're here right if this hand is
 

557
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,370
so we're here right if this hand is
going to paint the circle this way

558
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:13,380
going to paint the circle this way
 

559
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,590
going to paint the circle this way
you see and this hand is going to paint

560
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
you see and this hand is going to paint
 

561
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,329
you see and this hand is going to paint
that Circle

562
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:17,339
that Circle
 

563
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,650
that Circle
this way

564
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:18,660
this way
 

565
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,110
this way
so my body's going here into

566
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
so my body's going here into
 

567
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,689
so my body's going here into
the tank as opposed to here do you see

568
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:23,699
the tank as opposed to here do you see
 

569
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:34,069
the tank as opposed to here do you see
the straight line so

570
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079

 

571
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,210

foreign

572
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:38,220

 

573
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,910

locked my knee happened to match

574
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:40,920
locked my knee happened to match
 

575
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,550
locked my knee happened to match
attention's body but not important to me

576
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:45,560
attention's body but not important to me
 

577
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:59,449
attention's body but not important to me
Ray of theory missed it I missed it okay

578
00:15:59,449 --> 00:15:59,459

 

579
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:04,009

my arms paint the same Circle

580
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:04,019

 

581
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,110

okay

582
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,120
okay
 

583
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,509
okay
try it

584
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:08,519
try it
 

585
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,069
try it
okay so uh we're going and what I said

586
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:13,079
okay so uh we're going and what I said
 

587
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,769
okay so uh we're going and what I said
was you should feel free

588
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:15,779
was you should feel free
 

589
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,530
was you should feel free
to move your knee

590
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:18,540
to move your knee
 

591
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,990
to move your knee
because what this is doing tactically

592
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,000
because what this is doing tactically
 

593
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,389
because what this is doing tactically
again you wouldn't necessarily be so

594
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:23,399
again you wouldn't necessarily be so
 

595
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,910
again you wouldn't necessarily be so
turtle is taking away the turtle

596
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
turtle is taking away the turtle
 

597
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,610
turtle is taking away the turtle
potential okay meaning you want to lay

598
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:28,620
potential okay meaning you want to lay
 

599
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,910
potential okay meaning you want to lay
him out okay so let's let's say he's

600
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
him out okay so let's let's say he's
 

601
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,610
him out okay so let's let's say he's
he's pretty turnable right now but it

602
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:34,620
he's pretty turnable right now but it
 

603
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,410
he's pretty turnable right now but it
wouldn't be like that at full speed okay

604
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:36,420
wouldn't be like that at full speed okay
 

605
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,769
wouldn't be like that at full speed okay
but let's say he is here if I take this

606
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:39,779
but let's say he is here if I take this
 

607
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,710
but let's say he is here if I take this
down to where that knee is he won't be

608
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
down to where that knee is he won't be
 

609
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,110
down to where that knee is he won't be
uh spread out so I'm I've got here

610
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,120
uh spread out so I'm I've got here
 

611
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,749
uh spread out so I'm I've got here
right I'm I'll move that leg again

612
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:50,759
right I'm I'll move that leg again
 

613
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,670
right I'm I'll move that leg again
because the main goal is to get the

614
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:52,680
because the main goal is to get the
 

615
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,490
because the main goal is to get the
Shoulder on the ground and to deturtle

616
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:55,500
Shoulder on the ground and to deturtle
 

617
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,790
Shoulder on the ground and to deturtle
him so I might move it again

618
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
him so I might move it again
 

619
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,710
him so I might move it again
and then there's there's the circle and

620
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
and then there's there's the circle and
 

621
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,470
and then there's there's the circle and
I keep it though okay

622
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:03,480
I keep it though okay
 

623
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,449
I keep it though okay
um as opposed to uh when I saw you doing

624
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:07,459
um as opposed to uh when I saw you doing
 

625
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,990
um as opposed to uh when I saw you doing
coming around and you're knee turtling

626
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
coming around and you're knee turtling
 

627
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,669
coming around and you're knee turtling
straight

628
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
straight
 

629
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,590
straight
you see that all right

630
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
you see that all right
 

631
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,610
you see that all right
again that's gonna let him out again the

632
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:19,620
again that's gonna let him out again the
 

633
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,949
again that's gonna let him out again the
same thing that adds to the grace and

634
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:21,959
same thing that adds to the grace and
 

635
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,289
same thing that adds to the grace and
the beauty and the harmonization of the

636
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:24,299
the beauty and the harmonization of the
 

637
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,569
the beauty and the harmonization of the
yin and yang and the martial viability

638
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:26,579
yin and yang and the martial viability
 

639
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,289
yin and yang and the martial viability
and the mechanical advantages right

640
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:30,299
and the mechanical advantages right
 

641
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,110
and the mechanical advantages right
the opposite of all those things

642
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
the opposite of all those things
 

643
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,570
the opposite of all those things
is going to come from undoing the

644
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:35,580
is going to come from undoing the
 

645
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,770
is going to come from undoing the
pattern so if I try to go straight here

646
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:39,780
pattern so if I try to go straight here
 

647
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,409
pattern so if I try to go straight here
that's where he's going to get out

648
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:42,419
that's where he's going to get out
 

649
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,630
that's where he's going to get out
do you understand get your ass out of

okay but

656
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
okay but
 

657
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,150
okay but
he tries to go forward now it actually

658
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:53,160
he tries to go forward now it actually
 

659
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,770
he tries to go forward now it actually
makes the other technique work better

660
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:54,780
makes the other technique work better
 

661
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,650
makes the other technique work better
because his energy is now more energy is

662
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:57,660
because his energy is now more energy is

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:22,500
do you see that hold down you held your
 

679
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,669
do you see that hold down you held your
