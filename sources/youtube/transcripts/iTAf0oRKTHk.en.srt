1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,030

so remember there's not different arts

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,040
so remember there's not different arts
 

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,870
so remember there's not different arts
so you have to use the same kazushi

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:04,880
so you have to use the same kazushi
 

5
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,230
so you have to use the same kazushi
pattern so

6
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,240
pattern so
 

7
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,509
pattern so
i have the front inward kazushi pattern

8
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
i have the front inward kazushi pattern
 

9
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,549
i have the front inward kazushi pattern
this one

10
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559

 

11
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,950

and i have the back outward because you

12
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
and i have the back outward because you
 

13
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,269
and i have the back outward because you
should

14
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279

 

15
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,550

okay so the first one is

16
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
okay so the first one is
 

17
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,950
okay so the first one is
he's gonna get me in the headlock and

18
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
he's gonna get me in the headlock and
 

19
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,710
he's gonna get me in the headlock and
you'll see his energy is going that way

20
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
you'll see his energy is going that way
 

21
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,470
you'll see his energy is going that way
he goes in boom and so you can see

22
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
he goes in boom and so you can see
 

23
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,670
he goes in boom and so you can see
go back do it on your own whoa

24
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:35,680
go back do it on your own whoa
 

25
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,510
go back do it on your own whoa
here's that here's the front position

26
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
here's that here's the front position
 

27
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,110
here's that here's the front position
pad

28
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120

 

29
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,830

so i feed that energy he goes around

30
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:43,840
so i feed that energy he goes around
 

31
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,790
so i feed that energy he goes around
secure

32
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
secure
 

33
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,990
secure
keep going around boom

34
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
keep going around boom
 

35
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,709
keep going around boom
get your base

36
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719

 

37
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,830

base out all four corners

38
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
base out all four corners
 

39
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,510
base out all four corners
so one blend

40
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520

 

41
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:18,469

all four corners

42
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479

 

43
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,230

then

44
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240

 

45
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,230

secure this arms the problem are

46
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
secure this arms the problem are
 

47
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,630
secure this arms the problem are
this arm because i don't want him

48
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
this arm because i don't want him
 

49
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,149
this arm because i don't want him
punching

50
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
punching
 

51
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,310
punching
so i have a couple options i can get it

52
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
so i have a couple options i can get it
 

53
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,030
so i have a couple options i can get it
here this way on the back side some

54
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
here this way on the back side some
 

55
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,190
here this way on the back side some
people are so wide

56
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
people are so wide
 

57
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,389
people are so wide
then take this one or take both

58
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:42,399
then take this one or take both
 

59
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,550
then take this one or take both
this arm's not doing anything it's just

60
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
this arm's not doing anything it's just
 

61
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,230
this arm's not doing anything it's just
wasting his energy

62
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
wasting his energy
 

63
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,149
wasting his energy
but this arm i i don't want him i don't

64
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
but this arm i i don't want him i don't
 

65
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,510
but this arm i i don't want him i don't
want to be holding this

66
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
want to be holding this
 

67
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,789
want to be holding this
he gets that boom okay

68
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
he gets that boom okay
 

69
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,550
he gets that boom okay
so in the movement he goes i release

70
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
so in the movement he goes i release
 

71
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,270
so in the movement he goes i release
accept catch that arm and let him go

72
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
accept catch that arm and let him go
 

73
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,590
accept catch that arm and let him go
into the kazushi pattern and we're gonna

74
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
into the kazushi pattern and we're gonna
 

75
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,510
into the kazushi pattern and we're gonna
stop here all four

76
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:05,520
stop here all four
 

77
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,910
stop here all four
corners knees and hands oh let's try

78
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
corners knees and hands oh let's try
 

79
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,710
corners knees and hands oh let's try
so he goes i yield to it

80
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720

 

81
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,270

face clear secure my base even more

82
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
face clear secure my base even more
 

83
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,710
face clear secure my base even more
then i can move this hand here

84
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
then i can move this hand here
 

85
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,309
then i can move this hand here
here on this jaw hinge push if my arm's

86
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
here on this jaw hinge push if my arm's
 

87
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,150
here on this jaw hinge push if my arm's
long enough if my arm's not long enough

88
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
long enough if my arm's not long enough
 

89
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,430
long enough if my arm's not long enough
come inside

90
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
come inside
 

91
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,509
come inside
and take this at an angle so i'm go

92
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
and take this at an angle so i'm go
 

93
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,589
and take this at an angle so i'm go
i'm not pulling straight into this i'm

94
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
i'm not pulling straight into this i'm
 

95
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,589
i'm not pulling straight into this i'm
going to go at an angle

96
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
going to go at an angle
 

97
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,030
going to go at an angle
this way then you have all your escape

98
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
this way then you have all your escape
 

99
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,430
this way then you have all your escape
so

100
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
so
 

101
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:53,670
so
you can do your arm bar

102
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680

 

103
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,990

so relax yield

104
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000

 

105
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,390

base check over

106
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
base check over
 

107
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:16,830
base check over
if i can reach here if i can't hear

108
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840

 

109
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:30,830

boom

110
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840

 

111
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,229

so

112
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239

 

113
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,350

okay okay so uh let's say yes

114
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
okay okay so uh let's say yes
 

115
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,789
okay okay so uh let's say yes
so if i'm going to do for example

116
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
so if i'm going to do for example
 

117
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,309
so if i'm going to do for example
hook you hold

118
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
hook you hold
 

119
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,550
hook you hold
his body moves into that with this step

120
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
his body moves into that with this step
 

121
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,910
his body moves into that with this step
and then this the outward backward

122
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
and then this the outward backward
 

123
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,630
and then this the outward backward
opens itself up so the same thing

124
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
opens itself up so the same thing
 

125
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,149
opens itself up so the same thing
happens here

126
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
happens here
 

127
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,630
happens here
so as he goes he'll step again to re hit

128
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
so as he goes he'll step again to re hit
 

129
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,830
so as he goes he'll step again to re hit
his mouth you see he'll feel me

130
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
his mouth you see he'll feel me
 

131
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,869
his mouth you see he'll feel me
healed he will he's go

132
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
healed he will he's go
 

133
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,830
healed he will he's go
he won't feel this you see so he feels

134
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
he won't feel this you see so he feels
 

135
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,949
he won't feel this you see so he feels
the yield

136
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
the yield
 

137
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,030
the yield
and he takes his face again you're not

138
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
and he takes his face again you're not
 

139
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,870
and he takes his face again you're not
going to get

140
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880

 

141
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,110

but he will open himself up to this one

142
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
but he will open himself up to this one
 

143
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,390
but he will open himself up to this one
now okay

144
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
now okay
 

145
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,270
now okay
so you're trying for the first one is

146
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
so you're trying for the first one is
 

147
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,230
so you're trying for the first one is
the first one

148
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
the first one
 

149
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,030
the first one
and you're just gonna go

150
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040

 

151
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:42,070

and do the same

152
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
and do the same
 

153
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,070
and do the same
so really if you just let him do his

154
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
so really if you just let him do his
 

155
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,790
so really if you just let him do his
thing i'm coming here he does his thing

156
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
thing i'm coming here he does his thing
 

157
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,870
thing i'm coming here he does his thing
and i put my leg inside you can kick

158
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
and i put my leg inside you can kick
 

159
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,030
and i put my leg inside you can kick
that leg out too

160
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040

 

161
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:03,749

and you're in the same technique

162
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759

 

163
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,230

okay so now leave the technique out and

164
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
okay so now leave the technique out and
 

165
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,909
okay so now leave the technique out and
just work the uh

166
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
just work the uh
 

167
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,590
just work the uh
the concept of yielding so he's gonna go

168
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
the concept of yielding so he's gonna go
 

169
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,950
the concept of yielding so he's gonna go
i'm yielding i'll just go

170
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960

 

171
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,390

do the first one again i go

172
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
do the first one again i go
 

173
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,830
do the first one again i go
i yield

174
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840

 

175
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,830

i'm just extending his energy we go go

176
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840

 

177
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,909

ahead

178
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919

 

179
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,070

and i don't have to think about it he's

180
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
and i don't have to think about it he's
 

181
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,189
and i don't have to think about it he's
doing it

182
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
doing it
 

183
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,749
doing it
i feel his energy

184
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759

 

185
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,590

and that's the same thing on the other

186
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
and that's the same thing on the other
 

187
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,790
and that's the same thing on the other
one so

188
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
one so
 

189
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,150
one so
go slow so you can see i'm starting to

190
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
go slow so you can see i'm starting to
 

191
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,950
go slow so you can see i'm starting to
do that one

192
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
do that one
 

193
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,029
do that one
he realizes it's gone you see that's

194
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
he realizes it's gone you see that's
 

195
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,830
he realizes it's gone you see that's
what he's gonna do

196
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
what he's gonna do
 

197
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,230
what he's gonna do
so he goes i go he feels that

198
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
so he goes i go he feels that
 

199
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,870
so he goes i go he feels that
and you'll feel like ah too late

200
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880

 

201
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,150

you want to feel when the energy changes

202
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
you want to feel when the energy changes
 

203
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,629
you want to feel when the energy changes
again

204
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
again
 

205
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:23,350
again
oh my god can you go this

206
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360

 

207
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,590

not after the fact it's not a leverage

208
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
not after the fact it's not a leverage
 

209
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,950
not after the fact it's not a leverage
technique

210
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
technique
 

211
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,309
technique
and it goes it goes again

212
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
and it goes it goes again
 

213
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,830
and it goes it goes again
and then i'm going to do a leverage

214
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
and then i'm going to do a leverage
 

215
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:41,670
and then i'm going to do a leverage
i'm going to feel his energy he goes

216
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680

 

217
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,029

really i'm not doing anything his base

218
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
really i'm not doing anything his base
 

219
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,990
really i'm not doing anything his base
changed and the energy leaks out

220
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
changed and the energy leaks out
 

221
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,070
changed and the energy leaks out
and he goes

222
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080

 

223
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,629

he does the first one without that step

224
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
he does the first one without that step
 

225
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,890
he does the first one without that step
a yield

226
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:03,900

 

227
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:11,430

[Music]

228
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440

 

229
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,759

okay let's let the technique go
