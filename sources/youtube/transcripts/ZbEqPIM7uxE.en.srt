[Music]

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,440

 

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,870

So when we do the poku game and he's

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:14,880
So when we do the poku game and he's
 

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,109
So when we do the poku game and he's
trying Okay, you see how he come over?

6
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:17,119
trying Okay, you see how he come over?
 

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,670
trying Okay, you see how he come over?
So let's look at what he did. I push.

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
So let's look at what he did. I push.
 

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,510
So let's look at what he did. I push.
I'm trying to bring it in. He came over

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
I'm trying to bring it in. He came over
 

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,109
I'm trying to bring it in. He came over
the top. You see that? Okay. So he goes

12
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
the top. You see that? Okay. So he goes
 

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:42,869
the top. You see that? Okay. So he goes
over the top and I go up.

14
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:42,879

 

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,590

Okay. So again, I'm trying to bring him

16
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
Okay. So again, I'm trying to bring him
 

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,470
Okay. So again, I'm trying to bring him
this way. He came over the top. Drop the

18
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:48,480
this way. He came over the top. Drop the
 

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,069
this way. He came over the top. Drop the
elbow and you're on the inside. You have

20
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
elbow and you're on the inside. You have
 

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,150
elbow and you're on the inside. You have
the other hand working the entire time.

22
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
the other hand working the entire time.
 

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,229
the other hand working the entire time.
So maybe I was going to go this way. You

24
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
So maybe I was going to go this way. You
 

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:08,149
So maybe I was going to go this way. You
see,

26
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159

 

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:18,550

he counter over the top and I have to go

28
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560

 

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,469

and I have to go the other way. So,

30
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
and I have to go the other way. So,
 

31
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,270
and I have to go the other way. So,
we're focus on this hand again. I'm

32
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
we're focus on this hand again. I'm
 

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,590
we're focus on this hand again. I'm
here. I'm going here. Goes over the top

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
here. I'm going here. Goes over the top
 

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,390
here. I'm going here. Goes over the top
and around. what my elbows are doing.

36
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
and around. what my elbows are doing.
 

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,390
and around. what my elbows are doing.
That's the elbows are the are the key.

38
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
That's the elbows are the are the key.
 

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,149
That's the elbows are the are the key.
So elbow, he go he's going over the top.

40
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
So elbow, he go he's going over the top.
 

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,230
So elbow, he go he's going over the top.
Elbow,

42
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
Elbow,
 

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,149
Elbow,
I'm down the inside. So with our

44
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
I'm down the inside. So with our
 

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,149
I'm down the inside. So with our
spirals, I went inward spiral. He's

46
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
spirals, I went inward spiral. He's
 

47
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,350
spirals, I went inward spiral. He's
going over the top. I go outward spiral.

48
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
going over the top. I go outward spiral.
 

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,069
going over the top. I go outward spiral.
Okay, which elbow went

50
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
Okay, which elbow went
 

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,910
Okay, which elbow went
up and in the outer spiral. It goes down

52
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
up and in the outer spiral. It goes down
 

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,109
up and in the outer spiral. It goes down
and it's going out. Okay.

54
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
and it's going out. Okay.
 

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,109
and it's going out. Okay.
So, we'll work on that one. You came in.

56
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
So, we'll work on that one. You came in.
 

57
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:11,110
So, we'll work on that one. You came in.
I went one. You'll feel that I go pay

58
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120

 

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,949

attention that I keep the eye on my

60
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
attention that I keep the eye on my
 

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,790
attention that I keep the eye on my
body. So, I'm not going to stay here

62
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
body. So, I'm not going to stay here
 

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,390
body. So, I'm not going to stay here
because all this is getting closer to

64
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
because all this is getting closer to
 

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,750
because all this is getting closer to
me. So, as as I reach for him, you see

66
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
me. So, as as I reach for him, you see
 

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,990
me. So, as as I reach for him, you see
the angle of my torso. He's going over

68
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
the angle of my torso. He's going over
 

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,630
the angle of my torso. He's going over
the top and I work that angle. There is

70
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
the top and I work that angle. There is
 

71
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,990
the top and I work that angle. There is
also a deviation angle. So I'm not going

72
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
also a deviation angle. So I'm not going
 

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,110
also a deviation angle. So I'm not going
straight back. I go around the energy.

74
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
straight back. I go around the energy.
 

75
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:44,710
straight back. I go around the energy.
You see that? So I

76
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720

 

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,550

so I keep the kata space between my

78
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
so I keep the kata space between my
 

79
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,270
so I keep the kata space between my
torso and elbow. Okay, let's try. If we

80
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
torso and elbow. Okay, let's try. If we
 

81
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,790
torso and elbow. Okay, let's try. If we
look at what he did, we got to get a

82
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
look at what he did, we got to get a
 

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,470
look at what he did, we got to get a
little slip. He's coming in. You see

84
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
little slip. He's coming in. You see
 

85
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,070
little slip. He's coming in. You see
that?

86
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
that?
 

87
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,670
that?
So, which spiral is he doing?

88
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
So, which spiral is he doing?
 

89
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,949
So, which spiral is he doing?
>> Okay. So, I'm going inward. He's going

90
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
>> Okay. So, I'm going inward. He's going
 

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,589
>> Okay. So, I'm going inward. He's going
to go outward. I go outward. And there

92
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
to go outward. I go outward. And there
 

93
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,710
to go outward. I go outward. And there
we go. Okay. You guys see that?

94
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
we go. Okay. You guys see that?
 

95
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,790
we go. Okay. You guys see that?
>> Okay. So, I was trying to go in. He goes

96
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
>> Okay. So, I was trying to go in. He goes
 

97
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,470
>> Okay. So, I was trying to go in. He goes
outward. I go outward. And there I go.

98
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
outward. I go outward. And there I go.
 

99
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,030
outward. I go outward. And there I go.
Just like the swords,

100
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
Just like the swords,
 

101
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,149
Just like the swords,
watch how our elbows are working

102
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
watch how our elbows are working
 

103
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,990
watch how our elbows are working
together,

104
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
together,
 

105
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,869
together,
not behind. Otherwise, it's going to get

106
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
not behind. Otherwise, it's going to get
 

107
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,990
not behind. Otherwise, it's going to get
crunched on me. And I have to do more.

108
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
crunched on me. And I have to do more.
 

109
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,260
crunched on me. And I have to do more.
So, I feel

110
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,270
So, I feel
 

111
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,390
So, I feel

okay. He never presses on me, but I

114
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
okay. He never presses on me, but I
 

115
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,030
okay. He never presses on me, but I
can't take it all the way off or I'll

116
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
can't take it all the way off or I'll
 

117
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,789
can't take it all the way off or I'll
lose what?

118
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
lose what?
 

119
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,910
lose what?
>> The adhesion. Okay. try to we first

120
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
>> The adhesion. Okay. try to we first
 

121
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,030
>> The adhesion. Okay. try to we first
reach and I came here you see and I am

122
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
reach and I came here you see and I am
 

123
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,670
reach and I came here you see and I am
trying to do this one.

124
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680

 

125
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,869

So we go he counters it and know how I

126
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
So we go he counters it and know how I
 

127
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:14,149
So we go he counters it and know how I
got to take it the other way.

128
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159

 

129
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,310

So, we're going to look at his hand.

130
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
So, we're going to look at his hand.
 

131
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,030
So, we're going to look at his hand.
Okay. So, just so we'll do it slow so I

132
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
Okay. So, just so we'll do it slow so I
 

133
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,349
Okay. So, just so we'll do it slow so I
can talk. Okay. So, one I'm trying to go

134
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
can talk. Okay. So, one I'm trying to go
 

135
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,990
can talk. Okay. So, one I'm trying to go
there. Goes here. And now this one goes

136
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
there. Goes here. And now this one goes
 

137
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,670
there. Goes here. And now this one goes
there.

138
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
there.
 

139
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,189
there.
You guys see that?

140
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
You guys see that?
 

141
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,070
You guys see that?
>> Okay. So, it was trying to get here.

142
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
>> Okay. So, it was trying to get here.
 

143
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,830
>> Okay. So, it was trying to get here.
And this one's going here. So, I'm on

144
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
And this one's going here. So, I'm on
 

145
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,909
And this one's going here. So, I'm on
the I'm on the uh inside outside. Got

146
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
the I'm on the uh inside outside. Got
 

147
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,230
the I'm on the uh inside outside. Got
it? And then I'm on the other side of my

148
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
it? And then I'm on the other side of my
 

149
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,790
it? And then I'm on the other side of my
angles of deflection. You see that?

150
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
angles of deflection. You see that?
 

151
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,990
angles of deflection. You see that?
Okay. But if he gets over the top of

152
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay. But if he gets over the top of
 

153
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,110
Okay. But if he gets over the top of
this, there's the touch right there.

154
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
this, there's the touch right there.
 

155
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,590
this, there's the touch right there.
Okay. So, when you feel that, that's

156
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
Okay. So, when you feel that, that's
 

157
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,430
Okay. So, when you feel that, that's
where I now got to go the other way.

158
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
where I now got to go the other way.
 

159
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,710
where I now got to go the other way.
So, now we going in. Okay. Well, let me

160
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
So, now we going in. Okay. Well, let me
 

161
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,469
So, now we going in. Okay. Well, let me
start. Okay. Just do your first thing

162
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
start. Okay. Just do your first thing
 

163
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,469
start. Okay. Just do your first thing
and you'll find. Okay, there it is right

164
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
and you'll find. Okay, there it is right
 

165
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,510
and you'll find. Okay, there it is right
there. So, there I go. I was

166
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
there. So, there I go. I was
 

167
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,150
there. So, there I go. I was
>> trying to get to the inside. Do you guys

168
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
>> trying to get to the inside. Do you guys
 

169
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,110
>> trying to get to the inside. Do you guys
understand?

170
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
understand?
 

171
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,749
understand?
>> Okay, but once I realize I'm now going

172
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
>> Okay, but once I realize I'm now going
 

173
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,230
>> Okay, but once I realize I'm now going
to be on the inside of this one, I go to

174
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
to be on the inside of this one, I go to
 

175
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,590
to be on the inside of this one, I go to
the outside of this one. Okay.

176
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600

 

177
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,270

>> So, I'm going here, right? He's getting

178
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
>> So, I'm going here, right? He's getting
 

179
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,629
>> So, I'm going here, right? He's getting
to the inside and I go to the outside.

180
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
to the inside and I go to the outside.
 

181
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,029
to the inside and I go to the outside.
And you have to make sure when you're

182
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
And you have to make sure when you're
 

183
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,870
And you have to make sure when you're
here,

184
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
here,
 

185
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,110
here,
as this hand comes back, you can't be in

186
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
as this hand comes back, you can't be in
 

187
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,670
as this hand comes back, you can't be in
the way. You have to move out of the

188
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
the way. You have to move out of the
 

189
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,350
the way. You have to move out of the
way.

190
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
way.
 

191
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,189
way.
Okay. And refine your circle.

192
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
Okay. And refine your circle.
 

193
00:05:41,199 --> 00:06:08,150
Okay. And refine your circle.
Here we go. Boom. Boom.

194
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160

 

195
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,670

and use the X pattern. So, as we're

196
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
and use the X pattern. So, as we're
 

197
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,350
and use the X pattern. So, as we're
going here, boom, I did a different one.

198
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
going here, boom, I did a different one.
 

199
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,790
going here, boom, I did a different one.
Okay,

200
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
Okay,
 

201
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,629
Okay,
>> this one's going to go here. And once

202
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
>> this one's going to go here. And once
 

203
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,350
>> this one's going to go here. And once
you have that, this one goes that way.

204
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
you have that, this one goes that way.
 

205
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,309
you have that, this one goes that way.
Do it again.

206
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319

 

207
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:39,270

Okay, try it.

208
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280

 

209
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,390

So, what what we're what we're doing

210
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
So, what what we're what we're doing
 

211
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,230
So, what what we're what we're doing
here is I'm I'm harmonizing things.

212
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
here is I'm I'm harmonizing things.
 

213
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,830
here is I'm I'm harmonizing things.
Okay.

214
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
Okay.
 

215
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,749
Okay.
So, I'm on the inside outside. You see

216
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
So, I'm on the inside outside. You see
 

217
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,189
So, I'm on the inside outside. You see
that? As opposed to on the outside, two

218
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
that? As opposed to on the outside, two
 

219
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,950
that? As opposed to on the outside, two
on the inside. So, yeah, I I started

220
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
on the inside. So, yeah, I I started
 

221
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,430
on the inside. So, yeah, I I started
there, but then I harmonized. And when I

222
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
there, but then I harmonized. And when I
 

223
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,950
there, but then I harmonized. And when I
harmonize, that's where you get the

224
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
harmonize, that's where you get the
 

225
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,469
harmonize, that's where you get the
yield. The yield that he goes to 4 A,

226
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
yield. The yield that he goes to 4 A,
 

227
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,150
yield. The yield that he goes to 4 A,
that sets up the X pattern. Okay? So, if

228
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,160
that sets up the X pattern. Okay? So, if
 

229
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,270
that sets up the X pattern. Okay? So, if
I say on the outside as we did, you're

230
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
I say on the outside as we did, you're
 

231
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,110
I say on the outside as we did, you're
going to you're going to hit that line,

232
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
going to you're going to hit that line,
 

233
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,710
going to you're going to hit that line,
but we're not doing that. I want you to

234
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
but we're not doing that. I want you to
 

235
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,990
but we're not doing that. I want you to
play with the four and eight. So, we

236
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
play with the four and eight. So, we
 

237
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,390
play with the four and eight. So, we
have to figure out how to yield and how

238
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
have to figure out how to yield and how
 

239
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,790
have to figure out how to yield and how
to keep contact. Okay? So I start here

240
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
to keep contact. Okay? So I start here
 

241
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,950
to keep contact. Okay? So I start here
and I go I'm going here. You take So you

242
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
and I go I'm going here. You take So you
 

243
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,189
and I go I'm going here. You take So you
take him here and then that's the

244
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
take him here and then that's the
 

245
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,189
take him here and then that's the
projection. Okay. But as we're going

246
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
projection. Okay. But as we're going
 

247
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,510
projection. Okay. But as we're going
there, he counters that one. So now we

248
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
there, he counters that one. So now we
 

249
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:54,790
there, he counters that one. So now we
got to go this way.

250
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800

 

251
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,629

All I got to do is get on the outside.

252
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
All I got to do is get on the outside.
 

253
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,150
All I got to do is get on the outside.
So I've actually done three different

254
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,160
So I've actually done three different
 

255
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,869
So I've actually done three different
ways of getting on the outside. Okay. So

256
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
ways of getting on the outside. Okay. So
 

257
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,909
ways of getting on the outside. Okay. So
when I go here and he counters, right,

258
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
when I go here and he counters, right,
 

259
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,230
when I go here and he counters, right,
you can go here. I saw some of you saw

260
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
you can go here. I saw some of you saw
 

261
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,309
you can go here. I saw some of you saw
you do that. Some of you are fine. Just

262
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
you do that. Some of you are fine. Just
 

263
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,909
you do that. Some of you are fine. Just
end here. And there you have it. Time to

264
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
end here. And there you have it. Time to
 

265
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,629
end here. And there you have it. Time to
do the other one that first came to me,

266
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
do the other one that first came to me,
 

267
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,189
do the other one that first came to me,
which is the one where I came around

268
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
which is the one where I came around
 

269
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,110
which is the one where I came around
this way.

270
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
this way.
 

271
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,670
this way.
You guys see that? So, the first one I

272
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
You guys see that? So, the first one I
 

273
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,230
You guys see that? So, the first one I
went here and found it. On the other

274
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
went here and found it. On the other
 

275
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,070
went here and found it. On the other
one, I came here and I found it this

276
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
one, I came here and I found it this
 

277
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,749
one, I came here and I found it this
way.

278
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
way.
 

279
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,790
way.
Okay. What I don't want to do though is

280
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800
Okay. What I don't want to do though is
 

281
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,110
Okay. What I don't want to do though is
when I go here and I get on the inside

282
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
when I go here and I get on the inside
 

283
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,310
when I go here and I get on the inside
because here's where you're going to

284
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
because here's where you're going to
 

285
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,949
because here's where you're going to
stop. You're going to stop him. Even if

286
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
stop. You're going to stop him. Even if
 

287
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,230
stop. You're going to stop him. Even if
you're pushing him around, you see that

288
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
you're pushing him around, you see that
 

289
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,750
you're pushing him around, you see that
you're you're technically you're

290
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
you're you're technically you're
 

291
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,509
you're you're technically you're
stopping. So you want to be on the

292
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
stopping. So you want to be on the
 

293
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,110
stopping. So you want to be on the
inside

294
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
inside
 

295
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:55,990
inside
on the

296
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000

 

297
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,790

on the outside. I mean, okay, that will

298
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
on the outside. I mean, okay, that will
 

299
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,430
on the outside. I mean, okay, that will
also be consistent that my angle of

300
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
also be consistent that my angle of
 

301
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,829
also be consistent that my angle of
deflection is going

302
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
deflection is going
 

303
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,790
deflection is going
to the right, my right, and my body went

304
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
to the right, my right, and my body went
 

305
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,430
to the right, my right, and my body went
to my left, he went to my right. Okay,

306
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
to my left, he went to my right. Okay,
 

307
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,910
to my left, he went to my right. Okay,
so don't do I know it's there, but he's

308
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
so don't do I know it's there, but he's
 

309
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,030
so don't do I know it's there, but he's
not really there. Okay, the two insides.

310
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
not really there. Okay, the two insides.
 

311
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,360
not really there. Okay, the two insides.
track.
