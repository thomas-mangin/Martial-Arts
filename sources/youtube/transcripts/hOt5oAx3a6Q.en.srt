so what i'm going to do is create two
 

21
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,670
so what i'm going to do is create two
events where i'm

22
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:27,680
events where i'm
 

23
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,870
events where i'm
tempted or triggered to close so

24
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
tempted or triggered to close so
 

25
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,030

all right so now i'm gonna do it this

50
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
all right so now i'm gonna do it this
 

51
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,990
all right so now i'm gonna do it this
releasing this openness

52
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
releasing this openness
 

53
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,670

i'm gonna do it in an active way okay
 

55
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,469
i'm gonna do it in an active way okay
so i'm gonna create a trigger here

56
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479

 

57
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,630

one and then i'm gonna increase the

58
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
one and then i'm gonna increase the
 

59
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,310
one and then i'm gonna increase the
triggering by pushing

60
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
triggering by pushing
 

61
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,390

00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
that's a progression drill so i there is
 

237
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,150
that's a progression drill so i there is
a kind of openness

238
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
a kind of openness
 

239
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,629
a kind of openness
meditation that you have to do at the

240
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
meditation that you have to do at the
 

241
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,790
meditation that you have to do at the
mind body level okay

242
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
mind body level okay
 

243
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,830
mind body level okay
um but that part of that openness is

244
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
um but that part of that openness is
 

245
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,150
um but that part of that openness is
really just about dropping the dichotomy

246
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
really just about dropping the dichotomy
 

247
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,990
really just about dropping the dichotomy
so the same thing like doing something

248
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
so the same thing like doing something
 

249
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,029
so the same thing like doing something
to him is

250
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
to him is
 

251
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,230
to him is
dichotomous um

252
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
dichotomous um
 

253
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,270
dichotomous um
so maybe you'll go like here and now

254
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
so maybe you'll go like here and now
 

255
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,830
so maybe you'll go like here and now
you're like

256
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840
you're like
 

257
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,110
you're like
i want to throw him and now you're

pushing you see um and then this drill
 

261
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,950
pushing you see um and then this drill
you won't be able to progress by so you

262
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
you won't be able to progress by so you
 

263
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,909
you won't be able to progress by so you
can do a lot

264
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
can do a lot
 

265
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,909
can do a lot
you can do a lot of your ikea with this

266
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
you can do a lot of your ikea with this
 

267
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,590
you can do a lot of your ikea with this
drill

268
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
drill
 

269
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,469
drill
a lot of people that are good they can

270
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
a lot of people that are good they can
 

271
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,150
a lot of people that are good they can
do that skill okay

272
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
do that skill okay
 

273
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,510
do that skill okay
but why is that skill actually working

274
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
but why is that skill actually working
 

275
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,749
but why is that skill actually working
is because i don't contest him

276
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
is because i don't contest him
 

277
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,790
is because i don't contest him
internally

278
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
internally
 

279
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,790
internally
and his energy is going through me okay

280
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
and his energy is going through me okay
 

281
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,990
and his energy is going through me okay
i'm just doing it i'm i am continually

282
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
i'm just doing it i'm i am continually
 

283
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,390
i'm just doing it i'm i am continually
letting his energy go through me as i go

284
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
letting his energy go through me as i go
 

285
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,909
letting his energy go through me as i go
forward okay so if he has two hands i'm

286
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
forward okay so if he has two hands i'm
 

287
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:14,469

293
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,350

okay and the reason why i wanted to go

294
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
okay and the reason why i wanted to go
 

295
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,629
okay and the reason why i wanted to go
through me is i don't want to be

dependent upon this external
 

299
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,230
dependent upon this external
displacement

300
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
displacement
 

301
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,189
displacement
okay so you have to drop the last little

302
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
okay so you have to drop the last little
 

303
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,469

gosh you're going to drop you got to
 

307
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,390
gosh you're going to drop you got to
release that

308
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
release that
 

309
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,870
release that
because what i want is i want to get him

310

to give me a lot
 

313
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,029
to give me a lot
a lot of energy and that energy goes

314
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
a lot of energy and that energy goes
 

315
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,150
a lot of energy and that energy goes
through

316
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
through
 

317
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,150
through
can you see and now now i'm doing the

318
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
can you see and now now i'm doing the
 

319
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,070
can you see and now now i'm doing the
same exact releasing skill

320
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
same exact releasing skill
 

321
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,469
same exact releasing skill
keeping my joints open i'm just letting

322
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
keeping my joints open i'm just letting
 

323
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,510
keeping my joints open i'm just letting
his energy go

324
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
his energy go
 

325
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,830
his energy go
boom and back out so gives a lot of

326
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840

 

327
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,670

energy

328
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680

 

329
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,790

and you will never get that skill if you

330
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
and you will never get that skill if you
 

331
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,390
and you will never get that skill if you
were doing

332
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
were doing
 

333
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:19,990
were doing
that okay 32 hands

334
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000

 

335
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,589

this is going to require a quicker

336
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
this is going to require a quicker
 

337
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,029
this is going to require a quicker
releasing you see

338
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
releasing you see
 

339
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,950
releasing you see
