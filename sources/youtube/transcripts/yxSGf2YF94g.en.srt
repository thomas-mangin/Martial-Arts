00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:22,840
till you get that hand light again
 

17
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,189
till you get that hand light again
okay but when you do the fade it's

18
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
okay but when you do the fade it's
 

19
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,790
okay but when you do the fade it's
important that you bait him with the

20
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
important that you bait him with the
 

21
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,150
important that you bait him with the
other hand so I use my other hand out

22
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:29,160
other hand so I use my other hand out
 

23
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,509
other hand so I use my other hand out
here

24
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
here
 

25
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,350
here
no no different than I want him to

26
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
no no different than I want him to
 

27
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,350
no no different than I want him to
attack my head I with the sword workor I

28
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:36,360
attack my head I with the sword workor I
 

29
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,990
attack my head I with the sword workor I
I expose my head so he goes for it so

30
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,000
I expose my head so he goes for it so
 

31
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,630
I expose my head so he goes for it so
you go you want to bait with the other

32
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
you go you want to bait with the other
 

33
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,069
you go you want to bait with the other
hand so I kind of show it with him and

34
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:43,079
hand so I kind of show it with him and
 

35
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,270
hand so I kind of show it with him and
then I will come around to take energy

36
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
then I will come around to take energy
 

37
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,389
then I will come around to take energy
off of that hand so yet one there it is

38
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
off of that hand so yet one there it is
 

39
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,270
off of that hand so yet one there it is
and I expose it to

40
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
and I expose it to
 

41
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,029
and I expose it to
him absorb expose it to him but I don't

42
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,039

let him ever get

44
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920

45
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,709

46
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
it
 

47
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,229
it
one expose it to him and then I bring it

48
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:03,239
one expose it to him and then I bring it
 

49
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,149

51
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,429

Cent one expose it to bring it to

00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:10,439
Cent one expose it to bring it to
 

53
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:17,630

55
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,030

okay all right now the mistake that

56
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,040
okay all right now the mistake that
 

57
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,390
okay all right now the mistake that
you're making is very common is you'll

58
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
you're making is very common is you'll
 

59
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,950
you're making is very common is you'll
feel a lot of

60
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
feel a lot of
 

61
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,069
feel a lot of
energy on these hands like that okay and

62
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:29,079
energy on these hands like that okay and
 

63
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,830
energy on these hands like that okay and
no

64
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:30,840
no
 

65
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,870
no
and so you'll keep that hand and you

66
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:33,880
and so you'll keep that hand and you
 

67
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,069
and so you'll keep that hand and you
want it to be part of your CQ hole but

68
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:37,079
want it to be part of your CQ hole but
 

69
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,590
want it to be part of your CQ hole but
the more you turn that hand the more he

70
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
the more you turn that hand the more he
 

71
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,510

moves away from the

work you need a Yin hand so the yin hand
 

81
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,870

Will they'll take that dive okay um but

170
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:28,680
Will they'll take that dive okay um but
 

171
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,629
Will they'll take that dive okay um but
so too will count a person that's trying

172
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
so too will count a person that's trying
 

173
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,309
so too will count a person that's trying
to counter so let me show you where that

174
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:33,319
to counter so let me show you where that
 

175
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,230
to counter so let me show you where that
is okay go slower so I can talk he comes

176
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,240
is okay go slower so I can talk he comes
 

177
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,390
is okay go slower so I can talk he comes
around I give it to him okay and that

178
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:41,400
around I give it to him okay and that
 

179
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,510
around I give it to him okay and that
pulls that turn there puts him here on

180
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
pulls that turn there puts him here on
 

181
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,309
pulls that turn there puts him here on
my upper arm you guys see that and I

182
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:49,319
my upper arm you guys see that and I
 

183
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,309
my upper arm you guys see that and I
will not continue to rotate my shoulders

184
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:52,319
will not continue to rotate my shoulders
 

185
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,150
will not continue to rotate my shoulders
into this throw you see and that's what

186
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,160
into this throw you see and that's what
 

187
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,909
into this throw you see and that's what
you keep doing Sean and you keep doing

188
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
you keep doing Sean and you keep doing
 

189
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,390
you keep doing Sean and you keep doing
it too okay

190
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
it too okay
 

191
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,189
it too okay
so again Watch we're all thinking as

192
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:04,199
so again Watch we're all thinking as
 

193
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,790
so again Watch we're all thinking as
long as I keep rotating my

194
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
long as I keep rotating my
 

195
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,749
long as I keep rotating my
shoulders but I can't get ahead of this

196
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
shoulders but I can't get ahead of this
 

197
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,670
shoulders but I can't get ahead of this
spiraling pattern okay and me I'm not

198
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:14,680
spiraling pattern okay and me I'm not
 

199
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,230
spiraling pattern okay and me I'm not
using the x pattern okay so as it comes

200
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:19,240
using the x pattern okay so as it comes
 

201
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,390
using the x pattern okay so as it comes
around my shoulders as soon as I got

202
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
around my shoulders as soon as I got
 

203
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,950
around my shoulders as soon as I got
that my shoulders stop rotating they

204
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
that my shoulders stop rotating they
 

205
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,710
that my shoulders stop rotating they
don't they don't keep turning this hand

206
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:27,720
don't they don't keep turning this hand
 

207
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,909
don't they don't keep turning this hand
goes up and I

208
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:30,919
goes up and I
 

209
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,550
goes up and I
across acoss across the Closs okay we'll

210
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
across acoss across the Closs okay we'll
 

211
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,469
across acoss across the Closs okay we'll
do that same side one b boom as I'll

212
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
do that same side one b boom as I'll
 

213
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,469
do that same side one b boom as I'll
turn I'll turn to get him there now I

214
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:45,479
turn I'll turn to get him there now I
 

215
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,150
turn I'll turn to get him there now I
passed the adhesion point from the grip

216
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,160
passed the adhesion point from the grip
 

217
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,749
passed the adhesion point from the grip
up to the head and now this is doing the

218
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:52,759
up to the head and now this is doing the
 

219
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,189
up to the head and now this is doing the
Thro okay that's all you're doing it's

220
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
Thro okay that's all you're doing it's
 

221
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,430
Thro okay that's all you're doing it's
no different on tension nugget I'm going

222
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
no different on tension nugget I'm going
 

223
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,909
no different on tension nugget I'm going
to use the adhesion point of the grip to

224
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:00,919
to use the adhesion point of the grip to
 

225
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,749
to use the adhesion point of the grip to
generate the adhesion point on the neck

226
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
generate the adhesion point on the neck
 

227
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,550
generate the adhesion point on the neck
and that's where I

228
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:05,560
and that's where I
 

229
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,869
and that's where I
use now that part okay so you're passing

230
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:09,879
use now that part okay so you're passing
 

231
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,990
use now that part okay so you're passing
the adhesion point he comes around I

232
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,000
the adhesion point he comes around I
 

233
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,390
the adhesion point he comes around I
will turn as much as I need to till he

234
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:15,400
will turn as much as I need to till he
 

235
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,830
will turn as much as I need to till he
there now now I feel the adhesion on the

236
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:18,840
there now now I feel the adhesion on the
 

237
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,230
there now now I feel the adhesion on the
upper arm now if I keep rotating my

238
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
upper arm now if I keep rotating my
 

239
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,790
upper arm now if I keep rotating my
shoulders even on the entry he is just

240
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:25,800
shoulders even on the entry he is just
 

241
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,270
shoulders even on the entry he is just
ahead of me the whole time okay

242
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:30,280
ahead of me the whole time okay
 

243
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,270
ahead of me the whole time okay
so

244
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
so
 

245
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,350
so
instead turned to get get huge there it

246
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,360
instead turned to get get huge there it
 

247
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,790
instead turned to get get huge there it
is and now it's just across don't keep

248
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:37,800
is and now it's just across don't keep
 

249
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,909
is and now it's just across don't keep
rotating

250
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:38,919
rotating
 

251
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:43,589
rotating
your okay again yes he's making a circle

252
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
your okay again yes he's making a circle
 

253
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,070
your okay again yes he's making a circle
but I don't paint a circle okay one more

254
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,080
but I don't paint a circle okay one more
 

255
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,029
but I don't paint a circle okay one more
time turn there it is now I go straight

256
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:54,039
time turn there it is now I go straight
 

257
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:58,629
time turn there it is now I go straight
across okay try it again this y hand

258
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
across okay try it again this y hand
 

259
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,830
across okay try it again this y hand
that I did

260
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
that I did
 

261
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,950
that I did
that's so I can get this transference

262
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
that's so I can get this transference
 

263
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,469
that's so I can get this transference
right here on the upper arm okay that's

264
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
right here on the upper arm okay that's
 

265
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,909
right here on the upper arm okay that's
when I give it after I have

266
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
when I give it after I have
 

267
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,430
when I give it after I have
it

268
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
it
 

269
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,830
it
don't leave it back

270
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840

 

271
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,029

there there see

272
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:20,039

see so come camera go to the back if you

276
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,000
see so come camera go to the back if you
 

277
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,149
see so come camera go to the back if you
can get

278
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:31,159
can get
 

279
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:35,190
can get
him without putting that hammer lock on

280
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
him without putting that hammer lock on
 

281
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,949

better got it but you'll never get it by

282
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
better got it but you'll never get it by
 

283
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,949
better got it but you'll never get it by
trying to keep the hand in front of you

284
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
trying to keep the hand in front of you
 

285
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,990
trying to keep the hand in front of you
cuz he would just keep going around

286
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
cuz he would just keep going around
 

287
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,190
cuz he would just keep going around
you he wouldn't get the thing okay so

288
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,200
you he wouldn't get the thing okay so
 

289
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,790
you he wouldn't get the thing okay so
remember your whole goal is to trade the

290
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:51,800
remember your whole goal is to trade the
 

291
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,790
remember your whole goal is to trade the
iian contact point and once you have it

292
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:55,800
iian contact point and once you have it
 

293
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,710
iian contact point and once you have it
then F this then then you can take it

294
00:08:59,710 --> 00:08:59,720
then F this then then you can take it
 

295
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,630
then F this then then you can take it
back okay so up pull HP then you can

296
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
back okay so up pull HP then you can
 

297
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,230
back okay so up pull HP then you can
take it back okay so don't F

298
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
take it back okay so don't F
 

299

K okay so people go here and they don't
 

315
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,269
K okay so people go here and they don't
have contact you see and then when they

316
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:42,279
have contact you see and then when they
 

317
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,150
have contact you see and then when they
bring the hand up now they get

318
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,160
bring the hand up now they get
 

319
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,110
bring the hand up now they get
contact okay that's not

320
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,120
contact okay that's not
 

321
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,430
contact okay that's not
correct so you bring him to that upper

322
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
correct so you bring him to that upper
 

323
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,949
correct so you bring him to that upper
arm you you already have

324
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:53,959
arm you you already have
 

325
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,269
arm you you already have
contact and it's the upper arm that

326
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:56,279
contact and it's the upper arm that
 

327
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,190
contact and it's the upper arm that
brings him around with the adhesion okay

328
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
brings him around with the adhesion okay
 

329
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,710
brings him around with the adhesion okay

around you're here okay you need to have
 

343
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,829
around you're here okay you need to have
adhesion there got

344
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:26,839
adhesion there got
 

345
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,829
adhesion there got
it you can't have

346
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
it you can't have
 

347
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,630
it you can't have
Bo that's when you no that's not going

348
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
Bo that's when you no that's not going
 

349

to work
 

351
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,870
to work
okay so you're going to wrap him around

352
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:37,880
okay so you're going to wrap him around
 

353
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,910
okay so you're going to wrap him around
till you get there oh that's what I have

354
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:40,920
till you get there oh that's what I have
 

355
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,150
till you get there oh that's what I have
that's what I want to feel okay and

356
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,160
that's what I want to feel okay and
 

357
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,670
that's what I want to feel okay and
again hi can like all everything you

358
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
again hi can like all everything you
 

359
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,350
again hi can like all everything you
still get the technique do you guys

360
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,360
still get the technique do you guys
 

361
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,269
still get the technique do you guys
understand so

362
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:50,279
understand so
 

363
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,829
understand so
again the the incommon the wrong

364
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
again the the incommon the wrong
 

365
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,550
again the the incommon the wrong
assumption is that you're like oh I do

366
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
assumption is that you're like oh I do
 

367
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,310

have contact no no no no

368
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
have contact no no no no
 

369
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,910
have contact no no no no
here's where he needs to be not out

370
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:02,920
here's where he needs to be not out
 

371
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,310
here's where he needs to be not out
there and then you move to him you have

372
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:05,320
there and then you move to him you have
 

373
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,190
there and then you move to him you have
to bring him into you boom and now this

374
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:08,200
to bring him into you boom and now this
 

375
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,829
to bring him into you boom and now this
goes up okay all right try it again okay

376
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
goes up okay all right try it again okay
 

377
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,990
goes up okay all right try it again okay
my my people are having this mistake

378
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
my my people are having this mistake
 

379
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,750
my my people are having this mistake
Kristen gets it a lot of the times but

380
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
Kristen gets it a lot of the times but
 

381
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,430
Kristen gets it a lot of the times but
everyone else is doing goofy stuff so I

382
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:20,440
everyone else is doing goofy stuff so I
 

383
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,150
everyone else is doing goofy stuff so I
imagine anyone that's going to try this

384
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
imagine anyone that's going to try this
 

385
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,870
imagine anyone that's going to try this
technique is going to leave this part

386
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:23,880
technique is going to leave this part
 

387
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,870
technique is going to leave this part
out okay and what they do instead is

388
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
out okay and what they do instead is
 

389
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,509
out okay and what they do instead is
they're not paying attention to the last

390
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:28,519
they're not paying attention to the last
 

391
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,350
they're not paying attention to the last
part they just come here and go like

392
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:30,360
part they just come here and go like
 

393
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,829
part they just come here and go like
that see what that does is it keeps him

394
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
that see what that does is it keeps him
 

395
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,190
that see what that does is it keeps him
moving on the same Circle so I can't cut

396
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:36,200
moving on the same Circle so I can't cut
 

397
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,670
moving on the same Circle so I can't cut
across it so I won't have the x pattern

398
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:38,680
across it so I won't have the x pattern
 

399
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,350
across it so I won't have the x pattern
so I can't deconstruct the base from

400
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
so I can't deconstruct the base from
 

401
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,350
so I can't deconstruct the base from
this relationship to a line of gravity

402
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
this relationship to a line of gravity
 

403
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,350
this relationship to a line of gravity
so I don't really have a falling

404
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
so I don't really have a falling
 

405
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,870
so I don't really have a falling
geometry I have a need for a

406
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:47,880
geometry I have a need for a
 

407
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,790
geometry I have a need for a
choreography okay

408
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
choreography okay
 

409
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,470
choreography okay
so what happens is they're like well

410
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:53,480
so what happens is they're like well
 

411
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,269
so what happens is they're like well
here's where the technique should have

412
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
here's where the technique should have
 

413
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,509
here's where the technique should have
happened you see should have happened

414
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:58,519
happened you see should have happened
 

415
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,590
happened you see should have happened
here so now they go like that no you

416
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
here so now they go like that no you
 

417
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,470
here so now they go like that no you
have to understand what you're doing on

418
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:03,480
have to understand what you're doing on
 

419
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,350
have to understand what you're doing on
this part and how you're doing it okay

420
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:06,360
this part and how you're doing it okay
 

421
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,790
this part and how you're doing it okay
so I have one contact point I have

422
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:09,800
so I have one contact point I have
 

423
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,990
so I have one contact point I have
another contact Point okay and I will

424
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,000
another contact Point okay and I will
 

425
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,590
another contact Point okay and I will
use the two together to move his body so

426
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
use the two together to move his body so
 

427
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,350
use the two together to move his body so
it's not that I'm getting out of the way

428
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:20,360
it's not that I'm getting out of the way
 

429
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,470
it's not that I'm getting out of the way
I see where his head is and I know where

430
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,480
I see where his head is and I know where
 

431
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,030
I see where his head is and I know where
it needs to be okay so I'm going to

432
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,040
it needs to be okay so I'm going to
 

433
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,430
it needs to be okay so I'm going to
connect to his Center you see

434
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
connect to his Center you see
 

435
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,430
connect to his Center you see
I'm moving him it's not that I'm in here

436
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:32,440
I'm moving him it's not that I'm in here
 

437
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,509
I'm moving him it's not that I'm in here
and I move him me okay I am moving but

438
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:36,519
and I move him me okay I am moving but
 

439
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,269
and I move him me okay I am moving but
he is moving with my movement you see

440
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:40,279
he is moving with my movement you see
 

441
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,069
he is moving with my movement you see
now all I have to do here is one more

442
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:43,079
now all I have to do here is one more
 

443
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,470
now all I have to do here is one more
turn where I leave him where I'm putting

444
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:45,480
turn where I leave him where I'm putting
 

445
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,829
turn where I leave him where I'm putting
him or I turn it a rate faster and there

446
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:48,839
him or I turn it a rate faster and there
 

447
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,590
him or I turn it a rate faster and there
it is right there then it's right

448
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:52,600
it is right there then it's right
 

449
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,189
it is right there then it's right
there so

450
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:55,199
there so
 

451
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:59,590
there so
move with him there it is

452
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
move with him there it is
 

453
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,910
move with him there it is
and he he could feel it it's pretty

454
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
and he he could feel it it's pretty
 

455
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,550
and he he could feel it it's pretty
tight into me okay as opposed to here

456
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:06,560
tight into me okay as opposed to here
 

457
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,069
tight into me okay as opposed to here
and then you're now just pushing him

458
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
and then you're now just pushing him
 

459
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,870
and then you're now just pushing him
ahead of you on the circle so your goal

460
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
ahead of you on the circle so your goal
 

461
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,030
ahead of you on the circle so your goal
here is to turn him boom there it is

462
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,040
here is to turn him boom there it is
 

463
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,150
here is to turn him boom there it is
right there and just like regular

464
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,160
right there and just like regular
 

465
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,590
right there and just like regular
kall when you come here and you bring

466
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
kall when you come here and you bring
 

467
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,310
kall when you come here and you bring
him in you can do the throw without your

468
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
him in you can do the throw without your
 

469
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,310
him in you can do the throw without your
hand ever going here

470
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:29,320
hand ever going here
 

471
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,269
hand ever going here
right he's going that way the same thing

472
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:32,279
right he's going that way the same thing
 

473
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,750
right he's going that way the same thing
here I come is tight and it's the same

474
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
here I come is tight and it's the same
 

475
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,430
here I come is tight and it's the same
thing you're just come out with your

476
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:38,440
thing you're just come out with your
 

477
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,350
thing you're just come out with your
spiral got it now have one turn around

478
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,360
spiral got it now have one turn around
 

479
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,710
spiral got it now have one turn around
so you feel it it's tight tight tight

480
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
so you feel it it's tight tight tight
 

481
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,829
so you feel it it's tight tight tight
then up then in
