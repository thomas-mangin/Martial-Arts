00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:11,620

 

263
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,550

so watch just watch my spine and watch

264
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:15,560
so watch just watch my spine and watch
 

265
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,840

starting to rotate move move what I'm

268
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,230
starting to rotate move move what I'm
 

269
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:57,300
starting to rotate move move what I'm
doing is I'm saying that is easy up now

you're not gonna go like this you see

276
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:41,519
you're not gonna go like this you see
 

277
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,980
you're not gonna go like this you see
your mouth here

278
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:42,990
your mouth here
 

279
00:15:42,990 --> 00:16:08,890
