1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,110

all right this is a center sensitivity

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:04,120
all right this is a center sensitivity
 

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,909
all right this is a center sensitivity
drill okay and so a lot of times you

4
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:06,919
drill okay and so a lot of times you
 

5
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,549
drill okay and so a lot of times you
know

6
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:08,559
know
 

7
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,230
know
you it's like we pull on the arm and

8
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:11,240
you it's like we pull on the arm and
 

9
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,709
you it's like we pull on the arm and
then eventually it pulls on the center

10
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
then eventually it pulls on the center
 

11
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,470
then eventually it pulls on the center
you guys see that so I I'm going to pull

12
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:17,480
you guys see that so I I'm going to pull
 

13
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,630
you guys see that so I I'm going to pull
on the arm and now you can feel that I

14
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:21,640
on the arm and now you can feel that I
 

15
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,070
on the arm and now you can feel that I
have kind of that you see and then

16
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080
have kind of that you see and then
 

17
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,470
have kind of that you see and then
eventually I start to pull it outside

18
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:27,480
eventually I start to pull it outside
 

19
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,470
eventually I start to pull it outside
and then eventually it pulls down you

20
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:29,480
and then eventually it pulls down you
 

21
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,389
and then eventually it pulls down you
see that that's not that's not it okay

22
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:33,399
see that that's not that's not it okay
 

23
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,150
see that that's not that's not it okay
so at the moment of contact is what you

24
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,160
so at the moment of contact is what you
 

25
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,790
so at the moment of contact is what you
want to feel so I don't have to do

26
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:39,800
want to feel so I don't have to do
 

27
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,670

anything with this position you see this
 

29
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,630
anything with this position you see this
this

30
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
this
 

31
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,189
this
position uh if you want to project I

32
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:47,199
position uh if you want to project I
 

33
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:50,830
position uh if you want to project I
just have to increase the Y value

34
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:50,840
just have to increase the Y value
 

35
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,950
just have to increase the Y value
okay so again just fine I'll find it w

36
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
okay so again just fine I'll find it w
 

37
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,510
okay so again just fine I'll find it w
okay and then you from from here you

38
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
okay and then you from from here you
 

39
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,189
okay and then you from from here you
kind you can just start moving that

40
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
kind you can just start moving that
 

41
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,150

your hand is doing so you're like oh I

110
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
your hand is doing so you're like oh I
 

111
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,949
your hand is doing so you're like oh I
think you got to turn the hand you can

112
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
think you got to turn the hand you can
 

113
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,949
think you got to turn the hand you can
turn the hand over no you're just going

114
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
turn the hand over no you're just going
 

115
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:55,190
turn the hand over no you're just going
to figure out how to do this

116
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200

 

117
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,550

okay okay got it all right let's try so

118
00:02:59,550 --> 00:02:59,560
okay okay got it all right let's try so
 

119
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,630
okay okay got it all right let's try so
every is different it doesn't M it

120
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:01,640
every is different it doesn't M it
 

121
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,430
every is different it doesn't M it
doesn't matter just like the contact

122
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
doesn't matter just like the contact
 

123
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,589
doesn't matter just like the contact
point doesn't matter okay so for for

124
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:06,599
point doesn't matter okay so for for
 

125
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,350
point doesn't matter okay so for for
example uh so here here I have you can

126
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:10,360
example uh so here here I have you can
 

127
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,990
example uh so here here I have you can
feel that right but as I try to start

128
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,000
feel that right but as I try to start
 

129
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,869
feel that right but as I try to start
turning it do you see how he turned his

130
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
turning it do you see how he turned his
 

131
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,550
turning it do you see how he turned his
hips you see that so he he felt we

132
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
hips you see that so he he felt we
 

133
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,229
hips you see that so he he felt we
demonstrate it again so I'm going to do

134
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
demonstrate it again so I'm going to do
 

135
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,990
demonstrate it again so I'm going to do
the thing so he feels my center and he

136
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,000
the thing so he feels my center and he
 

137
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,190
the thing so he feels my center and he
feels me start to take balance and he's

138
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
feels me start to take balance and he's
 

139
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,429
feels me start to take balance and he's
absorbing the energy do you see okay

140
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:30,439
absorbing the energy do you see okay
 

141
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,869
absorbing the energy do you see okay
I didn't want him to do that but it

142
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:31,879
I didn't want him to do that but it
 

143
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,710
I didn't want him to do that but it
doesn't matter so I got to figure out so

144
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
doesn't matter so I got to figure out so
 

145
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,470
doesn't matter so I got to figure out so
I go I go that way okay but I still have

146
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:37,480
I go I go that way okay but I still have
 

147
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,270
I go I go that way okay but I still have
that Center you see okay now if I start

148
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,280
that Center you see okay now if I start
 

149
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,309
that Center you see okay now if I start
pushing again he's going backwards do

150
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:43,319
pushing again he's going backwards do
 

151
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,110
pushing again he's going backwards do
you see do you see that okay so I know

152
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,120
you see do you see that okay so I know
 

153
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,830
you see do you see that okay so I know
that's not going to do what I

154
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
that's not going to do what I
 

155
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,910
that's not going to do what I
want look I come

156
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
want look I come
 

157
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,630
want look I come
forward see then

158
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:53,640
forward see then
 

159
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,229
forward see then
now okay it's not ideal I wish you

160
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:57,239
now okay it's not ideal I wish you
 

161
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,509
now okay it's not ideal I wish you
wouldn't do that cuz he's countering but

162
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
wouldn't do that cuz he's countering but
 

163
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,869
wouldn't do that cuz he's countering but
that makes better training because

164
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:01,879
that makes better training because
 

165
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,830
that makes better training because
because the center will be dynamic like

166
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
because the center will be dynamic like
 

167
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,229
because the center will be dynamic like
that you get what I'm saying so um your

168
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
that you get what I'm saying so um your
 

169
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,149
that you get what I'm saying so um your
question of like what is UK doing if he

170
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:11,159
question of like what is UK doing if he
 

171
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,069
question of like what is UK doing if he
does that I'm still going to do it get

172
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:14,079
does that I'm still going to do it get
 

173
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,189
does that I'm still going to do it get
it but what UK is not

174
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:16,199
it but what UK is not
 

175
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,390
it but what UK is not
doing is he goes and I just lock up do

176
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:21,400
doing is he goes and I just lock up do
 

177
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,189
doing is he goes and I just lock up do
you see I I just because I

178
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
you see I I just because I
 

179
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,550
you see I I just because I
am the the connection

180
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
am the the connection
 

181
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,629
am the the connection
point and and then the metric by which

182
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:31,639
point and and then the metric by which
 

183
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,189
point and and then the metric by which
he gains his

184
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
he gains his
 

185
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,510
he gains his
sensitivity right I actually don't do

186
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
sensitivity right I actually don't do
 

187
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,790
sensitivity right I actually don't do
that if I start doing some weird thing

188
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:37,800
that if I start doing some weird thing
 

189
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,189
that if I start doing some weird thing
myself okay but he has to get that okay

190
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:42,199
myself okay but he has to get that okay

00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:42,879
going to take you down okay um but
 

321
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,110
going to take you down okay um but
you're like trying to do a technique you

322
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
you're like trying to do a technique you
 

323
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,390
you're like trying to do a technique you
see and you get some leverage on here

324
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:49,400
see and you get some leverage on here
 

325
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,950
see and you get some leverage on here
and then but you're really just pulling

326
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960
and then but you're really just pulling
 

327
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,230
and then but you're really just pulling
all the skin you see okay so remember I

328
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,240
all the skin you see okay so remember I
 

329
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,390
all the skin you see okay so remember I
did one

330
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
did one
 

331
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,830
did one
rep do you guys remember I did one rep

332
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
rep do you guys remember I did one rep
 

333
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,790
rep do you guys remember I did one rep
without having to do a mechanical so

334
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
without having to do a mechanical so
 

335
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,550
without having to do a mechanical so
we're here like that and I'm in already

336
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:05,560
we're here like that and I'm in already
 

337
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,270
we're here like that and I'm in already
okay you see and I don't need to do

338
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,280
okay you see and I don't need to do
 

339
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,629
okay you see and I don't need to do
anything with my hand with my arm or

340
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:11,639
anything with my hand with my arm or
 

341
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,149
anything with my hand with my arm or
your arm okay so here we'll do like that

342
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:15,159
your arm okay so here we'll do like that
 

343
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,309
your arm okay so here we'll do like that
you see no I'm not in yet okay there we

344
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:19,319
you see no I'm not in yet okay there we
 

345
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,230
you see no I'm not in yet okay there we
go okay and now I just keep adjusting

346
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
go okay and now I just keep adjusting
 

347
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,629
go okay and now I just keep adjusting
this thing you see okay and you're going

348
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:27,639
this thing you see okay and you're going
 

349
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,990
this thing you see okay and you're going
to eventually move and I don't go

350
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
to eventually move and I don't go
 

351
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,389
to eventually move and I don't go
oh now I have the ledge I want okay so I

352
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
oh now I have the ledge I want okay so I
 

353
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,230
oh now I have the ledge I want okay so I
didn't make the ledge and then push the

354
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,240
didn't make the ledge and then push the
 

355
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,870
didn't make the ledge and then push the
ledge okay the ledge happened because

356
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:41,880
ledge okay the ledge happened because
 

357
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,230
ledge okay the ledge happened because
we're move you're moving you see that

358
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
we're move you're moving you see that
 

359
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,350
we're move you're moving you see that
your arm is doing that thing okay and

360
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:46,360
your arm is doing that thing okay and
 

361
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,070
your arm is doing that thing okay and
then I keep in that Center so I'm not

362
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
then I keep in that Center so I'm not
 

363
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,230
then I keep in that Center so I'm not
going to tell you okay so pull in same

364
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
going to tell you okay so pull in same
 

365
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,550
going to tell you okay so pull in same
thing do you see you could go this way

366
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
thing do you see you could go this way
 

367
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,910
thing do you see you could go this way
you see you could go this way it's not

368
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
you see you could go this way it's not
 

369
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,030
you see you could go this way it's not
that I turn your arm I just I have you

370
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,040
that I turn your arm I just I have you
 

371
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,910
that I turn your arm I just I have you
here and I move that you see okay so

372
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:04,920
here and I move that you see okay so
 

373
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,790
here and I move that you see okay so
find that instead of finding this ledge

374
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
find that instead of finding this ledge
 

375
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,910
find that instead of finding this ledge
that you could now do Zoom what you

376
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:10,920
that you could now do Zoom what you
 

377
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,590
that you could now do Zoom what you
think isum okay all right again if

378
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:14,600
think isum okay all right again if
 

379
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,310
think isum okay all right again if
you're if you're just doing the the

380
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
you're if you're just doing the the
 

381
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,630
you're if you're just doing the the
center connection that that's that was

382
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
center connection that that's that was
 

383
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,350
center connection that that's that was
it that's it okay um but what we're

384
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:22,360
it that's it okay um but what we're
 

385
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,509
it that's it okay um but what we're
doing with the fall is as he falls the

386
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
doing with the fall is as he falls the
 

387
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,470
doing with the fall is as he falls the
center connection has to change you see

388
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
center connection has to change you see
 

389
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,670
center connection has to change you see
because it's changing okay and then you

390
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
because it's changing okay and then you
 

391
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,509
because it's changing okay and then you
have to not smell the skin suit pull

392
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
have to not smell the skin suit pull
 

393
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,790
have to not smell the skin suit pull
okay you want to keep the center

394
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
okay you want to keep the center
 

395
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,750
okay you want to keep the center
connection you guys thought that's why

396
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:38,760
connection you guys thought that's why
 

397
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,430
connection you guys thought that's why
we task ourselves with the fall when you

398
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
we task ourselves with the fall when you
 

399
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,870
we task ourselves with the fall when you
when you look at the fall as you control

400
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:43,880
when you look at the fall as you control
 

401
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,590
when you look at the fall as you control
the

402
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:44,600
the
 

403
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,630
the
center right we know that his lower Tom

404
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
center right we know that his lower Tom
 

405
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,230
center right we know that his lower Tom
Den is

406
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
Den is
 

407
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,910
Den is
also um I don't know the word is

408
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:52,920
also um I don't know the word is
 

409
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,069
also um I don't know the word is
skipping my mind right now but I think

410
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:55,079
skipping my mind right now but I think
 

411
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:57,670
skipping my mind right now but I think
it's congruent it's congruent with his

412
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
it's congruent it's congruent with his
 

413
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,949
it's congruent it's congruent with his
center of gravity got it uh in this case

414
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:01,959
center of gravity got it uh in this case
 

415
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,910
center of gravity got it uh in this case
due to how where he's standing how he's

416
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
due to how where he's standing how he's
 

417
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,389
due to how where he's standing how he's
standing and that means his line of

418
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
standing and that means his line of
 

419
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,069
standing and that means his line of
gravity got it is in a particular place

420
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
gravity got it is in a particular place
 

421
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,990
gravity got it is in a particular place
so as I move his Center a particular way

422
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
so as I move his Center a particular way
 

423
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,030
so as I move his Center a particular way
I in order to stay up with it I'm going

424
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
I in order to stay up with it I'm going
 

425
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,910
I in order to stay up with it I'm going
to make that Center gravity as I

426
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
to make that Center gravity as I
 

427
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,150
to make that Center gravity as I
manipulate the lower tonden the center

428
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
manipulate the lower tonden the center
 

429
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,630
manipulate the lower tonden the center
gravity is now moving in the sagittal

430
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:25,640
gravity is now moving in the sagittal
 

431
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,310
gravity is now moving in the sagittal
plane that means his line of gravity is

432
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
plane that means his line of gravity is
 

433
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,470
plane that means his line of gravity is
moving right in the sagittal plane on

434
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:31,480
moving right in the sagittal plane on
 

435
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,190
moving right in the sagittal plane on
the mat and I keep putting it outside

436
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,200
the mat and I keep putting it outside
 

437
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,190
the mat and I keep putting it outside
his Bas of support just ever so slightly

438
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
his Bas of support just ever so slightly
 

439
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,389
his Bas of support just ever so slightly
and that's what makes the fall and now

440
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:39,399
and that's what makes the fall and now
 

441
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,030
and that's what makes the fall and now
allows for a dynamic Center connection

442
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,040
allows for a dynamic Center connection
 

443
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,629
allows for a dynamic Center connection
okay so if we if we are doing for

444
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:45,639
okay so if we if we are doing for
 

445
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,069
okay so if we if we are doing for
example edag you can see I I I you can

446
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:49,079
example edag you can see I I I you can
 

447
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,389
example edag you can see I I I you can
feel that right and I do the same thing

448
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:51,399
feel that right and I do the same thing
 

449
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,190
feel that right and I do the same thing
it's all the same it's the same like

450
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:54,200
it's all the same it's the same like
 

451
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,310
it's all the same it's the same like
moving his center around you see okay

452
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:57,320
moving his center around you see okay
 

453
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,310
moving his center around you see okay
and now I still from here I move this

454
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
and now I still from here I move this
 

455
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,269
and now I still from here I move this
Center and just crush

456
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:04,279

 

457
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:07,269

it I'm not crushing the guy that's

458
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
it I'm not crushing the guy that's
 

459
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,829
it I'm not crushing the guy that's
standing straight up and just ever so

460
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
standing straight up and just ever so
 

461
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,310
standing straight up and just ever so
slightly pushing the lower tanden

462
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:15,320
slightly pushing the lower tanden
 

463
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,069
slightly pushing the lower tanden
down in a place where the center of

464
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:18,079
down in a place where the center of
 

465
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,990
down in a place where the center of
gravity and the line is is outside his

466
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,000
gravity and the line is is outside his
 

467
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,750
gravity and the line is is outside his
Bas of support so the line of gravity is

468
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:22,760
Bas of support so the line of gravity is
 

469
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,069
Bas of support so the line of gravity is
outside the Bas this support you got it

470
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
outside the Bas this support you got it
 

471
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,230
outside the Bas this support you got it
and so I'm not going like

472
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
and so I'm not going like
 

473
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,629
and so I'm not going like
this

474
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:30,639
this
 

475
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,829
this
see that's different okay you you have

476
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
see that's different okay you you have
 

477
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,269
see that's different okay you you have
