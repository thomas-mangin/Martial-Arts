00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,150

all right so we'll go over the opening

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,160
all right so we'll go over the opening
 

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,230
all right so we'll go over the opening
onot okay

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
onot okay
 

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,430
onot okay
um let's get

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,440
um let's get
 

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,549
um let's get
some uh let's say this the energetic and

8
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:15,559
some uh let's say this the energetic and
 

9
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,710
some uh let's say this the energetic and
the spiritual aspects of the art are not

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:19,720
the spiritual aspects of the art are not
 

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,070
the spiritual aspects of the art are not
going to

12
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,080
going to
 

13
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,470
going to
violate the physical aspects of the art

14
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
violate the physical aspects of the art
 

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,470
violate the physical aspects of the art
and the physical aspects thereby will

16
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:27,480
and the physical aspects thereby will
 

17
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,029
and the physical aspects thereby will
not violate Material Science that

18
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:30,039
not violate Material Science that
 

19
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,069
not violate Material Science that
they're not going to okay if you you

20
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
they're not going to okay if you you
 

21
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,869
they're not going to okay if you you
Mystics out there are you more

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,950
required as a prerequisite in reasoning
for that possibility is

36
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960
for that possibility is
 

37
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,389
for that possibility is
not antithetical to reasoning it it is

38
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
not antithetical to reasoning it it is
 

39
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,750
not antithetical to reasoning it it is
the ultimate reasoning

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
the ultimate reasoning
 

41
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,270
the ultimate reasoning
okay all right so we're going to look at

42
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
okay all right so we're going to look at
 

43
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,789
okay all right so we're going to look at
this at the physical level but we are

44
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
this at the physical level but we are
 

45
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,350
this at the physical level but we are
wanting to understand that if we have a

46
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:14,360
wanting to understand that if we have a
 

47
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,990
wanting to understand that if we have a
sound physical level to this technique

48
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
sound physical level to this technique
 

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,950
sound physical level to this technique
then and only then will we have a sound

50
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:21,960
then and only then will we have a sound
 

51
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,550
then and only then will we have a sound
energetic aspect and thereby a sound

52
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:25,560
energetic aspect and thereby a sound
 

53
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,870
energetic aspect and thereby a sound
spiritual aspect to it

54
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:27,880
spiritual aspect to it
 

55
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,670
spiritual aspect to it
okay so um um to remember what our

56
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
okay so um um to remember what our
 

57
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,910
okay so um um to remember what our
spiritual component is it's a

58
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
spiritual component is it's a
 

59
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,990
spiritual component is it's a
Reconciliation of dichotomy okay um

60
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,000
Reconciliation of dichotomy okay um
 

61
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,030
Reconciliation of dichotomy okay um
which we simplify because of all else

62
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,040
which we simplify because of all else
 

63
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,990
which we simplify because of all else
that is noted when we talk about the

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
that is noted when we talk about the

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,749
that is noted when we talk about the
energetic component or the physical

dichotomy by referring to the
 

73
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,550
dichotomy by referring to the
reconciliation of two types of

00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
reconciliation of two types of
 

75
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,590
reconciliation of two types of
experience of the world or two types of

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
experience of the world or two types of
 

77
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,469
experience of the world or two types of
mind okay all we want to take out of

78
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:05,479
mind okay all we want to take out of
 

79
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,630
mind okay all we want to take out of
that is we're looking for reconciliation

80
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
that is we're looking for reconciliation
 

81
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,350
that is we're looking for reconciliation
of

82
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:10,360
of
 

83
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,070
of
dichotomy in Silk Road cultures the way

84
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
dichotomy in Silk Road cultures the way
 

85
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,550
dichotomy in Silk Road cultures the way
that dichotomy is

86
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:17,560
that dichotomy is
 

87
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,910
that dichotomy is
reconciled is in a spiraling rotation or

88
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:22,920
reconciled is in a spiraling rotation or
 

89
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,350
reconciled is in a spiraling rotation or
as we say here a spiral rotating cross

90
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:28,360
as we say here a spiral rotating cross
 

91
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,110
as we say here a spiral rotating cross
and this is the only way that you'll

92
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
and this is the only way that you'll
 

93
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,470
and this is the only way that you'll
reconcile those two minds those two

94
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:33,480
reconcile those two minds those two
 

95
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,750
reconcile those two minds those two
experiences of the world this is the

96
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
experiences of the world this is the
 

97
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,390
experiences of the world this is the
only way you'll reconcile yin and

98
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
only way you'll reconcile yin and
 

99
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,350
only way you'll reconcile yin and
yang Yin and yangong

100
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360

Chi K and II it's the only way you can

102
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:44,599
Chi K and II it's the only way you can
 

103
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,509
Chi K and II it's the only way you can
do it and when you are uh sound in your

104
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
do it and when you are uh sound in your
 

105
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,550
do it and when you are uh sound in your
thinking or your reason at the spiritual

106
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:51,560
thinking or your reason at the spiritual
 

107
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,110
thinking or your reason at the spiritual
level and at the energetic level it must

108
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
level and at the energetic level it must
 

109
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,710
level and at the energetic level it must
be reflected in your physical level so

110
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:57,720
be reflected in your physical level so
 

111
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,750
be reflected in your physical level so
if the only way I can do this is with a

112
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
if the only way I can do this is with a

121
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:23,070

to I can't be uh for example going one

122
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,080

 

123
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,789

way I pull one way and then I push back

00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:27,799
way I pull one way and then I push back
 

125
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,630
way I pull one way and then I push back
that way I can't do that I can't go one

126
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
that way I can't do that I can't go one
 

127
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,309
that way I can't do that I can't go one
way push back and do

128
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:35,319
way push back and do
 

129
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:38,589
way push back and do
zigzags that's not going to

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
okay so we want to note
 

157
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,670
okay so we want to note
that we don't want want these zigzagging

158
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:30,680
that we don't want want these zigzagging
 

159
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,590
that we don't want want these zigzagging
reversing angles because they do not

160
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
reversing angles because they do not
 

161
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,710
reversing angles because they do not
function energetically and thereby they

162
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:35,720
function energetically and thereby they
 

163
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,469
function energetically and thereby they
do not function spiritually but also

164
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
do not function spiritually but also
 

165
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,590
do not function spiritually but also
they're not martially sound they don't

166
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:40,600
they're not martially sound they don't
 

167
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,590
they're not martially sound they don't
work

168
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:44,600

 

169
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,430

okay so let's get into the physical and

170
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:48,440
okay so let's get into the physical and
 

171
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,029
okay so let's get into the physical and

00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:15,479
non-c contestation so if I'm the
 

265
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:19,270
non-c contestation so if I'm the
target I don't want to remain the Target

266
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
target I don't want to remain the Target
 

267
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,029
target I don't want to remain the Target
because then they Remain the attacker I

268
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:22,039
because then they Remain the attacker I
 

269
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:23,869
because then they Remain the attacker I
remain in an oppositional relationship

270
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:23,879
remain in an oppositional relationship
 

271
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,390
remain in an oppositional relationship
to them I have a dichotomy and it's not

272
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
to them I have a dichotomy and it's not
 

273
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,710
to them I have a dichotomy and it's not
going

274
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:27,720
going
 

275
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,230
going
away what I want to do instead is not be

00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,240
away what I want to do instead is not be
 

277
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,990
away what I want to do instead is not be
the target so how do you do that don't

278
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
the target so how do you do that don't
 

279
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,909
the target so how do you do that don't
stay where the target was stain move

280
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:38,919
stay where the target was stain move
 

281

that's your angle of
 

287
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,189
that's your angle of
deviation to ensure that you are not

288
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:50,199
deviation to ensure that you are not
 

289
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,270
deviation to ensure that you are not
tracked by the attacker so you as the

00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
tracked by the attacker so you as the
 

291
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,029
tracked by the attacker so you as the
target are not tracked you deflect in

292
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:56,039
target are not tracked you deflect in
 

293
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,710
target are not tracked you deflect in

I deflect to the right I did not
 

303
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,510
I deflect to the right I did not
actually deviate I remain the

actually deviate I remain the
 

305
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,149
actually deviate I remain the
Target and I'll show you that

306
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:18,159

gak I would deviate to my right and I
 

317
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,589
gak I would deviate to my right and I
would also deflect to my right so this

318
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:38,599
would also deflect to my right so this
 

319
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,750
would also deflect to my right so this

so I go this way and then I bring him

324
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:48,279
so I go this way and then I bring him

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,710

see and depending on your UK you got one

328
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
see and depending on your UK you got one
 

329
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,829
see and depending on your UK you got one
or two

330
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
or two
 

331
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,710
or two
reactions so one was the one that you

332
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
reactions so one was the one that you
 

333
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,710
reactions so one was the one that you
did where I kind of keep it out and then

334
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:03,720
did where I kind of keep it out and then
 

335
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,110
did where I kind of keep it out and then
I make you

336
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
I make you
 

337
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,949
I make you
fall and then as you come up we pretty

338
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
fall and then as you come up we pretty
 

339
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:09,990
fall and then as you come up we pretty
much

340
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
much
 

341
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,710
much
Start EO from there okay in my mind

342
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:15,720
Start EO from there okay in my mind
 

343
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,030
Start EO from there okay in my mind
that's not a Keon that's a what if what

344
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
that's not a Keon that's a what if what
 

345
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,230
that's not a Keon that's a what if what
if you did

346
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
if you did
 

347
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,470
if you did
Su the guy kept his grip and got back up

348
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
Su the guy kept his grip and got back up
 

349
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,590
Su the guy kept his grip and got back up
then it would open up EO okay and in

350
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:28,600
then it would open up EO okay and in
 

351
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,790
then it would open up EO okay and in
that way if it's already telling you

352
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
that way if it's already telling you
 

353
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,829
that way if it's already telling you
where EO should start it should start

354
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
where EO should start it should start
 

355
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,670
where EO should start it should start
with

356
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:34,680
with
 

357
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,670
with
energy going past you to the left do do

358
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:38,680
energy going past you to the left do do
 

359
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,030
energy going past you to the left do do
you see that okay all right the other

360
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,040
you see that okay all right the other
 

361
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,870
you see that okay all right the other
option is this person neutralizes the

362
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
option is this person neutralizes the
 

363
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,790
option is this person neutralizes the
weight here and gets under it straight

364
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:47,800
weight here and gets under it straight
 

365
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,550
weight here and gets under it straight
ahead you see so as he

366
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:51,560
ahead you see so as he
 

367
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,269
ahead you see so as he
goes out and he pulls out that way he

368
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
goes out and he pulls out that way he
 

369
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,310
goes out and he pulls out that way he
comes this way okay which which anyone

370
00:09:59,310 --> 00:09:59,320
comes this way okay which which anyone
 

371
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,509
comes this way okay which which anyone
could do because you're moving to your

372
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:02,519
could do because you're moving to your
 

373
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,430
could do because you're moving to your
left and deflecting to your left okay

374
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
left and deflecting to your left okay
 

375
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,350
left and deflecting to your left okay
it's no different than then if you throw

376
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:08,360
it's no different than then if you throw
 

377
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,870
it's no different than then if you throw
a punch and I'm going to deviate to my

378
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:11,880
a punch and I'm going to deviate to my
 

379
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,710
a punch and I'm going to deviate to my
right and deflect to my right then the

380
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:15,720
right and deflect to my right then the
 

381
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,310
right and deflect to my right then the
line of attack is going to stay with me

382
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
line of attack is going to stay with me
 

383
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,230
line of attack is going to stay with me
okay if I go right this hand has to go

384
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
okay if I go right this hand has to go
 

385
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,110
okay if I go right this hand has to go
to the left then it's not tracking me

386
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,120
to the left then it's not tracking me
 

387
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,790
to the left then it's not tracking me
okay so uh and this is this is

388
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:29,800
okay so uh and this is this is
 

389
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,870
okay so uh and this is this is
interesting because in cha Sensei

390
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
interesting because in cha Sensei
 

391
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,190
interesting because in cha Sensei
lineage it wasn't called the what if but

392
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
lineage it wasn't called the what if but
 

393
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,870
lineage it wasn't called the what if but
we're going to call it the what if the

394
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
we're going to call it the what if the
 

395
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,430
we're going to call it the what if the
what if they get up from sum Tosh while

396
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
what if they get up from sum Tosh while
 

397
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,069
what if they get up from sum Tosh while
they're still grabbing you no one really

398
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
they're still grabbing you no one really
 

399
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,069
they're still grabbing you no one really
ever did it for Tachi was they did the

400
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:45,079
ever did it for Tachi was they did the
 

401
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,910
ever did it for Tachi was they did the
first version so the the first version

402
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
first version so the the first version
 

403
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,030
first version so the the first version
he goes out and he deflects that way and

404
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,040
he goes out and he deflects that way and
 

405
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,629
he goes out and he deflects that way and
they stop here they just stop there okay

406
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:55,639
they stop here they just stop there okay
 

407
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,629
they stop here they just stop there okay
they you have to train yourself as a UK

408
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:57,639
they you have to train yourself as a UK
 

409
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,590
they you have to train yourself as a UK
in a way not to

410
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
in a way not to
 

411
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,550
in a way not to
fall into

412
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:01,560
fall into
 

413
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,509
fall into
sumos and also don't crash into me you

414
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
sumos and also don't crash into me you
 

415
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,430
sumos and also don't crash into me you
see so as you go really hard you're

416
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
see so as you go really hard you're
 

417
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,470
see so as you go really hard you're
going really hard oh bad UK all right I

418
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:11,480
going really hard oh bad UK all right I
 

419
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,590
going really hard oh bad UK all right I
have to figure out he goes really hard

420
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
have to figure out he goes really hard
 

421
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,829
have to figure out he goes really hard
and I have to figure out how to stop

422
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:16,839
and I have to figure out how to stop
 

423
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:19,949
and I have to figure out how to stop
where you can see I could still go

424
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:19,959
where you can see I could still go
 

425
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,670
where you can see I could still go
forward because he's not deflecting in

426
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:22,680
forward because he's not deflecting in
 

427
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,190
forward because he's not deflecting in
contrary angle to his angle deviation

428
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
contrary angle to his angle deviation
 

429
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,230
contrary angle to his angle deviation
they're complimentary angles so you're

430
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,240
they're complimentary angles so you're
 

431
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,990
they're complimentary angles so you're
still open to it okay so we don't want

432
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
still open to it okay so we don't want
 

433
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,069
still open to it okay so we don't want
to do that all

434
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:33,079
to do that all
 

435
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:36,269
to do that all
right so if we

436
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:36,279
right so if we
 

437
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,949
right so if we
look at the working what if if I go this

438
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
look at the working what if if I go this
 

439
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,310
look at the working what if if I go this
way and I take you down and just s your

440
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:43,320
way and I take you down and just s your
 

441
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,750
way and I take you down and just s your
touch and as you're coming

442
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:46,760
touch and as you're coming
 

443
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,230
touch and as you're coming
up you can see that my I'm on the right

444
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,240
up you can see that my I'm on the right
 

445
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,949
up you can see that my I'm on the right
and I'm going to deflect to the left you

446
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:53,959
and I'm going to deflect to the left you
 

447
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:56,310
and I'm going to deflect to the left you
see that well we just want to do that

448
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
see that well we just want to do that
 

449
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,750
see that well we just want to do that
from the start okay and the way to do

450
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
from the start okay and the way to do
 

451
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,110
from the start okay and the way to do
that is instead of going this way with

452
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
that is instead of going this way with
 

453
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,150
that is instead of going this way with
your deflection your deflection goes

454
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
your deflection your deflection goes
 

455
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,670
your deflection your deflection goes
this

456
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:08,680

 

457
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,750

way so right on the grab not this

458
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
way so right on the grab not this
 

459
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,430
way so right on the grab not this
way right on the grab I go to the right

460
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
way right on the grab I go to the right
 

461
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,310
way right on the grab I go to the right
my hand and his elbow go to the

462
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:21,320
my hand and his elbow go to the
 

463
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,470
my hand and his elbow go to the
left just like if you threw a punch I

464
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,480
left just like if you threw a punch I
 

465
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,629
left just like if you threw a punch I
move to the right or my parry and blocks

466
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:27,639
move to the right or my parry and blocks
 

467
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,030
move to the right or my parry and blocks
go to the left

468
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,040
go to the left
 

469
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,509
go to the left
here he is I go to the right he goes to

470
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:32,519
here he is I go to the right he goes to
 

471
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,470
here he is I go to the right he goes to
the

472
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:35,480

 

473
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,030

left if we're standing if we're standing

474
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
left if we're standing if we're standing
 

475
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,069
left if we're standing if we're standing
and he does not do the what if but you

476
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:41,079
and he does not do the what if but you
 

477
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:44,030
and he does not do the what if but you
better do the goody K me it don't crash

478
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,040
better do the goody K me it don't crash
 

479
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,750
better do the goody K me it don't crash
into me okay he's at this

480
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
into me okay he's at this
 

481
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,990
into me okay he's at this
angle he's not at that angle and that's

482
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
angle he's not at that angle and that's
 

483
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,150
angle he's not at that angle and that's
why all I can do because all I'm

484
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
why all I can do because all I'm
 

485
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,509
why all I can do because all I'm
controlling is one end of the lever all

486
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
controlling is one end of the lever all
 

487
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,509
controlling is one end of the lever all
I can do is go back back on that same

488
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:00,519
I can do is go back back on that same
 

489
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,590
I can do is go back back on that same
lever which is what you see and this is

490
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
lever which is what you see and this is
 

491
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,110
lever which is what you see and this is
a straight line I move on a straight

492
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,120
a straight line I move on a straight
 

493
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,069
a straight line I move on a straight
line you moved on a straight

494
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:11,079

 

495
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:13,910

line but we don't want a straight line

496
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
line but we don't want a straight line
 

497
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,670
line but we don't want a straight line
so I going start this rotating and now

498
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:16,680
so I going start this rotating and now
 

499
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:23,800
so I going start this rotating and now
he goes that

500
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:23,810

 

501
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,750

505
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,069

so now why do I say that's rotating it

506
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:34,079
so now why do I say that's rotating it
 

507
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,590
so now why do I say that's rotating it
looks like he's kind of going straight

508
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:36,600
looks like he's kind of going straight
 

509
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,069
looks like he's kind of going straight
well he's going around me on the other

510
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
well he's going around me on the other
 

511
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,670
well he's going around me on the other
one he's coming into

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:42,680
one he's coming into
 

513
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,870
one he's coming into
me on this one he's going I'm in the

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:45,880
me on this one he's going I'm in the
 

515
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,870
me on this one he's going I'm in the
middle he's going around me and he's

516
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:48,880
middle he's going around me and he's
 

517
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,670
middle he's going around me and he's
still going around

518
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680

 

519
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,470

so they combine the two you see maybe

they go

they go

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,030
they go
here and it's not quite around

small so here my rear leg did it then my

538
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:25,800
small so here my rear leg did it then my
 

539
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,670

front

00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:36,720
it and the angle of deflection is made
 

545
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,629
it and the angle of deflection is made
smaller but I have to

546
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:39,639
smaller but I have to
 

547
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:42,509
smaller but I have to
generate this spiralis and that means

548
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:42,519
generate this spiralis and that means
 

549
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,430
generate this spiralis and that means
I'm at the center okay that's the way

550
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:44,440
I'm at the center okay that's the way

you generate

552
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:45,720

00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,160

 

555
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,110

right the second mistake that people

556
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,120
right the second mistake that people
 

557
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,509
right the second mistake that people
often make is they don't let the spiral

558
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:56,519
often make is they don't let the spiral
 

559
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,870
often make is they don't let the spiral
get past you they get Ang anxious so

560
00:14:59,870 --> 00:14:59,880
get past you they get Ang anxious so
 

561
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,189
get past you they get Ang anxious so
they go one and they try to turn it and

562
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:04,199
they go one and they try to turn it and
 

563
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:09,230
they go one and they try to turn it and
so we'll do it on the other

doing the second spiral

576

throwing towards eight I step inside and
 

735
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,750
throwing towards eight I step inside and
I bring him around the 10 there's your

736

838
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:14,159
around this joint The Joint not his
 

839
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,710
around this joint The Joint not his
elbow is going to keep

840
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,720
elbow is going to keep
 

841
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,870
elbow is going to keep
tightening as I do no different movement

842
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:19,880
tightening as I do no different movement
 

843
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,230
tightening as I do no different movement
than I than you ever do it's just now on

844
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
than I than you ever do it's just now on
 

845
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,669
than I than you ever do it's just now on
a spiral pattern so as I come

846
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:26,679
a spiral pattern so as I come
 

847
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,389
a spiral pattern so as I come
around

848
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:29,399
around
 

849
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:33,310
around
down as I move around nobody no UK

850
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:33,320
down as I move around nobody no UK
 

851
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,909
down as I move around nobody no UK
should ever let you move around without

852
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:34,919
should ever let you move around without
 

853
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,269
should ever let you move around without
you now having to loosen it okay so as I

854
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:38,279
you now having to loosen it okay so as I
 

855
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,269
you now having to loosen it okay so as I
come around now here's where he'll feel

856
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:40,279
come around now here's where he'll feel
 

857
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,990
come around now here's where he'll feel
it tap when you don't like it like so I

858
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,000
it tap when you don't like it like so I
 

859
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,590
it tap when you don't like it like so I
can't get to here without letting him

860
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:45,600
can't get to here without letting him
 

861
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:54,549
can't get to here without letting him
out I'll try at a different

862
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:54,559

 

863
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:59,269

angle and as I rotate

864
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
angle and as I rotate
 

865
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,990
angle and as I rotate
now this angle as I go back around cuz

866
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,000
now this angle as I go back around cuz
 

867
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,710
now this angle as I go back around cuz
I'm going to spiral it's going to be

868
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
I'm going to spiral it's going to be
 

869
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,430
I'm going to spiral it's going to be
really tight cuz it's already tighten

870
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:06,440
really tight cuz it's already tighten
 

871
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,029
really tight cuz it's already tighten
out like you could already do the top

872
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:08,039
out like you could already do the top
 

873
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,070
out like you could already do the top
from here because I use a spiral to

874
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,080
from here because I use a spiral to
 

875
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,269
from here because I use a spiral to
tighten up all the joint so now as I

876
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:14,279
tighten up all the joint so now as I
 

877
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,510
tighten up all the joint so now as I
move into it I'm never going to get

878
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:18,520
move into it I'm never going to get
 

879
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,830
move into it I'm never going to get
there meaning if I was holding it just

880
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:21,840
there meaning if I was holding it just
 

881
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,870
there meaning if I was holding it just
as tight this is where I break his arm

00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:25,880
as tight this is where I break his arm
 

883
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,110

right because there's no
 

905
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,350
right because there's no
stress the theory is is that I'm going

00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360
stress the theory is is that I'm going
 

907
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,430
stress the theory is is that I'm going
to hold him down and he's going to be

908
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,440
to hold him down and he's going to be
 

909
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,029
to hold him down and he's going to be
pinned but we already know that he can

910
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:06,039
pinned but we already know that he can
 

911
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:08,950
pinned but we already know that he can
do a grany roll from there okay he can

912
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:08,960
do a grany roll from there okay he can
 

913
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,789
do a grany roll from there okay he can
just roll out of that he can slide

914
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:11,799
just roll out of that he can slide
 

915
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:14,310
just roll out of that he can slide
forward and take away the pressure the

916
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,320
forward and take away the pressure the
 

917
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,230
forward and take away the pressure the
vertical pressure point um this is not a

00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:17,240
vertical pressure point um this is not a
 

919
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,950

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:19,960
pin could be a break though it could be

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,750
pin could be a break though it could be
a dislocation if it's done properly on a

a dislocation if it's done properly on a

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,350
a dislocation if it's done properly on a
spiral okay the other thing that I have

924
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,360
spiral okay the other thing that I have
 

925
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,310
spiral okay the other thing that I have
is again

926
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:29,320
is again
 

927
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,070
is again
internally so my tanden is moving one

928
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,080
internally so my tanden is moving one
 

929
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,430
internally so my tanden is moving one
way and as it goes another way it now

930
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:37,440
way and as it goes another way it now
 

931
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,750
way and as it goes another way it now
has to go down so it's going down it's

932
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:40,760
has to go down so it's going down it's
 

933
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,350
has to go down so it's going down it's
coming back up and going back

934
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:44,360
coming back up and going back
 

935
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,710
coming back up and going back
around and now it finishes down over the

936
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:47,720
around and now it finishes down over the
 

937
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,110
around and now it finishes down over the
top and now I do all that going in the

938
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:52,120
top and now I do all that going in the
 

939
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,830
top and now I do all that going in the
other direction in this movement here so

940
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:54,840
other direction in this movement here so
 

941
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,149
other direction in this movement here so
it's going

942
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:56,159
it's going
 

943
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,549
it's going
down I'll loosen it for him is going

944
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:00,559

949
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,190

down on that one last movement none of

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,200
down on that one last movement none of
 

951
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,269
down on that one last movement none of
that is in the other technique that has

00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:15,279
that is in the other technique that has
 

953
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,950
that is in the other technique that has
no angle of cancellation on the
