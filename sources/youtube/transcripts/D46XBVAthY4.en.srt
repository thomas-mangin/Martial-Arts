i'm not hitting him with rotational

98
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
i'm not hitting him with rotational
 

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,430
i'm not hitting him with rotational
torque i'm not doing that okay

100
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
torque i'm not doing that okay
 

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,949
torque i'm not doing that okay
uh i i'll hit him with the settling so

102
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
uh i i'll hit him with the settling so
 

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,589
uh i i'll hit him with the settling so
the settling comes around and i'm going

104
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
the settling comes around and i'm going
 

105
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,869
the settling comes around and i'm going
to home settle do you understand

106
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
to home settle do you understand
 

107
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,309
to home settle do you understand
try to try to do don't sit here and go

108
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
try to try to do don't sit here and go
 

109
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,190
try to try to do don't sit here and go
got it so it's a settling that hit and

110
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
got it so it's a settling that hit and
 

111
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,869
got it so it's a settling that hit and
this isn't how you punch people this

112
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
this isn't how you punch people this
 

113
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,949
this isn't how you punch people this
isn't how i fight this is just

114

isn't how i fight this is just
 

115
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,070
isn't how i fight this is just
i'm going to add his resistance

116
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
i'm going to add his resistance
 

117
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,949
i'm going to add his resistance
to my resistance meaning his

118
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
to my resistance meaning his
 

119
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,589
to my resistance meaning his
gravitational pull to my gravitational

120
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
gravitational pull to my gravitational
 

121
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,390
gravitational pull to my gravitational
pull

122
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
pull
 

123
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,949
pull
so that's what i

124
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
so that's what i
 

125
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,589
so that's what i
coach you project through him

126
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
coach you project through him
 

127
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,830
coach you project through him
not rotational torque okay

128
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
not rotational torque okay
 

129
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:30,150
not rotational torque okay
so i just drop

130
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160

 

131
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,710

okay try okay

132
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
okay try okay
 

133
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,990
okay try okay
so

134
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
so
 

135
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,670
so
you're not punching the circle you're

136
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
you're not punching the circle you're
 

137
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,310
you're not punching the circle you're
not doing like heavy back work okay

138
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
not doing like heavy back work okay
 

139
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,510
not doing like heavy back work okay
you're doing

140
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
you're doing
 

141
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,430
you're doing
uh

142
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
uh
 

143
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,909
uh
you're doing the internal aspects at a

144
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
you're doing the internal aspects at a
 

145
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,030
you're doing the internal aspects at a
ballistic

146
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
ballistic
 

147
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,150
ballistic
pace

148
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
pace
 

149
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,670
pace
okay so if she pushes on me like she's

150
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
okay so if she pushes on me like she's
 

151
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,590
okay so if she pushes on me like she's
pushing on me

152
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
pushing on me
 

153
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,710
pushing on me
that is a fixating case okay so now

154
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
that is a fixating case okay so now
 

155
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,950
that is a fixating case okay so now
we're doing it ballistically okay

156
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
we're doing it ballistically okay
 

157
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,990
we're doing it ballistically okay
so she's the little target for me for

158
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
so she's the little target for me for
 

159
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,950
so she's the little target for me for
your leg square i'm gonna punch you but

160
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
your leg square i'm gonna punch you but
 

161
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,629
your leg square i'm gonna punch you but
it's not a punch

162
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639

so it's not
there's a there's a co-q projection in

200
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
there's a there's a co-q projection in
 

201
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,870
there's a there's a co-q projection in
the middle of it but it's ballistic got

202
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
the middle of it but it's ballistic got

then i have the internal skills i i
actually have more than the initiative

366
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
actually have more than the initiative
 

367
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,389

okay do you get that
 

369
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,389
okay do you get that
uh but let's say i didn't have internal

370
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
uh but let's say i didn't have internal
 

371

so in order to do that i can't do this

428
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:18,560
so in order to do that i can't do this

the internals it allows me to do that
 

437
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,670
the internals it allows me to do that
allows me to she goes and boom i can do

allows me to she goes and boom i can do
you see how energy went back and did you

440
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
you see how energy went back and did you
 

441
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,829
you see how energy went back and did you
feel that energy went back into her and

feel that energy went back into her and
 

443
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,110
feel that energy went back into her and
so she goes

444
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
so she goes
 

445
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,590
so she goes
boom and this is where i can come in

446
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
boom and this is where i can come in
 

447
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,870
boom and this is where i can come in
if i wanted just to attack but here i

so
 

557
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,069
so
here if she did the first yield where

558
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
here if she did the first yield where
 

559
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,150
here if she did the first yield where
you got a lot of distance and external

560
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
you got a lot of distance and external
 

561
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,150
you got a lot of distance and external
yield do you remember yeah there we go

562
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
yield do you remember yeah there we go
 

563
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,870
yield do you remember yeah there we go
full and i have my balance do you see

564
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:24,880
full and i have my balance do you see
 

565
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,069
full and i have my balance do you see
and now we're here do the other one

566
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,079
and now we're here do the other one
 

567
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,990
and now we're here do the other one
i still have my balance

568
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
i still have my balance
 

569
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,270
i still have my balance
you see that

570
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
you see that
 

571
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,029
you see that
so uh go ahead

572
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039

 

573
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,909

where does the kazushi come from

00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
where does the kazushi come from
 

575
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,070
where does the kazushi come from
that's the question okay

576
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080
that's the question okay
 

577
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,510
that's the question okay
so when she comes in it comes from

578
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
so when she comes in it comes from
 

579
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,350
so when she comes in it comes from
non-contestation

580
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:48,360
non-contestation
 

581
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,510
non-contestation
non-contestation okay but not external

non-contestation
 

585
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,390
non-contestation
internal non-contest station so there i

586
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
internal non-contest station so there i
 

587
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,870
internal non-contest station so there i
didn't even move when you saw that it

588

and then
 

603
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,630
and then
try to project there has to be a yield

604
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:22,640
try to project there has to be a yield
 

605
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,669
try to project there has to be a yield
you have to create a yin space okay has

606
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:25,679
you have to create a yin space okay has
 

607
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,870
you have to create a yin space okay has
to be a yin space a in space

608
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:30,880

 

609
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,270

but the in space should be internal

610
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
but the in space should be internal
 

611
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,549
but the in space should be internal
internal

612
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559

 

613
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,990

external

614
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
external
 

615
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,230
external
then a push

616
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240
then a push
 

617
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,510
then a push
internal oh

618
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
internal oh
 

619
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,310
internal oh
you see internal heel space okay

620
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
you see internal heel space okay
 

621
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,590
you see internal heel space okay
all right try it

622
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
all right try it
 

623
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,870
all right try it
okay so now as you do your heels

624
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880

 

625
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,270

uh take them into one of the kazushi

626
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
uh take them into one of the kazushi
 

627
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,669
uh take them into one of the kazushi
patterns so you got a two front inwards

628
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
patterns so you got a two front inwards
 

629
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,470
patterns so you got a two front inwards
and then two rear outwards okay so you

630
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,480
and then two rear outwards okay so you
 

631
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,870
and then two rear outwards okay so you
can't just go here

632
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
can't just go here
 

633
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,630
can't just go here
you go you gotta take him into the

you go you gotta take him into the
 

635
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:15,029
you go you gotta take him into the
kadushi pattern
