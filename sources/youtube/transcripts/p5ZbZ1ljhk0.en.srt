105
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,129
you see I can't touch his wrist okay
so I'd like for you to use

106
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:55,139
so I'd like for you to use
 

107

concept of keema City

108
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:57,780
concept of keema City
 

109
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,830
concept of keema City
the

110
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
the
 

111
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,570
the
physiological index point I can't touch

112
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:02,580
physiological index point I can't touch
 

113
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,010
physiological index point I can't touch
his wrist

114
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:04,020
his wrist
 

115
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,210
his wrist
and therefore my hands go here

116
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,220
and therefore my hands go here
 

117
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,890
and therefore my hands go here
right here

118
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:09,900
right here
 

119
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,150
right here
so the tegatana is on the tricep tendon

120
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
so the tegatana is on the tricep tendon
 

121
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,469
so the tegatana is on the tricep tendon
of insertion

122
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:15,479
of insertion
 

123
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,490
of insertion
on the other hand is just North of it

124
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:19,500
on the other hand is just North of it
 

125
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,189
on the other hand is just North of it
towards the shoulder okay

126
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:22,199
towards the shoulder okay
 

127
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,210
towards the shoulder okay
then his energy is going to come down

128
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:26,220
then his energy is going to come down
 

129
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,070
then his energy is going to come down
now

130
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
now
 

131
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,350
now
when his energy comes down where do you

132
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:30,360
when his energy comes down where do you
 

133
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,310
when his energy comes down where do you
think that goes anyone can answer

134
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320

 

135
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,469

where am I going to take it

136
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
where am I going to take it
 

137
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,510
where am I going to take it
to a rotation nope

138
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:38,520
to a rotation nope
 

139
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,950
to a rotation nope
that's your problem

140
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:39,960
that's your problem
 

141
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,870

I'll project him look look at where we
 

149
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,890
I'll project him look look at where we
are now do you see if the camera comes

150
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:54,900
are now do you see if the camera comes
 

151
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,270
are now do you see if the camera comes
over there

152
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:56,280
over there
 

153
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,990
over there
where do you go

he's off the line and now I can enter
 

157
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,450
he's off the line and now I can enter
here it's ever so it's not an external

158
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:05,460
here it's ever so it's not an external
 

159
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,430
here it's ever so it's not an external
thing it becomes an extra little thing

160
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
thing it becomes an extra little thing
 

161
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,070
thing it becomes an extra little thing
after the projection okay

162
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080

after the projection okay
so I'm going to come around and bring

164
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:12,360
so I'm going to come around and bring
 

165
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,330
so I'm going to come around and bring
the camera back around over to this side

166
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:14,340
the camera back around over to this side
 

167
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,570
the camera back around over to this side
it is his hands coming down I started to

168
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:17,580
it is his hands coming down I started to
 

169
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,129
it is his hands coming down I started to
rotate

170
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:19,139
rotate
 

171
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,490
rotate
this half will come

172
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:22,500
this half will come
 

173
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,790
this half will come
