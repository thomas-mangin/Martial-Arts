00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839

 

361
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,030

okay does everyone sing the pivoting

362
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
okay does everyone sing the pivoting
 

363
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,150
okay does everyone sing the pivoting
and the other uh

364
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
and the other uh
 

365
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,990
and the other uh
alternative

366
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
alternative
 

367
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,870
alternative
was

368
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
was
 

369
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,949
was
uh projecting

370
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959

 

371
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,590

so can you define the difference between

372
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
so can you define the difference between
 

373
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,829
so can you define the difference between
projecting and pivoting and we're

374
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
projecting and pivoting and we're
 

375
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,150
projecting and pivoting and we're
talking about the center right and we're

376
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
talking about the center right and we're
 

377
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,949
talking about the center right and we're
talking about this to uh

378
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
talking about this to uh
 

379
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,190
talking about this to uh
note the difference so that i can begin

380
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
note the difference so that i can begin
 

381
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,750
note the difference so that i can begin
to hunt because if it's not different if

382
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
to hunt because if it's not different if
 

383
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,870
to hunt because if it's not different if
it is what i'm doing there's no hunt

384
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
it is what i'm doing there's no hunt
 

385
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,070
it is what i'm doing there's no hunt
okay

386
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
okay
 

387
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,790
okay
so

388
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
so
 

389
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,350
so
what how would you define

390
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
what how would you define
 

391
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,070
what how would you define
a pivoting of the center versus a

392
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
a pivoting of the center versus a
 

393
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,670
a pivoting of the center versus a
projecting of the center

394
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
projecting of the center
 

395
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,750
projecting of the center
anyone go for it

396
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
anyone go for it
 

397
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,389
anyone go for it
requires so when she comes in

398
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
requires so when she comes in
 

399
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,269
requires so when she comes in
uh it requires a hard surface where his

400
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
uh it requires a hard surface where his
 

401
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,110
uh it requires a hard surface where his
center actually stops moving for a split

402
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
center actually stops moving for a split
 

403
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,310
center actually stops moving for a split
stick and then she's able to pivot off

404
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
stick and then she's able to pivot off
 

405
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,350
stick and then she's able to pivot off
that center incense versus projecting

406
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
that center incense versus projecting
 

407
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,430
that center incense versus projecting
which is the center comes in it's still

408
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
which is the center comes in it's still
 

409
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,350
which is the center comes in it's still
moving and it comes back out and it's

410
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
moving and it comes back out and it's
 

411
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,590
moving and it comes back out and it's
always moving okay how about we use

412
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
always moving okay how about we use
 

413
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,389
always moving okay how about we use
dimensions here

414
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
dimensions here
 

415
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,230
dimensions here
so pivoting

416
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
so pivoting
 

417
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,750
so pivoting
you're only moving

418
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
you're only moving
 

419
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,150
you're only moving
in one plane or in two dimensions

420
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
in one plane or in two dimensions
 

421
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,430
in one plane or in two dimensions
whereas with the projection you're

422
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
whereas with the projection you're
 

423
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,829
whereas with the projection you're
getting all three dimensions of movement

424
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
getting all three dimensions of movement
 

425
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,310
getting all three dimensions of movement
yeah and in particular the sagittal

426
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
yeah and in particular the sagittal
 

427
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,069
yeah and in particular the sagittal
plane

428
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
plane
 

429
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,230
plane
do you get that if if it's not

430
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
do you get that if if it's not
 

431
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,949
do you get that if if it's not
traversing the sagittal plane it's not

432
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
traversing the sagittal plane it's not
 

433
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,110
traversing the sagittal plane it's not
projecting okay so

434
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
projecting okay so
 

435
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,230
projecting okay so
uh

436
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
uh
 

437
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,509
uh
if i if i have a center and i have this

438
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
if i if i have a center and i have this
 

439
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,509
if i if i have a center and i have this
vertical plane here

440
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
vertical plane here
 

441
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,990
vertical plane here
and i am just

442
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
and i am just
 

443
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,670
and i am just
tilting it

444
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
tilting it
 

445
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,030
tilting it
in that plane do you see

446
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
in that plane do you see
 

447
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,509
in that plane do you see
but if i

448
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
but if i
 

449
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,150
but if i
start moving it do you see

450
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
start moving it do you see
 

451
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,350
start moving it do you see
it's not just tilting it

452
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
it's not just tilting it
 

453
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,310
it's not just tilting it
but

454
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320

 

455
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,670

it gets

456
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
it gets
 

457
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,470
it gets
traversing in the sagittal plane do you

458
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
traversing in the sagittal plane do you
 

459
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,030
traversing in the sagittal plane do you
see that so i want you to be if you're

460
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
see that so i want you to be if you're
 

461
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,630
see that so i want you to be if you're
going to hunt

462
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
going to hunt
 

463
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,949
going to hunt
you have to be specific you have to

464
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
you have to be specific you have to
 

465
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,350
you have to be specific you have to
define these things okay

466
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
define these things okay
 

467
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,910
define these things okay
uh if you see something different

468
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
uh if you see something different
 

469
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,470
uh if you see something different
hunting means try to find out what is

470
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
hunting means try to find out what is
 

471
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,590
hunting means try to find out what is
different

472
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
different
 

473
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,550
different
okay

474
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
okay
 

475
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,829
okay
so

476
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
so
 

477
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,710
so
uh

478
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
uh
 

479
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,110
uh
pivoting

480
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
pivoting
 

481
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,710
pivoting
right there's nothing wrong with

482
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
right there's nothing wrong with
 

483
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,310
right there's nothing wrong with
pivoting there's nothing you you can't

484
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
pivoting there's nothing you you can't
 

485
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,430
pivoting there's nothing you you can't
pivot by the same means you see but our

486
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
pivot by the same means you see but our
 

487
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,150
pivot by the same means you see but our
drill is doing something different with

488
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
drill is doing something different with
 

489
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,069
drill is doing something different with
those beans okay so i'm not doing at

490
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
those beans okay so i'm not doing at
 

491
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,030
those beans okay so i'm not doing at
home

492
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
home
 

493
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,790
home
this way i'm doing this

494
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
this way i'm doing this
 

495
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,069
this way i'm doing this
do you see that okay

496
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079

 

497
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,430

um

498
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440

 

499
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,069

and this is gonna tie us back to your

500
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
and this is gonna tie us back to your
 

501
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,150
and this is gonna tie us back to your
your original question okay

502
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160

 

503
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,470

if you pay attention

504
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
if you pay attention
 

505
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,990
if you pay attention
right

506
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
right
 

507
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,870
right
uh

508
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:04,880
uh
 

509
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,430
uh
nothing is happening to him nothing is

510
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
nothing is happening to him nothing is
 

511
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,670
nothing is happening to him nothing is
happening to him nothing is happening to

512
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
happening to him nothing is happening to
 

513
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,310
happening to him nothing is happening to
him nothing is happening to him and now

514
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
him nothing is happening to him and now
 

515
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,389
him nothing is happening to him and now
something's happening too

516
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
something's happening too
 

517
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,829
something's happening too
okay

518
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
okay
 

519
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,269
okay
but he's here

520
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279

 

521
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,269

and something was happening to him

522
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
and something was happening to him
 

523
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,230
and something was happening to him
before my arms went back out dc but it's

524
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
before my arms went back out dc but it's
 

525
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,710
before my arms went back out dc but it's
so smooth and fast

526
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
so smooth and fast
 

527
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,430
so smooth and fast
that it looks like

528
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
that it looks like
 

529
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,910
that it looks like
uh nothing's happening to him nothing's

530
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
uh nothing's happening to him nothing's
 

531
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,829
uh nothing's happening to him nothing's
happening to it nothing's happening to

532
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:33,839
happening to it nothing's happening to
 

533
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,870
happening to it nothing's happening to
him nothing until i start to go out

534

605
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,030
boom there's already a re-per a
percussive energy that way okay you have

606
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
percussive energy that way okay you have
 

607
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,550
percussive energy that way okay you have
to make sure

608
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
to make sure
 

609
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,710

this little beat there i'll just smooth
 

621
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:24,870
this little beat there i'll just smooth
it out

622

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,990
can you tell
down down

712
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
down down
 

713
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,549
down down
do you see down this is the opposite

714
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
do you see down this is the opposite
 

715
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,829
do you see down this is the opposite
okay it's the opposite okay

716
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839
okay it's the opposite okay
 

717
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,669
okay it's the opposite okay
so this way made sense to where you're

718
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679
so this way made sense to where you're
 

719
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,029
so this way made sense to where you're
at now

720
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039

 

721
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,909

how do i go the other way

722
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919
how do i go the other way
 

723
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,630
how do i go the other way
and make them go the other way okay you

724
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
and make them go the other way okay you
 

725
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,310
and make them go the other way okay you
get well that's

726
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
get well that's
 

727
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,750
get well that's
you gotta hunt for it okay

728
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
you gotta hunt for it okay
 

729
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,230
you gotta hunt for it okay
uh but we know that energy all the time

730
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
uh but we know that energy all the time
 

731
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,710
uh but we know that energy all the time
it's rebounding energy

732
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
it's rebounding energy
 

733
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,110
it's rebounding energy
do you get it you wanna bounce the ball

734
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
do you get it you wanna bounce the ball
 

735
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,750
do you get it you wanna bounce the ball
up you gotta first throw it down and

736
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:43,760
up you gotta first throw it down and
 

737
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,669
up you gotta first throw it down and
it'll bounce up off of it it's very

738
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
it'll bounce up off of it it's very
 

739
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,270
it'll bounce up off of it it's very
similar okay

740
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
similar okay
 

741
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,150
similar okay
all right

742
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160
all right
 

743
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,950
all right
let's try it

744
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:52,960

 

745
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,150

so um

746
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160

 

747
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,870

the point you were making was that you

748
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:00,880
the point you were making was that you
 

749
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,110
the point you were making was that you
you could feel you could feel closer to

750
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
you could feel you could feel closer to
 

751
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,549
you could feel you could feel closer to
it if you remain relaxed okay

752
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
it if you remain relaxed okay
 

753
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,470
it if you remain relaxed okay
um

754
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480
um
 

755
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,510
um
and the

756
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520
and the
 

757
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,350
and the
response i made was i think uh

758
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
response i made was i think uh
 

759
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,950
response i made was i think uh
tension

760
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
tension
 

761
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,110
tension
uh blocks

762
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120
uh blocks
 

763
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,029
uh blocks
that with his energy

764
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:19,039
that with his energy
 

765
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,950
that with his energy
or stops or

766
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
or stops or
 

767
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,909
or stops or
causes it to deflect away from the

768
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
causes it to deflect away from the
 

769
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,270
causes it to deflect away from the
greater mass

770
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
greater mass
 

771
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,870
greater mass
here the earth

772
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
here the earth
 

773
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,789
here the earth
and inhibits the rebounding okay

774
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:30,799
and inhibits the rebounding okay
 

775
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,710
and inhibits the rebounding okay
uh so example of this is if he's pushing

776
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
uh so example of this is if he's pushing
 

777
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,669
uh so example of this is if he's pushing
and i tense it stays up in my shoulders

778
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
and i tense it stays up in my shoulders
 

779
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,789
and i tense it stays up in my shoulders
do you see and you can see my stance

780
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:40,799
do you see and you can see my stance
 

781
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,630
do you see and you can see my stance
lift you see

782
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
lift you see
 

783
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,830
lift you see
but the more i relaxed i am it goes down

784
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
but the more i relaxed i am it goes down
 

785
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,789
but the more i relaxed i am it goes down
it goes down into my body okay

786
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
it goes down into my body okay
 

787
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,590
it goes down into my body okay
uh that tension can happen anywhere it

788
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
uh that tension can happen anywhere it
 

789
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,830
uh that tension can happen anywhere it
could happen down on my legs even you

790
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
could happen down on my legs even you
 

791
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,510
could happen down on my legs even you
see uh it's

792
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520
see uh it's
 

793
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,549
see uh it's
not quite all the way in okay

794
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
not quite all the way in okay
 

795
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,909
not quite all the way in okay
uh so i have to be very relaxed

796
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
uh so i have to be very relaxed
 

797
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,789
uh so i have to be very relaxed
very relaxed and that's now that's

798
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
very relaxed and that's now that's
 

799
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,070
very relaxed and that's now that's
really weird because um

800
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,080
really weird because um
 

801
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,990
really weird because um
in the same way that this was

802
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
in the same way that this was
 

803
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,590
in the same way that this was
somewhat

804
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
somewhat
 

805
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,750
somewhat
intuitive right

806
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760
intuitive right
 

807
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,230
intuitive right
um

808
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240

 

809
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,710

this is what we imagined by relaxing

810
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720

 

811
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,310

but that's all that's obviously uh not

812
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
but that's all that's obviously uh not
 

813
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,950
but that's all that's obviously uh not
not what's happening do you see

814
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
not what's happening do you see
 

815
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,510
not what's happening do you see
uh do you get that and so but this isn't

816
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
uh do you get that and so but this isn't
 

817
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,270
uh do you get that and so but this isn't
it either

818
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
it either
 

819
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,590
it either
that's not it either okay that's the

820
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
that's not it either okay that's the
 

821
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,909
that's not it either okay that's the
kind of energy yes and energy and yeah i

822
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:39,919
kind of energy yes and energy and yeah i
 

823
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,549
kind of energy yes and energy and yeah i
can aim it into his center and yeah i

824
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
can aim it into his center and yeah i
 

825
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,870
can aim it into his center and yeah i
can traverse his center along the mat

826
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:44,880
can traverse his center along the mat
 

827
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,390
can traverse his center along the mat
but that was not what i saw do you see

828
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
but that was not what i saw do you see
 

829
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,789
but that was not what i saw do you see
the arms are very loose the face

830
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
the arms are very loose the face
 

831
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,230
the arms are very loose the face
everything is very very loose do you get

832
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,240
everything is very very loose do you get
 

833
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,590
everything is very very loose do you get
that okay

834
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
that okay
 

835
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,270
that okay
um but it was it wasn't that either

836
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
um but it was it wasn't that either
 

837
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,630
um but it was it wasn't that either
okay

838
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:00,640
okay
 

839
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,789
okay
um

840
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
um
 

841
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,230
um
let us

842
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,240
let us
 

843
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,310
let us
we'll do a few so you could you could

844
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
we'll do a few so you could you could
 

845
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:24,690
we'll do a few so you could you could
watch

846
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:24,700

 

847
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:33,110

[Music]

848
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120

 

849
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,310

okay um

850
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320

 

851
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,190

something totally is different okay so

852
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,200
something totally is different okay so
 

853
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,750
something totally is different okay so
you have to stop looking there and you

854
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:43,760
you have to stop looking there and you
 

855
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,669
you have to stop looking there and you
have to keep hunting

856
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
have to keep hunting
 

857
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,789
have to keep hunting
okay

858
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,799
okay
 

859
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,510
okay
um

860
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
um
 

861
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,750
um
in my opinion all of the

862
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760
in my opinion all of the
 

863
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,070
in my opinion all of the
understandings can only be metaphorical

864
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,080
understandings can only be metaphorical
 

865
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,950
understandings can only be metaphorical
okay

866
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
okay
 

867
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,390
okay
they're they're

868
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
they're they're
 

869
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,830
they're they're
they're

871
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,230

literary they're language games you see

872
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
literary they're language games you see
 

873
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,110
literary they're language games you see
so if i talk about

874
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,120
so if i talk about
 

875
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,549
so if i talk about
uh

uh
the energy being blocked into my

the energy being blocked into my
 

879
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,070
the energy being blocked into my
shoulders

that's still tilted here um we also had
 

921
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,190
that's still tilted here um we also had
that uh

922
