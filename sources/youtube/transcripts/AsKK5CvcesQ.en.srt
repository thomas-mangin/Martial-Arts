00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:03,600
Go back.
 

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,030
Go back.
>> All right. Freeze. Don't move. Don't

move.
>> Okay. No pressure though.

8
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:11,840
>> Okay. No pressure though.

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,990
>> Okay. No pressure though.
Where is the deviation from yesterday's

10
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
Where is the deviation from yesterday's
 

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,950
Where is the deviation from yesterday's
training?

12
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
training?
 

13
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,950
training?
No, that that's not important. We didn't

14
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960
No, that that's not important. We didn't
 

15
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,189
No, that that's not important. We didn't
even talk about that yesterday. Not so

16
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
even talk about that yesterday. Not so
 

17
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,990
even talk about that yesterday. Not so
important here.

18
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
important here.
 

19
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,990
important here.
Do you do you see that?

20
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000
Do you do you see that?
 

21
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,870
Do you do you see that?
>> Do you see the angling? Okay, that the

22
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
>> Do you see the angling? Okay, that the
 

23
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,350
>> Do you see the angling? Okay, that the
shoulders are

24
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
shoulders are
 

25
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,990
shoulders are
this one's forward. Do you got it? Okay,

26
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
this one's forward. Do you got it? Okay,
 

27
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,790
this one's forward. Do you got it? Okay,
now why

28
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
now why
 

29
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,590
now why
there's something else?

30
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
there's something else?
 

31
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,990
there's something else?
He's He's obviously trying not to be

32
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
He's He's obviously trying not to be
 

33
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,310
He's He's obviously trying not to be
turned. Do you see that? So, he

34
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
turned. Do you see that? So, he
 

35
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,510
turned. Do you see that? So, he
contested against the turn that he felt.

36
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
contested against the turn that he felt.
 

37
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,029
contested against the turn that he felt.
Okay. Now, go to what's making him

38
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
Okay. Now, go to what's making him
 

39
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,430
Okay. Now, go to what's making him
turnable.

40
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
turnable.
 

41
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,990
turnable.
Because when we contest, we start the

42
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
Because when we contest, we start the
 

43
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,990
Because when we contest, we start the
whole rippling,

44
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
whole rippling,
 

45
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,389
whole rippling,
right? The pebble in the pond. Just as

46
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
right? The pebble in the pond. Just as
 

47
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,030
right? The pebble in the pond. Just as
we we have the non-contestation and it

48
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
we we have the non-contestation and it
 

49
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,070
we we have the non-contestation and it
ripples out, the contestation ripples

50
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
ripples out, the contestation ripples
 

51
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,990
ripples out, the contestation ripples
out, too. So, you're going to see uh

52
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
out, too. So, you're going to see uh
 

53
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,670
out, too. So, you're going to see uh
where this is being exacerbated by

54
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
where this is being exacerbated by
 

55
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,910
where this is being exacerbated by
something that had that he did from the

56
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920
something that had that he did from the
 

57
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,670
something that had that he did from the
very start.

58
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680

 

59
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:31,590

>> No. Come and look around the body.

60
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600

 

61
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,870

What were the instructions yesterday?

62
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
What were the instructions yesterday?
 

63
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,870
What were the instructions yesterday?
Where's his elbow related to his

64
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
Where's his elbow related to his
 

65
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,069
Where's his elbow related to his
shoulder?

66
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
shoulder?
 

67
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,069
shoulder?
>> It's outside the shoulder. Do you see

68
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
>> It's outside the shoulder. Do you see
 

69
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,350
>> It's outside the shoulder. Do you see
that? And that generates

70
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
that? And that generates
 

71
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,950
that? And that generates
this

72
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
this
 

73
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,270
this
this. Do you see? So, let me in. See his

74
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
this. Do you see? So, let me in. See his
 

75
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,670
this. Do you see? So, let me in. See his
elbows out out here. And so I if if I

76
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
elbows out out here. And so I if if I
 

77
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,590
elbows out out here. And so I if if I
just push because I gripped on the

78
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
just push because I gripped on the
 

79
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,149
just push because I gripped on the
outside. I didn't grip here. Make a

80
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
outside. I didn't grip here. Make a
 

81
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,109
outside. I didn't grip here. Make a
fist. I'm not gripping here.

82
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
fist. I'm not gripping here.
 

83
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,590
fist. I'm not gripping here.
There has to be a slight Yes. But yes.

84
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
There has to be a slight Yes. But yes.
 

85
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,790
There has to be a slight Yes. But yes.
So you'll feel it now. You see? Okay.

86
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
So you'll feel it now. You see? Okay.
 

87
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,869
So you'll feel it now. You see? Okay.
And again, my coach should have just

88
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
And again, my coach should have just
 

89
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,350
And again, my coach should have just
been able to do that. But you what's

90
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
been able to do that. But you what's
 

91
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,470
been able to do that. But you what's
happening is when you're down, you feel

92
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
happening is when you're down, you feel
 

93
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,110
happening is when you're down, you feel
your own flexion

94
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
your own flexion
 

95
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,550
your own flexion
and you feel like you're doing

96
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
and you feel like you're doing
 

97
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,070
and you feel like you're doing
something.

98
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
something.
 

99
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,350
something.
You need to do as UK the same thing he's

100
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
You need to do as UK the same thing he's
 

101
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,790
You need to do as UK the same thing he's
doing. He is letting energy go down. I

102
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
doing. He is letting energy go down. I
 

103
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,550
doing. He is letting energy go down. I
let energy go down and that's what's

104
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
let energy go down and that's what's
 

105
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,150
let energy go down and that's what's
moving. And he could feel that shoulder

106
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
moving. And he could feel that shoulder
 

107
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,790
moving. And he could feel that shoulder
biting neck. Okay, does that make sense?

108
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
biting neck. Okay, does that make sense?
 

109
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,110
biting neck. Okay, does that make sense?
Okay, so let's have another team go. I

110
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
Okay, so let's have another team go. I
 

111
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,309
Okay, so let's have another team go. I
don't care who go watch

112
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319

 

113
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,990

down.

114
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000

 

115
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,150

Okay, stop.

116
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
Okay, stop.
 

117
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,750
Okay, stop.
You see that? See the angle again? We're

118
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
You see that? See the angle again? We're
 

119
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,309
You see that? See the angle again? We're
already in the contestation. Do Do you

120
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
already in the contestation. Do Do you
 

121
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,830
already in the contestation. Do Do you
see that? Trying to get trying to get

122
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
see that? Trying to get trying to get
 

123
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,070
see that? Trying to get trying to get
here. Okay,

124
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
here. Okay,
 

125
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,830
here. Okay,
there's already

126
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840

 

127
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,070

a weakness in the torso in the in the in

128
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
a weakness in the torso in the in the in
 

129
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,949
a weakness in the torso in the in the in
the spine. So, don't move. You don't

130
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
the spine. So, don't move. You don't
 

131
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,509
the spine. So, don't move. You don't
move. Now let go.

132
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519

 

133
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,030

Do you see it?

134
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
Do you see it?
 

135
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,790
Do you see it?
>> Okay. So your first thing is you're

136
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
>> Okay. So your first thing is you're
 

137
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,270
>> Okay. So your first thing is you're
relax. You're relaxing,

138
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
relax. You're relaxing,
 

139
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,869
relax. You're relaxing,
right? But what were we told yesterday?

140
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
right? But what were we told yesterday?
 

141
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,830
right? But what were we told yesterday?
Releasing is not relaxing. I can't go

142
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
Releasing is not relaxing. I can't go
 

143
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,710
Releasing is not relaxing. I can't go
like this. What were we told in zen? My

144
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
like this. What were we told in zen? My
 

145
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,270
like this. What were we told in zen? My
spine has to do.

146
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280

 

147
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,350

Reaching up. You can't. If you relax

148
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
Reaching up. You can't. If you relax
 

149
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,309
Reaching up. You can't. If you relax
it doesn't do it. So you have no energy

150
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
it doesn't do it. So you have no energy
 

151
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,270
it doesn't do it. So you have no energy
going through your spine. Okay. And

152
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
going through your spine. Okay. And
 

153
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,470
going through your spine. Okay. And
which you can expose. Okay. All right.

154
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
which you can expose. Okay. All right.
 

155
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,190
which you can expose. Okay. All right.
So my point here is that all these

156
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
So my point here is that all these
 

157
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,990
So my point here is that all these
things are showing up but I'm just not

158
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
things are showing up but I'm just not
 

159
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,149
things are showing up but I'm just not
conscious of them. Just like I'm not

160
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
conscious of them. Just like I'm not
 

161
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,190
conscious of them. Just like I'm not
conscious of the habitual flexion I have

162
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
conscious of the habitual flexion I have
 

163
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,030
conscious of the habitual flexion I have
all day against the gravity that's

164
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
all day against the gravity that's
 

165
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,390
all day against the gravity that's
working on me. You see? And I never feel

166
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
working on me. You see? And I never feel
 

167
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,949
working on me. You see? And I never feel
the rebounding force or the pressing up

168
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
the rebounding force or the pressing up
 

169
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,190
the rebounding force or the pressing up
of the earth. I never feel those forces.

170
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
of the earth. I never feel those forces.
 

171
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,429
of the earth. I never feel those forces.
Okay? But imagine in your art

172
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
Okay? But imagine in your art
 

173
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,069
Okay? But imagine in your art
that's one with the universe. We're

174
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
that's one with the universe. We're
 

175
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,270
that's one with the universe. We're
supposed to be able to feel those

176
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
supposed to be able to feel those
 

177
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,110
supposed to be able to feel those
forces. And if I can feel them, I can

178
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
forces. And if I can feel them, I can
 

179
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,430
forces. And if I can feel them, I can
use them. You see, and that's where and

180
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
use them. You see, and that's where and
 

181
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,749
use them. You see, and that's where and
if I can use them, then I don't have to

182
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
if I can use them, then I don't have to
 

183
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,189
if I can use them, then I don't have to
use these other forces that make me

184
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
use these other forces that make me
 

185
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,990
use these other forces that make me
waste energy and things like that. Okay?

186
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
waste energy and things like that. Okay?
 

187
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,710
waste energy and things like that. Okay?
So, let's all get to a conscious level

188
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
So, let's all get to a conscious level
 

189
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,189
So, let's all get to a conscious level
so we can answer the question again.

190
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
so we can answer the question again.
 

191
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,120
so we can answer the question again.
Where's my flexion? Okay.
