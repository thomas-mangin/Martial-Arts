iido uh is going to be sound with these

182
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
iido uh is going to be sound with these
 

183
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,430

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
three major Sciences it's not going to
 

185
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,790

Okay um so while we do have a mystical

194
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:54,600
Okay um so while we do have a mystical
 

195
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,749
Okay um so while we do have a mystical
aspect to our practice here we also have

196
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
aspect to our practice here we also have
 

197
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,150
aspect to our practice here we also have
this aspect and usually this is where

198
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
this aspect and usually this is where
 

199
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,430
this aspect and usually this is where
most of your Corrections are coming from

your your your Kinesiology is off it's
 

203
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,710

wrong your biomechanics is off the
 

205
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,150
wrong your biomechanics is off the
physics is off um and I would say uh

206
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
physics is off um and I would say uh
 

207
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,430
physics is off um and I would say uh
most of modern iido is not only void of

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,710
its spiritual aspects valid and viable
but it's also invalid k kinesiologic

221
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,230

270
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
going to violate these Sciences it's
 

271
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,710
going to violate these Sciences it's
it's not done okay so you have to have

272
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
it's not done okay so you have to have
 

273
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,350
it's not done okay so you have to have
these things which is why at the

274
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:48,360
these things which is why at the
 

275
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,629
these things which is why at the
beginning level we don't really talk

276
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
beginning level we don't really talk
 

277
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,710
beginning level we don't really talk
about the mystical practices we just get

278
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:53,720
about the mystical practices we just get
 

279
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,510

your body in the right place okay and so

280
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:56,520
your body in the right place okay and so
 

281
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,390
your body in the right place okay and so
most of your Corrections come from that

282
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
most of your Corrections come from that
 

283
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,189
most of your Corrections come from that
all right um so some things that we want

284
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
all right um so some things that we want
 

285
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,430
all right um so some things that we want
to talk about is your your overall

286
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
to talk about is your your overall
 

287
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,909
to talk about is your your overall
um you know moving a body physically

288
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:08,919
um you know moving a body physically
 

289
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:10,710
um you know moving a body physically
through space any body moving through

290
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
through space any body moving through
 

291
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,629
through space any body moving through
space is it's going to move according to

292
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:13,639
space is it's going to move according to
 

293
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,350
space is it's going to move according to
our laws our physical laws that we

294
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,360
our laws our physical laws that we
 

295
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,950

understand so gravity inertia momentum

296
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
understand so gravity inertia momentum
 

297
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,950
understand so gravity inertia momentum
Etc things like that okay uh and when

298
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:21,960
Etc things like that okay uh and when
 

299
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,029
Etc things like that okay uh and when
you apply that um to the human body uh

300
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
you apply that um to the human body uh
 

301
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,550
you apply that um to the human body uh
you're going to get into this field

302
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:29,560
you're going to get into this field
 

303
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,990
you're going to get into this field
which is kinesiology which is the study

304
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000
which is kinesiology which is the study
 

305
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,189
which is kinesiology which is the study
of the body through uh in movement okay

306
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:36,199
of the body through uh in movement okay
 

307
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,430
of the body through uh in movement okay
uh and kinesi Kinesiology is a broader

uh and kinesi Kinesiology is a broader
 

309
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,110
uh and kinesi Kinesiology is a broader
scientific field of which biomechanics

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,120
scientific field of which biomechanics
 

311
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,749
scientific field of which biomechanics
is a subset okay so this is your your

312
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
is a subset okay so this is your your
 

313
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,990
is a subset okay so this is your your
body moving through space all right uh

that's what we're trying to look at and

334
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
that's what we're trying to look at and
 

335
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,670
that's what we're trying to look at and
some inry way understanding is just to

00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
some inry way understanding is just to
 

337
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,950
some inry way understanding is just to
take because physics especially

theoretical physics gets way out there

340
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
theoretical physics gets way out there
 

341
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,589
theoretical physics gets way out there
um which is why you don't really want to

342
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
um which is why you don't really want to
 

343
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,469
um which is why you don't really want to
play out here too much although you got

344
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:29,479
play out here too much although you got
 

345
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:31,110
play out here too much although you got
to pay attention to what we're

346
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
to pay attention to what we're
 

347
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,230
to pay attention to what we're
discovering but you really do hang out

348
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:33,240
discovering but you really do hang out
 

349
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,829
discovering but you really do hang out
here a lot okay um because physics will

350
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
here a lot okay um because physics will
 

351
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,990
here a lot okay um because physics will
talk about things uh out in environments

352
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:41,000
talk about things uh out in environments
 

353
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,310

different from wherein a human body is
 

355
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,829
different from wherein a human body is
functioning okay so for example we're

356
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
functioning okay so for example we're
 

357
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,670
functioning okay so for example we're
probably always on Earth with this

we're probably not in places that are
 

363
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,070
we're probably not in places that are
other than that okay so we're really

00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:55,080
other than that okay so we're really

Force levers the more Force you can

450
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
Force levers the more Force you can
 

451
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,230
Force levers the more Force you can
generate the more Force you can generate

452
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
generate the more Force you can generate
 

453
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,269
generate the more Force you can generate
the more resistance you could overcome

00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:06,279
the more resistance you could overcome
 

455
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,590

00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:13,839
be the mass of the UK okay so uh if you
 

459
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,750
be the mass of the UK okay so uh if you
have less Force you can't overcome

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
accelerate and overcome that resistance
 

489
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,870
accelerate and overcome that resistance
okay and so usually this is solved by

490
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:07,880
okay and so usually this is solved by
 

491
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,230
okay and so usually this is solved by
culture and iido your UK is going to

492
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
culture and iido your UK is going to
 

493
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,350
culture and iido your UK is going to
move for you if you outrank them and if

494
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
move for you if you outrank them and if
 

495
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,550
move for you if you outrank them and if
you don't outrank them then they're

496
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:15,560
you don't outrank them then they're
 

497
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,189
you don't outrank them then they're
going to with you okay and then

498
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:19,199
going to with you okay and then
 

499
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:22,310
going to with you okay and then
this one is not well understood in iido

500
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
this one is not well understood in iido
 

501
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,069
this one is not well understood in iido
but and this is the main one to

502
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
but and this is the main one to
 

503
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,430
but and this is the main one to
understand is that uh you're going to

504
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
understand is that uh you're going to
 

505
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,069
understand is that uh you're going to
have an equal and opposite Force to

506
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
have an equal and opposite Force to
 

507
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,910
have an equal and opposite Force to
every Force you'll apply okay um and

508
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
every Force you'll apply okay um and
 

509
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,550
every Force you'll apply okay um and
this is where I I want to really focus

510
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
this is where I I want to really focus
 

511
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,389
this is where I I want to really focus
on uh because it becomes

512
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:39,399
on uh because it becomes
 

513
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,269
on uh because it becomes
important in an art like iido which is

514
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:44,279
important in an art like iido which is
 

515
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,430
important in an art like iido which is
spiral in its combat geometry okay so

516
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:48,440
spiral in its combat geometry okay so
 

517
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,430
spiral in its combat geometry okay so
we're we're trying to do circles okay uh

518
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:52,440
we're we're trying to do circles okay uh
 

519
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,829
we're we're trying to do circles okay uh
either shrinking circles or larger uh

520
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
either shrinking circles or larger uh
 

521
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,550
either shrinking circles or larger uh
enlarging circles we're we're not trying

522
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
enlarging circles we're we're not trying
 

523
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,110
enlarging circles we're we're not trying
to to hit things at at uh right angles

524
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,120
to to hit things at at uh right angles
 

525
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,670
to to hit things at at uh right angles
and things like that okay um I would put

526
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
and things like that okay um I would put
 

527
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,750
and things like that okay um I would put
before you that none of the Japanese

528
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
before you that none of the Japanese
 

529
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,509
before you that none of the Japanese
Arts do I think a lot of iido people

530
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:10,519
Arts do I think a lot of iido people
 

531
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:13,790
Arts do I think a lot of iido people
think will think that karate um or

532
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:13,800
think will think that karate um or
 

533
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,750
think will think that karate um or
shenji Kempo is like this linear thing

534
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:16,760
shenji Kempo is like this linear thing
 

535
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,550
shenji Kempo is like this linear thing
and I think they just don't practice

536
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560
and I think they just don't practice
 

537
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,069
and I think they just don't practice
those arts and they don't realize okay I

538
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:21,079
those arts and they don't realize okay I
 

539
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:24,030
those arts and they don't realize okay I
think any art on the silk World culture

540
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,040
think any art on the silk World culture
 

541
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,949
think any art on the silk World culture
is going to use rotational Force okay um

542
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:27,959
is going to use rotational Force okay um
 

543
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,269
is going to use rotational Force okay um
and this comes in the play in rotational

544
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:32,279
and this comes in the play in rotational
 

545
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,829
and this comes in the play in rotational
force uh because every time you either

546
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,839
force uh because every time you either
 

547
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,509
force uh because every time you either
try to pull something in or make

548
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:38,519
try to pull something in or make
 

549
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,829
try to pull something in or make
something go out there's going to be a

550
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:43,839
something go out there's going to be a
 

551
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,389
something go out there's going to be a
uh opposite Vector across your

552
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
uh opposite Vector across your
 

553
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,790
uh opposite Vector across your
rotational torque um so for example let

554
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:49,800
rotational torque um so for example let
 

555
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,150
rotational torque um so for example let
me simplify

556
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,160

 

557
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,470

this if here is my

558
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:57,480
this if here is my
 

559
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,949
this if here is my
resistance and I'm going to try to make

560
00:13:59,949 --> 00:13:59,959
resistance and I'm going to try to make
 

561
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,230
resistance and I'm going to try to make
it go on a

562
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
it go on a
 

563
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,590
it go on a
curve which affords me all kinds of

564
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600

 

565
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,430

advantages so I'm going to make it go

566
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:10,440
advantages so I'm going to make it go
 

567
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,310
advantages so I'm going to make it go
like on a

568
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,320

 

569
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,189

curve at every degree of rotation there

570
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
curve at every degree of rotation there
 

571
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,910
curve at every degree of rotation there
is another line that's cutting right

572
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:20,920
is another line that's cutting right
 

573
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,870
is another line that's cutting right
across that line okay it's just doing it

574
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
across that line okay it's just doing it
 

575
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,310
across that line okay it's just doing it
incrementally okay

576
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:29,320
incrementally okay
 

577
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,389
incrementally okay
and this is why we here

578
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:33,399
and this is why we here
 

579
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:39,069
and this is why we here
move with a ground path that is singular

580
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:39,079
move with a ground path that is singular
 

581
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,430
move with a ground path that is singular
in its architecture we don't

582
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:42,440
in its architecture we don't
 

583
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,910
in its architecture we don't
use two what I wouldn't even call Ground

584
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
use two what I wouldn't even call Ground
 

585
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,110
use two what I wouldn't even call Ground
pass we don't use two uh Bas of supports

586
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
pass we don't use two uh Bas of supports
 

587
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,350
pass we don't use two uh Bas of supports
element because

588
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
element because
 

589
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,470
element because
eventually the equal and opposite line

590
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
eventually the equal and opposite line
 

591
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,310
eventually the equal and opposite line
is going to cut through the uh Shak

592
00:14:59,310 --> 00:14:59,320
is going to cut through the uh Shak
 

593
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,470
is going to cut through the uh Shak
of that stance okay so let me get you

594
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:01,480
of that stance okay so let me get you
 

595
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,590
of that stance okay so let me get you
there and I'll explain this to you and

596
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:04,600
there and I'll explain this to you and
 

597
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,110
there and I'll explain this to you and
this is why for example a lot of your

598
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
this is why for example a lot of your
 

599
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,710
this is why for example a lot of your
techniques feel

600
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
techniques feel
 

601
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,749
techniques feel
weak uh more so in jiu waza than in Kona

602
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:14,759
weak uh more so in jiu waza than in Kona
 

603
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,350
weak uh more so in jiu waza than in Kona
because in

604
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:16,360
because in
 

605
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,550
because in
Kona your

606
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:19,560
Kona your
 

607
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,110
Kona your
saki uh is doing too much

608
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,120
saki uh is doing too much
 

609
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,189
saki uh is doing too much
choreography got it and then in

610
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
choreography got it and then in
 

611
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,670
choreography got it and then in
Gaza they don't know which technique

612
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
Gaza they don't know which technique
 

613
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,509
Gaza they don't know which technique
you're going to do and by default

614
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:31,519
you're going to do and by default
 

615
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,710
you're going to do and by default
they're a little late and now you feel

616
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
they're a little late and now you feel
 

617
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,990
they're a little late and now you feel
that equal and opposite energy against

618
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,000
that equal and opposite energy against
 

619
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,430
that equal and opposite energy against
your rotational torque and it's cutting

620
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
your rotational torque and it's cutting
 

621
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,790
your rotational torque and it's cutting
through your basis support taking off

622
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:41,800
through your basis support taking off
 

623
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,189
through your basis support taking off
balance and decreasing how much power

624
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:44,199
balance and decreasing how much power
 

625
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:47,550
balance and decreasing how much power
you can apply in the spiraling pattern

626
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:47,560
you can apply in the spiraling pattern
 

627
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,629
you can apply in the spiraling pattern
because it's going to start pulling you

628
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:49,639
because it's going to start pulling you
 

629
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,910
because it's going to start pulling you
off your base okay so let's first

630
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:52,920
off your base okay so let's first
 

631
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,590
off your base okay so let's first
understand uh a couple things here we

632
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:56,600
understand uh a couple things here we
 

633
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,910
understand uh a couple things here we
have uh angle

634
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
have uh angle
 

635
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,990
have uh angle
of

636
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000

 

637
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,389

disturbance okay and we have base of

638
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399

 

639
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,790

support all right so your Bas of support

640
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
support all right so your Bas of support
 

641
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,949
support all right so your Bas of support
is we'll say that we're on the Flat

642
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:18,959
is we'll say that we're on the Flat
 

643
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,829
is we'll say that we're on the Flat
Earth okay it's going to be your contact

644
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:22,839

645
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,550
Earth okay it's going to be your contact
points with the Earth so let's say

646
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
points with the Earth so let's say
 

647
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,110

leg your contact points with the Earth
so there's your other foot and your

652
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:31,959
so there's your other foot and your
 

653
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:35,910
so there's your other foot and your
other leg and then the area in between

654
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:35,920
other leg and then the area in between
 

655
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,269
other leg and then the area in between
them that is your basis support so it's

656
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
them that is your basis support so it's
 

657
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,670
them that is your basis support so it's
going to be my contact points well

658
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
going to be my contact points well
 

659
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,189
going to be my contact points well
that's not really working but you get

660
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
that's not really working but you get
 

661
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,550
that's not really working but you get
the point okay that whole area there is

662
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
the point okay that whole area there is
 

663
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,509
the point okay that whole area there is
my Bas of

support in your Bas of support you also
 

667
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,470
support in your Bas of support you also
have something called your line of

and your line of

672
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:03,760
and your line of
 

673
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,549
and your line of
gravity is going to be a theoretical

674
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
gravity is going to be a theoretical
 

675
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,750
gravity is going to be a theoretical
line which means it's I can't physically

it from your Center gravity in this case
I'm standing up so my center of gravity

682
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm standing up so my center of gravity
 

683
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,990
I'm standing up so my center of gravity
somewhere around my H perpendicular to

the
 

687
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,949
the
Earth so it's a theoretical line so

688
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
Earth so it's a theoretical line so
 

689
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,390
Earth so it's a theoretical line so
we'll draw it with with dots

690
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:27,400

 

691
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,029

okay
 

693
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,950
okay
and as long as my line of gravity is

694
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:31,960
and as long as my line of gravity is
 

695
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,669

okay when my line of gravity is taken
 

699
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,390
okay when my line of gravity is taken
outside of my Bas of support we have

700
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
outside of my Bas of support we have
 

701
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:55,390
outside of my Bas of support we have
another concept and that is angle of

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,750
your base of support okay as you start
to lean over your center of gravity is

722
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:34,760
to lean over your center of gravity is
 

723
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,590
to lean over your center of gravity is
going to start to raise and come out

724
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
going to start to raise and come out

this equal and opposite force acting
 

795
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:14,070
this equal and opposite force acting
upon my mass okay and so let me uh and

796
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
upon my mass okay and so let me uh and
 

797
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,990
upon my mass okay and so let me uh and
and this becomes more and more

798

and this becomes more and more
 

799
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,190
and this becomes more and more

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,750
EO and here is UK's arm which is a lever
okay and as they try to uh turn the UK

818
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:55,760
okay and as they try to uh turn the UK
 

819
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,549
okay and as they try to uh turn the UK
around there's always that equal an

820
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:58,559
around there's always that equal an
 

821
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,350
around there's always that equal an
opposite force acting on the mass that

822
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360
opposite force acting on the mass that
 

823
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,070
opposite force acting on the mass that
they're moving okay so right now if if

824
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,080
they're moving okay so right now if if
 

825
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,549
they're moving okay so right now if if
UK's head is over here and their spines

826
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:07,559
UK's head is over here and their spines
 

827
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,430
UK's head is over here and their spines
over here this kind of works at this

828
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:10,440
over here this kind of works at this
 

829
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,110
over here this kind of works at this
point because the equal and opposite

830
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,120
point because the equal and opposite
 

831
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,269
point because the equal and opposite
line can be grounded on the inside foot

832
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:18,279
line can be grounded on the inside foot
 

833
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:22,590
line can be grounded on the inside foot
but at a certain point let's say in the

834
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:22,600
but at a certain point let's say in the
 

835
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,110
but at a certain point let's say in the
deeper into the

836
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,120

 

837
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,630

spiral where the arm is over over here

838
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
spiral where the arm is over over here
 

839
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,110
spiral where the arm is over over here
now and they're acting on this part that

840
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,120
now and they're acting on this part that
 

841
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,070
now and they're acting on this part that
equal and opposite Line is now falling

842
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,080
equal and opposite Line is now falling
 

843
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,269
equal and opposite Line is now falling
outside the Bas of support it's not

844
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:39,279
outside the Bas of support it's not
 

845
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,029
outside the Bas of support it's not
falling on the on the uh grounding foot

846
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
falling on the on the uh grounding foot
 

847
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,110
falling on the on the uh grounding foot
okay and this is actually an angle of

848
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,120
okay and this is actually an angle of
 

849
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,070
okay and this is actually an angle of
disturbance okay so I'm going to show

850
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,080
disturbance okay so I'm going to show
 

851
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,029
disturbance okay so I'm going to show
you these Concepts as we go through all

852
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
you these Concepts as we go through all
 

853
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,830
you these Concepts as we go through all
right here we go get everyone on the

854
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:54,840
right here we go get everyone on the
 

855
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,029
right here we go get everyone on the
same page I will okay so here

856
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:00,039
same page I will okay so here
 

857
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:03,870
same page I will okay so here
is the lever that I'm trying to move to

858
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:03,880
is the lever that I'm trying to move to
 

859
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,190
is the lever that I'm trying to move to
move his Center okay so if you look here

860
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:08,200
move his Center okay so if you look here
 

861
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,470
move his Center okay so if you look here
I'm going to apply force incrementally

862
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:11,480
I'm going to apply force incrementally
 

863
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,870
I'm going to apply force incrementally
on a rotation so you're going to pay

864
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:13,880
on a rotation so you're going to pay
 

865
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,630
on a rotation so you're going to pay
attention maybe CA come over here you

866
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
attention maybe CA come over here you
 

867
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,350
attention maybe CA come over here you
guys can stay in frame I want you to

868
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:18,360
guys can stay in frame I want you to
 

869
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,630
guys can stay in frame I want you to
understand what's going on so as I

870
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:20,640
understand what's going on so as I
 

871
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,310
understand what's going on so as I
rotate this and just walk with me as I

872
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,320
rotate this and just walk with me as I
 

873
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,029
rotate this and just walk with me as I
rotate this in a

874
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:26,039
rotate this in a
 

875
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,830
rotate this in a
circle physically I have Force at

876
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840
circle physically I have Force at
 

877
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,470
circle physically I have Force at
various pie slices as we're going around

878
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:32,480
various pie slices as we're going around
 

879
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,110
various pie slices as we're going around
do you see that and so at this

880
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,120
do you see that and so at this
 

881
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,789
do you see that and so at this
point this foot is ground vectoring that

882
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:39,799
point this foot is ground vectoring that
 

883
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,470
point this foot is ground vectoring that
resistance point to move it through

884
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:41,480
resistance point to move it through
 

885
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,870
resistance point to move it through
space okay and that equal and opposite

886
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:44,880
space okay and that equal and opposite
 

887
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,669
space okay and that equal and opposite
energy as I push here there's the equal

888
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
energy as I push here there's the equal
 

889
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,750
energy as I push here there's the equal
and opposite energy coming back at the

890
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760
and opposite energy coming back at the
 

891
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,710
and opposite energy coming back at the
exact angle that I'm pushing so right

892
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:51,720
exact angle that I'm pushing so right
 

893
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,710
exact angle that I'm pushing so right
now it's on the foot do you see it's on

894
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
now it's on the foot do you see it's on
 

895
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,269
now it's on the foot do you see it's on
that foot as I do it but as we start to

896
00:22:57,269 --> 00:22:57,279
that foot as I do it but as we start to
 

897
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,909
that foot as I do it but as we start to
go

898
00:22:58,909 --> 00:22:58,919
go
 

899
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,669
go
it starts to go in between my legs that

900
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
it starts to go in between my legs that
 

901
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,470
it starts to go in between my legs that
equal and opposite energy do you see and

902
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
equal and opposite energy do you see and
 

903
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,950
equal and opposite energy do you see and
that means now if you come over

904
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:07,960
that means now if you come over
 

905
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,149
that means now if you come over
here and you're going to be you're going

906
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:10,159
here and you're going to be you're going
 

907
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,669
here and you're going to be you're going
to you're going to represent that equal

908
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:12,679
to you're going to represent that equal
 

909
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,510
to you're going to represent that equal
and opposite energy do you got it and so

910
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:16,520
and opposite energy do you got it and so
 

911
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,789
and opposite energy do you got it and so
her equal and opposite energy is not

912
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
her equal and opposite energy is not
 

913
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,110
her equal and opposite energy is not
being ground vector and this is my angle

914
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,120
being ground vector and this is my angle
 

915
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,510
being ground vector and this is my angle
of disturbance between my feet so she

916
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,520
of disturbance between my feet so she
 

917
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,029
of disturbance between my feet so she
can easily push me over between my feet

918
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:28,039
can easily push me over between my feet
 

919
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,310
can easily push me over between my feet
feet you see you see that and that's

920
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,320
feet you see you see that and that's
 

921
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,110
feet you see you see that and that's
what we do all the time the UK is we

922
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
what we do all the time the UK is we
 

923
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,630
what we do all the time the UK is we
don't push into their Bas of support we

924
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:35,640
don't push into their Bas of support we
 

925
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,390
don't push into their Bas of support we
push between the contact points all the

926
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400
push between the contact points all the
 

927
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,990
push between the contact points all the
time okay so but usually what happens

928
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,000
time okay so but usually what happens
 

929
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,390
time okay so but usually what happens
you can step out now is your UK goes

930
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
you can step out now is your UK goes
 

931
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,430
you can step out now is your UK goes
around the the soft part of the

932
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:46,440
around the the soft part of the
 

933
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,710
around the the soft part of the
technique do you see and then and then

934
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:48,720
technique do you see and then and then
 

935
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,789
technique do you see and then and then
you can go and you can do this stuff

936
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:53,799
you can go and you can do this stuff
 

937
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,870
you can go and you can do this stuff
okay unless they out right

938
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
okay unless they out right
 

939
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,909
okay unless they out right
here so he's going to he's going to put

940
00:23:59,909 --> 00:23:59,919
here so he's going to he's going to put
 

941
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,430
here so he's going to he's going to put
that other foot over there and here he's

942
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:02,440
that other foot over there and here he's
 

943
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,070
that other foot over there and here he's
grounding on that foot okay so you're

944
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,080
grounding on that foot okay so you're
 

945
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,630
grounding on that foot okay so you're
going to represent the equal and

946
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:06,640
going to represent the equal and
 

947
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,110
going to represent the equal and
opposite energy you see and she can

948
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,120
opposite energy you see and she can
 

949
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,990
opposite energy you see and she can
you're going to ground on that foot this

950
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
you're going to ground on that foot this
 

951
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,470
you're going to ground on that foot this
fo don't move okay and then but as he

952
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:15,480
fo don't move okay and then but as he
 

953
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,390
fo don't move okay and then but as he
starts to turn look where her equal and

954
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,400
starts to turn look where her equal and
 

955
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,310
starts to turn look where her equal and
opposite energy is now pushing between

956
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:21,320
opposite energy is now pushing between
 

957
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,149
opposite energy is now pushing between
his feet you see that and so now you

958
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159
his feet you see that and so now you
 

959
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,510
his feet you see that and so now you
push Virginia you push into and you're

960
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:26,520
push Virginia you push into and you're
 

961
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,470
push Virginia you push into and you're
going to lose lose his face

962
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
going to lose lose his face
 

963
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,430
going to lose lose his face
if he loses his bace then he loses his

964
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
if he loses his bace then he loses his
 

965
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,389
if he loses his bace then he loses his
rotational Integrity you you can't bring

966
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:34,399
rotational Integrity you you can't bring
 

967
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:36,549
rotational Integrity you you can't bring
me around so we're just demonstrating

968
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
me around so we're just demonstrating
 

969
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,470
me around so we're just demonstrating
that you'd be pushed over but if you

970
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:39,480
that you'd be pushed over but if you
 

971
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,029
that you'd be pushed over but if you
reverse the equal and opposite

972
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:42,039
reverse the equal and opposite
 

973
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:45,669
reverse the equal and opposite
energy okay and we'll show it again here

974
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:45,679
energy okay and we'll show it again here
 

975
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,389
energy okay and we'll show it again here
here we're fine but once you start

976
00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:48,399
here we're fine but once you start
 

977
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:51,230
here we're fine but once you start
rotating then we're not going to be fine

978
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,240
rotating then we're not going to be fine
 

979
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,190
rotating then we're not going to be fine
you see that and I will now be the equal

980
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
you see that and I will now be the equal
 

981
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,990
you see that and I will now be the equal
and opposite energy and this is is where

982
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
and opposite energy and this is is where
 

983
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,110
and opposite energy and this is is where
your senior UK

984
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,120

 

985
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,549

goes because you can never get enough

986
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:05,559
goes because you can never get enough
 

987
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:08,870
goes because you can never get enough
Mass into the technique so without your

988
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
Mass into the technique so without your
 

989
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,549
Mass into the technique so without your
mass doesn't matter your acceleration

990
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:11,559
mass doesn't matter your acceleration
 

991
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,830
mass doesn't matter your acceleration
your force or your ability to overcome

992
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:13,840
your force or your ability to overcome
 

993
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,389
your force or your ability to overcome
the resistance goes down why does it

994
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:16,399
the resistance goes down why does it
 

995
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:18,990
the resistance goes down why does it
always look like it works because you

996
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:19,000
always look like it works because you
 

997
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,190
always look like it works because you
outrank your UK and they'll step

998
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,200
outrank your UK and they'll step
 

999
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,950
outrank your UK and they'll step
themselves into the next contact point

1000
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
themselves into the next contact point
 

1001
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,870
themselves into the next contact point
so watch again stay there stay there

1002
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:27,880
so watch again stay there stay there
 

1003
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,470
so watch again stay there stay there
there and then Virginia comes over look

1004
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:30,480
there and then Virginia comes over look
 

1005
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,549
there and then Virginia comes over look
at his elbow line he's back on his foot

1006
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:35,559
at his elbow line he's back on his foot
 

1007
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,750
at his elbow line he's back on his foot
you see that Sean got it and then what

1008
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:38,760
you see that Sean got it and then what
 

1009
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,950
you see that Sean got it and then what
you'll do is you'll drop your how much

1010
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:41,960
you'll do is you'll drop your how much
 

1011
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,789
you'll do is you'll drop your how much
you weigh um 180 180 you'll drop your

1012
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:45,799
you weigh um 180 180 you'll drop your
 

1013
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:49,830
you weigh um 180 180 you'll drop your
180 on my elbow and then I go

1014
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:49,840
180 on my elbow and then I go
 

1015
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,669
180 on my elbow and then I go
down got it so everyone knows if I get

1016
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:53,679
down got it so everyone knows if I get
 

1017
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,190
down got it so everyone knows if I get
my weight on I can generally overcome

1018
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,200
my weight on I can generally overcome
 

1019
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,470
my weight on I can generally overcome
your

1020
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
your
 

1021
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,190
your
ability um but everyone gets stalled at

1022
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,200
ability um but everyone gets stalled at
 

1023
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,110
ability um but everyone gets stalled at
that from this Pivot Point into the

1024
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,120
that from this Pivot Point into the
 

1025
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,669
that from this Pivot Point into the
middle of the Bas of support where the

1026
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:07,679
middle of the Bas of support where the
 

1027
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,029
middle of the Bas of support where the
angle disturbance is until you can get

1028
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:10,039
angle disturbance is until you can get
 

1029
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:13,510
angle disturbance is until you can get
your weight back onto the top of it and

1030
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
your weight back onto the top of it and
 

1031
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,389
your weight back onto the top of it and
regain the back Pivot Point okay the

1032
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:16,399
regain the back Pivot Point okay the
 

1033
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:21,350
regain the back Pivot Point okay the
back Bas of support um again though

1034
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:21,360
back Bas of support um again though
 

1035
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,190
back Bas of support um again though
let's say

1036
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,200
let's say
 

1037
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,149
let's say
uh we know for example once he goes off

1038
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:27,159
uh we know for example once he goes off
 

1039
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:29,510
uh we know for example once he goes off
of that Pivot Point just leave it on the

1040
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:29,520
of that Pivot Point just leave it on the
 

1041
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,990
of that Pivot Point just leave it on the
ground please in the rotation he's now

1042
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
ground please in the rotation he's now
 

1043
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,870
ground please in the rotation he's now
between his his two pivot Points and

1044
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:34,880
between his his two pivot Points and
 

1045
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,510
between his his two pivot Points and
that's the angle disturbance that we use

1046
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,520
that's the angle disturbance that we use
 

1047
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,070
that's the angle disturbance that we use
all the time okay as

1048
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
all the time okay as
 

1049
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,269
all the time okay as
nit all right and then what he's going

1050
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:42,279
nit all right and then what he's going
 

1051
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,669
nit all right and then what he's going
to as he Bridges from this and if I

1052
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:45,679
to as he Bridges from this and if I
 

1053
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,510
to as he Bridges from this and if I
could use you you see she's pushing into

1054
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:48,520
could use you you see she's pushing into
 

1055
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,630
could use you you see she's pushing into
his back foot so you are on your basic

1056
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,640
his back foot so you are on your basic
 

1057
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,590
his back foot so you are on your basic
support there's no angle disturbance

1058
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:52,600
support there's no angle disturbance
 

1059
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,789
support there's no angle disturbance
it's

1060
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:53,799
it's
 

1061
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:58,110
it's
this that that 45 until so you can get

1062
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,120
this that that 45 until so you can get
 

1063
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,070
this that that 45 until so you can get
me back on that foot again you see and

1064
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,080
me back on that foot again you see and
 

1065
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,590
me back on that foot again you see and
it's that 45 where your

1066
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:06,600
it's that 45 where your
 

1067
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,789
it's that 45 where your
simpai look at you cuz you you can't get

1068
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:09,799
simpai look at you cuz you you can't get
 

1069
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,149
simpai look at you cuz you you can't get
that all right now the Assumption though

1070
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:12,159
that all right now the Assumption though
 

1071
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,230
that all right now the Assumption though
is the following go even if you got me

1072
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,240
is the following go even if you got me
 

1073
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,149
is the following go even if you got me
back to that Pivot Point remember here's

1074
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:18,159
back to that Pivot Point remember here's
 

1075
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,870
back to that Pivot Point remember here's
where everyone puts their weight on the

1076
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:20,880
where everyone puts their weight on the
 

1077
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,230
where everyone puts their weight on the
elbow right go

1078
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,240

 

1079
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,310

ahead because I'm never off balance you

1080
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:29,320
ahead because I'm never off balance you
 

1081
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,389
ahead because I'm never off balance you
see that I am never off balance here's

1082
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:32,399
see that I am never off balance here's
 

1083
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,430
see that I am never off balance here's
the thing go

1084
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:35,440

 

1085
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,909

back what the choreograph you get is

1086
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:37,919
back what the choreograph you get is
 

1087
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,269
back what the choreograph you get is
going to

1088
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:39,279
going to
 

1089
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,549
going to
do uh kohai is going to move from one

1090
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:43,559
do uh kohai is going to move from one
 

1091
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:47,149
do uh kohai is going to move from one
contact Point negate the need

1092
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:47,159
contact Point negate the need
 

1093
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,230
contact Point negate the need
for the Bas of support right and then

1094
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,240
for the Bas of support right and then
 

1095
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,509
for the Bas of support right and then
they move back to your Bas of support so

1096
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:53,519
they move back to your Bas of support so
 

1097
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,789
they move back to your Bas of support so
the force line never cut through your

1098
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:55,799
the force line never cut through your
 

1099
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,590
the force line never cut through your
contact points you guys understand

that's what choreography does I go on

1102
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:01,039
that's what choreography does I go on
 

1103
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,470
that's what choreography does I go on
and I this part to here here again

1104
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,480
and I this part to here here again
 

1105
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,110
and I this part to here here again
you're legitimate okay now however since

1106
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,120
you're legitimate okay now however since
 

1107
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,509
you're legitimate okay now however since
I moved myself there I'm not really off

1108
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:12,519
I moved myself there I'm not really off
 

1109
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,470
I moved myself there I'm not really off
balance you get it so as he goes I'm

1110
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:16,480
balance you get it so as he goes I'm
 

1111
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,269
balance you get it so as he goes I'm
actually countering him which again he

1112
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:19,279
actually countering him which again he
 

1113
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,230
actually countering him which again he
could put all his weight on there and

1114
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:21,240
could put all his weight on there and
 

1115
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,669
could put all his weight on there and
he's never going to get me down never

1116
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:24,679
he's never going to get me down never
 

1117
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:27,669
he's never going to get me down never
okay you guys understand that so the C

1118
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:27,679
okay you guys understand that so the C
 

1119
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,909
okay you guys understand that so the C
graphy is hiding a lot of things um so

1120
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:31,919
graphy is hiding a lot of things um so
 

1121
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,509
graphy is hiding a lot of things um so
let's look at this angle of disturbance

1122
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:34,519
let's look at this angle of disturbance
 

1123
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:37,269
let's look at this angle of disturbance
a little bit more closely so angle

1124
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:37,279
a little bit more closely so angle
 

1125
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,950
a little bit more closely so angle
disturbance is any line that I use to

1126
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:40,960
disturbance is any line that I use to
 

1127
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,990
disturbance is any line that I use to
take your Center your line of gravity

1128
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,000
take your Center your line of gravity
 

1129
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,310
take your Center your line of gravity
outside your Bas of support so get in

1130
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,320
outside your Bas of support so get in
 

1131
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,070
outside your Bas of support so get in
any stance you want okay so here if I

1132
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,080
any stance you want okay so here if I
 

1133
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,830
any stance you want okay so here if I
push at this line his line of gravity

1134
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:54,840
push at this line his line of gravity
 

1135
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,630
push at this line his line of gravity
the theoretical line from his center of

1136
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,640
the theoretical line from his center of
 

1137
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,509
the theoretical line from his center of
gravity per perpendicular to the Earth

1138
00:28:58,509 --> 00:28:58,519
gravity per perpendicular to the Earth
 

1139
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,389
gravity per perpendicular to the Earth
will never fall outside that Bas of

1140
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:00,399
will never fall outside that Bas of
 

1141
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,070
will never fall outside that Bas of
support right you see that okay but if I

1142
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
support right you see that okay but if I
 

1143
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,350
support right you see that okay but if I
come over

1144
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:05,360
come over
 

1145
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,789
come over
here this is going to push that line

1146
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
here this is going to push that line
 

1147
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,509
here this is going to push that line
outside okay and so we do that all the

1148
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:11,519
outside okay and so we do that all the
 

1149
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,389
outside okay and so we do that all the
time in our spiraling geometry okay um

1150
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:15,399
time in our spiraling geometry okay um
 

1151
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:18,789
time in our spiraling geometry okay um
and so that concept there that

1152
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:18,799
and so that concept there that
 

1153
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,990
and so that concept there that
scientific concept is what allows both

1154
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,000
scientific concept is what allows both
 

1155
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,590
scientific concept is what allows both
this Senpai UK to jam your Technique up

1156
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:25,600
this Senpai UK to jam your Technique up
 

1157
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,909

right and what requires kohai UK to step

1158
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:29,919
right and what requires kohai UK to step
 

1159
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,669
right and what requires kohai UK to step
through the problem area and also gives

1160
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:32,679
through the problem area and also gives
 

1161
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:35,110
through the problem area and also gives
you the root Awakening when you try e

00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,120
you the root Awakening when you try e
 

1163
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,669
you the root Awakening when you try e
for example on someone who does not want

1164
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:36,679
for example on someone who does not want
 

1165
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:39,669
for example on someone who does not want
to know okay does that make sense okay

1166
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:39,679
to know okay does that make sense okay
 

1167
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,470
to know okay does that make sense okay
so let me have you guys play around with

1168
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:41,480
so let me have you guys play around with
 

1169
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,990
so let me have you guys play around with
those Concepts all right you can stall

1170
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,000
those Concepts all right you can stall
 

1171
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,070
those Concepts all right you can stall
them you can move you can now stall them

1172
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,080
them you can move you can now stall them
 

1173
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,870
them you can move you can now stall them
because you have your balance Etc all

1174
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:48,880
because you have your balance Etc all
 

1175
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,990
because you have your balance Etc all
right let's

1176
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
right let's
 

1177
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,710
right let's
try so uh this is why we have that rule

1178
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:53,720
try so uh this is why we have that rule
 

1179
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,870
try so uh this is why we have that rule
no double pivoting if you double pivot

an angle disturbance it will either

1192
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:14,120
an angle disturbance it will either
 

1193
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,070
an angle disturbance it will either
reduce your ability to put force on the

1194
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,080
reduce your ability to put force on the
 

1195
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,470
reduce your ability to put force on the
point of rotation Andor you'll be

1196
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:19,480
point of rotation Andor you'll be
 

1197
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,710
point of rotation Andor you'll be
totally overcome by the a person that's

1198
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:21,720
totally overcome by the a person that's
 

1199
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,029
totally overcome by the a person that's
resisting okay so the real problem here

1200
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:25,039
resisting okay so the real problem here
 

1201
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,990
resisting okay so the real problem here
is that I have a double it stance so I'm

1202
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,000
is that I have a double it stance so I'm
 

1203
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,470
is that I have a double it stance so I'm
double pivoting okay again that is

1204
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:31,480
double pivoting okay again that is
 

1205
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,870
double pivoting okay again that is
totally overlooked in contemporary iido

1206
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:34,880
totally overlooked in contemporary iido
 

1207
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,269
totally overlooked in contemporary iido
because of the choreography okay or uh

1208
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:38,279
because of the choreography okay or uh
 

1209
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,029
because of the choreography okay or uh
no one has a problem with the fact that

1210
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:40,039
no one has a problem with the fact that
 

1211
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:42,070
no one has a problem with the fact that
you're musling everyone cuz you're

1212
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,080
you're musling everyone cuz you're
 

1213
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,590
you're musling everyone cuz you're
you're like you know 280 and you're

1214
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:44,600
you're like you know 280 and you're
 

1215
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,269
you're like you know 280 and you're
going on some small person that's like

1216
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:47,279
going on some small person that's like
 

1217
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,509
going on some small person that's like
110 okay like you you should be if your

1218
00:30:51,509 --> 00:30:51,519
110 okay like you you should be if your
 

1219
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,269
110 okay like you you should be if your
if that's your dojo you should be

1220
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:55,279
if that's your dojo you should be
 

1221
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,549
if that's your dojo you should be
going whatever you know like not

1222
00:30:58,549 --> 00:30:58,559
going whatever you know like not
 

1223
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,310
going whatever you know like not
impressed okay um does that make sense

1224
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,320
impressed okay um does that make sense
 

1225
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,029
impressed okay um does that make sense
okay so what we're GNA do instead is

1226
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:06,039
okay so what we're GNA do instead is
 

1227
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:08,350
okay so what we're GNA do instead is
have a single Pivot Point you have to

1228
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,360
have a single Pivot Point you have to
 

1229
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,470
have a single Pivot Point you have to
have a single Pivot Point my other foot

1230
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:10,480
have a single Pivot Point my other foot
 

1231
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,470
have a single Pivot Point my other foot
is touching the ground but that's not

1232
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:12,480
is touching the ground but that's not
 

1233
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,549
is touching the ground but that's not
the part that is moving him so I'm not

1234
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:15,559
the part that is moving him so I'm not
 

1235
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:18,669
the part that is moving him so I'm not
here you see and I have that foot and

1236
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:18,679
here you see and I have that foot and
 

1237
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:20,669
here you see and I have that foot and
then through choreography I pass through

1238
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:20,679
then through choreography I pass through
 

1239
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:23,430
then through choreography I pass through
the angle disturbance line right here

1240
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:23,440
the angle disturbance line right here
 

1241
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,830
the angle disturbance line right here
and then try to get on top with some

1242
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:25,840
and then try to get on top with some
 

1243
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,549
and then try to get on top with some
Mash here okay

1244
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:29,559

 

1245
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:31,750

so the first element is you have to have

1246
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:31,760
so the first element is you have to have
 

1247
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,430
so the first element is you have to have
a single pivot point if I have to have a

1248
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:34,440
a single pivot point if I have to have a
 

1249
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,710
a single pivot point if I have to have a
single pivot point there is no reason

1250
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
single pivot point there is no reason
 

1251
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,710
single pivot point there is no reason
for my foot to be out there my foot can

1252
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:39,720
for my foot to be out there my foot can
 

1253
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,590
for my foot to be out there my foot can
be in here okay and this part is the

1254
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:44,600
be in here okay and this part is the
 

1255
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,669
be in here okay and this part is the
same way as here I can generate Force

1256
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:47,679
same way as here I can generate Force
 

1257
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,269
same way as here I can generate Force
Virginia if you don't

1258
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:49,279
Virginia if you don't
 

1259
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,909
Virginia if you don't
mind she's she's the equal an opposite

1260
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:51,919
mind she's she's the equal an opposite
 

1261
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,430
mind she's she's the equal an opposite
line you see and she's in that foot you

1262
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:54,440
line you see and she's in that foot you
 

1263
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,310
line you see and she's in that foot you
see that and if I only have a single PIV

1264
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:57,320
see that and if I only have a single PIV
 

1265
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,190
see that and if I only have a single PIV
Point throughout this technique it

1266
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,200
Point throughout this technique it
 

1267
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,190
Point throughout this technique it
doesn't matter where that other foot is

1268
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,200
doesn't matter where that other foot is
 

1269
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,629
doesn't matter where that other foot is
you see and so I can keep moving it's

1270
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:04,639
you see and so I can keep moving it's
 

1271
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:07,789
you see and so I can keep moving it's
always on that foot as I'm moving around

1272
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:07,799
always on that foot as I'm moving around
 

1273
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,789
always on that foot as I'm moving around
you get it

1274
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:09,799
you get it
 

1275
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:14,110
you get it
okay it's the double Pivot

1276
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,120
okay it's the double Pivot
 

1277
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,149
okay it's the double Pivot
Point this is now I can't I cannot go

1278
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:17,159
Point this is now I can't I cannot go
 

1279
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,710
Point this is now I can't I cannot go
any further this is where your Senai

1280
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:19,720
any further this is where your Senai
 

1281
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,070
any further this is where your Senai
will get you there

1282
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,080
will get you there
 

1283
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,990
will get you there
okay all right

1284
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,000
okay all right
 

1285
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,950
okay all right
so here this foot near so you never

1286
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:29,960
so here this foot near so you never
 

1287
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,750
so here this foot near so you never
tempt that okay and this now allows you

1288
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:34,760
tempt that okay and this now allows you
 

1289
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,509
tempt that okay and this now allows you
to always be ground vectoring into the

1290
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:38,519
to always be ground vectoring into the
 

1291
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,590
to always be ground vectoring into the
technique so the same way

1292
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:41,600
technique so the same way
 

1293
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,870
technique so the same way
here there's the equal and opposite

1294
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:43,880
here there's the equal and opposite
 

1295
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,990
here there's the equal and opposite
energy the same way she can't do

1296
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,000
energy the same way she can't do
 

1297
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,870
energy the same way she can't do
anything cuz you're in that foot you're

1298
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:47,880
anything cuz you're in that foot you're
 

1299
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,269
anything cuz you're in that foot you're
still in that foot do you see didn't

1300
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:50,279
still in that foot do you see didn't
 

1301
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,629
still in that foot do you see didn't
change anything for you and now as I

1302
00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:52,639
change anything for you and now as I
 

1303
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,909
change anything for you and now as I
keep moving I'm always doing that so

1304
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:54,919
keep moving I'm always doing that so
 

1305
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:58,029
keep moving I'm always doing that so
here's her new uh equal opposite energy

1306
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:58,039
here's her new uh equal opposite energy
 

1307
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:00,990
here's her new uh equal opposite energy
come over here there you are and or

1308
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,000
come over here there you are and or
 

1309
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,590
come over here there you are and or
still in that foot it feels exactly the

1310
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:02,600
still in that foot it feels exactly the
 

1311
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,430
still in that foot it feels exactly the
same to you and as we rotate

1312
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
same to you and as we rotate
 

1313
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,389
same to you and as we rotate
again it feels exactly the same to you

1314
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:08,399
again it feels exactly the same to you
 

1315
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,029
again it feels exactly the same to you
you see okay and we just going

1316
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:12,039
you see okay and we just going
 

1317
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:15,110
you see okay and we just going
incrementally down as we're coming

1318
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,120
incrementally down as we're coming
 

1319
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,710
incrementally down as we're coming
around okay so we

1320
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:18,720
around okay so we
 

1321
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,269
around okay so we
go same foot she's pushing I

1322
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:24,279
go same foot she's pushing I
 

1323
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:27,549
go same foot she's pushing I
turn same foot you see feels the same

1324
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:27,559
turn same foot you see feels the same
 

1325
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,509
turn same foot you see feels the same
and I start rotating the

1326
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:30,519
and I start rotating the
 

1327
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:36,269
and I start rotating the
arm feels the same till he's down

1328
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:36,279
arm feels the same till he's down
 

1329
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:40,629
arm feels the same till he's down
okay one thing you'll

1330
00:33:40,629 --> 00:33:40,639

 

1331
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:44,389

1332
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:44,399
notice on the other one where I go let
 

1333
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,310
notice on the other one where I go let
me just do it please we know it doesn't

1334
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,320
me just do it please we know it doesn't
 

1335
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,590
me just do it please we know it doesn't
work but let me do it okay I do you see

1336
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:48,600
work but let me do it okay I do you see
 

1337
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,830
work but let me do it okay I do you see
this but he can actually step his foot

1338
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:52,840
this but he can actually step his foot
 

1339
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,310

equal and oppos energy that foot gets

1342
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,000
equal and oppos energy that foot gets
 

1343
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,269
equal and oppos energy that foot gets
pinned you see he doesn't do that

1344
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:02,279
pinned you see he doesn't do that
 

1345
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,710

choreography step the foot's getting

1346
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:04,720
choreography step the foot's getting
 

1347
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,950

pinned and now his center of gravity is

1348
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:08,960
pinned and now his center of gravity is
 

1349
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,990
pinned and now his center of gravity is
traveling up his body which makes the

1350
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
traveling up his body which makes the
 

1351
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,589
traveling up his body which makes the
line of gravity come outside his base

1352
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:14,599
line of gravity come outside his base
 

1353
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:18,349
line of gravity come outside his base
and support it's almost on the edge it's

1354
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:18,359
and support it's almost on the edge it's
 

1355
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:22,669
and support it's almost on the edge it's
like right here you get it and so now I

1356
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:22,679
like right here you get it and so now I
 

1357
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:29,430
like right here you get it and so now I
go and he falls outside of that base

1358
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:29,440

 

1359
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,270

guys see that all right let's try

1360
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:33,280
guys see that all right let's try
 

1361
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,669
guys see that all right let's try
it if if uh just let me make a side note

1362
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:36,679
it if if uh just let me make a side note
 

1363
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:41,190
it if if uh just let me make a side note
if your UK did take that step in it's

1364
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,200
if your UK did take that step in it's
 

1365
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,669
if your UK did take that step in it's
it's possible you can get under these

1366
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:43,679
it's possible you can get under these
 

1367
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,149
it's possible you can get under these
pressure lines right and all you're

1368
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:46,159
pressure lines right and all you're
 

1369
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,750
pressure lines right and all you're
going to do is on the wherever they land

1370
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:48,760
going to do is on the wherever they land
 

1371
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,349
going to do is on the wherever they land
you repeat the same geometry you get it

1372
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:51,359
you repeat the same geometry you get it
 

1373
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,149
you repeat the same geometry you get it
it would be a

1374
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:53,159
it would be a
 

1375
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,270
it would be a
counter a lot of times you can't because

1376
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:56,280
counter a lot of times you can't because
 

1377
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,710
counter a lot of times you can't because
I already pinned the foot but he got it

1378
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:58,720
I already pinned the foot but he got it
 

1379
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,069
I already pinned the foot but he got it
he lowered the center you see okay it's

1380
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:01,079
he lowered the center you see okay it's
 

1381
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:03,310
he lowered the center you see okay it's
from here that I do that same thing you

1382
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:03,320
from here that I do that same thing you
 

1383
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,230
from here that I do that same thing you
see he couldn't step a second time okay

1384
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
see he couldn't step a second time okay
 

1385
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,030
see he couldn't step a second time okay
uh but let's just try it without the

1386
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,040
uh but let's just try it without the
 

1387
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,870
uh but let's just try it without the
counter okay all right okay now we have

1388
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:12,880
counter okay all right okay now we have
 

1389
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,950
counter okay all right okay now we have
that dictum that we use which is uh the

1390
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:15,960
that dictum that we use which is uh the
 

1391
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,310
that dictum that we use which is uh the
only reason I'm

1392
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:17,320
only reason I'm
 

1393
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,390
only reason I'm
turning is because they're pushing so

1394
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:20,400
turning is because they're pushing so
 

1395
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,030
turning is because they're pushing so
when push turn Okay um and which is why

1396
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,040
when push turn Okay um and which is why
 

1397
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,550
when push turn Okay um and which is why
we're going to turn and iido you're

1398
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:26,560
we're going to turn and iido you're
 

1399
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,150
we're going to turn and iido you're
going to use a spiraling geometry at all

1400
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:29,160
going to use a spiraling geometry at all
 

1401
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,109
going to use a spiraling geometry at all
times uh which means if you reverse

1402
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:32,119
times uh which means if you reverse
 

1403
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:34,710
times uh which means if you reverse
engineer that UK is going to push at all

1404
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:34,720
engineer that UK is going to push at all
 

1405
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,030
engineer that UK is going to push at all
times hence our our uh prescription for

1406
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:38,040
times hence our our uh prescription for
 

1407
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,470
times hence our our uh prescription for
spinal displacement okay but a lot of

1408
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
spinal displacement okay but a lot of
 

1409
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,109
spinal displacement okay but a lot of
schools don't do that and then the

1410
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:42,119
schools don't do that and then the
 

1411
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,870
schools don't do that and then the
physics is wrong okay so we'll do the

1412
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:44,880
physics is wrong okay so we'll do the
 

1413
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,349
physics is wrong okay so we'll do the
same thing uh but now he's he's pu he's

1414
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:49,359
same thing uh but now he's he's pu he's
 

1415
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,710
same thing uh but now he's he's pu he's
going to be pushing you get it so we're

1416
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:51,720
going to be pushing you get it so we're
 

1417
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,829
going to be pushing you get it so we're
like in here in E he he's got some push

1418
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:54,839
like in here in E he he's got some push
 

1419
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:57,630
like in here in E he he's got some push
to him you see that well all all of this

1420
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:57,640
to him you see that well all all of this
 

1421
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,230
to him you see that well all all of this
that we just did it just becomes easier

1422
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,240
that we just did it just becomes easier
 

1423
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,589
that we just did it just becomes easier
okay boom just becomes easier okay but

1424
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:05,599
okay boom just becomes easier okay but
 

1425
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,829
okay boom just becomes easier okay but
the other one might also be easier cuz

1426
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:08,839
the other one might also be easier cuz
 

1427
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:11,430
the other one might also be easier cuz
he's pushing you see and I go like this

1428
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:11,440
he's pushing you see and I go like this
 

1429
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,630
he's pushing you see and I go like this
but you can see there's a little tint

1430
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:14,640
but you can see there's a little tint
 

1431
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,270
but you can see there's a little tint
where it got behind you see that and

1432
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,280
where it got behind you see that and
 

1433
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,990
where it got behind you see that and
people you're trying to arrest or people

1434
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,000
people you're trying to arrest or people
 

1435
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,750
people you're trying to arrest or people
that are going with your program or

1436
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:21,760
that are going with your program or
 

1437
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,109
that are going with your program or
don't know your chorography it's that

1438
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:24,119
don't know your chorography it's that
 

1439
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,829
don't know your chorography it's that
little quarter of the rotation

1440
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:27,839
little quarter of the rotation
 

1441
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,550
little quarter of the rotation
where they resist and change what's

1442
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:29,560
where they resist and change what's
 

1443
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,990
where they resist and change what's
going to happen okay which we

1444
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:31,000
going to happen okay which we
 

1445
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,510
going to happen okay which we
demonstrated statically why because the

1446
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:33,520
demonstrated statically why because the
 

1447
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,829
demonstrated statically why because the
equal and opposite line is going to you

1448
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:35,839
equal and opposite line is going to you
 

1449
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,150
equal and opposite line is going to you
is going to generate an angle

1450
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,160
is going to generate an angle
 

1451
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,309
is going to generate an angle
disturbance between your contact points

1452
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:39,319
disturbance between your contact points
 

1453
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:43,230
disturbance between your contact points
of your Bas of support okay all right so

1454

do uh you're yeah you're there put your
static okay and I'm going to do like the

1460
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:52,960
static okay and I'm going to do like the
 

1461
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,750
static okay and I'm going to do like the
classic idag get to the back okay and

1462
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:56,760
classic idag get to the back okay and

do so here we have a taller UK and
 

1467
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,230
do so here we have a taller UK and
you're not pushing you just hold in

1468
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:05,240
you're not pushing you just hold in
 

1469
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,829
you're not pushing you just hold in
there I don't know you really like his

1470
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:06,839
there I don't know you really like his
 

1471
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,829
there I don't know you really like his
watch or something okay and she and he's

1472
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839
watch or something okay and she and he's
 

1473
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,109
watch or something okay and she and he's
going to try to get to the

1474
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:12,119
going to try to get to the
 

1475
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:16,630
going to try to get to the
dock okay cool and uh let's pay

1476
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:16,640
dock okay cool and uh let's pay
 

1477
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,190
dock okay cool and uh let's pay
attention to

1478
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:18,200
attention to
 

1479
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,190
attention to
this is

1480
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:20,200
this is
 

1481
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,109
this is
he behind her shoulder yeah sort

1482
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:25,119
he behind her shoulder yeah sort
 

1483
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,230
he behind her shoulder yeah sort
of right

1484
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,240
of right
 

1485
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,430
of right
am the camera is that making sense what

1486
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:29,440
am the camera is that making sense what
 

1487
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,790
am the camera is that making sense what
I'm

1488
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:30,800
I'm
 

1489
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,550
I'm
saying if we if we put them on a grid

1490
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:35,560
saying if we if we put them on a grid
 

1491
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,990
saying if we if we put them on a grid
12:00

1492
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,000
12:00
 

1493
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,510
12:00
6:00 and we cut on the 93 line he's he's

1494
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
6:00 and we cut on the 93 line he's he's
 

1495
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,430
6:00 and we cut on the 93 line he's he's
got part of his body on that side of the

1496
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:46,440
got part of his body on that side of the
 

1497
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,510
got part of his body on that side of the
line you see that

1498
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:50,520

 

1499
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,109

okay but is that behind

1500
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:54,119
okay but is that behind
 

1501
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:57,190
okay but is that behind
her got it so you come over here here

1502
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:57,200
her got it so you come over here here
 

1503
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,069
her got it so you come over here here
here's her spine

1504
00:37:59,069 --> 00:37:59,079
here's her spine
 

1505
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:02,910
here's her spine
line he's actually south of the spine

1506
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:02,920
line he's actually south of the spine
 

1507
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,030
line he's actually south of the spine
line okay so now let's say you were

1508
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,040
line okay so now let's say you were
 

1509
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,570
line okay so now let's say you were
going to do

1510
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:06,580
going to do
 

1511
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,510
going to do
[Music]

1512
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:08,520
[Music]
 

1513
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,150
[Music]
slowly

1514
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,160
slowly
 

1515
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,589
slowly
okay no no no T slow down you're going

1516
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:14,599
okay no no no T slow down you're going
 

1517
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,230
okay no no no T slow down you're going
to go really slow you're going to bring

1518
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,240
to go really slow you're going to bring
 

1519
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,150
to go really slow you're going to bring
her around here okay he's bringing her

1520
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160
her around here okay he's bringing her
 

1521
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,750
her around here okay he's bringing her
around stay there and we know there's

1522
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:22,760
around stay there and we know there's
 

1523
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,910
around stay there and we know there's
going to be an opposite and equal energy

1524
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:25,920
going to be an opposite and equal energy
 

1525
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,349
going to be an opposite and equal energy
that's coming to what you're doing okay

1526
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:28,359
that's coming to what you're doing okay
 

1527
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:30,390
that's coming to what you're doing okay
and it cuts

1528
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:30,400
and it cuts
 

1529
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,069
and it cuts
across it cuts on the radius so every

1530
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
across it cuts on the radius so every
 

1531
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,829
across it cuts on the radius so every
degree of rotation that you do

1532
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:36,839
degree of rotation that you do
 

1533
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:41,349
degree of rotation that you do
eventually right here is

1534
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:41,359
eventually right here is
 

1535
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,710
eventually right here is
where it is now between

1536
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:44,720
where it is now between
 

1537
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,990
where it is now between
your Bas of support you see and now it's

1538
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:49,000
your Bas of support you see and now it's
 

1539
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,150
your Bas of support you see and now it's
the angle of disturbance okay so let me

1540
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,160
the angle of disturbance okay so let me
 

1541
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,230
the angle of disturbance okay so let me
in stay

1542
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:55,240
in stay
 

1543
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,829
in stay
there back

1544
00:38:58,829 --> 00:38:58,839

 

1545
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,069

he's got part of him behind me but not

1546
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:02,079
he's got part of him behind me but not
 

1547
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,750
he's got part of him behind me but not
so he can bring me here to his Center do

1548
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:04,760
so he can bring me here to his Center do
 

1549
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,510
so he can bring me here to his Center do
you see but now as he starts to rotate

1550
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:07,520
you see but now as he starts to rotate
 

1551
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,510
you see but now as he starts to rotate
more and he's trying to bring it around

1552
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:09,520
more and he's trying to bring it around
 

1553
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,150
more and he's trying to bring it around
that energy right there you

1554
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:13,160
that energy right there you
 

1555
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,270
that energy right there you
see is cutting between his basic support

1556
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:17,280
see is cutting between his basic support
 

1557
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,109
see is cutting between his basic support
okay and we see this all the

1558
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:20,119
okay and we see this all the
 

1559
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:24,470
okay and we see this all the
time uh let's change the UK or change

1560
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:24,480
time uh let's change the UK or change
 

1561
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,069
time uh let's change the UK or change
the rules

1562
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:29,079

 

1563
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:32,910

okay nope go back you're just

1564
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:32,920
okay nope go back you're just
 

1565
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,589
okay nope go back you're just
grabbing she has to move cool all right

1566
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:36,599
grabbing she has to move cool all right
 

1567
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:39,750
grabbing she has to move cool all right
she got further back than him but if you

1568
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:39,760
she got further back than him but if you
 

1569
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,630
she got further back than him but if you
come look over

1570
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:42,640
come look over
 

1571
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,750
come look over
here in other words from the 12 to three

1572
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:45,760
here in other words from the 12 to three
 

1573
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,589
here in other words from the 12 to three
line is she that side of it yes but in

1574
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:50,599
line is she that side of it yes but in
 

1575
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,150
line is she that side of it yes but in
terms of

1576
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,160
terms of
 

1577
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,270
terms of
rotation this is the line that's

1578
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:54,280
rotation this is the line that's
 

1579
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,910
rotation this is the line that's
important do you see and and she's

1580
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:57,920
important do you see and and she's
 

1581
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,589
important do you see and and she's
not okay and so usually what happens is

1582
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:01,599
not okay and so usually what happens is
 

1583
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,470
not okay and so usually what happens is
your UK is going to step into it go

1584
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:05,480
your UK is going to step into it go
 

1585
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,910
your UK is going to step into it go
ahead and do 10 then UK took that step

1586
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:08,920
ahead and do 10 then UK took that step
 

1587
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,589
ahead and do 10 then UK took that step
again you see and that's

1588
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:12,599
again you see and that's
 

1589
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,710
again you see and that's
choreography and in real in real in

1590
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:15,720
choreography and in real in real in
 

1591
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,109
choreography and in real in real in
reality it would also be a counter it's

1592
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:18,119
reality it would also be a counter it's
 

1593
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,910
reality it would also be a counter it's
more of a counter okay

1594
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:20,920
more of a counter okay
 

1595
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,069
more of a counter okay
or you're

1596
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:24,079
or you're
 

1597
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,550
or you're
there and we're here you can see see

1598
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:26,560
there and we're here you can see see
 

1599
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,470
there and we're here you can see see
she's not on the other side of that line

1600
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:29,480
she's not on the other side of that line
 

1601
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,589
she's not on the other side of that line
here's where your Senpai UK goes

1602
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:33,599
here's where your Senpai UK goes
 

1603
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,030
here's where your Senpai UK goes
off I'm not going

1604
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,040
off I'm not going
 

1605
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,109
off I'm not going
go you see they just shut your Technique

1606
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:41,119
go you see they just shut your Technique
 

1607
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,230
go you see they just shut your Technique
down okay because you have to choose

1608
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,240
down okay because you have to choose
 

1609
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,470
down okay because you have to choose
between either getting pulled off

1610
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:46,480
between either getting pulled off
 

1611
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,589
between either getting pulled off
balance or making it obvious that you're

1612
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:49,599
balance or making it obvious that you're
 

1613
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,870
balance or making it obvious that you're
musling the hell out of it do you see so

1614
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:51,880
musling the hell out of it do you see so
 

1615
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,910
musling the hell out of it do you see so
you don't as the Senai nogget and they

1616
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:54,920
you don't as the Senai nogget and they
 

1617
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,069
you don't as the Senai nogget and they
keep going like

1618
00:40:57,069 --> 00:40:57,079
keep going like
 

1619
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,589
keep going like
but for their Shan they're like they're

1620
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:00,599
but for their Shan they're like they're
 

1621
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,430
but for their Shan they're like they're
like going all over the place right

1622
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:02,440
like going all over the place right
 

1623
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,270
like going all over the place right
there're as light as a feather

1624
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:04,280
there're as light as a feather
 

1625
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,230
there're as light as a feather
all right and I don't understand how

1626
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,240
all right and I don't understand how
 

1627
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,309
all right and I don't understand how
that would ever be understood as

1628
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:08,319
that would ever be understood as
 

1629
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,470
that would ever be understood as
spiritual maturity you're obviously a

1630
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:10,480
spiritual maturity you're obviously a
 

1631
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,829
spiritual maturity you're obviously a
fraud okay all right so uh watch what we

1632
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:15,839
fraud okay all right so uh watch what we
 

1633
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,710
fraud okay all right so uh watch what we
do and this is why we do it okay so he

1634
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:19,720
do and this is why we do it okay so he
 

1635
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,950
do and this is why we do it okay so he
has to spinally displac you get it so he

1636
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:22,960
has to spinally displac you get it so he
 

1637
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,589
has to spinally displac you get it so he
finally displaces done it and we have

1638
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:26,599
finally displaces done it and we have
 

1639
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:28,630
finally displaces done it and we have
our energetic reasons for that but

1640
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:28,640
our energetic reasons for that but
 

1641
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,990
our energetic reasons for that but
there's a concentric relationship

1642
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:31,000
there's a concentric relationship
 

1643
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,790
there's a concentric relationship
between the energetics and the Marshall

1644
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:33,800
between the energetics and the Marshall
 

1645
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,510
between the energetics and the Marshall
aspects okay so I just can't get to the

1646
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:37,520
aspects okay so I just can't get to the
 

1647
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,670
aspects okay so I just can't get to the
back of

1648
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:38,680
back of
 

1649
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,990
back of
somebody no matter how much I enter I

1650
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:43,000
somebody no matter how much I enter I
 

1651
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,349
somebody no matter how much I enter I
can't get to the back of where the

1652
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:46,359
can't get to the back of where the
 

1653
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:48,910
can't get to the back of where the
spiral rotation is going to happen

1654
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:48,920
spiral rotation is going to happen
 

1655
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,990
spiral rotation is going to happen
without you passing me I just can't so

1656
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,000
without you passing me I just can't so
 

1657
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,230
without you passing me I just can't so
um let's do it on this side I could try

1658
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:57,240
um let's do it on this side I could try
 

1659
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,710
um let's do it on this side I could try
I could really try

1660
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:00,720
I could really try
 

1661
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,870
I could really try
okay but that step is not Marshall that

1662
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:03,880
okay but that step is not Marshall that
 

1663
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,750
okay but that step is not Marshall that
is dorus pal you get it that's not a

1664
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:06,760
is dorus pal you get it that's not a
 

1665
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,349
is dorus pal you get it that's not a
marshall stat okay so energetically we

1666
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:10,359
marshall stat okay so energetically we
 

1667
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:13,150
marshall stat okay so energetically we
know he's finally displacing p and we

1668
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:13,160
know he's finally displacing p and we
 

1669
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,750
know he's finally displacing p and we
also know

1670
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:14,760
also know
 

1671
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,589
also know
martially that he has to push for me to

1672
00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:18,599
martially that he has to push for me to
 

1673
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,630
martially that he has to push for me to
turn you get it but a lot of people and

1674
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:21,640
turn you get it but a lot of people and
 

1675
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,230
turn you get it but a lot of people and
we know I'm going to turn because it's

1676
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:23,240
we know I'm going to turn because it's
 

1677
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,870
we know I'm going to turn because it's
like he I'm going to do spiral geometry

1678
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:25,880
like he I'm going to do spiral geometry
 

1679
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,349
like he I'm going to do spiral geometry
okay but a lot of people here will try

1680
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:28,359
okay but a lot of people here will try
 

1681
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:31,470
okay but a lot of people here will try
to enter and get themselves and they

1682
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:31,480
to enter and get themselves and they
 

1683
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,349
to enter and get themselves and they
consider this is the right place to be

1684
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:34,359
consider this is the right place to be
 

1685
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:37,670
consider this is the right place to be
but as you start rotating I can kind of

1686
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:37,680
but as you start rotating I can kind of
 

1687
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,630
but as you start rotating I can kind of
feel my right foot here right as I start

1688
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:41,640
feel my right foot here right as I start
 

1689
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,589
feel my right foot here right as I start
going it's getting weaker and weaker and

1690
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:43,599
going it's getting weaker and weaker and
 

1691
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,950
going it's getting weaker and weaker and
weaker it's starting to pull me off on

1692
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:45,960
weaker it's starting to pull me off on
 

1693
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,309
weaker it's starting to pull me off on
that opposite equal energy between my

1694
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:48,319
that opposite equal energy between my
 

1695
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,150
that opposite equal energy between my
two feet okay

1696
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:51,160
two feet okay
 

1697
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,510
two feet okay
so we instead obey the energetic law

1698
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:55,520
so we instead obey the energetic law
 

1699
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,510
so we instead obey the energetic law
which gives you to the martial law he's

1700
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:57,520
which gives you to the martial law he's
 

1701
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,910
which gives you to the martial law he's
finally displacing and then I bring him

1702
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:00,920
finally displacing and then I bring him
 

1703
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,549
finally displacing and then I bring him
around and I

1704
00:43:03,549 --> 00:43:03,559
around and I
 

1705
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:08,230
around and I
enter here and now I'm where I need to

1706
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,240
enter here and now I'm where I need to
 

1707
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,990
enter here and now I'm where I need to
be so if you get that

1708
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:13,000

 

1709
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,950

Joe and you draw it over to the top and

1710
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:15,960
Joe and you draw it over to the top and
 

1711
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,710
Joe and you draw it over to the top and
you can see my spine is just right of

1712
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:21,720
you can see my spine is just right of
 

1713
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,390
you can see my spine is just right of
his spine camera I don't know where you

1714
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:24,400
his spine camera I don't know where you
 

1715
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,349
his spine camera I don't know where you
need to move to see it

1716
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:30,359

 

1717
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:32,630

okay and that

1718
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:32,640
okay and that
 

1719
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,150
okay and that
foot is on that line do you guys see

1720
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:37,160
foot is on that line do you guys see
 

1721
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,790
foot is on that line do you guys see
that okay so now I can do this kazushi

1722
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:42,800
that okay so now I can do this kazushi
 

1723
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,270
that okay so now I can do this kazushi
and if we look at the kazushi angle

1724
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:45,280
and if we look at the kazushi angle
 

1725
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,470
and if we look at the kazushi angle
let's have it over

1726
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:48,480

 

1727
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,829

here it is between his Bas of

1728
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:52,839
here it is between his Bas of
 

1729
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,150
here it is between his Bas of
supports you guys see that that's where

1730
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,160
supports you guys see that that's where
 

1731
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,790
supports you guys see that that's where
where his angle is so that's where he

1732
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:58,800
where his angle is so that's where he
 

1733
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,030
where his angle is so that's where he
can be taken off

1734
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,040
can be taken off
 

1735
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,109
can be taken off
out you guys see that as opposed to this

1736
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:05,119
out you guys see that as opposed to this
 

1737
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,829
out you guys see that as opposed to this
just uh pretend

1738
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:09,839

 

1739
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,630

okay which your your your kohai will do

1740
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:13,640
okay which your your your kohai will do
 

1741
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,470
okay which your your your kohai will do
for you but your Senpai won't and

1742
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:15,480
for you but your Senpai won't and
 

1743
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,870
for you but your Senpai won't and
definitely not your Shan they're not

1744
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:16,880
definitely not your Shan they're not
 

1745
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,390
definitely not your Shan they're not
going to do okay you guys get it so he

1746
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,400
going to do okay you guys get it so he
 

1747
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,430
going to do okay you guys get it so he
has to push I bring him around and so

1748
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:23,440
has to push I bring him around and so
 

1749
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,150
has to push I bring him around and so
that I can get to where I need to be for

1750
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:26,160
that I can get to where I need to be for
 

1751
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,670
that I can get to where I need to be for
spiraling kazushi that I'm going to use

1752
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:28,680
spiraling kazushi that I'm going to use
 

1753
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,150
spiraling kazushi that I'm going to use
okay all right so let's uh play with

1754
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:31,160
okay all right so let's uh play with
 

1755
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,470
okay all right so let's uh play with
those two versions no spinal

1756
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:33,480
those two versions no spinal
 

1757
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,150
those two versions no spinal
displacement and try to get to the back

1758
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:36,160
displacement and try to get to the back
 

1759
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,790
displacement and try to get to the back
don't go with it and then the second one

1760
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:38,800
don't go with it and then the second one
 

1761
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,710
don't go with it and then the second one
spinal displacement and get all the way

1762
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:41,720
spinal displacement and get all the way
 

1763
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,670
spinal displacement and get all the way
on the other side of the spine so that

1764
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:43,680
on the other side of the spine so that
 

1765
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,710
on the other side of the spine so that
you can keep that ground Vector okay all

1766
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:48,720

 

1767
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,710

right okay now there's a couple things

1768
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:51,720
right okay now there's a couple things
 

1769
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,950
right okay now there's a couple things
as we were obeying the scientific

1770
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:53,960
as we were obeying the scientific
 

1771
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,990
as we were obeying the scientific
principles there's a couple things

1772
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:56,000
principles there's a couple things
 

1773
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,589
principles there's a couple things
things that uh we've

1774
00:44:59,589 --> 00:44:59,599
things that uh we've
 

1775
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,150
things that uh we've
learned the axis of rotation has to be a

1776
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:03,160
learned the axis of rotation has to be a
 

1777
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,150
learned the axis of rotation has to be a
single point can't be a twoo okay

1778
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:07,160
single point can't be a twoo okay
 

1779
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,990
single point can't be a twoo okay
and it's further back do do you guys see

1780
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:11,000
and it's further back do do you guys see
 

1781
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,190
and it's further back do do you guys see
that it's further back so for example we

1782
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:14,200
that it's further back so for example we
 

1783
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,870
that it's further back so for example we
just put that down point this

1784
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:16,880
just put that down point this
 

1785
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,430
just put that down point this
out we had that first example of

1786
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:20,440
out we had that first example of
 

1787
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,309
out we had that first example of
eoa when you're going to double pivot

1788
00:45:23,309 --> 00:45:23,319
eoa when you're going to double pivot
 

1789
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:26,430
eoa when you're going to double pivot
you could be here and then you can he'll

1790
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:26,440
you could be here and then you can he'll
 

1791
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,829
you could be here and then you can he'll
choreograph that but when you're going

1792
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:28,839
choreograph that but when you're going
 

1793
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:31,870
choreograph that but when you're going
to single pivot it's back here it's back

1794
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:31,880
to single pivot it's back here it's back
 

1795
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,150
to single pivot it's back here it's back
here okay and if you're

1796
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:35,160
here okay and if you're
 

1797
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,349
here okay and if you're
doing a choreograph kazushi it looks

1798
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:38,359
doing a choreograph kazushi it looks
 

1799
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:41,589
doing a choreograph kazushi it looks
like I'm behind him do you see but I'm

1800
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:41,599
like I'm behind him do you see but I'm
 

1801
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,630
like I'm behind him do you see but I'm
not going to be and to be where I needed

1802
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:43,640
not going to be and to be where I needed
 

1803
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,309
not going to be and to be where I needed
to be I am back okay so he's deeper or

1804
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:49,319
to be I am back okay so he's deeper or
 

1805
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:50,870
to be I am back okay so he's deeper or
I'm deeper

1806
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
I'm deeper
 

1807
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,710
I'm deeper
in than what modern iido thinks

1808
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:54,720
in than what modern iido thinks
 

1809
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,950
in than what modern iido thinks
okay and and why don't they think it cuz

1810
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:57,960
okay and and why don't they think it cuz
 

1811
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,910
okay and and why don't they think it cuz
your kohai UK is going to choreograph

1812
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:00,920
your kohai UK is going to choreograph
 

1813
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,870
your kohai UK is going to choreograph
the past the angle of disturbance from

1814
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:02,880
the past the angle of disturbance from
 

1815
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,630
the past the angle of disturbance from
the equal and opposite energy okay

1816
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:08,640

 

1817
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,430

um because it's a concentric art while

1818
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:12,440
um because it's a concentric art while
 

1819
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,630
um because it's a concentric art while
I'm debating now the physics I have to

1820
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:14,640
I'm debating now the physics I have to
 

1821
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,790
I'm debating now the physics I have to
have a deeper axis of

1822
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:16,800
have a deeper axis of
 

1823
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,750
have a deeper axis of
rotation uh you're going to see that

1824
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:19,760
rotation uh you're going to see that
 

1825
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,069
rotation uh you're going to see that
concentrically it's going to also be

1826
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:22,079
concentrically it's going to also be
 

1827
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,230
concentrically it's going to also be
where I'm not vulnerable okay and so

1828
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:25,240
where I'm not vulnerable okay and so
 

1829
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,870
where I'm not vulnerable okay and so
when you get weapons that's where it's

1830
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:26,880
when you get weapons that's where it's
 

1831
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,589
when you get weapons that's where it's
going to come up all right so let's get

1832
00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:29,599
going to come up all right so let's get
 

1833
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,030
going to come up all right so let's get
we had a question on the little set that

1834
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,040
we had a question on the little set that
 

1835
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,510
we had a question on the little set that
we did so I'll get you guys up to speed

1836
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:35,520
we did so I'll get you guys up to speed
 

1837
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,990
we did so I'll get you guys up to speed
okay so he's going to go I go back you

1838
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:38,000
okay so he's going to go I go back you
 

1839
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,390
okay so he's going to go I go back you
got to slow down so I can talk and then

1840
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:40,400
got to slow down so I can talk and then
 

1841
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,109
got to slow down so I can talk and then
he goes boom and the question was he's

1842
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:46,119
he goes boom and the question was he's
 

1843
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:47,790
he goes boom and the question was he's
going to

1844
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:47,800
going to
 

1845
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,470
going to
slow go and let's uh the question I'll

1846
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:51,480
slow go and let's uh the question I'll
 

1847
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,910
slow go and let's uh the question I'll
just State the question the question is

1848
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:53,920
just State the question the question is
 

1849
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,390
just State the question the question is
why don't I me 10 con

1850
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:56,400
why don't I me 10 con
 

1851
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,470
why don't I me 10 con
okay and my answer is because you can't

1852
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:00,480
okay and my answer is because you can't
 

1853
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,430
okay and my answer is because you can't
enter deep enough to do it okay um so

1854
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:04,440
enter deep enough to do it okay um so
 

1855
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,910
enter deep enough to do it okay um so
let us explain why I would say that okay

1856
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:08,920
let us explain why I would say that okay
 

1857
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,190
let us explain why I would say that okay
uh he did a

1858
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,200
uh he did a
 

1859
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,910
uh he did a
ski right yeah okay I'll get you go go

1860
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:13,920
ski right yeah okay I'll get you go go
 

1861
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,630
ski right yeah okay I'll get you go go
go okay and then he does

1862
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:16,640
go okay and then he does
 

1863
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,870
go okay and then he does
makos cool all right let's start looking

1864
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:19,880
makos cool all right let's start looking
 

1865
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,470
makos cool all right let's start looking
at the my here he's going to go and

1866
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:23,480
at the my here he's going to go and
 

1867
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,430
at the my here he's going to go and
let's

1868
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:24,440
let's
 

1869
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,470
let's
assume that did not get checked out at

1870
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:27,480
assume that did not get checked out at
 

1871
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,950
assume that did not get checked out at
all okay so my feet can't leave yet got

1872
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:31,960
all okay so my feet can't leave yet got
 

1873
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,470
all okay so my feet can't leave yet got
it and nor would I if I could nor would

1874
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:35,480
it and nor would I if I could nor would
 

1875
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,069
it and nor would I if I could nor would
I want to because he'll just track me on

1876
00:47:39,069 --> 00:47:39,079
I want to because he'll just track me on
 

1877
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:44,230
I want to because he'll just track me on
the ADI show the tracking and hit boom

1878
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:44,240
the ADI show the tracking and hit boom
 

1879
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,150
the ADI show the tracking and hit boom
okay so I have to wait for the weapon to

1880
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:48,160
okay so I have to wait for the weapon to
 

1881
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,630
okay so I have to wait for the weapon to
commit you see which is last night's

1882
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:51,640
commit you see which is last night's
 

1883
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,349
commit you see which is last night's
video and I follow it all the way past

1884
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:54,359
video and I follow it all the way past
 

1885
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:57,870
video and I follow it all the way past
me and now I have a zone of sanctuary

1886
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:57,880
me and now I have a zone of sanctuary
 

1887
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,790
me and now I have a zone of sanctuary
that I can hit okay remember see there

1888
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:01,800
that I can hit okay remember see there
 

1889
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,950
that I can hit okay remember see there
remember yesterday if I'm here and I use

1890
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:04,960
remember yesterday if I'm here and I use
 

1891
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,270
remember yesterday if I'm here and I use
that same

1892
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:06,280
that same
 

1893
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,829
that same
footwork um you did the

1894
00:48:08,829 --> 00:48:08,839
footwork um you did the
 

1895
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:13,109
footwork um you did the
Makia he goes down and I do a little one

1896
00:48:13,109 --> 00:48:13,119
Makia he goes down and I do a little one
 

1897
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,670
Makia he goes down and I do a little one
he'll just hit me on the in movement of

1898
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:15,680
he'll just hit me on the in movement of
 

1899
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,710
he'll just hit me on the in movement of
the sword so I have to wait for that

1900
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:17,720
the sword so I have to wait for that
 

1901
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,870
the sword so I have to wait for that
thing to pass me okay so when can you ad

1902
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:20,880
thing to pass me okay so when can you ad
 

1903
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,390
thing to pass me okay so when can you ad
me after the after the Joe has passed

1904
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:24,400
me after the after the Joe has passed
 

1905
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,270
me after the after the Joe has passed
its point penetration that's when you

1906
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,280
its point penetration that's when you
 

1907
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,270
its point penetration that's when you
can do it otherwise you're just going to

1908
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:29,280
can do it otherwise you're just going to
 

1909
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,870
can do it otherwise you're just going to
re re uh Vector your targeting and get

1910
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:31,880
re re uh Vector your targeting and get
 

1911
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,190
re re uh Vector your targeting and get
me okay so let's go there here's the ski

1912
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:35,200
me okay so let's go there here's the ski
 

1913
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,470
me okay so let's go there here's the ski
and know my sword is here and let's look

1914
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:37,480
and know my sword is here and let's look
 

1915
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:42,069
and know my sword is here and let's look
at uh the range of the ski okay so make

1916
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:42,079
at uh the range of the ski okay so make

you have enough could you get any more
 

1921
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,510
you have enough could you get any more
penetration all right cool that's what

1922
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:47,520

we like to see that you penetrated a
whole body so here's about where I am

1926

so I'm going to
take again not Marshall that's my new

1932
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:02,119
take again not Marshall that's my new
 

1933
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,109
take again not Marshall that's my new
pivot

1934
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:04,119
pivot
 

1935
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:10,190
pivot
point and I'm not on Vector do you see

1936
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:10,200
point and I'm not on Vector do you see
 

1937
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,270
point and I'm not on Vector do you see
okay we'll do it

1938
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:13,280
okay we'll do it
 

1939
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,230
okay we'll do it
again go start sure

1940
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:16,240
again go start sure
 

1941
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,990
again go start sure
boom

1942
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:21,000

 

1943
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,990

boom I can kind of maybe get it got it

1944
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:25,000
boom I can kind of maybe get it got it
 

1945
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,589
boom I can kind of maybe get it got it
maybe you're tall maybe even if you're

1946
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:26,599
maybe you're tall maybe even if you're
 

1947
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:28,510
maybe you're tall maybe even if you're
taller than me you can get it but I'm

1948
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:28,520
taller than me you can get it but I'm
 

1949
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,950
taller than me you can get it but I'm
doing some weird with my inner knee

1950
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:30,960
doing some weird with my inner knee
 

1951
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,230
doing some weird with my inner knee
here which I don't do cuz that's hurting

1952
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:33,240
here which I don't do cuz that's hurting
 

1953
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,190
here which I don't do cuz that's hurting
okay but let's say I'm just about there

1954
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:37,200
okay but let's say I'm just about there
 

1955
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,950
okay but let's say I'm just about there
okay got it again I don't think this is

1956
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:40,960
okay got it again I don't think this is
 

1957
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,670
okay got it again I don't think this is
Marshall okay I think your movement has

1958
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:43,680
Marshall okay I think your movement has
 

1959
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,309
Marshall okay I think your movement has
to be quick and agile okay but let's say

1960
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:48,319
to be quick and agile okay but let's say
 

1961
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,470
to be quick and agile okay but let's say
someone taller could get there

1962
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:51,480
someone taller could get there
 

1963
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,910
someone taller could get there
okay and again someone short all right

1964
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:54,920
okay and again someone short all right
 

1965
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,190
okay and again someone short all right
here we go

1966
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:56,200
here we go
 

1967
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,069
here we go
back

1968
00:49:57,069 --> 00:49:57,079
back
 

1969
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:03,910
back
out okay good your tush good boom I have

1970
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:03,920
out okay good your tush good boom I have
 

1971
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,309
out okay good your tush good boom I have
to wait I start

1972
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:06,319
to wait I start
 

1973
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,470
to wait I start
entering okay got it and

1974
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:10,480
entering okay got it and
 

1975
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,069
entering okay got it and
now I have to get that foot maneuver in

1976
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:14,079
now I have to get that foot maneuver in
 

1977
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:18,710
now I have to get that foot maneuver in
there you see let's go back rewind the

1978
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:18,720
there you see let's go back rewind the
 

1979
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,430
there you see let's go back rewind the
film bring your foot with you okay cool

1980
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:22,440
film bring your foot with you okay cool
 

1981
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,430
film bring your foot with you okay cool
and here's my rule when you're making up

1982
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:24,440
and here's my rule when you're making up
 

1983
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,950
and here's my rule when you're making up
choreography you cannot move faster than

1984
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:27,960
choreography you cannot move faster than
 

1985
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,190
choreography you cannot move faster than
your imagined opponent so he gets one

1986
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:32,200
your imagined opponent so he gets one
 

1987
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,990
your imagined opponent so he gets one
step I get one step he gets two steps I

1988
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,000
step I get one step he gets two steps I
 

1989
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,670
step I get one step he gets two steps I
get two steps okay otherwise I have to

1990
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:38,680
get two steps okay otherwise I have to
 

1991
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,230
get two steps okay otherwise I have to
be faster than him it's not realistic

1992
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:41,240
be faster than him it's not realistic
 

1993
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,030
be faster than him it's not realistic
okay so when he does his IDI step I got

1994
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:46,040
okay so when he does his IDI step I got
 

1995
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,630
okay so when he does his IDI step I got
one step you see and boom that's where

1996
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:50,640
one step you see and boom that's where
 

1997
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,230
one step you see and boom that's where
I'm going to

1998
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:52,240
I'm going to
 

1999
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,510
I'm going to
hit the duration between here

2000
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:56,520
hit the duration between here
 

2001
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,990
hit the duration between here
and here takes a long time you guys see

2002
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,000
and here takes a long time you guys see
 

2003
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,470
and here takes a long time you guys see
that even if I could have got here it

2004
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:02,480
that even if I could have got here it
 

2005
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,950
that even if I could have got here it
takes a long

2006
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:04,960
takes a long
 

2007
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,470
takes a long
time so this is what you have to worry

2008
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:10,480

 

2009
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,190

about I go

2010
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:14,200
about I go
 

2011
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,030
about I go
and you got to get all the way in your

2012
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:17,040
and you got to get all the way in your
 

2013
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,630
and you got to get all the way in your
ten Con in the time that I do that

2014
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:21,640
ten Con in the time that I do that
 

2015
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,349
ten Con in the time that I do that
okay so I go

2016
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:24,359
okay so I go
 

2017
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:26,069
okay so I go
one

2018
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:26,079
one
 

2019
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,829
one
boom boom boom but you got to get all

2020
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:29,839
boom boom boom but you got to get all
 

2021
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,950
boom boom boom but you got to get all
the way

2022
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:31,960
the way
 

2023
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,510
the way
around and even really he's taller than

2024
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:34,520
around and even really he's taller than
 

2025
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:42,750
around and even really he's taller than
me it's a long way to

2026
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:42,760

 

2027
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,789

get even if he swung the sword he might

2028
00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:46,799
get even if he swung the sword he might
 

2029
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:48,990
get even if he swung the sword he might
cut me

2030
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:49,000
cut me
 

2031
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,030
cut me
right

2032
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:51,040
right
 

2033
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,710
right
um but what's what probably might happen

2034
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:54,720
um but what's what probably might happen
 

2035
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,789
um but what's what probably might happen
so either iuchi happens which is not a

2036
00:51:57,789 --> 00:51:57,799
so either iuchi happens which is not a
 

2037
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:01,589
so either iuchi happens which is not a
solution or I go back the longer weapon

2038
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:01,599
solution or I go back the longer weapon
 

2039
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:23,309
solution or I go back the longer weapon
wins got

2040
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:23,319

 

2041
00:52:23,319 --> 00:52:27,829

it okay now let's say that he goes

2042
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:27,839
it okay now let's say that he goes
 

2043
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,069
it okay now let's say that he goes
closer cuz I like what you're doing

2044
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:30,079
closer cuz I like what you're doing
 

2045
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,630
closer cuz I like what you're doing
which is you're staying out of the

2046
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:31,640
which is you're staying out of the
 

2047
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,990
which is you're staying out of the
radius of the weapon okay if you shorten

2048
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,000
radius of the weapon okay if you shorten
 

2049
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,270
radius of the weapon okay if you shorten
the radius you could actually be faster

2050
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:38,280
the radius you could actually be faster
 

2051
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,190
the radius you could actually be faster
right okay so first let's see if you

2052
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:40,200
right okay so first let's see if you
 

2053
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,789
right okay so first let's see if you
understand what I'm saying Bo

2054
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:43,799
understand what I'm saying Bo
 

2055
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:47,910
understand what I'm saying Bo
good you're just going to enter

2056
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:47,920
good you're just going to enter
 

2057
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,150
good you're just going to enter
here cool and this is actually how I got

2058
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:51,160
here cool and this is actually how I got
 

2059
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:56,230
here cool and this is actually how I got
into range by shortening the radius okay

2060
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:56,240
into range by shortening the radius okay
 

2061
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,309
into range by shortening the radius okay
and again the downside is that you move

2062
00:52:59,309 --> 00:52:59,319
and again the downside is that you move
 

2063
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:04,069
and again the downside is that you move
inside the Joe to what

2064
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079

 

2065
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,470

range the kicking range the personal

2066
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,480
range the kicking range the personal
 

2067
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,750
range the kicking range the personal
weapon range okay so as I go here

2068
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:11,760
weapon range okay so as I go here
 

2069
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,230
weapon range okay so as I go here
bom you're going to move

2070
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:14,240
bom you're going to move
 

2071
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,750
bom you're going to move
in I know it's it's not your nature

2072
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:16,760
in I know it's it's not your nature
 

2073
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:24,150
in I know it's it's not your nature
anymore okay you got you going to come

2074
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:24,160

 

2075
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,349

in

2076
00:53:26,349 --> 00:53:26,359
in
 

2077
00:53:26,359 --> 00:53:30,510
in
you can't be going y do you

2078
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:30,520
you can't be going y do you
 

2079
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,750
you can't be going y do you
see after I've gone

2080
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:34,760
see after I've gone
 

2081
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,670
see after I've gone
young you do you got that you can only

2082
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:37,680
young you do you got that you can only
 

2083
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,789
young you do you got that you can only
go yin to my young because after that

2084
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:41,799
go yin to my young because after that
 

2085
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:43,950
go yin to my young because after that
you're just opening up stuff so if we

2086
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:43,960
you're just opening up stuff so if we
 

2087
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,630
you're just opening up stuff so if we
look at the original form where you just

2088
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:46,640
look at the original form where you just
 

2089
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,789
look at the original form where you just

2090
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:47,799
side
 

2091
00:53:47,799 --> 00:53:49,510
side
step

2092
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:49,520
step
 

2093
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,789
step
he is going y with my y okay here's in

2094
00:53:55,789 --> 00:53:55,799
he is going y with my y okay here's in
 

2095
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:59,309
he is going y with my y okay here's in
and he's matching it and now he goes Yin

2096
00:53:59,309 --> 00:53:59,319
and he's matching it and now he goes Yin
 

2097
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,950
and he's matching it and now he goes Yin
with my y he's going to cut me on the

2098
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:01,960
with my y he's going to cut me on the
 

2099
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,030
with my y he's going to cut me on the
back on the other one you see on these

2100
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:05,040
back on the other one you see on these
 

2101
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,870
back on the other one you see on these
other versions you're going in after my

2102
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:09,880
other versions you're going in after my
 

2103
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,829
other versions you're going in after my
yang has completed and that's why the

2104
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:12,839
yang has completed and that's why the
 

2105
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:15,829
yang has completed and that's why the
second Joe can come in or if you cut the

2106
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:15,839
second Joe can come in or if you cut the
 

2107
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,349
second Joe can come in or if you cut the
radius the personal weapon can come in

2108
00:54:18,349 --> 00:54:18,359
radius the personal weapon can come in
 

2109
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:20,789
radius the personal weapon can come in
cuz you're Yin when I'm just waiting I'm

2110
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:20,799
cuz you're Yin when I'm just waiting I'm
 

2111
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,589
cuz you're Yin when I'm just waiting I'm
already reset y okay all right let me

2112
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:23,599
already reset y okay all right let me
 

2113
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,990
already reset y okay all right let me
have you play with that

2114
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:26,000
have you play with that
 

2115
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,470
have you play with that
okay so what to sum up what we got so

2116
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:29,480
okay so what to sum up what we got so
 

2117
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,390
okay so what to sum up what we got so
far the the axis of rotation of the

2118
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:33,400
far the the axis of rotation of the
 

2119
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,710
far the the axis of rotation of the
Turning movement is much deeper than

2120
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:36,720
Turning movement is much deeper than
 

2121
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,030
Turning movement is much deeper than
contemporary iido thinks it is okay uh

2122
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,040
contemporary iido thinks it is okay uh
 

2123
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,829
contemporary iido thinks it is okay uh
again the first thing we showed is that

2124
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:42,839
again the first thing we showed is that
 

2125
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:45,390
again the first thing we showed is that
if it's not it's probably because you're

2126
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:45,400
if it's not it's probably because you're
 

2127
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,349
if it's not it's probably because you're
going to double pivot and as you rotate

2128
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:48,359
going to double pivot and as you rotate
 

2129
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:50,829
going to double pivot and as you rotate
the angle of disturbance is going to cut

2130
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:50,839
the angle of disturbance is going to cut
 

2131
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:52,789
the angle of disturbance is going to cut
through your base of support and it's

2132
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:52,799
through your base of support and it's
 

2133
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:56,710
through your base of support and it's
only solved by choreography okay okay um

2134
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:56,720
only solved by choreography okay okay um
 

2135
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,549
only solved by choreography okay okay um
and here what we're doing is the axis of

2136
00:54:59,549 --> 00:54:59,559
and here what we're doing is the axis of
 

2137
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:02,750
and here what we're doing is the axis of
rotation you see is too far in front uh

2138
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:02,760
rotation you see is too far in front uh
 

2139
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,510
rotation you see is too far in front uh
and because the concentric nature of the

2140
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:04,520
and because the concentric nature of the
 

2141
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,549
and because the concentric nature of the
art it's now not only physically

2142
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:08,559
art it's now not only physically
 

2143
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,030
art it's now not only physically
impossible as in the other examples it's

2144
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,040
impossible as in the other examples it's
 

2145
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,349
impossible as in the other examples it's
now not Marly viable because the yin and

2146
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:13,359
now not Marly viable because the yin and
 

2147
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,190
now not Marly viable because the yin and
the Yang trade places okay but if you

2148
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:16,200
the Yang trade places okay but if you
 

2149
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,309
the Yang trade places okay but if you
wanted to make it Marly viable you have

2150
00:55:19,309 --> 00:55:19,319
wanted to make it Marly viable you have
 

2151
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:21,870
wanted to make it Marly viable you have
to find a way of having your axis of

2152
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:21,880
to find a way of having your axis of
 

2153
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,029
to find a way of having your axis of
rotation happen deeper okay and this

2154
00:55:26,029 --> 00:55:26,039
rotation happen deeper okay and this
 

2155
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:28,349
rotation happen deeper okay and this
this is not the way the form is is is

2156
00:55:28,349 --> 00:55:28,359
this is not the way the form is is is
 

2157
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:31,630
this is not the way the form is is is
going but this one way to do it is the

2158
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:31,640
going but this one way to do it is the
 

2159
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,510
going but this one way to do it is the
guy charges way past okay like he just

2160
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:35,520
guy charges way past okay like he just
 

2161
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,990
guy charges way past okay like he just
goes balls to the wall and this is just

2162
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:38,000
goes balls to the wall and this is just
 

2163
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,309
goes balls to the wall and this is just
to demonstrate that the axis of rotation

2164
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:41,319
to demonstrate that the axis of rotation
 

2165
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:44,309
to demonstrate that the axis of rotation
in aido is much deeper than most people

2166
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:44,319
in aido is much deeper than most people
 

2167
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,069
in aido is much deeper than most people
think it is okay so if we're doing it

2168
00:55:47,069 --> 00:55:47,079
think it is okay so if we're doing it
 

2169
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:48,390
think it is okay so if we're doing it
again

2170
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:48,400
again
 

2171
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,789
again
slowly and we're just looking at these

2172
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:51,799
slowly and we're just looking at these
 

2173
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:56,710
slowly and we're just looking at these
rotation angles okay and I come in and I

2174
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:56,720
rotation angles okay and I come in and I
 

2175
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,870
rotation angles okay and I come in and I
run then you can see that the ten con is

2176
00:55:59,870 --> 00:55:59,880
run then you can see that the ten con is
 

2177
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,710
run then you can see that the ten con is
going to work and he's going to hit me

2178
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:01,720
going to work and he's going to hit me
 

2179
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,029
going to work and he's going to hit me
because he can't hit me there he's got a

2180
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:04,039
because he can't hit me there he's got a
 

2181
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:06,950
because he can't hit me there he's got a
Tenon to get online and now he can get

2182
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:06,960
Tenon to get online and now he can get
 

2183
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:20,910
Tenon to get online and now he can get
me okay so we'll demonstrate it

2184
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:20,920

 

2185
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,549

again and you can see that it will work

2186
00:56:23,549 --> 00:56:23,559
again and you can see that it will work
 

2187
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:25,950
again and you can see that it will work
okay but that is not the form

2188
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:25,960
okay but that is not the form
 

2189
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,230
okay but that is not the form
and that's kind of a dumb move I think

2190
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:29,240
and that's kind of a dumb move I think
 

2191
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,789
and that's kind of a dumb move I think
because he has a big knife and I don't

2192
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:31,799
because he has a big knife and I don't
 

2193
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:33,390
because he has a big knife and I don't
really want to run it people with big

2194
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:33,400
really want to run it people with big
 

2195
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,829
really want to run it people with big
knives I want to hit them from the

2196
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:34,839
knives I want to hit them from the
 

2197
00:56:34,839 --> 00:56:37,630
knives I want to hit them from the
outside where I have my advantage does

2198
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:37,640
outside where I have my advantage does
 

2199
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,549
outside where I have my advantage does
not make sense for the Joe to over

2200
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:39,559
not make sense for the Joe to over
 

2201
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:46,119
not make sense for the Joe to over
penetrate to that degree okay all right
