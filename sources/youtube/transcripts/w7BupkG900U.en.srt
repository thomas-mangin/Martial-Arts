culture is an apophatic term it's not a
 

183
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,670
culture is an apophatic term it's not a
place in my body like a lot of moderns

184
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
place in my body like a lot of moderns
 

185
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,469
place in my body like a lot of moderns
think when they talk about it use your

186
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:51,479
think when they talk about it use your
 

187
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,689
think when they talk about it use your
tonden aim your time you don't have a

188
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:53,699
tonden aim your time you don't have a
 

189
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:54,830
tonden aim your time you don't have a
taunted

190
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
taunted
 

191
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,830
taunted
until you can internalize yin and yang

192
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
until you can internalize yin and yang
 

193
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,530
until you can internalize yin and yang
and until they meet

194
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:00,540
and until they meet
 

195
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,870
and until they meet
in the midpoint of your body now you

196
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
in the midpoint of your body now you
 

197
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,350
in the midpoint of your body now you
have a taunted now you have a field

198
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
have a taunted now you have a field
 

199
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,650
have a taunted now you have a field
where yin and yang can be mixed to be

200
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:09,660
where yin and yang can be mixed to be
 

201
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,810
where yin and yang can be mixed to be
reconciled and indistinguishable from

202
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:11,820
reconciled and indistinguishable from
 

203
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,830
reconciled and indistinguishable from
each other

204
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:12,840
each other
 

205
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,710
each other
that's what your tandem is

206
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:15,720
that's what your tandem is
 

207
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,770
that's what your tandem is
so the pattern

208
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:18,780
so the pattern
 

209
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,749
so the pattern
of the mixing

210
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:20,759
of the mixing
 

211
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,570
of the mixing
is the rotating cross

212
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:23,580
is the rotating cross
 

213
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,790
is the rotating cross
that you've seen me mention many many

214
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:25,800
that you've seen me mention many many
 

215
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,810
that you've seen me mention many many
times

216
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:26,820
times
 

217
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,510
times
so I'm going to uh maybe you want to

218
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
so I'm going to uh maybe you want to
 

219
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,850
so I'm going to uh maybe you want to
come more in front maybe you need to

220
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:31,860
come more in front maybe you need to
 

221
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,950
come more in front maybe you need to
come around so you can see me

222
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:33,960
come around so you can see me
 

223
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,110
come around so you can see me
let us

224
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,120
let us
 

225
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,610
let us
say use this Band-Aid on this ball

226
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:40,620
say use this Band-Aid on this ball
 

227
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,830
say use this Band-Aid on this ball
as a reference point okay

228
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840

 

229
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,930

the yin and yang energy is going to mix

230
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:50,940
the yin and yang energy is going to mix
 

231
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,150
the yin and yang energy is going to mix
this way first

232
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160

 

233
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,870

then up

234
00:05:59,870 --> 00:05:59,880

 

235
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,350

you see

236
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360

 

237
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,730

cut it

238
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:04,740
cut it
 

239
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,469
cut it
then back the other one

240
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:09,479

 

241
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,870

and then down

242
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:11,880
and then down
 

243
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,790
and then down
you got it

244
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:13,800
you got it
 

245
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,710
you got it
I'll do it again

246
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:15,720
I'll do it again
 

247
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,650
I'll do it again
it's gonna go one way so in this case I

248
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:18,660
it's gonna go one way so in this case I
 

249
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,890
it's gonna go one way so in this case I
would be throwing to my left

250
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:21,900
would be throwing to my left
 

251
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,890
would be throwing to my left
the energy inside my body is going to

252
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:24,900
the energy inside my body is going to
 

253
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,070
the energy inside my body is going to
first mix to my right

254
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080

 

255
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,050

it's going to go up

256
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,060

 

257
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,370

it's going to mix to the left

258
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:37,380

 

259
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,770

and then it's going to go down

260
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:39,780
and then it's going to go down
 

261
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,890
and then it's going to go down
okay

262
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:42,900

 

263
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,189

so now come here

264
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:46,199
so now come here
 

265
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,010
so now come here
this point was made in the kokudosa

266
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,020
this point was made in the kokudosa
 

267
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,050
this point was made in the kokudosa
video

268
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,060
video
 

269
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,330
video
so his pushing is Young energy

270
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:56,340

 

271
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,050

you can see how deota

272
00:06:59,050 --> 00:06:59,060
you can see how deota
 

273
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,450
you can see how deota
aims it in the chest do you think that

274
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:02,460
aims it in the chest do you think that
 

275
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,170
aims it in the chest do you think that
this is this is technically

276
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,180
this is this is technically
 

277
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,770
this is this is technically
but only at a physiological level

278
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:09,780
but only at a physiological level
 

279
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,830
but only at a physiological level
this is

280
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
this is
 

281
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,170
this is
a energetic component level it's in my

282
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:15,180
a energetic component level it's in my
 

283
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,309
a energetic component level it's in my
chest

284
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
chest
 

285
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,689
chest
okay

286
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:17,699
okay
 

287
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,950
okay
I am going to Vector that down bounce it

288
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:21,960
I am going to Vector that down bounce it
 

289
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,450
I am going to Vector that down bounce it
off the ground

290
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:23,460
off the ground
 

291
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,670
off the ground
and that's where the mixing starts with

292
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
and that's where the mixing starts with
 

293
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,010
and that's where the mixing starts with
the Earth Energy the yinchi got it

294
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:30,020
the Earth Energy the yinchi got it
 

295
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:36,610
the Earth Energy the yinchi got it
dot oh now it's in my body meeting here

296
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:36,620
dot oh now it's in my body meeting here
 

297
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,430
dot oh now it's in my body meeting here
down now I have a tandem field

298
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:40,440
down now I have a tandem field
 

299
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,330
down now I have a tandem field
now what I do push

300
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:44,340

 

301
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,270

I'll feel the expansion of the Tom Den

302
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
I'll feel the expansion of the Tom Den
 

303
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,150
I'll feel the expansion of the Tom Den
as those energies are expanding and

304
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
as those energies are expanding and
 

305
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,870
as those energies are expanding and
pressing on each other and now I rotate

306
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:53,880
pressing on each other and now I rotate
 

307
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,210
pressing on each other and now I rotate
that I'm going to exaggerate it now I'm

308
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,220
that I'm going to exaggerate it now I'm
 

309
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,490
that I'm going to exaggerate it now I'm
gonna I'm gonna throw this way to my

310
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:58,500
gonna I'm gonna throw this way to my
 

311
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,969
gonna I'm gonna throw this way to my
left I'm going to rotate it

312
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:01,979
left I'm going to rotate it
 

313
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,309
left I'm going to rotate it
to the right

314
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
to the right
 

315
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,589
to the right
bring it up

316
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:06,599
bring it up
 

317
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:07,969
bring it up
you see

318
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:07,979
you see
 

319
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,909
you see
bring it back to the left

320
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:10,919
bring it back to the left
 

321
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:16,129
bring it back to the left
and then bring it down

322
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:16,139

 

323
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,790

if I was going to my right

324
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:19,800
if I was going to my right
 

325
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,730
if I was going to my right
it'll go to the left

326
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:22,740
it'll go to the left
 

327
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,409
it'll go to the left
up

328
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:24,419
up
 

329
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:32,630
up
over to the right and then down

330
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640

 

331
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,870

against your back

332
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:37,880

 

333
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,730

knowing that come back to the physical

334
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:40,740
knowing that come back to the physical
 

335
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,850
knowing that come back to the physical
component

336
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:43,860

 

337
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,790

that rotation

338
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
that rotation
 

339
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,370
that rotation
has a physical component and as you get

340
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:49,380
has a physical component and as you get
 

341
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,710
has a physical component and as you get
more skilled less and less of the

342
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:51,720
more skilled less and less of the
 

343
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,009
more skilled less and less of the
physical component is necessary

344
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:55,019
physical component is necessary
 

345
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,990
physical component is necessary
but

346
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,000
but
 

347
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,630
but
the physical component is never going to

348
00:08:59,630 --> 00:08:59,640
the physical component is never going to
 

349
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,150
the physical component is never going to
manifest in the waste

350
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
manifest in the waste
 

351
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,009
manifest in the waste
I'll show you what that looks like in

352
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:04,019
I'll show you what that looks like in
 

353
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,210
I'll show you what that looks like in
the waist

354
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:05,220
the waist
 

355
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,610

on this technique I have my pattern so
that she rotates to the right she writes

680
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:33,539
that she rotates to the right she writes
 

681
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,870
that she rotates to the right she writes
rotates up

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:35,880
rotates up
 

683
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,230
rotates up
then back to the left she rotates to the

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:39,240
then back to the left she rotates to the
 

685
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,690
then back to the left she rotates to the
right she goes up rotate it back to the

686
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:41,700
right she goes up rotate it back to the
 

687
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,390

down and then to the right that's that's

692
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:50,340
down and then to the right that's that's
 

693
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,510
