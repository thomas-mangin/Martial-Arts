that's the one I'm going to use so I'm
 

81
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,910
that's the one I'm going to use so I'm
here and I do this this time no rotation

82
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:38,920
here and I do this this time no rotation
 

83
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,710
here and I do this this time no rotation
boom

84
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:41,720

target is resistance okay it's young
 

97
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,630
target is resistance okay it's young
energy so and that's what I'm using to

98
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
energy so and that's what I'm using to
 

99
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,750
energy so and that's what I'm using to
project just like if he's pushing into

100
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:06,760
project just like if he's pushing into
