what we call a practice it's not just

36
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
what we call a practice it's not just
 

37
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,910
what we call a practice it's not just
my

38
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
my
 

39
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,869
my
intellect okay

00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
intellect okay
 

41
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,189
intellect okay
and there the reason they all go in is

42
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
and there the reason they all go in is
 

43
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,670
and there the reason they all go in is
because they are concentric to each

44
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
because they are concentric to each
 

45
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,029
because they are concentric to each
other so

46
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
other so
 

47
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,390
other so
the state of being that i'm in

48
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
the state of being that i'm in
 

49
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,350
the state of being that i'm in
is in all of those things and therefore

50
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
is in all of those things and therefore
 

51
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,990
is in all of those things and therefore
a transformation of my being

52
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
a transformation of my being
 

53
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,750
a transformation of my being

182
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
watch this kind of hollywood
 

183
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,470
watch this kind of hollywood
stuff

184
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
stuff
 

185
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,789
stuff
where your sword is out you see what it

186
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
where your sword is out you see what it
 

187
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,350
where your sword is out you see what it
does to my left elbow

188
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
does to my left elbow
 

189
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,750
does to my left elbow
it also exposes this

190
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
it also exposes this
 

191
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,869
it also exposes this
okay it exposes this to being pinned and

192
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
okay it exposes this to being pinned and
 

193
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,509
okay it exposes this to being pinned and
now i can't get the sword out

194
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
now i can't get the sword out
 

195
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,990
now i can't get the sword out
i want to operate on the center line of

196
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
i want to operate on the center line of
 

197
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,509
i want to operate on the center line of
my body

198
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
my body
 

199
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,910
my body
and my elbows are in

200
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
and my elbows are in
 

201
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,910
and my elbows are in
elbows in

202
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
elbows in
 

203
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,949
elbows in
now start to identify

204
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
now start to identify
 

205
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,309
now start to identify
the correct moves by the tension all the

206
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
the correct moves by the tension all the
 

207
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,270
the correct moves by the tension all the
while we are today paying attention to

208
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
while we are today paying attention to
 

209
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,509
while we are today paying attention to
the lower legs okay

210
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
the lower legs okay
 

211
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,390
the lower legs okay
so

212
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
so
 

213
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,189
so
sword is going to come out

214
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
sword is going to come out
 

215
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,430
sword is going to come out
in a tension-free

216
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
in a tension-free
 

217
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,790
in a tension-free
manner

218
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
manner
 

219
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,990
manner
when you feel the tension start to

220
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
when you feel the tension start to
 

221
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,670
when you feel the tension start to
develop

222
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
develop
 

223
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,510
develop
that's where you go to the next room

224
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
that's where you go to the next room
 

225
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,870
that's where you go to the next room
okay so

226
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
okay so
 

227
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,510
okay so
this is this is all tension free you can

228
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
this is this is all tension free you can
 

229
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,749
this is this is all tension free you can
see it's very easy to come out

230
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
see it's very easy to come out
 

231
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,310
see it's very easy to come out
and somewhere about here i start to feel

232
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
and somewhere about here i start to feel
 

233
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,270
and somewhere about here i start to feel
tension

234
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
tension
 

235
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,790
tension
in the upper

236
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
in the upper
 

237
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,189
in the upper
left quadrant so i'll exaggerate that

238
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
left quadrant so i'll exaggerate that
 

239
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,590
left quadrant so i'll exaggerate that
move and you see what it starts to do to

240
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
move and you see what it starts to do to
 

241
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,870
move and you see what it starts to do to
my right right scapula mechanism that's

242
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
my right right scapula mechanism that's
 

243
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,550
my right right scapula mechanism that's
tension

244
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
tension
 

245
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,390
tension
before you get there

246
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
before you get there
 

247
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,990
before you get there
on the eve of getting there you come up

248
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000

 

249
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,790

so

250
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
so
 

251
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,310
so
here i am

252
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
here i am
 

253
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,710
here i am
keep going tension

254
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
keep going tension
 

255
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,510
keep going tension
stay here and you come up you can come

256
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
stay here and you come up you can come
 

257
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,590
stay here and you come up you can come
up a little bit more bring the sword out

258
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
up a little bit more bring the sword out
 

259
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,629
up a little bit more bring the sword out
a little more if i keep going you'll see

260
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
a little more if i keep going you'll see
 

261
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,310
a little more if i keep going you'll see
i'll get that same

262
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
i'll get that same
 

263
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,550
i'll get that same
tension in the right scapula mechanism

264
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
tension in the right scapula mechanism
 

265
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,350
tension in the right scapula mechanism
so it goes

266
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360

 

267
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,350

not here

268
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360

 

269
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,510

not there

270
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
not there
 

271
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,350
not there
out

272
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
out
 

273
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,629
out
it's at this point that the left hand

274
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
it's at this point that the left hand
 

275
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,629
it's at this point that the left hand
is going to take over

276
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
is going to take over
 

277
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,230
is going to take over
so

278
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
so
 

279
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,390
so
the left hand is going to take the sword

280
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
the left hand is going to take the sword
 

281
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,550
the left hand is going to take the sword
off

282
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
off
 

283
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,990
off
and you'll see

284
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
and you'll see
 

285
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,150
and you'll see
if i keep going here

286
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
if i keep going here
 

287
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,150
if i keep going here
i'm going to get that same tension in

288
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
i'm going to get that same tension in
 

289
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,110
i'm going to get that same tension in
the left

290
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
the left
 

291
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,350
the left
scapula you'll feel it in your grip and

292
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
scapula you'll feel it in your grip and
 

293
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,309
scapula you'll feel it in your grip and
you can't get it out okay so on the eve

294
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:56,319
you can't get it out okay so on the eve
 

295
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,909
you can't get it out okay so on the eve
of getting there that's when you start

296
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
of getting there that's when you start
 

297
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:05,029
of getting there that's when you start
to turn the side

298
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039

 

299
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,670

a monitor for tension

300
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
a monitor for tension
 

301
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,350
a monitor for tension
lower legs because that's part of our

302
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
lower legs because that's part of our
 

303
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,070
lower legs because that's part of our
training today foot bones

304
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
training today foot bones
 

305
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,710
training today foot bones
monitor for tension

306
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720

 

307
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,390

the reason i'm letting the sword draw

308
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
the reason i'm letting the sword draw
 

309
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,590
the reason i'm letting the sword draw
is you can tell the sword is free

310
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
is you can tell the sword is free
 

311
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,150
is you can tell the sword is free
i don't i'm not pulling the right hand

312
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
i don't i'm not pulling the right hand
 

313
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,390
i don't i'm not pulling the right hand
to get the sword free

314
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
to get the sword free
 

315
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,029
to get the sword free
so i move the right hand to here and

316
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
so i move the right hand to here and
 

317
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,670
so i move the right hand to here and
then it turns and the sword is free

318
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
then it turns and the sword is free
 

319
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,230
then it turns and the sword is free
hence it drops freely

320
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
hence it drops freely
 

321
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,110
hence it drops freely
in contrast

322
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
in contrast
 

323
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,670
in contrast
i'm here sword is not dropping and i

324
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
i'm here sword is not dropping and i
 

325
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,670
i'm here sword is not dropping and i
have to pull it out with the right hand

326
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
have to pull it out with the right hand
 

327
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,350
have to pull it out with the right hand
that's going to bring the tension back

328
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
that's going to bring the tension back
 

329
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,110
that's going to bring the tension back
into the right spot

330
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
into the right spot
 

331
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,909
into the right spot
into the right skeptical mechanism so

332
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
into the right skeptical mechanism so
 

333
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:57,670
into the right skeptical mechanism so
very release very relaxed

334
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680

 

335
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,830

as you're doing this pay attention that

336
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
as you're doing this pay attention that
 

337
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,390
as you're doing this pay attention that
the left hand

338
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
the left hand
 

339
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,950
the left hand
does not prematurely grab it has the

340
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
does not prematurely grab it has the
 

341
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,189
does not prematurely grab it has the
same concern with

342
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
same concern with
 

343
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,150
same concern with
tension

344
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
tension
 

345
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,550
tension
as the right hand does so some of you

346
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
as the right hand does so some of you
 

347
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,270
as the right hand does so some of you
are

348
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
are
 

349
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,270
are
almost putting yourself in nico with

350
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
almost putting yourself in nico with

sternum solar plexus level
 

603
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,350
sternum solar plexus level
so i will demonstrate that the tension

604
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
so i will demonstrate that the tension
 

605
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,629
so i will demonstrate that the tension
shows up there i go here okay there

606
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
shows up there i go here okay there
 

607
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,230
shows up there i go here okay there
there's the tension

608
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,240
there's the tension
 

609
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,550
there's the tension
oh and i come up

610
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
oh and i come up
 

611
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,790
oh and i come up
okay and i keep going there's the

612
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
okay and i keep going there's the
 

613
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,750
okay and i keep going there's the
tension again and i'm up above the lower

614
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
tension again and i'm up above the lower
 

615
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,389
tension again and i'm up above the lower
sternum solar plexus level if i keep

616
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
sternum solar plexus level if i keep
 

617
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,310
sternum solar plexus level if i keep
that cut even

618
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
that cut even
 

619
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,629
that cut even
you're going to see i'm activating the

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,949
you're going to see i'm activating the
delta

622

623
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,790

so this is done

624
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800
so this is done
 

625
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,949
so this is done

we're just monitoring for tension
 

655
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,190
we're just monitoring for tension
okay let's try

656
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
okay let's try
 

657
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,069
okay let's try
okay so now we're gonna add some

658
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
okay so now we're gonna add some
 

659
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,310
okay so now we're gonna add some
some power but you have to monitor if

660
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
some power but you have to monitor if
