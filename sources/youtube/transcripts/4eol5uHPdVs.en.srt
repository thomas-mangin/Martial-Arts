00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,330

 

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,279

all right so I'm Christopher Hine we're

4
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:16,289
all right so I'm Christopher Hine we're
 

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:17,840
all right so I'm Christopher Hine we're
talking this week about how to eat which

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:17,850
talking this week about how to eat which
 

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,790
talking this week about how to eat which
literally translates as belly power but

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:19,800
literally translates as belly power but
 

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,620
literally translates as belly power but
it's kind of just a blanket term that we

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:21,630
it's kind of just a blanket term that we
 

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,240
it's kind of just a blanket term that we
use for making good alignments and

12
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,250
use for making good alignments and
 

13
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,189
use for making good alignments and
proper ways to use the body that seemed

14
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
proper ways to use the body that seemed
 

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,960
proper ways to use the body that seemed
very strong sometimes deceptively strong

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:26,970
very strong sometimes deceptively strong
 

17
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,370
very strong sometimes deceptively strong
and that's why sometimes these

18
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:28,380
and that's why sometimes these
 

19
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,050
and that's why sometimes these
techniques can be used to deceive people

20
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:30,060
techniques can be used to deceive people
 

21
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,269
techniques can be used to deceive people
to think you got special powers but in

22
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:32,279
to think you got special powers but in
 

23
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,530
to think you got special powers but in
truth they're just principles that we

24
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:33,540
truth they're just principles that we
 

25
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,389
truth they're just principles that we
can use in lots of different ways one of

26
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:35,399
can use in lots of different ways one of
 

27
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,590
can use in lots of different ways one of
the principles that I think is really

28
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:36,600
the principles that I think is really
 

29
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,860
the principles that I think is really
impressive is connecting to the force

30
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:39,870
impressive is connecting to the force
 

31
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,200
impressive is connecting to the force
structure and so this is my own term for

32
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,210
structure and so this is my own term for
 

33
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,060
structure and so this is my own term for
it I don't know a fancy Japanese word or

34
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,070
it I don't know a fancy Japanese word or
 

35
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,380
it I don't know a fancy Japanese word or
any other kind of word for this but

36
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:45,390
any other kind of word for this but
 

37
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,060
any other kind of word for this but
basically the idea is when something

38
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,070
basically the idea is when something
 

39
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,260
basically the idea is when something
trying to push you over if you can

40
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,270
trying to push you over if you can
 

41
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,510
trying to push you over if you can
connect to it meaning you can physically

42
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:50,520
connect to it meaning you can physically
 

43
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,760
connect to it meaning you can physically
touch it in some way then it's harder

44
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:52,770
touch it in some way then it's harder
 

45
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,410
touch it in some way then it's harder
for that force to drive you over and you

46
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:54,420
for that force to drive you over and you
 

47
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,090
for that force to drive you over and you
know in essence it's kind of like you're

48
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,100
know in essence it's kind of like you're
 

49
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,520
know in essence it's kind of like you're
riding along with them right so like if

50
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:58,530
riding along with them right so like if
 

51
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,110
riding along with them right so like if
you think about a horse you know if you

52
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,120
you think about a horse you know if you
 

53
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,849
you think about a horse you know if you
try to resist the horse pushing you

54
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:01,859
try to resist the horse pushing you
 

55
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,799
try to resist the horse pushing you
that's really hard but if you grab the

56
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:03,809
that's really hard but if you grab the
 

57
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,299
that's really hard but if you grab the
horse's neck when they try to push you

58
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:05,309
horse's neck when they try to push you
 

59
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:06,649
horse's neck when they try to push you
then you would just move along with the

60
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:06,659
then you would just move along with the
 

61
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,690
then you would just move along with the
horse and that's kind of this idea of

62
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:08,700
horse and that's kind of this idea of
 

63
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,880
horse and that's kind of this idea of
connecting to force structure so I'm

64
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:10,890
connecting to force structure so I'm
 

65
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,320
connecting to force structure so I'm
gonna call Sasha in here and we're gonna

66
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,330
gonna call Sasha in here and we're gonna
 

67
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,880
gonna call Sasha in here and we're gonna
talk about this concept a little more

68
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:15,890
talk about this concept a little more
 

69
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,960
talk about this concept a little more
okay so we're going to talk about

70
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:17,970
okay so we're going to talk about
 

71
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,120
okay so we're going to talk about
connecting force structure here I'm

72
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,130
connecting force structure here I'm
 

73
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,830
connecting force structure here I'm
gonna just push it over right now so I

74
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
gonna just push it over right now so I
 

75
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,600
gonna just push it over right now so I
want you to resist nice and square like

76
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:23,610
want you to resist nice and square like
 

77
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,160
want you to resist nice and square like
that since I she's not gonna have an

78
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,170
that since I she's not gonna have an
 

79
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,630
that since I she's not gonna have an
advantage by pushing the book actually

80
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
advantage by pushing the book actually
 

81
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,190
advantage by pushing the book actually
since in square and I'm gonna try to

82
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:28,200
since in square and I'm gonna try to
 

83
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,910
since in square and I'm gonna try to
push her over all right so I weigh 200

84
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
push her over all right so I weigh 200
 

85
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,069
push her over all right so I weigh 200
pounds Sasha weighs 100 pounds not very

86
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
pounds Sasha weighs 100 pounds not very
 

87
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,910
pounds Sasha weighs 100 pounds not very
difficult to do

88
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:34,920
difficult to do
 

89
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,980
difficult to do
now we're gonna have Sasha connect to

90
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:36,990
now we're gonna have Sasha connect to
 

91
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,080
now we're gonna have Sasha connect to
the structure that's pushing her so as I

92
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,090
the structure that's pushing her so as I
 

93
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,730
the structure that's pushing her so as I
put my hands on Sasha's shoulders Sasha

94
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:40,740
put my hands on Sasha's shoulders Sasha
 

95
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,230
put my hands on Sasha's shoulders Sasha
is going to touch underneath my elbows

96
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
is going to touch underneath my elbows
 

97
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,910
is going to touch underneath my elbows
like this and then they begin to drive

98
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
like this and then they begin to drive
 

99
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,840
like this and then they begin to drive
into Sasha she's going to connect

100
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:45,850
into Sasha she's going to connect
 

101
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,610
into Sasha she's going to connect
I mean when I'd read pretty Socktober

102
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:47,620
I mean when I'd read pretty Socktober
 

103
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,530
I mean when I'd read pretty Socktober
I'm actually kind of trying to push

104
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:49,540
I'm actually kind of trying to push
 

105
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,840
I'm actually kind of trying to push
myself over like this two things are

106
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:51,850
myself over like this two things are
 

107
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,430
myself over like this two things are
actually happening in one one is that

108
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:53,440
actually happening in one one is that
 

109
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,960
actually happening in one one is that
her sinner is actually being driven a

110
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:54,970
her sinner is actually being driven a
 

111
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,580
her sinner is actually being driven a
little lower than my Center as she

112
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:56,590
little lower than my Center as she
 

113
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,410
little lower than my Center as she
connects and pushes into my elbows like

114
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:58,420
connects and pushes into my elbows like
 

115
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,850
connects and pushes into my elbows like
this what's happening is she's kind of

116
00:01:59,850 --> 00:01:59,860
this what's happening is she's kind of
 

117
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,410
this what's happening is she's kind of
lifting me up a little bit while she's

118
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:01,420
lifting me up a little bit while she's
 

119
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,760
lifting me up a little bit while she's
pushing herself down at the same time

120
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:02,770
pushing herself down at the same time
 

121
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,950
pushing herself down at the same time
the other thing is she's distracting the

122
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
the other thing is she's distracting the
 

123
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,180
the other thing is she's distracting the
force that I'm putting into her while

124
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,190
force that I'm putting into her while
 

125
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,950
force that I'm putting into her while
I'm trying to push it or the forces

126
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:07,960
I'm trying to push it or the forces
 

127
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,630
I'm trying to push it or the forces
being strapped up so I can really start

128
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:09,640
being strapped up so I can really start
 

129
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,730
being strapped up so I can really start
to push into her here and it's much

130
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:11,740
to push into her here and it's much
 

131
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,160
to push into her here and it's much
harder for me because she's connected to

132
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,170
harder for me because she's connected to
 

133
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,710
harder for me because she's connected to
the structure of my body another ways to

134
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
the structure of my body another ways to
 

135
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,270
the structure of my body another ways to
show this and his common in greco-roman

136
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:18,280
show this and his common in greco-roman
 

137
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,910
show this and his common in greco-roman
wrestling is a great bunt if I were to

138
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:20,920
wrestling is a great bunt if I were to
 

139
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,070
wrestling is a great bunt if I were to
get here behind Sasha like this and go

140
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,080
get here behind Sasha like this and go
 

141
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,310
get here behind Sasha like this and go
to pick Sasha up it's relatively easy

142
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:26,320
to pick Sasha up it's relatively easy
 

143
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,710
to pick Sasha up it's relatively easy
now when I do it this time it's gonna be

144
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
now when I do it this time it's gonna be
 

145
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,120
now when I do it this time it's gonna be
much more difficult for me what's what

146
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,130
much more difficult for me what's what
 

147
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:35,729
much more difficult for me what's what
happens okay so I'm not just acting

148
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:35,739
happens okay so I'm not just acting
 

149
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,350
happens okay so I'm not just acting
that's a really difficult thing to do

150
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
that's a really difficult thing to do
 

151
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,449
that's a really difficult thing to do
now the reason is because what Sasha did

152
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:39,459
now the reason is because what Sasha did
 

153
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,610
now the reason is because what Sasha did
was she's wrapping her leg around and

154
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:41,620
was she's wrapping her leg around and
 

155
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,710
was she's wrapping her leg around and
hooking behind my leg like this and so

156
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:43,720
hooking behind my leg like this and so
 

157
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,600
hooking behind my leg like this and so
when I go to lift her she's connected to

158
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:45,610
when I go to lift her she's connected to
 

159
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,330
when I go to lift her she's connected to
the structure that's provided force so

160
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:48,340
the structure that's provided force so
 

161

amount of force but still even even with
 

229
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,760
amount of force but still even even with
good alignment because I'm so much

230
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:58,770
good alignment because I'm so much
 

231
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,290
good alignment because I'm so much
stronger I could probably manage to

to my elbows here when I go to push her
 

237
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,960
to my elbows here when I go to push her
over she just got a ton stronger really

238
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:07,970
over she just got a ton stronger really
 

239
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,880
over she just got a ton stronger really
push and she's able to resist me and the

240
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:10,890
push and she's able to resist me and the
 

241
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,560
push and she's able to resist me and the
reason is because she's connecting to

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:12,570
reason is because she's connecting to
 

243
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,600
reason is because she's connecting to
the structure that's putting force into

the structure that's putting force into
 

245
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,520
the structure that's putting force into
her any time we do that can get a big

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,409
her any time we do that can get a big
