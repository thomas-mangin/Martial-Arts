4
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:31,640
this I want to show you the common
 

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,709
this I want to show you the common
mistake

6
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:33,719
mistake
 

7
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,389
mistake
okay um and I want to point out that

8
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:37,399
okay um and I want to point out that
 

9
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,590
okay um and I want to point out that
when you go when you're trying to learn

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
when you go when you're trying to learn
 

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,830
when you go when you're trying to learn
something it's better to go slow it's

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
something it's better to go slow it's
 

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,229
something it's better to go slow it's
just better to go slow uh the

14
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:45,239
just better to go slow uh the
 

15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,029
just better to go slow uh the
uncultivated Mind becomes easily

16
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:48,039
uncultivated Mind becomes easily
 

17
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,350
uncultivated Mind becomes easily
fettered and it gets fettered by a

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:50,360
fettered and it gets fettered by a
 

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,630
fettered and it gets fettered by a
quicker Tempo more than it does by a

20
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
quicker Tempo more than it does by a
 

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,349
quicker Tempo more than it does by a
slower Tempo so you have to go slow now

22
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:55,359
slower Tempo so you have to go slow now
 

23
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,990
slower Tempo so you have to go slow now
the downside of that is that same feder

24
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
the downside of that is that same feder
 

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,670
the downside of that is that same feder
mind is also it's a spiritual immaturity

26
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:02,680
mind is also it's a spiritual immaturity
 

27
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,390
mind is also it's a spiritual immaturity
Ferness is a spiritual immaturity so the

28
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:05,400
Ferness is a spiritual immaturity so the
 

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,670
Ferness is a spiritual immaturity so the
same spiritual

30
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
same spiritual
 

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,350
same spiritual
immaturity will uh

32
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
immaturity will uh
 

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,510
immaturity will uh
aize the self and end up doing things as

34
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
aize the self and end up doing things as
 

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,149
aize the self and end up doing things as
if they're superhuman and so they start

36
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
if they're superhuman and so they start
 

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,190
if they're superhuman and so they start
to do things unrealistic things that

38
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
to do things unrealistic things that
 

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,749
to do things unrealistic things that
would not work at faster harder more

40
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:26,759
would not work at faster harder more
 

41
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,830
would not work at faster harder more
intense tempos again so the problem is

42
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:30,840
intense tempos again so the problem is
 

43
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,870
intense tempos again so the problem is
I have a FedEd mind okay use a slower

44
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:33,880
I have a FedEd mind okay use a slower
 

45
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,590
I have a FedEd mind okay use a slower
Tempo however the slower Tempo allows

46
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
Tempo however the slower Tempo allows
 

47
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,429
Tempo however the slower Tempo allows
for huge deviation from what is

48
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:40,439
for huge deviation from what is
 

49
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,990
for huge deviation from what is
practical what is viable okay and so a

50
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,000
practical what is viable okay and so a
 

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,510
practical what is viable okay and so a
uh problem that comes up from the slower

52
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
uh problem that comes up from the slower
 

53
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,429
uh problem that comes up from the slower
Tempo is the following one so let's put

54
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:50,439
Tempo is the following one so let's put
 

55
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,749
Tempo is the following one so let's put
the camera over here on this

56
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:52,759
the camera over here on this
 

57
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,749
the camera over here on this
side

58
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
side
 

59
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,709
side
okay and it is a premature

60
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
okay and it is a premature

um ending the yin phases of the sword
 

65
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,910
um ending the yin phases of the sword
okay which you can do when there's no

66
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
okay which you can do when there's no
 

67
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,309
okay which you can do when there's no
real pressure okay um and so what I mean

68
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
real pressure okay um and so what I mean
 

69
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,150
real pressure okay um and so what I mean
by that is you got to go really slow so

70
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,160
by that is you got to go really slow so
 

71
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,589
by that is you got to go really slow so
I can talk and do this okay as he's

72
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
I can talk and do this okay as he's
 

73
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,430
I can talk and do this okay as he's
doing a legit AOS that's attacking and

74
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
doing a legit AOS that's attacking and
 

75

finding my Center do you
 

77
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,830
finding my Center do you
see I have to take that pressure

78
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:30,840
see I have to take that pressure
 

79
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,910
see I have to take that pressure
off and his pressure is going all the

80
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
off and his pressure is going all the
 

81
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,390
off and his pressure is going all the
way it's going down Okay so this sword

82
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
way it's going down Okay so this sword
 

83
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,589
way it's going down Okay so this sword
has to uh it cannot pick up here it

84
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:42,599
has to uh it cannot pick up here it
 

85
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,270
has to uh it cannot pick up here it
cannot pick up here if he's loose loose

86
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,280
cannot pick up here if he's loose loose
 

87
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,710
cannot pick up here if he's loose loose

okay weapons wind up they wind
up all the time okay so I have to this

124
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:47,640
up all the time okay so I have to this
 

125
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,390
up all the time okay so I have to this
sword has to move all the way so that I

126
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:51,400
sword has to move all the way so that I
 

127
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,470
sword has to move all the way so that I
completely neutralize his y energy okay

128
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
completely neutralize his y energy okay
 

129
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,309
completely neutralize his y energy okay
so as we go around and he goes I can't

130
00:03:59,309 --> 00:03:59,319
so as we go around and he goes I can't
 

131
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,429
so as we go around and he goes I can't
pick it up up there it's too heavy so I

132
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:02,439
pick it up up there it's too heavy so I
 

133
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,630
pick it up up there it's too heavy so I
had to come all the way around to get

134
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
had to come all the way around to get
 

135
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,589
had to come all the way around to get
completely off and that's what's going

136
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:06,599
completely off and that's what's going
 

137
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,750
completely off and that's what's going
to have that tip back there if I H if I

138
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:10,760
to have that tip back there if I H if I
