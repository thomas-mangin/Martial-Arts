hi i'm christopher hein and this week

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
hi i'm christopher hein and this week
 

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,790
hi i'm christopher hein and this week
we're talking about filling in all the

8
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
we're talking about filling in all the
 

9
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,430
we're talking about filling in all the
missing gaps in aikido so

10
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440
missing gaps in aikido so
 

11
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,110
missing gaps in aikido so
i think that most aikido people are

12
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
i think that most aikido people are
 

13
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,390
i think that most aikido people are
pretty clear about what the techniques

14
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,400
pretty clear about what the techniques
 

15
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,990
pretty clear about what the techniques
are and how to do the techniques and

16
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,000
are and how to do the techniques and
 

17
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,590
are and how to do the techniques and
and people have good ideas about what

18
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
and people have good ideas about what
 

19
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,429
and people have good ideas about what
the main philosophies of aikido are

20
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
the main philosophies of aikido are
 

21
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,269
the main philosophies of aikido are
but how do we fill in all that area in

22
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
but how do we fill in all that area in
 

23
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,269
but how do we fill in all that area in
between that allows our techniques to

24
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
between that allows our techniques to
 

25
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,710
between that allows our techniques to
to facilitate our our our philosophy

26
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
to facilitate our our our philosophy
 

27
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,950
to facilitate our our our philosophy
and how our philosophy is represented by

28
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
and how our philosophy is represented by
 

29
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,270
and how our philosophy is represented by
those techniques

30
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
those techniques
 

31
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,870
those techniques
we've already talked about all the

32
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:34,880
we've already talked about all the
 

33
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,470
we've already talked about all the
middle stuff and so you know the basic

34
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
middle stuff and so you know the basic
 

35
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,549
middle stuff and so you know the basic
uh arrangement i use in my approach to

36
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:38,559
uh arrangement i use in my approach to
 

37
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,150
uh arrangement i use in my approach to
aikido is that first there's a

38
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
aikido is that first there's a
 

39
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,830
aikido is that first there's a
philosophy and then a set of goals that

40
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
philosophy and then a set of goals that
 

41
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,190
philosophy and then a set of goals that
allow us to know if we're achieving our

42
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
allow us to know if we're achieving our
 

43
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,470
allow us to know if we're achieving our
philosophy or not

44
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,480
philosophy or not
 

45
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,990
philosophy or not
and then below that is the set of

46
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
and then below that is the set of
 

47
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,750
and then below that is the set of
tactics and the tactics start to

48
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
tactics and the tactics start to
 

49
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,590
tactics and the tactics start to
represent our strategy the the

50
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
represent our strategy the the
 

51
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,830
represent our strategy the the
systematic approach that we have

52
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
systematic approach that we have
 

53
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,590
systematic approach that we have
in order to achieve those goals and then

54
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
in order to achieve those goals and then
 

55
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,869
in order to achieve those goals and then
below that we have

56
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
below that we have
 

57
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,910
below that we have
techniques and so let's talk real quick

58
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
techniques and so let's talk real quick
 

59
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,270
techniques and so let's talk real quick
about just what a technique is in

60
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
about just what a technique is in
 

61
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,310
about just what a technique is in
general and then we'll kind of talk

62
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
general and then we'll kind of talk
 

63
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,750
general and then we'll kind of talk
about what the techniques are in aikido

64
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
about what the techniques are in aikido
 

65
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,470
about what the techniques are in aikido
and how those

66
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
and how those
 

67
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,229
and how those
help us with our tactics which is really

68
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
help us with our tactics which is really
 

69
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,070
help us with our tactics which is really
important so it's important to

70
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
important so it's important to
 

71
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,670
important so it's important to
understand that everything you do in

72
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
understand that everything you do in
 

73
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,390
understand that everything you do in
your life

74
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
your life
 

75
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,550
your life
you have a technique for at least

76
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
you have a technique for at least
 

77
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,510
you have a technique for at least
anything that you've done

78
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
anything that you've done
 

79
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,190
anything that you've done
a few times right you have a technique

80
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
a few times right you have a technique
 

81
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,789
a few times right you have a technique
and what the technique does is enables

82
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
and what the technique does is enables
 

83
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,149
and what the technique does is enables
you to do something in a really

84
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
you to do something in a really
 

85
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,469
you to do something in a really
efficient manner right so i remember one

86
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
efficient manner right so i remember one
 

87
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,149
efficient manner right so i remember one
time i became obsessed with

88
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
time i became obsessed with
 

89
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,990
time i became obsessed with
the technique i used to button my shirt

90
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
the technique i used to button my shirt
 

91
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,590
the technique i used to button my shirt
in the morning right and i realized that

92
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
in the morning right and i realized that
 

93
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,109
in the morning right and i realized that
there were probably about five or six

94
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119
there were probably about five or six
 

95
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:25,990
there were probably about five or six
different ways to

96
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
different ways to
 

97
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,350
different ways to
to actually push the button through the

98
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
to actually push the button through the
 

99
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,350
to actually push the button through the
hole and button my shirt and that there

100
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
hole and button my shirt and that there
 

101
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,950
hole and button my shirt and that there
were different techniques and i didn't

102
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
were different techniques and i didn't
 

103
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,550
were different techniques and i didn't
use the other techniques and why didn't

104
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
use the other techniques and why didn't
 

105
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,990
use the other techniques and why didn't
i use them and why did i feel

106
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
i use them and why did i feel
 

107
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,590
i use them and why did i feel
that the technique i used to button my

108
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
that the technique i used to button my
 

109
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,270
that the technique i used to button my
shirt in the morning was was really

110
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
shirt in the morning was was really
 

111
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,830
shirt in the morning was was really
important

112
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
important
 

113
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,270
important
and that sounds like a weird thing but

114
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
and that sounds like a weird thing but
 

115
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,710
and that sounds like a weird thing but
the reason i got so obsessed with it is

116
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
the reason i got so obsessed with it is
 

117
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,910
the reason i got so obsessed with it is
because i realized that

118
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
because i realized that
 

119
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,910
because i realized that
uh martial arts techniques are just the

120
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
uh martial arts techniques are just the
 

121
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,270
uh martial arts techniques are just the
same kind of thing right

122
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
same kind of thing right
 

123
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,590
same kind of thing right
there might be a lot of ways to achieve

124
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
there might be a lot of ways to achieve
 

125
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,310
there might be a lot of ways to achieve
uh

126
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
uh
 

127
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,710
uh
something but this this shortened

128
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
something but this this shortened
 

129
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,230
something but this this shortened
version of it is the one that i find

130
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
version of it is the one that i find
 

131
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,310
version of it is the one that i find
ideal and why do i find it ideal

132
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
ideal and why do i find it ideal
 

133
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,670
ideal and why do i find it ideal
so that's basically what a technique is

134
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
so that's basically what a technique is
 

135
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,749
so that's basically what a technique is
and techniques are practiced and made to

136
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
and techniques are practiced and made to
 

137
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,709
and techniques are practiced and made to
be

138
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
be
 

139
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,469
be
something that it doesn't require a lot

140
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
something that it doesn't require a lot
 

141
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,310
something that it doesn't require a lot
of conscious thought now the reason for

142
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
of conscious thought now the reason for
 

143
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,429
of conscious thought now the reason for
this is because

144
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
this is because
 

145
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,510
this is because
conscious thought takes a lot of time

146
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,520
conscious thought takes a lot of time
 

147
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,830
conscious thought takes a lot of time
right so it doesn't seem like this to us

148
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
right so it doesn't seem like this to us
 

149
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,389
right so it doesn't seem like this to us
because

150
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
because
 

151
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,869
because
we we think from the conscious mind so

152
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
we we think from the conscious mind so
 

153
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,550
we we think from the conscious mind so
we think that oh you know i think pretty

154
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
we think that oh you know i think pretty
 

155
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,430
we think that oh you know i think pretty
fast but your

156
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
fast but your
 

157
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,270
fast but your
your unconscious reactions are actually

158
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
your unconscious reactions are actually
 

159
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,949
your unconscious reactions are actually
significantly faster than your conscious

160
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
significantly faster than your conscious
 

161
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,589
significantly faster than your conscious
reactions

162
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
reactions
 

163
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,190
reactions
so for example if you were to touch a

164
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
so for example if you were to touch a
 

165
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,229
so for example if you were to touch a
stove you don't have to touch it and say

166
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
stove you don't have to touch it and say
 

167
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,229
stove you don't have to touch it and say
oh that's hot i think that's going to

168
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
oh that's hot i think that's going to
 

169
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,589
oh that's hot i think that's going to
burn my hand and i'm going to pull it

170
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
burn my hand and i'm going to pull it
 

171
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,150
burn my hand and i'm going to pull it
away

172
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
away
 

173
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,070
away
in fact you really have almost zero

174
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
in fact you really have almost zero
 

175
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,910
in fact you really have almost zero
conscious thought you touch a hot stove

176
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
conscious thought you touch a hot stove
 

177
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,430
conscious thought you touch a hot stove
and your hand gets retracted

178
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
and your hand gets retracted
 

179
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,910
and your hand gets retracted
that's because your unconscious mind has

180
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
that's because your unconscious mind has
 

181
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,790
that's because your unconscious mind has
a really

182
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
a really
 

183
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,550
a really
well good technique produced which is to

184
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
well good technique produced which is to
 

185
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,390
well good technique produced which is to
pull that hand back as fast as possible

186
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
pull that hand back as fast as possible
 

187
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,110
pull that hand back as fast as possible
right

188
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
right
 

189
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,990
right
so techniques are training of the

190
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
so techniques are training of the
 

191
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,430
so techniques are training of the
unconscious mind so we want our

192
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
unconscious mind so we want our
 

193
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,710
unconscious mind so we want our
unconscious mind to do an

194
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
unconscious mind to do an
 

195
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,790
unconscious mind to do an
action in a really quick way and so we

196
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
action in a really quick way and so we
 

197
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,390
action in a really quick way and so we
don't want to be have the conscious mind

198
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
don't want to be have the conscious mind
 

199
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,589
don't want to be have the conscious mind
interfering with that

200
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
interfering with that
 

201
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,350
interfering with that
now when we're developing those and the

202
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
now when we're developing those and the
 

203
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,270
now when we're developing those and the
process of training is actually to

204
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
process of training is actually to
 

205
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,470
process of training is actually to
figure out what the best kind of

206
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
figure out what the best kind of
 

207
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,229
figure out what the best kind of
techniques are and how we can train

208
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
techniques are and how we can train
 

209
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,589
techniques are and how we can train
those to be as efficient with them as

210
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
those to be as efficient with them as
 

211
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,470
those to be as efficient with them as
possible and so

212
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
possible and so
 

213
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,750
possible and so
when we're talking about something like

214
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
when we're talking about something like
 

215
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,430
when we're talking about something like
a code guys you're you're training your

216
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
a code guys you're you're training your
 

217
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,229
a code guys you're you're training your
body to just

218
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
body to just
 

219
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,830
body to just
do a kodagash without you having to

220
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
do a kodagash without you having to
 

221
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,350
do a kodagash without you having to
think through the steps every time

222
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
think through the steps every time
 

223
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,790
think through the steps every time
now when you're a beginner of course you

224
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
now when you're a beginner of course you
 

225
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,390
now when you're a beginner of course you
have to think through the steps but as

226
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
have to think through the steps but as
 

227
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,830
have to think through the steps but as
you become more proficient

228
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
you become more proficient
 

229
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,190
you become more proficient
you will learn how to do it

230
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
you will learn how to do it
 

231
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,030
you will learn how to do it
unconsciously really quickly and with

232
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
unconsciously really quickly and with
 

233
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,670
unconsciously really quickly and with
really well

234
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
really well
 

235
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,070
really well
in fact i often laugh at some of my

236
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
in fact i often laugh at some of my
 

237
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,430
in fact i often laugh at some of my
senior students who haven't done a lot

238
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
senior students who haven't done a lot
 

239
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,390
senior students who haven't done a lot
of teaching because

240
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
of teaching because
 

241
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,149
of teaching because
when they're trying to explain to a new

242
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
when they're trying to explain to a new
 

243
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,589
when they're trying to explain to a new
person how to do something

244
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
person how to do something
 

245
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,110
person how to do something
they'll always say oh hang on and then

246
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
they'll always say oh hang on and then
 

247
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,229
they'll always say oh hang on and then
they'll just do it real quick and

248
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
they'll just do it real quick and
 

249
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,670
they'll just do it real quick and
they'll they'll consciously observe

250
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
they'll they'll consciously observe
 

251
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,030
they'll they'll consciously observe
themselves doing it

252
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
themselves doing it
 

253
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,550
themselves doing it
and then they can think oh yeah okay

254
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
and then they can think oh yeah okay
 

255
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,390
and then they can think oh yeah okay
that's what i do right and this is true

256
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
that's what i do right and this is true
 

257
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,910
that's what i do right and this is true
of any good technique it becomes

258
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
of any good technique it becomes
 

259
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,910
of any good technique it becomes
so natural to you that is your

260
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
so natural to you that is your
 

261
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,509
so natural to you that is your
unconscious mind doing it entirely and

262
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
unconscious mind doing it entirely and
 

263
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,789
unconscious mind doing it entirely and
your conscious mind really doesn't

264
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
your conscious mind really doesn't
 

265
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,550
your conscious mind really doesn't
become involved now that's ideal because

266
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
become involved now that's ideal because
 

267
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,830
become involved now that's ideal because
it's really fast and

268
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
it's really fast and
 

269
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,990
it's really fast and
conflicts generally really fast right so

270
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
conflicts generally really fast right so
 

271
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,270
conflicts generally really fast right so
something threatening and violent coming

272
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
something threatening and violent coming
 

273
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,869
something threatening and violent coming
at us is happening fast so

274
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
at us is happening fast so
 

275
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,229
at us is happening fast so
we have to have a set of techniques that

276
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
we have to have a set of techniques that
 

277
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,470
we have to have a set of techniques that
can do those things really fast

278
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
can do those things really fast
 

279
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,869
can do those things really fast
now examples of techniques in aikido so

280
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
now examples of techniques in aikido so
 

281
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,030
now examples of techniques in aikido so
techniques could be anything but what we

282
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
techniques could be anything but what we
 

283
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,630
techniques could be anything but what we
generally call the techniques in aikido

00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
and these have to do with controlling
 

301
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,030
and these have to do with controlling
the arms in certain ways twisting the

is they're a real important set of

310
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
is they're a real important set of
 

311
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,590
is they're a real important set of
principles that we kind of can't take

312
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
principles that we kind of can't take
 

313
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,230
principles that we kind of can't take
out of

314
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
out of

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,550
out of
achieving any of the the the tactical

ideals we'll want in aikida
so that's the keowaza then we also have

320
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
so that's the keowaza then we also have
 

321
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,150
so that's the keowaza then we also have
the nagewaza so these are things like

322
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
the nagewaza so these are things like
 

323
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,350
the nagewaza so these are things like
kokunage

324

these are the projection methods the

330
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
these are the projection methods the
 

331
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,510
these are the projection methods the
ways that we project something away from

332
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
ways that we project something away from
 

333
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,469
ways that we project something away from
us right so

334
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
us right so
 

335
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,469
us right so
how do we make something move away from

336
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
how do we make something move away from
 

337
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,909
how do we make something move away from
us so something's on us how do we make

338
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
us so something's on us how do we make
 

339
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,030
us so something's on us how do we make
it move away

340
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
it move away
 

341
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,590
it move away
then we have the osekomiwaza which are

342
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
then we have the osekomiwaza which are
 

343
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,430
then we have the osekomiwaza which are
the pins so how do we hold something

344
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
the pins so how do we hold something
 

345
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,350
the pins so how do we hold something
down and that might sound like it's

346
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
down and that might sound like it's
 

347
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,670
down and that might sound like it's
actually contrary to aikido

348
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
actually contrary to aikido
 

349
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,350
actually contrary to aikido
theory as i describe it but i'll explain

350
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
theory as i describe it but i'll explain
 

351
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,950
theory as i describe it but i'll explain
real quick as to how that works out but

352
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
real quick as to how that works out but
 

353
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,550
real quick as to how that works out but
the the pinning methods how do we hold

354
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
the the pinning methods how do we hold
 

355
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,430
the the pinning methods how do we hold
someone down or trap someone in some way

356
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
someone down or trap someone in some way
 

357
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,189
someone down or trap someone in some way
then we have the atemi waza how do we

358
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
then we have the atemi waza how do we
 

359
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,550
then we have the atemi waza how do we
strike stuff

360
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
strike stuff
 

361
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,390
strike stuff
and that could be armed or unarmed right

362
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
and that could be armed or unarmed right
 

363
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,830
and that could be armed or unarmed right
so it could be you know i'm just

364
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
so it could be you know i'm just
 

365
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,110
so it could be you know i'm just
popping someone real quick to get them

366
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
popping someone real quick to get them
 

367
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,550
popping someone real quick to get them
away or i've drawn a weapon and i'm

368
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
away or i've drawn a weapon and i'm
 

369
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,790
away or i've drawn a weapon and i'm
using a weapon to get someone away

370
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
using a weapon to get someone away
 

371
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,670
using a weapon to get someone away
and the hidoki wasa how i escaped from

372
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
and the hidoki wasa how i escaped from
 

373
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,110
and the hidoki wasa how i escaped from
from someone holding me so if someone's

374
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
from someone holding me so if someone's
 

375
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,629
from someone holding me so if someone's
got me in some way how do i become

376
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
got me in some way how do i become
 

377
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,150
got me in some way how do i become
disentangled from them and that's what

378
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
disentangled from them and that's what
 

379
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,270
disentangled from them and that's what
hodoki actually means

380
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
hodoki actually means
 

381
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,870
hodoki actually means
so how do i disentangle myself from

382
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
so how do i disentangle myself from
 

383
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,590
so how do i disentangle myself from
someone and bukiwaza so the bukiwaza is

384
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
someone and bukiwaza so the bukiwaza is
 

385
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,950
someone and bukiwaza so the bukiwaza is
the weapon technique so what if we get

386
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
the weapon technique so what if we get
 

387
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,469
the weapon technique so what if we get
in a situation where we got to do some

388
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
in a situation where we got to do some
 

389
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,150
in a situation where we got to do some
kind of weapon techniques right i need

390
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
kind of weapon techniques right i need
 

391
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,350
kind of weapon techniques right i need
to use a weapon i'm forced to use a

392
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
to use a weapon i'm forced to use a
 

393
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,110
to use a weapon i'm forced to use a
weapon to defend myself which also in

394
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
weapon to defend myself which also in
 

395
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,469
weapon to defend myself which also in
some ways might sound

396
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
some ways might sound
 

397
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,469
some ways might sound
contrary to aikido philosophy but is a

398
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
contrary to aikido philosophy but is a
 

399
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,870
contrary to aikido philosophy but is a
part of it and the doriwaza which is how

400
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
part of it and the doriwaza which is how
 

401
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,150
part of it and the doriwaza which is how
do we hold stuff and

402
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
do we hold stuff and
 

403
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,310
do we hold stuff and
the door he was also includes how do we

404
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
the door he was also includes how do we
 

405
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,830
the door he was also includes how do we
take something away from someone right

406
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
take something away from someone right
 

407
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,189
take something away from someone right
so how would i take a weapon away from

408
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
so how would i take a weapon away from
 

409
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,390
so how would i take a weapon away from
someone if someone was trying to attack

410
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
someone if someone was trying to attack
 

411
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:50,870
someone if someone was trying to attack
me

412
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
me
 

413
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,029
me
so those are the the regular techniques

414
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
so those are the the regular techniques
 

415
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,790
so those are the the regular techniques
in in my approach aikido we call those

416
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
in in my approach aikido we call those
 

417
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,749
in in my approach aikido we call those
kumiuchi

418
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
kumiuchi
 

419
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,309
kumiuchi
and those are struggle methods right so

420
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
and those are struggle methods right so
 

421
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,909
and those are struggle methods right so
they're the ways we struggle

422
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
they're the ways we struggle
 

423
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,909
they're the ways we struggle
now ideally i could we don't want to

424
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
now ideally i could we don't want to
 

425
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,430
now ideally i could we don't want to
struggle we want to make a chords we

426
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
struggle we want to make a chords we
 

427
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,390
struggle we want to make a chords we
want to make

428
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
want to make
 

429
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,150
want to make
some kind of negotiation that doesn't

430
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
some kind of negotiation that doesn't
 

431
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,749
some kind of negotiation that doesn't
require us to struggle at all

432
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
require us to struggle at all
 

433
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,990
require us to struggle at all
but sometimes the the struggle's

434
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
but sometimes the the struggle's
 

435
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,950
but sometimes the the struggle's
unavoidable

436
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
unavoidable
 

437
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,510
unavoidable
and so all of these things fall into a

438
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
and so all of these things fall into a
 

439
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,790
and so all of these things fall into a
lower level set of

440
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
lower level set of
 

441
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,430
lower level set of
tactics and um these lower level set of

442
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
tactics and um these lower level set of
 

443
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,110
tactics and um these lower level set of
tactics is generally what we call the

444
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
tactics is generally what we call the
 

445
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,950
tactics is generally what we call the
techniques of aikido

446
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
techniques of aikido
 

447
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,870
techniques of aikido
now those are all essential things right

448
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
now those are all essential things right
 

449
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,790
now those are all essential things right
so for example i would like someone to

450
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
so for example i would like someone to
 

451
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,629
so for example i would like someone to
never be able to grab me in fact if

452
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
never be able to grab me in fact if
 

453
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,670
never be able to grab me in fact if
someone grabs me

454
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
someone grabs me
 

455
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,150
someone grabs me
i've already lost my first three goals

456
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
i've already lost my first three goals
 

457
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,790
i've already lost my first three goals
right so

458
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
right so
 

459
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,390
right so
i wasn't ahead enough to keep them from

460
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
i wasn't ahead enough to keep them from
 

461
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,550
i wasn't ahead enough to keep them from
grabbing me i wasn't far enough away

462
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
grabbing me i wasn't far enough away
 

463
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,029
grabbing me i wasn't far enough away
that they

464
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
that they
 

465
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,510
that they
they wouldn't grab me and also my

466
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
they wouldn't grab me and also my
 

467
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,070
they wouldn't grab me and also my
position

468
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
position
 

469
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,590
position
it was bad one because they've got me

470
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
it was bad one because they've got me
 

471
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,950
it was bad one because they've got me
and then once they've got me i'm

472
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
and then once they've got me i'm
 

473
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,309
and then once they've got me i'm
probably not going to be able to easily

474
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
probably not going to be able to easily
 

475
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,150
probably not going to be able to easily
get to the position i want so

476
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
get to the position i want so
 

477
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,469
get to the position i want so
so someone grabbing me is really not

478
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
so someone grabbing me is really not
 

479
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,510
so someone grabbing me is really not
what i want

480
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
what i want
 

481
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,589
what i want
now unfortunately in aikido we think in

482
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
now unfortunately in aikido we think in
 

483
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,510
now unfortunately in aikido we think in
order to do aikido we've got to let

484
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
order to do aikido we've got to let
 

485
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,790
order to do aikido we've got to let
someone grab us first

486
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
someone grab us first
 

487
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,270
someone grab us first
so that's a real problem right

488
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280

 

489
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,270

now unfortunately in aikido we think in

490
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
now unfortunately in aikido we think in
 

491
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,270
now unfortunately in aikido we think in
order to do aikido we've got to let

492
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
order to do aikido we've got to let
 

493
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,469
order to do aikido we've got to let
someone grab us first

494
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
someone grab us first
 

495
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,710
someone grab us first
so that's a real problem right so that's

496
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
so that's a real problem right so that's
 

497
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,390
so that's a real problem right so that's
part of why we can't really achieve our

498
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
part of why we can't really achieve our
 

499
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,589
part of why we can't really achieve our
philosophy is because

500
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
philosophy is because
 

501
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,830
philosophy is because
we think that those low level tactics

502
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
we think that those low level tactics
 

503
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,029
we think that those low level tactics
which are important they're very

504
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
which are important they're very
 

505
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,990
which are important they're very
important to the system

506
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
important to the system
 

507
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,909
important to the system
we think those low level tactics are

508
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
we think those low level tactics are
 

509
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,189
we think those low level tactics are
what aikido is

510
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
what aikido is
 

511
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,029
what aikido is
but instead they're just they're what we

512
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
but instead they're just they're what we
 

513
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,550
but instead they're just they're what we
do when we can't do anything else so

514
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
do when we can't do anything else so
 

515
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,670
do when we can't do anything else so
they're included in the system but

516
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
they're included in the system but
 

517
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,950
they're included in the system but
they're not the ideal

518
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
they're not the ideal
 

519
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,390
they're not the ideal
right and there's a lot of stuff of you

520
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
right and there's a lot of stuff of you
 

521
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,270
right and there's a lot of stuff of you
issue but talking about how the

522
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
issue but talking about how the
 

523
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,950
issue but talking about how the
techniques and the forms are not really

524
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
techniques and the forms are not really
 

525
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,990
techniques and the forms are not really
important right so

526
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
important right so
 

527
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,350
important right so
there's something to practice and help

528
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
there's something to practice and help
 

529
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,110
there's something to practice and help
you kind of learn the way of aikido but

530
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
you kind of learn the way of aikido but
 

531
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,350
you kind of learn the way of aikido but
they're not they're not the ideal right

532
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
they're not they're not the ideal right
 

533
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,189
they're not they're not the ideal right
they are useful though and i train my

534
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
they are useful though and i train my
 

535
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,390
they are useful though and i train my
students in them all the time and we

536
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
students in them all the time and we
 

537
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,909
students in them all the time and we
spend a lot of time working on them and

538
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
spend a lot of time working on them and
 

539
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,670
spend a lot of time working on them and
especially fourth q third queue we

540
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
especially fourth q third queue we
 

541
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,350
especially fourth q third queue we
really want them to have good clean

542
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
really want them to have good clean
 

543
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,870
really want them to have good clean
techniques since reason because

544
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
techniques since reason because
 

545
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,430
techniques since reason because
those techniques those low level tactics

546
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
those techniques those low level tactics
 

547
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,430
those techniques those low level tactics
can help reset us to the higher level

548
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
can help reset us to the higher level
 

549
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,070
can help reset us to the higher level
tactics

550
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
tactics
 

551
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,909
tactics
which can then make us meet our goals

552
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919
which can then make us meet our goals
 

553
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,270
which can then make us meet our goals
which once we're meeting our goals and

554
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
which once we're meeting our goals and
 

555
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,430
which once we're meeting our goals and
we're achieving our aikido philosophy

556
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
we're achieving our aikido philosophy
 

557
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,150
we're achieving our aikido philosophy
so why are those what they are well the

558
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
so why are those what they are well the
 

559
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,749
so why are those what they are well the
kilwaza is set of

560
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
kilwaza is set of
 

561
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,589
kilwaza is set of
a set of very important principles that

562
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
a set of very important principles that
 

563
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,830
a set of very important principles that
we'll use no matter what once someone is

564
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
we'll use no matter what once someone is
 

565
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,430
we'll use no matter what once someone is
starting to come into contact with us

566
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
starting to come into contact with us
 

567
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,510
starting to come into contact with us
we're going to use those constantly all

568
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
we're going to use those constantly all
 

569
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,550
we're going to use those constantly all
the time we're constantly going to be

570
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
the time we're constantly going to be
 

571
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,909
the time we're constantly going to be
using those and that's because

572
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
using those and that's because
 

573
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,589
using those and that's because
people are going to get a hold of us and

574
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
people are going to get a hold of us and
 

575
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,990
people are going to get a hold of us and
things like ikkyo and nico and sankyo

576
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
things like ikkyo and nico and sankyo
 

577
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,150
things like ikkyo and nico and sankyo
and yonkyo all of them uh they can help

578
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
and yonkyo all of them uh they can help
 

579
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,189
and yonkyo all of them uh they can help
us get free

580
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
us get free
 

581
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,390
us get free
um also if someone was to um

582
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
um also if someone was to um
 

583
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,710
um also if someone was to um
have a weapon and try to get us dory

584
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
have a weapon and try to get us dory
 

585
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,629
have a weapon and try to get us dory
waza will also require

586
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
waza will also require
 

587
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,230
waza will also require
kyouwaza right so in order to get

588
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
kyouwaza right so in order to get
 

589
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,430
kyouwaza right so in order to get
something out of someone's hand we're

590
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
something out of someone's hand we're
 

591
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,869
something out of someone's hand we're
gonna need to know the lessons of the

592
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
gonna need to know the lessons of the
 

593
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,070
gonna need to know the lessons of the
kyowaza

594
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
kyowaza
 

595
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,589
kyowaza
in order to make good hadoki i have to

596
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
in order to make good hadoki i have to
 

597
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,270
in order to make good hadoki i have to
know the kielwaza

598
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
know the kielwaza
 

599
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,430
know the kielwaza
the kyowaza is really essential to all

600
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
the kyowaza is really essential to all
 

601
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,269
the kyowaza is really essential to all
of our basic struggle methods so that's

602
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
of our basic struggle methods so that's
 

603
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,709
of our basic struggle methods so that's
why they're the principles because those

604
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
why they're the principles because those
 

605
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,589
why they're the principles because those
six principles

606
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
six principles
 

607
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,589
six principles
will help us with everything else the

608
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
will help us with everything else the
 

609
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,589
will help us with everything else the
nagewaza is really important because

610
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
nagewaza is really important because
 

611
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,310
nagewaza is really important because
if i've lost my first three main goals

612
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
if i've lost my first three main goals
 

613
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,750
if i've lost my first three main goals
and someone's next to me

614
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
and someone's next to me
 

615
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,670
and someone's next to me
i want to be able to project them away

616
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
i want to be able to project them away
 

617
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,750
i want to be able to project them away
from me so i can then start using my

618
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
from me so i can then start using my
 

619
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,509
from me so i can then start using my
higher level tactics so if i can move

620
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
higher level tactics so if i can move
 

621
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,389
higher level tactics so if i can move
someone away from me

622
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
someone away from me
 

623
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,750
someone away from me
and don't think a throw just has to be

624
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
and don't think a throw just has to be
 

625
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,350
and don't think a throw just has to be
smashing someone into the ground that's

626
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
smashing someone into the ground that's
 

627
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,070
smashing someone into the ground that's
not the goal

628
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
not the goal
 

629
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,910
not the goal
uh projections in aikido are just to

630
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
uh projections in aikido are just to
 

631
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,269
uh projections in aikido are just to
move someone away so

632
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279
move someone away so
 

633
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,790
move someone away so
no one has to fall down if they just

634
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
no one has to fall down if they just
 

635
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,310
no one has to fall down if they just
stumble off of me well then i've got

636
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
stumble off of me well then i've got
 

637
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,750
stumble off of me well then i've got
some distance again and i'm achieving

638
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
some distance again and i'm achieving
 

639
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,949
some distance again and i'm achieving
one of my goals right so

640
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
one of my goals right so
 

641
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,870
one of my goals right so
i'm then working from a higher uh higher

642
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
i'm then working from a higher uh higher
 

643
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,710
i'm then working from a higher uh higher
position of tactics right so i'm using

644
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
position of tactics right so i'm using
 

645
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,150
position of tactics right so i'm using
better tactics instead of having to use

646
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
better tactics instead of having to use
 

647
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,910
better tactics instead of having to use
the lower level tactics so

648
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:09,920
the lower level tactics so
 

649
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,030
the lower level tactics so
if someone's next to me and i can

650
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
if someone's next to me and i can
 

651
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,790
if someone's next to me and i can
project them away that's why we need

652
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800
project them away that's why we need
 

653
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,910
project them away that's why we need
nage was it help

654
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
nage was it help
 

655
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,430
nage was it help
reset to get to those higher level

656
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
reset to get to those higher level
 

657
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,670
reset to get to those higher level
tactics pinning techniques now this

658
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
tactics pinning techniques now this
 

659
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,310
tactics pinning techniques now this
one's a

660
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
one's a
 

661
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,310
one's a
one fun one to talk about because i

662
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
one fun one to talk about because i
 

663
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,750
one fun one to talk about because i
think it seems like

664
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
think it seems like
 

665
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,269
think it seems like
that would be antithesis of the

666
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
that would be antithesis of the
 

667
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,030
that would be antithesis of the
philosophy of aikido right so

668
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
philosophy of aikido right so
 

669
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,790
philosophy of aikido right so
so if i'm pinning someone i very

670
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
so if i'm pinning someone i very
 

671
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,710
so if i'm pinning someone i very
actively am in direct physical contact

672
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
actively am in direct physical contact
 

673
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,670
actively am in direct physical contact
with them so which means if they're a

674
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
with them so which means if they're a
 

675
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,870
with them so which means if they're a
lot stronger than me

676
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
lot stronger than me
 

677
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,910
lot stronger than me
well then i'm not going to be able to

678
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
well then i'm not going to be able to
 

679
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,070
well then i'm not going to be able to
hold them very well also i have to be

680
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
hold them very well also i have to be
 

681
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,829
hold them very well also i have to be
close to them to pin them so that's not

682
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
close to them to pin them so that's not
 

683
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,430
close to them to pin them so that's not
achieving a main goal

684
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
achieving a main goal
 

685
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,790
achieving a main goal
i'm going to have all kinds of problems

686
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
i'm going to have all kinds of problems
 

687
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,150
i'm going to have all kinds of problems
are going to happen from this right so

688
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
are going to happen from this right so
 

689
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,430
are going to happen from this right so
it's important to understand that's a

690
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
it's important to understand that's a
 

691
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,430
it's important to understand that's a
low level tactic now why might i need

692
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
low level tactic now why might i need
 

693
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,949
low level tactic now why might i need
that low level tactic well

694
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
that low level tactic well
 

695
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,630
that low level tactic well
i got to get someone disarmed because

696
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
i got to get someone disarmed because
 

697
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,990
i got to get someone disarmed because
they're dangerous

698
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
they're dangerous
 

699
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,150
they're dangerous
and so in that situation i need to get

700
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
and so in that situation i need to get
 

701
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,150
and so in that situation i need to get
them into a controlled position on the

702
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
them into a controlled position on the
 

703
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,670
them into a controlled position on the
ground so i can get the weapon away from

704
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
ground so i can get the weapon away from
 

705
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:53,990
ground so i can get the weapon away from
them

706
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
them
 

707
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,829
them
or that someone who's potentially going

708
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:55,839
or that someone who's potentially going
 

709
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,030
or that someone who's potentially going
to hurt themselves

710
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
to hurt themselves
 

711
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,949
to hurt themselves
or someone else if i don't control them

712
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
or someone else if i don't control them
 

713
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,310
or someone else if i don't control them
right so meaning that you know

714
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
right so meaning that you know
 

715
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,150
right so meaning that you know
if i don't control that person they're

716
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
if i don't control that person they're
 

717
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,269
if i don't control that person they're
maybe they're insane or something

718
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
maybe they're insane or something
 

719
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,630
maybe they're insane or something
they're going to run off a cliff or do

720
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
they're going to run off a cliff or do
 

721
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,069
they're going to run off a cliff or do
something crazy or run into a burning

722
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079
something crazy or run into a burning
 

723
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,269
something crazy or run into a burning
building or who knows what

724
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
building or who knows what
 

725
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,190
building or who knows what
or hit someone or hurt someone else that

726
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
or hit someone or hurt someone else that
 

727
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,550
or hit someone or hurt someone else that
doesn't need to get hurt so

728
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
doesn't need to get hurt so
 

729
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,430
doesn't need to get hurt so
so pins will be useful but the way in

730
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
so pins will be useful but the way in
 

731
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,350
so pins will be useful but the way in
which we pin an aikido

732
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
which we pin an aikido
 

733
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,310
which we pin an aikido
always starts to reset us to our three

734
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
always starts to reset us to our three
 

735
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,870
always starts to reset us to our three
main

736
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
main
 

737
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,790
main
goals right so it always take us

738
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
goals right so it always take us
 

739
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,150
goals right so it always take us
tactically up now the reason it does

740
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
tactically up now the reason it does
 

741
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,030
tactically up now the reason it does
this is because

742
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
this is because
 

743
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,590
this is because
we don't pin body to body in aikido we

744
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
we don't pin body to body in aikido we
 

745
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,230
we don't pin body to body in aikido we
always pin

746
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
always pin
 

747
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,910
always pin
off to the side so that means we put a

748
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
off to the side so that means we put a
 

749
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,829
off to the side so that means we put a
premium on autonomy the ability to be

750
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
premium on autonomy the ability to be
 

751
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,310
premium on autonomy the ability to be
free

752
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
free
 

753
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,550
free
and we don't put a premium on control

754
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
and we don't put a premium on control
 

755
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,150
and we don't put a premium on control
and security which is what

756
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
and security which is what
 

757
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,230
and security which is what
um other systems of jiu jitsu and stuff

758
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
um other systems of jiu jitsu and stuff
 

759
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,990
um other systems of jiu jitsu and stuff
do they put a premium on that security

760
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
do they put a premium on that security
 

761
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,030
do they put a premium on that security
absolutely we want to hold them no

762
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
absolutely we want to hold them no
 

763
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,710
absolutely we want to hold them no
matter what but in aikido we give up a

764
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
matter what but in aikido we give up a
 

765
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,829
matter what but in aikido we give up a
little bit of security

766
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
little bit of security
 

767
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,509
little bit of security
for the ability to be autonomous and

768
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
for the ability to be autonomous and
 

769
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,110
for the ability to be autonomous and
that means that if it's not working out

770
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
that means that if it's not working out
 

771
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,550
that means that if it's not working out
right if so if they're stronger than us

772
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
right if so if they're stronger than us
 

773
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:46,870
right if so if they're stronger than us
or

774
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
or
 

775
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,150
or
more people come to attack us or

776
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
more people come to attack us or
 

777
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,670
more people come to attack us or
whatever we can always bail out of that

778
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
whatever we can always bail out of that
 

779
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,110
whatever we can always bail out of that
really easy and reset

780
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
really easy and reset
 

781
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,110
really easy and reset
to the three main goals so that's how

782
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
to the three main goals so that's how
 

783
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,269
to the three main goals so that's how
pinning plays out in aikido the way we

784
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
pinning plays out in aikido the way we
 

785
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,710
pinning plays out in aikido the way we
pin is really important it's important

786
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
pin is really important it's important
 

787
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,990
pin is really important it's important
to understand that we don't we don't pin

788
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
to understand that we don't we don't pin
 

789
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,509
to understand that we don't we don't pin
like you would in other jiu jitsu styles

790
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
like you would in other jiu jitsu styles
 

791
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,550
like you would in other jiu jitsu styles
and the reason we do that

792
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
and the reason we do that
 

793
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,310
and the reason we do that
is because autonomy is one of our number

794
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
is because autonomy is one of our number
 

795
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,710
is because autonomy is one of our number
one goals so that's why we have pins

796
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
one goals so that's why we have pins
 

797
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,710
one goals so that's why we have pins
why do we have weapons in aikido and why

798
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
why do we have weapons in aikido and why
 

799
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,470
why do we have weapons in aikido and why
do we have strikes so the itemiwaza and

800
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
do we have strikes so the itemiwaza and
 

801
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,829
do we have strikes so the itemiwaza and
the buki was both kind of fall in this

802
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
the buki was both kind of fall in this
 

803
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,550
the buki was both kind of fall in this
category

804
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
category
 

805
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,590
category
well sometimes we'll have no choice

806
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
well sometimes we'll have no choice
 

807
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,670
well sometimes we'll have no choice
but to hit someone or use a weapon on

808
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
but to hit someone or use a weapon on
 

809
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,350
but to hit someone or use a weapon on
someone because they put us in such a

810
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
someone because they put us in such a
 

811
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,670
someone because they put us in such a
bad situation that not doing that means

812
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
bad situation that not doing that means
 

813
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,670
bad situation that not doing that means
that it will cost us our lives or or

814
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
that it will cost us our lives or or
 

815
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,350
that it will cost us our lives or or
will be controlled or seriously in

816
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
will be controlled or seriously in
 

817
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,230
will be controlled or seriously in
danger right

818
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
danger right
 

819
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,030
danger right
so that's not ideal again it's not our

820
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
so that's not ideal again it's not our
 

821
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,389
so that's not ideal again it's not our
top level tactics it's

822
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
top level tactics it's
 

823
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,310
top level tactics it's
very low and so we've already made a lot

824
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
very low and so we've already made a lot
 

825
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,670
very low and so we've already made a lot
of failures at this point

826
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
of failures at this point
 

827
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,350
of failures at this point
so we had to use a weapon or we had to

828
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
so we had to use a weapon or we had to
 

829
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,790
so we had to use a weapon or we had to
hit someone in a severe way

830
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
hit someone in a severe way
 

831
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,230
hit someone in a severe way
in order to get them off of us so we

832
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
in order to get them off of us so we
 

833
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,670
in order to get them off of us so we
could start to work up to our higher

834
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
could start to work up to our higher
 

835
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,509
could start to work up to our higher
tactics again so that's why we have

836
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
tactics again so that's why we have
 

837
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,430
tactics again so that's why we have
weapons there are situations where we're

838
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
weapons there are situations where we're
 

839
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,829
weapons there are situations where we're
just we have to have some kind of power

840
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
just we have to have some kind of power
 

841
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,670
just we have to have some kind of power
and weapons can give us that in order to

842
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
and weapons can give us that in order to
 

843
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,030
and weapons can give us that in order to
get out of them now it's not ideal it's

844
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
get out of them now it's not ideal it's
 

845
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,790
get out of them now it's not ideal it's
not good aikido and when we use a weapon

846
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
not good aikido and when we use a weapon
 

847
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,790
not good aikido and when we use a weapon
in aikido we always call it the ikea kin

848
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
in aikido we always call it the ikea kin
 

849
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,430
in aikido we always call it the ikea kin
or the ik joe and that's because we're

850
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
or the ik joe and that's because we're
 

851
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,870
or the ik joe and that's because we're
we're being reminded that

852
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
we're being reminded that
 

853
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,710
we're being reminded that
it's not about using the weapon to get

854
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
it's not about using the weapon to get
 

855
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,310
it's not about using the weapon to get
the other person it's about achieving

856
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
the other person it's about achieving
 

857
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,590
the other person it's about achieving
our higher level goals

858
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
our higher level goals
 

859
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,430
our higher level goals
and so the weapon might facilitate us to

860
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
and so the weapon might facilitate us to
 

861
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,870
and so the weapon might facilitate us to
get back to our higher level goals but

862
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
get back to our higher level goals but
 

863
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,949
get back to our higher level goals but
the weapon isn't a means unto itself

864
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
the weapon isn't a means unto itself
 

865
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,550
the weapon isn't a means unto itself
right it's just a tool to help us get

866
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
right it's just a tool to help us get
 

867
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,069
right it's just a tool to help us get
back to our upper level stuff

868
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
back to our upper level stuff
 

869
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,310
back to our upper level stuff
right the the dory was pretty pretty

870
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
right the the dory was pretty pretty
 

871
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,750
right the the dory was pretty pretty
simple to explain sometimes we'll need

872
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
simple to explain sometimes we'll need
 

873
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,870
simple to explain sometimes we'll need
to hold people and sometimes we'll need

874
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
to hold people and sometimes we'll need
 

875
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,389
to hold people and sometimes we'll need
to take weapons from people

876
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
to take weapons from people
 

877
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,629
to take weapons from people

understanding why these techniques are

882
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
understanding why these techniques are
 

883
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,990
understanding why these techniques are
what they are is very important and

884
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
what they are is very important and
 

885
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,269
what they are is very important and
those techniques are very good and

886
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
those techniques are very good and
 

887
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,629
those techniques are very good and
you'll need them if you get into a bad

888
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
you'll need them if you get into a bad
 

889
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,350
you'll need them if you get into a bad
situation

situation
 

891
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,230

but they're very far from our ideal

892
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
but they're very far from our ideal

our ideal philosophy and so what the

our ideal philosophy and so what the
 

897
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,629
our ideal philosophy and so what the
strategy of aikido is telling us to do

898
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
strategy of aikido is telling us to do
 

899
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,550
strategy of aikido is telling us to do
is always get away from those low level

900
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
is always get away from those low level
 

901
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,190
is always get away from those low level
tactics

902
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
tactics
 

903
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,629
tactics
and start to work at the high level

904
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
and start to work at the high level
 

905
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,990
and start to work at the high level
tactics and then once we work at those

906
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
tactics and then once we work at those
 

907
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,949
tactics and then once we work at those
high level tactics

908
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
high level tactics
 

909
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,110
high level tactics
we can be regularly achieving our ideal

910
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
we can be regularly achieving our ideal
 

911
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,870
we can be regularly achieving our ideal
goals and if we're making our goals

912
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
goals and if we're making our goals
 

913
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,310
goals and if we're making our goals
then we're achieving the philosophy of

914
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
then we're achieving the philosophy of
 

915
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,550
then we're achieving the philosophy of
aikido so this is the progression i use

916
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
aikido so this is the progression i use
 

917
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,310
aikido so this is the progression i use
in my approach to aikido i hope it kind

918
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
in my approach to aikido i hope it kind
 

919
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,990
in my approach to aikido i hope it kind
of helps you think about aikido and what

920
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
of helps you think about aikido and what
 

921
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,710
of helps you think about aikido and what
it is and

922
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
it is and
 

923
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,790
it is and
and the pieces that are maybe missing in

924
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
and the pieces that are maybe missing in
 

925
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,710
and the pieces that are maybe missing in
aikido um and maybe kind of start to

926
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
aikido um and maybe kind of start to
 

927
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,990
aikido um and maybe kind of start to
suss those out for yourself

928
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
