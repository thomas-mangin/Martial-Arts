1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,990

okay so this is basic front kick

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,000
okay so this is basic front kick
 

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,110
okay so this is basic front kick
watch your sympathetic tension

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,120
watch your sympathetic tension
 

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,790
watch your sympathetic tension
so you go to and you have that

6
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
so you go to and you have that
 

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,390
so you go to and you have that
and you pull it in your hands

8
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400

 

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,310

or your leg is coming up

10
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
or your leg is coming up
 

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,870
or your leg is coming up
and you're losing your ground vector as

12
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880
and you're losing your ground vector as
 

13
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,590
and you're losing your ground vector as
you come up

14
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:23,600

 

15
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,189

so keep it as a release stroke i hit the

16
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
so keep it as a release stroke i hit the
 

17
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:27,830
so keep it as a release stroke i hit the
bag

18
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
bag
 

19
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,150
bag
i have the intention of hitting the bag

20
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
i have the intention of hitting the bag
 

21
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,669
i have the intention of hitting the bag
but my mind is not

22
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679
but my mind is not
 

23
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,670
but my mind is not
going into any sort of attachment

24
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:35,680
going into any sort of attachment
 

25
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,869
going into any sort of attachment
it is being fluid not attached

26
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879

 

27
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,030

just keep it at this pace where you can

28
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
just keep it at this pace where you can
 

29
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,709
just keep it at this pace where you can
keep your form

30
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719

 

31
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,069

and pay attention that you can control

32
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
and pay attention that you can control
 

33
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,630
and pay attention that you can control
your

34
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
your
 

35
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,310
your
landing and it's just as dynamic

36
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
landing and it's just as dynamic
 

37
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,430
landing and it's just as dynamic
as the first stance

38
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
as the first stance
 

39
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,310
as the first stance
just decide now okay

40
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320

 

41
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,509

okay so my dynamic stance i can try to

42
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
okay so my dynamic stance i can try to
 

43
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,149
okay so my dynamic stance i can try to
land

44
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
land
 

45
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,870
land
in it but if i don't land in it let's

46
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
in it but if i don't land in it let's
 

47
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,190
in it but if i don't land in it let's
say

48
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
say
 

49
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,670
say
oh then move the other foot so you do

50
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680
oh then move the other foot so you do
 

51
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,870
oh then move the other foot so you do
end up in it

52
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
end up in it
 

53
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,670
end up in it
it's not gymnastics where you have to

54
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
it's not gymnastics where you have to
 

55
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,590
it's not gymnastics where you have to
land like this and you lose a point for

56
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
land like this and you lose a point for
 

57
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,789
land like this and you lose a point for
taking a step

58
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
taking a step
 

59
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,910
taking a step
okay find your dynamic stance again all

60
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
okay find your dynamic stance again all
 

61
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,710
okay find your dynamic stance again all
right

62
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
right
 

63
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,070
right
because you're going to probably have to

64
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
because you're going to probably have to
 

65
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,070
because you're going to probably have to
use that now so this

66
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
use that now so this
 

67
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,590
use that now so this
is a technique timing technique

68
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
is a technique timing technique
 

69
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,390
is a technique timing technique
so he's coming to close the gap boom and

70
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
so he's coming to close the gap boom and
 

71
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,230
so he's coming to close the gap boom and
i'm going to throw that front kick in

72
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
i'm going to throw that front kick in
 

73
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,429
i'm going to throw that front kick in
that sweet spot

74
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
that sweet spot
 

75
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,550
that sweet spot
okay so he goes boom and i'll throw that

76
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
okay so he goes boom and i'll throw that
 

77
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,310
okay so he goes boom and i'll throw that
frost kick there so we're gonna do it on

78
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
frost kick there so we're gonna do it on
 

79
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,069
frost kick there so we're gonna do it on
the back

80
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
the back
 

81
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,749
the back
and it's a little different for the back

82
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
and it's a little different for the back
 

83
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,350
and it's a little different for the back
holder you're gonna have to trust the

84
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
holder you're gonna have to trust the
 

85
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,109
holder you're gonna have to trust the
foam technology

86
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
foam technology
 

87
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,710
foam technology
do not shove this bag into that person

88
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
do not shove this bag into that person

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
so it's not going to kill him he goes
 

107
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:22,550
so it's not going to kill him he goes
and i find that dynamic stance again

108
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
and i find that dynamic stance again
 

109
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,190
and i find that dynamic stance again
what i don't want to happen i'm out of

i'm not up here
 

121
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,830
i'm not up here
without the ground vector he hits the

122
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840

 

123
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,990

ground
 

125
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,949
ground
okay now he doesn't have the bag

126
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959

 

127
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,110

and we want to play with that dynamic

128
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
and we want to play with that dynamic
 

129
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,070
and we want to play with that dynamic
stance

130
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
stance
 

131
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,110
stance
okay so he goes i have the timing drill

132
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
okay so he goes i have the timing drill
 

133
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,110
okay so he goes i have the timing drill
boom let's do it from up from mcgartha

here he comes right

136
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560

sometimes your doesn't work comes
 

143
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,670
sometimes your doesn't work comes
back

144
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680
back
 

145
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:30,830

149
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,990

so when i do this move my hands have to

150
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
so when i do this move my hands have to
 

151
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,149
so when i do this move my hands have to
be under his hips

152
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
be under his hips
 

153
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,190
be under his hips
okay it's another time you move i gotta

154
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
okay it's another time you move i gotta
 

155
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,509
okay it's another time you move i gotta
hit it right in that sweet spot

156
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
hit it right in that sweet spot
 

157
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,509
hit it right in that sweet spot
and then i have this mid-foot vectoring

158
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
and then i have this mid-foot vectoring
 

159
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,630
and then i have this mid-foot vectoring
i'm not like this mid-foot vectoring and

160
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
i'm not like this mid-foot vectoring and
 

161
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,830
i'm not like this mid-foot vectoring and
as he goes over

162
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
as he goes over
 

163
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,589
as he goes over
i move past him

164
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599

 

165
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,910

00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080

 

169
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,589

you can brush the legs if you need it

170
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
you can brush the legs if you need it
 

171
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,469
you can brush the legs if you need it
sweet spot

172
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479

 

173
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,590

so again there's not two arts there's

174
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
