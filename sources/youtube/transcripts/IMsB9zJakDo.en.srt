1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,589

all right so let's do the other three

2
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:08,599
all right so let's do the other three
 

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:11,509
all right so let's do the other three
but let's point something out

4
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
but let's point something out
 

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,349
but let's point something out
here um he's pushing he's giving you the

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:16,359
here um he's pushing he's giving you the
 

7
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,349
here um he's pushing he's giving you the
Yang aspect

8
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,359
Yang aspect
 

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,269
Yang aspect
okay and what we're going to do is

10
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:24,279
okay and what we're going to do is
 

11
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,830
okay and what we're going to do is
Yin provide the yin aspect to it okay

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
Yin provide the yin aspect to it okay
 

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,429
Yin provide the yin aspect to it okay
we're going to do it both internally and

14
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:32,439
we're going to do it both internally and
 

15
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,750
we're going to do it both internally and
externally remember that

16
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:34,760
externally remember that
 

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,430
externally remember that
okay uh so for example we're here and so

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:38,440
okay uh so for example we're here and so
 

19
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,029
okay uh so for example we're here and so
I'm not going to do it externally but

20
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:41,039
I'm not going to do it externally but
 

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,430
I'm not going to do it externally but
I'll do it internally

22
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
I'll do it internally
 

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,790
I'll do it internally
okay and uh so I didn't move back I

24
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
okay and uh so I didn't move back I
 

25
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,229
okay and uh so I didn't move back I
didn't make circles or anything I'll do

26
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:49,239
didn't make circles or anything I'll do
 

27
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:50,630
didn't make circles or anything I'll do
it

28
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
it
 

29
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,189
it
internally and then you can

30
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199

 

31
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,990

see that what I'm allowing to happen is

32
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,000
see that what I'm allowing to happen is
 

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,310
see that what I'm allowing to happen is
for example he pushes on me I don't y or

34
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
for example he pushes on me I don't y or
 

35
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,030
for example he pushes on me I don't y or
try to resist it or externally go

36
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:10,040
try to resist it or externally go
 

37
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,350
try to resist it or externally go
backwards what's going to happen is I

38
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:12,360
backwards what's going to happen is I
 

39
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,710
backwards what's going to happen is I
internally yield eventually because he's

40
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:15,720
internally yield eventually because he's
 

41
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,310
internally yield eventually because he's
press into me I will touch the center so

42
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
press into me I will touch the center so
 

43
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,590
press into me I will touch the center so
you touch the

44
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:22,600

 

45
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,670

center without any kind of external

46
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
center without any kind of external
 

47
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,030
center without any kind of external
manipulation do you understand that so

48
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:28,040
manipulation do you understand that so
 

49
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,429
manipulation do you understand that so
here we're kind of here only

50
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:30,439
here we're kind of here only
 

51
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,149
here we're kind of here only
we're here only but as soon as I release

52
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:33,159
we're here only but as soon as I release
 

53
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,710
we're here only but as soon as I release
and he keeps pressing then

54
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:35,720
and he keeps pressing then
 

55
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,109
and he keeps pressing then
eventually I can feel the

56
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:40,119

 

57
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:46,630

center with no movement at

58
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640

 

59
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,670

all we're going to do that but we're

60
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
all we're going to do that but we're
 

61
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,789
all we're going to do that but we're
going to add an external yield but that

62
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
going to add an external yield but that
 

63
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,550
going to add an external yield but that
has to happen on the inside okay so for

64
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
has to happen on the inside okay so for
 

65
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,350
has to happen on the inside okay so for
example last time we did this some of

66
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
example last time we did this some of
 

67
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,749
example last time we did this some of
you had to bend your elbow and that's

68
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
you had to bend your elbow and that's
 

69
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,149
you had to bend your elbow and that's
because you don't have the internal

70
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:03,159
because you don't have the internal
 

71
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,510
because you don't have the internal
yield so all of it has to be achieved

72
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:06,520
yield so all of it has to be achieved
 

73
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,109
yield so all of it has to be achieved
externally okay but when I do that same

74
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:10,119
externally okay but when I do that same
 

75
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,750
externally okay but when I do that same
thing he's pushing pushing pushing

76
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
thing he's pushing pushing pushing
 

77
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,430
thing he's pushing pushing pushing
eventually he'll touch the center I'll

78
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:14,440
eventually he'll touch the center I'll
 

79
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,630
eventually he'll touch the center I'll
touch the center from where I at then I

80
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
touch the center from where I at then I
 

81
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,509
touch the center from where I at then I
can do it here and by the time we get

82
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:18,519
can do it here and by the time we get
 

83
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,670
can do it here and by the time we get
here we're already in that part you're

84
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:22,680
here we're already in that part you're
 

85
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,750
here we're already in that part you're
touching

86
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:28,760

 

87
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,430

him so even in the standard one you're

88
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:32,440
him so even in the standard one you're
 

89
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,229
him so even in the standard one you're
doing it so here you have your external

90
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:35,239
doing it so here you have your external
 

91
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,630
doing it so here you have your external
yield you

92
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
yield you
 

93
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,270
yield you
see but I need to get the internal

94
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:40,280
see but I need to get the internal
 

95
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,990
see but I need to get the internal
Center in the timing when I get here

96
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
Center in the timing when I get here
 

97
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,270
Center in the timing when I get here
then I already have

98
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280

 

99
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,350

that I don't not have it and then try to

100
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:52,360
that I don't not have it and then try to
 

101
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,030
that I don't not have it and then try to
push it over do you understand so I do

102
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,040
push it over do you understand so I do
 

103
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,270
push it over do you understand so I do
the part that you guys are

104
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:58,280
the part that you guys are
 

105
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,630
the part that you guys are
seeing here but you have to understand

106
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:01,640
seeing here but you have to understand
 

107
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,830
seeing here but you have to understand
by the time I get here I already feel

108
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:04,840
by the time I get here I already feel
 

109
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,830
by the time I get here I already feel
that I act I'm touching his Center I can

110
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
that I act I'm touching his Center I can
 

111
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,670
that I act I'm touching his Center I can
move him in different ways from

112
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680

 

113
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,190

here do you understand

114
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
here do you understand
 

115
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,470
here do you understand
okay so you have your standard one here

116
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:19,480
okay so you have your standard one here
 

117
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,869
okay so you have your standard one here
I touch right I'm in there standard one

118
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
I touch right I'm in there standard one
 

119
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,190
I touch right I'm in there standard one
and then I

120
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,200
and then I
 

121
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,270
and then I
just do the throw as you prescrib okay

122
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,280
just do the throw as you prescrib okay
 

123
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,270
just do the throw as you prescrib okay
on the other one same thing here I've

124
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
on the other one same thing here I've
 

125
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,990
on the other one same thing here I've
already touched I'm touching him the

126
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,000
already touched I'm touching him the
 

127
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,830
already touched I'm touching him the
same way touching his Center the same

128
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
same way touching his Center the same
 

129
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,190
same way touching his Center the same
way so you I'll try to let you so you

130
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
way so you I'll try to let you so you
 

131
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,710
way so you I'll try to let you so you
can see he could feel it but here he he

132
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
can see he could feel it but here he he
 

133
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,149
can see he could feel it but here he he
doesn't feel me in his Center and then

134
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:45,159
doesn't feel me in his Center and then
 

135
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,030
doesn't feel me in his Center and then
here he does so there's a couple things

136
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,040
here he does so there's a couple things
 

137
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,309
here he does so there's a couple things
so I'll bring him

138
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
so I'll bring him
 

139
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,229
so I'll bring him
up and he can hang out here because his

140
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
up and he can hang out here because his
 

141
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,229
up and he can hang out here because his
Center is actually my center now he

142
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:57,239
Center is actually my center now he
 

143
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,350
Center is actually my center now he
doesn't require great balance do you see

144
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:00,360
doesn't require great balance do you see
 

145
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,390
doesn't require great balance do you see
he's I'm perfectly balanced and

146
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,400
he's I'm perfectly balanced and
 

147
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,509
he's I'm perfectly balanced and
perfectly controlling him that's what

148
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
perfectly controlling him that's what
 

149
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,429
perfectly controlling him that's what
it's not like he's some Super Hyper

150
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
it's not like he's some Super Hyper
 

151
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,949
it's not like he's some Super Hyper
gymnastic person here okay and you can

152
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:09,959
gymnastic person here okay and you can
 

153
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,830
gymnastic person here okay and you can
put him

154
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840

 

155
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,949

back or as we were doing boom you can

156
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
back or as we were doing boom you can
 

157
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,629
back or as we were doing boom you can
project out

158
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:19,639
project out
 

159
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,270
project out
see so as we move on that's going to

160
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
see so as we move on that's going to
 

161
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,310
see so as we move on that's going to
become more important for the other ones

162
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
become more important for the other ones
 

163
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,110
become more important for the other ones
so you're going to have the yield

164
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
so you're going to have the yield
 

165
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,230
so you're going to have the yield

viability and you're looking at what was
DST Alchemy

336
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440

 

337
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,150

after the throw is not

338
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
after the throw is not
 

339
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,550
after the throw is not
it the throw is

340
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
it the throw is
 

341
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,030
it the throw is
more a symptom of the right d

342
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
more a symptom of the right d
 

343
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,790
more a symptom of the right d
Alchemy

344
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:51,800
Alchemy
 

345
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,710
Alchemy
so why is this a DST alchemical

346
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
so why is this a DST alchemical
 

347
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,790
so why is this a DST alchemical

393
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,110

okay

404
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:36,519
okay
 

405
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:39,829
okay
so I would say I would encourage you not

406
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
so I would say I would encourage you not
 

407
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,069
so I would say I would encourage you not
to do the throws but

408
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
to do the throws but
 

409
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,230
to do the throws but
really I imagine at one point I'll stop

410
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:45,240
really I imagine at one point I'll stop
 

411
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,949
really I imagine at one point I'll stop
doing the Marshall part and just do this

412
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
doing the Marshall part and just do this
 

413
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,509
doing the Marshall part and just do this
paired alchemical part where he'll push

414
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
paired alchemical part where he'll push
 

415
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,069
paired alchemical part where he'll push
and I will continue to not be triggered

416
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:57,079
and I will continue to not be triggered
 

417
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:05,389
and I will continue to not be triggered
by it regardless of my

418
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:05,399

 

419
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,030

posture just keep

420
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,040
posture just keep
 

421
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,150
posture just keep
releasing you can you can you keep ping

422
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,160
releasing you can you can you keep ping
 

423
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,350

okay and put myself in totally

424
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:14,360
okay and put myself in totally
 

425
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,550
okay and put myself in totally
biomechanically unsound positions to see

426
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560
biomechanically unsound positions to see
 

427
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,949
biomechanically unsound positions to see
if I can continue to

428
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:21,959
if I can continue to
 

429
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:27,750
if I can continue to
release and let that energy through

430
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760

 

431
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,550

433
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,910

right again we're I'm in his Center

434
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
right again we're I'm in his Center
 

435
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,110
right again we're I'm in his Center
because of the way this

436
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:42,120

 

437
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,509

works you understand I mention this so

438
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
works you understand I mention this so
 

439
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,430
works you understand I mention this so
you stop chasing the

440
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
you stop chasing the
 

441
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,670
you stop chasing the
throat and

442
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680

Chase young aspect

444
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
Chase young aspect
 

445
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,150
Chase young aspect
comes

446
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160

 

447
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,389

non-contest then you'll feel the two

448
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
non-contest then you'll feel the two
 

449
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,550
non-contest then you'll feel the two
minds

450
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560

reconcile okay we're just kind of

452
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:03,880
reconcile okay we're just kind of
 

453
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,710
reconcile okay we're just kind of
tasking

454
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:05,720
tasking
 

455
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:12,550
tasking
ourselves with or better said we have

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560

 

457
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,990

throws where the manner in which the

throws where the manner in which the
 

459
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,230

energetic reconciliation do you

462
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,000
energetic reconciliation do you
 

463
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,110
energetic reconciliation do you
understand it's kind of like um an x-ray

464
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:26,120
understand it's kind of like um an x-ray
 

465
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,590
understand it's kind of like um an x-ray
you get to see inside what's happening

466
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:30,600
you get to see inside what's happening
 

467
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,749
you get to see inside what's happening
okay so we have the other one and let's

468
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:35,759
okay so we have the other one and let's
 

469
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,710
okay so we have the other one and let's
take the hand of the first and second

470
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:39,720
take the hand of the first and second
 

471
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,710
take the hand of the first and second
technique so this hand is internally
