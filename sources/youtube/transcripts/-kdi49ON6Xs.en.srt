this technique or can you do that
 

121
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,110

probably be asking why doesn't he do
 

127
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,869
probably be asking why doesn't he do
that technique because that's I

128

that technique because that's I
 

129
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,470
that technique because that's I
don't do that technique okay and I have

130
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:27,480
don't do that technique okay and I have
 

131
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,270
don't do that technique okay and I have
humored a few of you but I think you

132
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:30,280
humored a few of you but I think you
 

133
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,910
humored a few of you but I think you
should probably question why do you feel

134
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:32,920
should probably question why do you feel
 

135
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,309
should probably question why do you feel
the need to have every single technique

kokun nag I don't do

146
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
kokun nag I don't do
 

147
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,229
kokun nag I don't do
kokun at jodon level for example

148
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:51,239
kokun at jodon level for example
 

149
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,949
kokun at jodon level for example
although it is very common to do at

150
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
although it is very common to do at
 

151
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,470
although it is very common to do at
jodon level I don't do it at Joon level

152
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
jodon level I don't do it at Joon level
 

153
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,390
jodon level I don't do it at Joon level
because you have to

154
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
because you have to
 

155
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,030
because you have to
uncheck the person in order to check

156
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,040
uncheck the person in order to check
 

157
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,509
uncheck the person in order to check
them again and that makes no Marshall

158
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:04,519
them again and that makes no Marshall
 

159
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,990
them again and that makes no Marshall
sense I think most people do jodon

160
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
sense I think most people do jodon
 

161
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,350
sense I think most people do jodon
because it allows them to wind up the

162
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
because it allows them to wind up the
 

163
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,869
because it allows them to wind up the
arm uh much more and generate more Force

164
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
arm uh much more and generate more Force
 

165
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,189
arm uh much more and generate more Force
so it's a muscle Reliant external Force

166
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:18,199
so it's a muscle Reliant external Force
 

167
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,789
so it's a muscle Reliant external Force
engine uh that is doesn't make any

okay so I'm going to answer the the

172
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
okay so I'm going to answer the the
 

173
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,270
okay so I'm going to answer the the
questions on kokun Naga from gon

174
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
questions on kokun Naga from gon
 

175
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,469
questions on kokun Naga from gon
but if you want to do it at jodon just

176
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:33,479
but if you want to do it at jodon just
 

177
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,629
but if you want to do it at jodon just
remember how to transition from gon to

178
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:35,639
remember how to transition from gon to
 

179
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,590
remember how to transition from gon to
jodon and then you do you

180
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:40,600

 

181
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,469

okay

182
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479

 

183
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,110

in this kind of

184
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120

 

185
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,909

00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,150
know that I have to utilize the
centrifugal uh and centripetal energies

190
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
centrifugal uh and centripetal energies
 

191
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,550

205
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,110

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,120
that in order to use the centrifugal or
 

207
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,189
that in order to use the centrifugal or

okay so the takeaway from what I just

212
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,000
okay so the takeaway from what I just
 

213
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,469
okay so the takeaway from what I just
said the overall pattern must be spiral

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,950
here is at best if you pay attention if
you slow down the

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,309
okay so if you look at this relationship
and you plot it in space Here's the tip

00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,309
at this point and the worst part is that
this is actually a turn and what ends up

262
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:55,319
this is actually a turn and what ends up
 

263
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,390
this is actually a turn and what ends up
happening is

264
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,400
happening is
 

265
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,270
happening is
at a certain moment

266
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,280
at a certain moment

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,189
at a certain moment
as I turn in my Tenon here my back is

00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,150
as I turn in my Tenon here my back is
actually to ukit which is not Marshall

270
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
actually to ukit which is not Marshall
 

271
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,550

at all that is totally wrong

272
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
at all that is totally wrong
 

273
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,830
at all that is totally wrong
okay but what the good trained Uka does

274
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
okay but what the good trained Uka does
 

275
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,150
okay but what the good trained Uka does
is they keep coming by and now you've

276
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
is they keep coming by and now you've
 

277
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,270
is they keep coming by and now you've
reconciled that Marshall problem which

278
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,280
reconciled that Marshall problem which
 

279
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,629
reconciled that Marshall problem which
would never be reconciled in real life

280
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
would never be reconciled in real life
 

281
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,749
would never be reconciled in real life
okay so now the now the UK is over

282
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
okay so now the now the UK is over
 

283
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,950
okay so now the now the UK is over
here okay and then you end up

284
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:29,960
here okay and then you end up
 

285
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,309
here okay and then you end up
accelerating them more this

286
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:33,319
accelerating them more this
 

287
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,670
accelerating them more this
way the throw happens you you send your

288
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:36,680
way the throw happens you you send your
 

289
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,510
way the throw happens you you send your
Force this

290
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:38,520
Force this
 

291
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,469
Force this
way and this accelerates the UK this

292
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
way and this accelerates the UK this
 

293
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,189
way and this accelerates the UK this
over here and then some here some where

294
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:46,199
over here and then some here some where
 

295
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,469
over here and then some here some where
in here for some reason the UK does a

296
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:49,479
in here for some reason the UK does a
 

297
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,830
in here for some reason the UK does a
forward rule they go Topsy Turvy okay

298
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:52,840
forward rule they go Topsy Turvy okay
 

299
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,869
forward rule they go Topsy Turvy okay
but if you look at this

300
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
but if you look at this
 

301
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,909
but if you look at this
shape there is nothing in here that

302
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
shape there is nothing in here that
 

303
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,510
shape there is nothing in here that
resembles anything that we just

304
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:00,520
resembles anything that we just
 

305
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,430
resembles anything that we just
said and in fact you're doing the 180

306
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
said and in fact you're doing the 180
 

307
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,430
said and in fact you're doing the 180
violation and here's

308
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:08,440
violation and here's
 

309
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,149
violation and here's
why for you to accelerate UK in this

310
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:13,159
why for you to accelerate UK in this
 

311
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,589
why for you to accelerate UK in this
direction which is what you're

312
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
direction which is what you're
 

313
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,309
direction which is what you're
doing you're on their 180 and all you're

314
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:19,319
doing you're on their 180 and all you're
 

315
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,469
doing you're on their 180 and all you're
doing is overpowering the inertia to

316
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:23,479
doing is overpowering the inertia to
 

317
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,830
doing is overpowering the inertia to
maintain their whatever acceleration

318
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:26,840
maintain their whatever acceleration
 

319
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,749
maintain their whatever acceleration
they have at that moment you now you amp

320
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
they have at that moment you now you amp
 

321
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,230
they have at that moment you now you amp
y it so you're just pushing on them

322
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:33,240
y it so you're just pushing on them
 

323
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,790
y it so you're just pushing on them
that's all you're doing if you weren't

324
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:35,800
that's all you're doing if you weren't
 

325
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,589
that's all you're doing if you weren't
able to overcome the inertia of their

326
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
able to overcome the inertia of their
 

327
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,469
able to overcome the inertia of their
given velocity at that time you would

328
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
given velocity at that time you would
 

329
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,470
given velocity at that time you would

starting that actual thing that would
 

479
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,030
starting that actual thing that would
have been used against me I want them to

480
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,040
have been used against me I want them to
 

481
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,150
have been used against me I want them to
reorient themselves but my angle is too

482
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
reorient themselves but my angle is too
 

483
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,710
reorient themselves but my angle is too
acute and I end up on the side of them

484
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:09,720
acute and I end up on the side of them
 

485
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,790
acute and I end up on the side of them
with them kind of more coming from this

486
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:15,800

 

487
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,710

angle okay so they're not totally doing

488
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:19,720

489
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,430

this angle
 

491
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,110
this angle
anymore it kind of looks like

492
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120

 

493
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,550

this they kind of go like this boom that

494
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:31,560
this they kind of go like this boom that
 

495
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,350
this they kind of go like this boom that
was it that's all I need to start the

496
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:34,360
was it that's all I need to start the
 

497
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,470
was it that's all I need to start the
rotation

498
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480

 

499
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,110

okay so I'm here

500
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120

 

501
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,230

now and when I throw now I turn within

502
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:49,240
now and when I throw now I turn within
 

503
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,430
now and when I throw now I turn within
this

504
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
this
 

505
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,189
this
area okay and as I enter that spirals

506
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
area okay and as I enter that spirals
 

507
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,030
area okay and as I enter that spirals
out and here's where the throw happens

508
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,040
out and here's where the throw happens
 

509
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,949
out and here's where the throw happens
because I'm in this middle spiral that's

510
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:03,959
because I'm in this middle spiral that's
 

511
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:04,910
because I'm in this middle spiral that's
ever

512
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:04,920
ever
 

513
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,230
ever
expanding and the centrifugal energy is

514
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
expanding and the centrifugal energy is
 

515
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,269
expanding and the centrifugal energy is
now established from where I am and that

516
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:11,279
now established from where I am and that
 

517
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:18,069
now established from where I am and that
is what is added to UK so I'm not just

518
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
is what is added to UK so I'm not just
 

519
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,910
is what is added to UK so I'm not just
throwing them and speeding them up here

520
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:20,920
throwing them and speeding them up here
 

521
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,269
throwing them and speeding them up here
the centrifugal energy right here of the

522
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:24,279
the centrifugal energy right here of the
 

523
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,629
the centrifugal energy right here of the
circle is what's accelerating them out

524
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:27,639
circle is what's accelerating them out
 

525
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:30,629
circle is what's accelerating them out
they go okay but that's only one of the

526
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:30,639
they go okay but that's only one of the
 

527
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,990
they go okay but that's only one of the
three forces that I use in the

528
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,000
three forces that I use in the
 

529
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,749
three forces that I use in the
throw I want to generate that outward

530
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:36,759
throw I want to generate that outward
 

531
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,310
throw I want to generate that outward
pulling energy to do that we can't make

532
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:41,320
pulling energy to do that we can't make
 

533
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,030
pulling energy to do that we can't make
this shape we have to make this

534
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,040
this shape we have to make this
 

535
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,470
this shape we have to make this
shape a very very easy way to understand

536
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
shape a very very easy way to understand
 

537
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,949

for a lot of Dojo but you know what

562
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
for a lot of Dojo but you know what
 

563
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,389
for a lot of Dojo but you know what
off figure it out is how that's how it

off figure it out is how that's how it
 

565
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,710
off figure it out is how that's how it
works okay I've been in some little Dojo

566
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:33,720
works okay I've been in some little Dojo
 

567
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,389
works okay I've been in some little Dojo
like in Japan I trained in a in a dojo

568
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:37,399
like in Japan I trained in a in a dojo
 

569

that would rent the space of a
 

571
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,430
that would rent the space of a
kindergarten classroom and um the dojo

572
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
kindergarten classroom and um the dojo
 

573
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,990
kindergarten classroom and um the dojo
was so small and everyone's doing uh

574
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,000
was so small and everyone's doing uh
 

575
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,030
was so small and everyone's doing uh
Tristan if you don't mind like let's say

we're doing yesterday's technique okay

578
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:53,079
we're doing yesterday's technique okay
 

579
00:15:53,079 --> 00:16:01,470
we're doing yesterday's technique okay
and they would do it like this

580
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:01,480

 

581
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,110

and it's like it's too small in

582
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,120
and it's like it's too small in
 

583
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,870
and it's like it's too small in
here they they adopted the technique to

584
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
here they they adopted the technique to
 

585
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,749
here they they adopted the technique to
the environment he like No And I was

586
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:08,759
the environment he like No And I was
 

587
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,990
the environment he like No And I was
like I'm not coming here

okay
 

591
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,230
okay
um do you get what I'm saying it's like

592
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,240
um do you get what I'm saying it's like
 

593
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,790
um do you get what I'm saying it's like
that's stupid but that's how people are

594
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:17,800
that's stupid but that's how people are
 

595
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,629
that's stupid but that's how people are
people are stupid that that Dojo was

596
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
people are stupid that that Dojo was
 

597
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,430
people are stupid that that Dojo was
about goes down the street I could just

598
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
about goes down the street I could just
 

599
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,949
about goes down the street I could just
walk there you're not learning the Art

600
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:25,959
walk there you're not learning the Art
 

601
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,230
walk there you're not learning the Art
Walk someplace else it's that simple

602
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,240
Walk someplace else it's that simple
 

603
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,389
Walk someplace else it's that simple
okay so sometimes here we split them out

604
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:31,399
okay so sometimes here we split them out
 

605
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:34,870
okay so sometimes here we split them out
in half uh we might turn or something

606
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
in half uh we might turn or something
 

607
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,590
in half uh we might turn or something
like that and we look for the this

608
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:38,600
like that and we look for the this
 

609
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,110
like that and we look for the this
pattern that the trajectory of the UK is

610
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,120
pattern that the trajectory of the UK is
 

611
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,790
pattern that the trajectory of the UK is
going to go this way not this way this

612
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
going to go this way not this way this
 

613
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,309
going to go this way not this way this
is incorrect okay all right so let me

614
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:50,319
is incorrect okay all right so let me
 

615
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:52,110
is incorrect okay all right so let me
show you what I was talking about just

616
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,120
show you what I was talking about just
 

617
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,749
show you what I was talking about just
now okay so in our Dojo the ocean is

618
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:54,759
now okay so in our Dojo the ocean is
 

619
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:57,749
now okay so in our Dojo the ocean is
South the ocean's over there and then

620
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
South the ocean's over there and then
 

621
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,550
South the ocean's over there and then
the mountains are North

622
00:16:59,550 --> 00:16:59,560
the mountains are North
 

623
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,949
the mountains are North
awesome sound bar okay so this is West

624
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:03,959
awesome sound bar okay so this is West
 

625
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,230
awesome sound bar okay so this is West
and this is East so in most

626
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,240
and this is East so in most
 

627
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,590
and this is East so in most
Dojo the um the person is going to come

628
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:10,600
Dojo the um the person is going to come
 

629
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,309
Dojo the um the person is going to come
from West and then go

630
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:14,319
from West and then go
 

631
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,350
from West and then go
east okay and if comes from the other

632
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360

 

633
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,350

side same thing okay in terms of

634
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:22,360
side same thing okay in terms of
 

635
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,270
side same thing okay in terms of
trajectory in in my trajectory he's

636
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
trajectory in in my trajectory he's
 

637
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,070
trajectory in in my trajectory he's
going to go this way

638
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,080
going to go this way
 

639
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,230
going to go this way
again he came from that way he has to go

640
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
again he came from that way he has to go
 

641
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,150
again he came from that way he has to go
the other he has to go

642
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,160
the other he has to go
 

643
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,669
the other he has to go
this

644
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
this
 

645
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,710
this
okay uh in terms of most people we slow

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,510

okay what I want to do instead is meet

660
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520
okay what I want to do instead is meet
 

661
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,350
okay what I want to do instead is meet
him you see I meet

662
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:12,360
him you see I meet
 

663
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,870
him you see I meet
him so that I have his

664
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880

 

665
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,070

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
back the reason why people have to do
 

667
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,070
back the reason why people have to do
the other thing is because they have to

668
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
the other thing is because they have to
 

669
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,390
the other thing is because they have to
accelerate him so for

670
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:27,400
accelerate him so for
 

671
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,549
accelerate him so for
example let's say I don't do

672
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
example let's say I don't do
 

673
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,029
example let's say I don't do
it I get in the back of him do you

674
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:36,039
it I get in the back of him do you
 

675
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:41,029
it I get in the back of him do you
see and uh now I try to accelerate him

676
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
see and uh now I try to accelerate him
 

677
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,950
see and uh now I try to accelerate him
down keep your I Tred to accelerate him

678
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960

 

679
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,310

down and you can see when I do that that

680
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:51,320
down and you can see when I do that that
 

681
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,149
down and you can see when I do that that
his inertia of the upright position is

682
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:55,159
his inertia of the upright position is
 

683
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:57,630
his inertia of the upright position is
now being contested with when I cut down

684
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:57,640
now being contested with when I cut down
 

685
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,549
now being contested with when I cut down
on you okay

686
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:01,559

 

687
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,029

if you now watch this I get I go ahead

688
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:05,039
if you now watch this I get I go ahead
 

689
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,029
if you now watch this I get I go ahead
and I get in the

690
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
and I get in the
 

691
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,350
and I get in the
box and I look now for the checked

692
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:10,360
box and I look now for the checked
 

693
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,950

unchecked okay he's unchecked right now

694
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
unchecked okay he's unchecked right now
 

695
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,909

00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:20,919

 

697
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:24,870

here put pieces together okay if I could

00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
here put pieces together okay if I could
 

699
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,909
here put pieces together okay if I could
get in the

700
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
get in the
 

701
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,350
get in the
back whoops come on okay and I use

702
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:30,360
back whoops come on okay and I use
 

703
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,230
back whoops come on okay and I use
uncheck and

704
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240
uncheck and
 

705
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,630
uncheck and
then okay now I want to add the third

706
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:35,640
then okay now I want to add the third
 

707
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,630
then okay now I want to add the third
piece uh just one out of the technique

708
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,640
piece uh just one out of the technique
 

709
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,549
piece uh just one out of the technique
instead of doing a forward R okay so I'm

710
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:41,559
instead of doing a forward R okay so I'm
 

711
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:46,070

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,149

Bo you're going to have to do it harder

714
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:49,159
Bo you're going to have to do it harder
 

715
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:55,590
Bo you're going to have to do it harder
going to have to contest

716
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600

 

717
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,470

more there's no way he could he would

718
00:19:59,470 --> 00:19:59,480
more there's no way he could he would
 

719
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,149
more there's no way he could he would
have to fall in that there's just no way

720
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,159
have to fall in that there's just no way
 

721
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,149
have to fall in that there's just no way
if I could even overpower him

722
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:05,159
if I could even overpower him
 

723
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:08,830
if I could even overpower him
okay uh he's actually stronger than me

724
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:08,840
okay uh he's actually stronger than me
 

725
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,750
okay uh he's actually stronger than me
don't let me cut your hand down get

726
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:13,760

 

727
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,350

it not going to be able to do that okay

728
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
it not going to be able to do that okay
 

729
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,990
it not going to be able to do that okay
but if I do the turn in front of him to

730
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,000
but if I do the turn in front of him to
 

731
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,350
but if I do the turn in front of him to
expose my

732
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
expose my
 

733
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,190
expose my
back you see then I can put his hand

734
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
back you see then I can put his hand
 

735
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,990
back you see then I can put his hand
further out in front of him making it

736
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
further out in front of him making it
 

737
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,430
further out in front of him making it
easier to accelerate him do you see how

738
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:37,440
easier to accelerate him do you see how
 

739
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,990
easier to accelerate him do you see how
I'm doing that it would be no it's very

740
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm doing that it would be no it's very
 

741
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,549
I'm doing that it would be no it's very
much akin to

742
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:43,559

 

743
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,270

this because I can step and go forward

744
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
this because I can step and go forward
 

745
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,549
this because I can step and go forward
but that doesn't really change anything

746
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:49,559
but that doesn't really change anything
 

747
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,390
but that doesn't really change anything
so let's exaggerate the fact that I turn

748
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,400
so let's exaggerate the fact that I turn
 

749
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,789
so let's exaggerate the fact that I turn
in front so that I can accelerate more

this will allow me to single pivot point
turn this will allow me to be the circle

829
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:06,640
turn this will allow me to be the circle
 

830
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,789
turn this will allow me to be the circle
and this will allow me to do the second

831
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:10,799
and this will allow me to do the second
 

832
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,110
and this will allow me to do the second
of three elements for the throw okay so

833
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,120
of three elements for the throw okay so
 

834
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:20,870
of three elements for the throw okay so
I know I want to get theal

835
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880

 

836
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,310

energy that's one energy of the throw

837
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
energy that's one energy of the throw
 

838
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,909
energy that's one energy of the throw
the other energy is going to be my Emi

839
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:27,919
the other energy is going to be my Emi
 

840
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,669
the other energy is going to be my Emi
angle

841
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
angle
 

842
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,310
angle
as I'm bringing him across I'm going to

843
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:33,320
as I'm bringing him across I'm going to
 

844
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:49,269
as I'm bringing him across I'm going to
attach the

845
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:49,279

 

846
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,350

leg I'm not accelerating him I'm going

847
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:52,360
leg I'm not accelerating him I'm going
 

848
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,870
leg I'm not accelerating him I'm going
to spin his body in place

849
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880
to spin his body in place
 

850
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,750
to spin his body in place
okay so in I'm behind going this

851
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:00,760
okay so in I'm behind going this
 

852
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,430
okay so in I'm behind going this
way stay up with

853
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:04,440

 

854
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,470

me in and behind is going this

855
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
me in and behind is going this
 

856
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,710
me in and behind is going this
way cental

857
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:11,720
way cental
 

858
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:29,070
way cental
energy anding behind my leg go

859
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,080

 

860
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,909

the third element of the

861
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:31,919
the third element of the
 

862
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,750
the third element of the
throw

863
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
throw
 

864
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,230
throw
is the adhesion at the

865
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:37,240
is the adhesion at the
 

866
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,870
is the adhesion at the
hand to get his

867
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
hand to get his
 

868
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,669
hand to get his
elbow

869
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:44,679

 

870
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:50,310

stay to

871
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,320

 

872
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,230

drop so we know that his body has

873
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
drop so we know that his body has
 

874
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,870
drop so we know that his body has
inertia and I don't want

875
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
inertia and I don't want
 

876
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,310
inertia and I don't want
to excel accelerate it against it but I

877
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:01,320
to excel accelerate it against it but I
 

878
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,430
to excel accelerate it against it but I
also don't want to push it down so he

879
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:04,440
also don't want to push it down so he
 

880
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,789
also don't want to push it down so he
his inertia is keeping him in place in

881
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:06,799
his inertia is keeping him in place in
 

882
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,789
his inertia is keeping him in place in
an erect posture so what I'm going to do

883
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:10,799
an erect posture so what I'm going to do
 

884
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,710
an erect posture so what I'm going to do
is 90° to it so I keep doing this with

885
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:13,720
is 90° to it so I keep doing this with
 

886
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,870
is 90° to it so I keep doing this with
his hand keep moving it

887
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:17,880
his hand keep moving it
 

888
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,190
his hand keep moving it
around it's no different than when he

889
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:20,200
around it's no different than when he
 

890
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,669
around it's no different than when he
was down

891
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:21,679
was down
 

892
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,630
was down
in and he tries to bring his head up I

893
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:24,640
in and he tries to bring his head up I
 

894
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,430
in and he tries to bring his head up I
brought his head forward I now do it in

895
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440
brought his head forward I now do it in
 

896
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,470
brought his head forward I now do it in
the half

897
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:30,480

 

898
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,230

okay and when you do that his body is

899
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,240
okay and when you do that his body is
 

900
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,990
okay and when you do that his body is
going to go across your leg and you get

901
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,000
going to go across your leg and you get
 

902
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,389
going to go across your leg and you get
to use that second Force I prob so I'm

903
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:40,399
to use that second Force I prob so I'm
 

904
00:25:40,399 --> 00:26:01,470
to use that second Force I prob so I'm
going to go one two

905
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:01,480

 

906
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,630

the adhesion open your grip okay the

907
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
the adhesion open your grip okay the
 

908
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,750
the adhesion open your grip okay the
adhesion is what's doing

909
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:06,760
adhesion is what's doing
 

910
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,190
adhesion is what's doing
it don't use his fingers don't use his

911
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:10,200
it don't use his fingers don't use his
 

912
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:44,789
it don't use his fingers don't use his
fingers you're in the Palm moving

913
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799

 

914
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,510

you can do it without the leg um sweep

915
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
you can do it without the leg um sweep
 

916
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,470
you can do it without the leg um sweep
especially for IDs that aren't used to

917
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:51,480
especially for IDs that aren't used to
 

918
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,990
especially for IDs that aren't used to
this you just kind of go a little

919
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,000
this you just kind of go a little
 

920
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,350
this you just kind of go a little
shallower but you keep the same powder

921
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
shallower but you keep the same powder
 

922
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,070
shallower but you keep the same powder
so it's instead of uh attacking this leg

923
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,080
so it's instead of uh attacking this leg
 

924
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:11,149
so it's instead of uh attacking this leg
boom

925

926
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,909

there I just go a little shallower but I

927
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:14,919
there I just go a little shallower but I
 

928
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,909
there I just go a little shallower but I
do the same

straighten again and just to pull down
 

964
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,509
straighten again and just to pull down
on his grip so his arm should never be

965
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:05,519
on his grip so his arm should never be
 

966
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,909
on his grip so his arm should never be
straight once the technique starts his

967
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:07,919
straight once the technique starts his
 

968
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,750
straight once the technique starts his
arm stays in this position okay the

969
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
arm stays in this position okay the
 

970
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,110

is it usually happens because you're not

973
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,200
is it usually happens because you're not
 

974
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,310
is it usually happens because you're not
strong enough for the mass that you're

975
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:19,320
strong enough for the mass that you're
 

976
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:25,190
strong enough for the mass that you're
uh resisting so the UK will come up you

977
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,200
uh resisting so the UK will come up you
 

978
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,070
uh resisting so the UK will come up you
see and then you take them back down

979
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,080
see and then you take them back down
 

980
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,310
see and then you take them back down
it's like a little merry go around to

it's like a little merry go around to
 

982
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,389
it's like a little merry go around to
this thing okay so you're here and they

00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:33,399
this thing okay so you're here and they
 

984
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:35,870
this thing okay so you're here and they
come up and then you

990
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,430

again you're in the wrong place and

991

again you're in the wrong place and
 

992
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,350
again you're in the wrong place and
you're doing the wrong thing okay so he

993
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:46,360
you're doing the wrong thing okay so he
 

994
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,750
you're doing the wrong thing okay so he
shouldn't come up and then done you

995
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
shouldn't come up and then done you
 

996
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,350
shouldn't come up and then done you
should let him up and he shouldn't make

997
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,360
should let him up and he shouldn't make
 

998
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,190

way well if that Force Vector is going
 

1072
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,909
way well if that Force Vector is going
back that way then the 90° is here I

1073
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:17,919
back that way then the 90° is here I

going to pull on it so you have to do
 

1198
