weight

10
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
weight
 

11
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,150
weight
needs to be directable

12
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160

 

13
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,510

it's not just weight on him but wait

14
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
it's not just weight on him but wait
 

15
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,550
it's not just weight on him but wait
where it's to your advantage

16
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
where it's to your advantage
 

17
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,670
where it's to your advantage
and wait

and wait
 

19
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,870
and wait
not where it's to your disadvantage so

not where it's to your disadvantage so
 

21
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,950
not where it's to your disadvantage so
you have the spine and you want to

22
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:26,960
you have the spine and you want to
 

23
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,550
you have the spine and you want to
understand

24
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
understand
 

25
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,029
understand
the point of no return

26
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
the point of no return
 

27
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,670
the point of no return
regarding your balance okay so even

28
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
regarding your balance okay so even
 

29
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,510
regarding your balance okay so even
though you're on the ground there's

30
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
though you're on the ground there's
 

31
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,030
though you're on the ground there's
still balance and still the tactic

32
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
still balance and still the tactic
 

33
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,470
still balance and still the tactic
of attacking balance okay so for example

34
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
of attacking balance okay so for example
 

35
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,549
of attacking balance okay so for example
if i bring my weight

36
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
if i bring my weight
 

37
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,069
if i bring my weight
too far over his spine it's easy for him

38
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
too far over his spine it's easy for him
 

39
00:00:48,079 --> 00:01:00,229
too far over his spine it's easy for him
to take my balance this way

40
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239

 

41
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,069

if you can
 

45
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,710
if you can
be aware of that center line

46
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
be aware of that center line
 

47
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,469
be aware of that center line
all things being equal if you can

48
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
all things being equal if you can
 

49
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,750
all things being equal if you can
place your way to attack his respiratory

50
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
place your way to attack his respiratory
 

51
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,910
place your way to attack his respiratory
system

system
 

53
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,469
system
so solar plexus

54
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
so solar plexus
 

55
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,789
so solar plexus
diaphragm

56
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799

abdominals
 

61
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,310
abdominals
best diaphragm solar plexus but

62
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
best diaphragm solar plexus but
 

63
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,469
best diaphragm solar plexus but
sometimes you don't have that because

64
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
sometimes you don't have that because
 

65
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,830
sometimes you don't have that because
you're up high

66
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
you're up high
 

67
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,950
you're up high
then try to compress this chest

68
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
then try to compress this chest
 

69
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,950
then try to compress this chest
sometimes you can't do

70
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
sometimes you can't do
 

71
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,870
sometimes you can't do
solar plexus diaphragm because you're

72
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
solar plexus diaphragm because you're
 

73
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,270
solar plexus diaphragm because you're
down low and try to stop the expansion

74
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
down low and try to stop the expansion
 

75
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,469
down low and try to stop the expansion
of the stomach

76
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479

 

77
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,950

so we're working

78
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
so we're working
 

79
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,429
so we're working
this basic side control

80
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
this basic side control
 

81
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,109
this basic side control
we're going to work the principle of

82
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
we're going to work the principle of
 

83
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,109
we're going to work the principle of
don't create space

84
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
don't create space
 

85
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,950
don't create space
create space

86
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
create space
 

87
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,630
create space
he can move

88
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
he can move
 

89
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,789
he can move
he can move he can counter if he can

90
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
he can move he can counter if he can
 

91
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,030
he can move he can counter if he can
counter he can attack

92
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
counter he can attack
 

93
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,429
counter he can attack
so don't create space

94
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439

 

95
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,910

you create space you're going to violate

96
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
you create space you're going to violate
 

97
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,990
you create space you're going to violate
the first rule too you're not going to

98
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
the first rule too you're not going to
 

99
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,670
the first rule too you're not going to
have weight on the guy

100
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
have weight on the guy
 

101
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,510
have weight on the guy
okay

102
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
okay
 

103
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,949
okay
so i'm up close

104
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
so i'm up close
 

105
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,350
so i'm up close
up close a lot of times you think this

106
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
up close a lot of times you think this
 

107
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,190
up close a lot of times you think this
is close and this is not close there's

108
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
is close and this is not close there's
 

109
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,510
is close and this is not close there's
space there see i can fit my hand in

110
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520

 

111
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,510

close close close

112
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
close close close
 

113
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,949
close close close
close

114
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:28,959
close
 

115
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,150
close
okay

116
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160

 

117
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,750

third principle

118
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
third principle
 

119
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,949
third principle
you can also use your weight because

120
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
you can also use your weight because
 

121
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,350
you can also use your weight because
it's mainly produced by the majority of

122
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
it's mainly produced by the majority of
 

123
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,150
it's mainly produced by the majority of
your mass

124
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160

 

125
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,150

in an attacking way

126
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
in an attacking way
 

127
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,150
in an attacking way
so here he has a common frame

128
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
so here he has a common frame
 

129
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,630
so here he has a common frame
and you can attack the frame with your

130
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
and you can attack the frame with your
 

131
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,229
and you can attack the frame with your
weight

132
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
weight
 

133
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,190
weight
you know that he's strongest he has the

134
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
you know that he's strongest he has the
 

135
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,990
you know that he's strongest he has the
most leverage on his center line

136
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
most leverage on his center line
 

137
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,110
most leverage on his center line
a frame that's too far out is not afraid

138
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
a frame that's too far out is not afraid
 

139
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,070
a frame that's too far out is not afraid
okay

140
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
okay
 

141
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,190
okay
so i can put my weight in a way

142
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
so i can put my weight in a way
 

143
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,229
so i can put my weight in a way
that i

144
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
that i
 

145
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,430
that i
create that mechanical disadvantage on

146
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
create that mechanical disadvantage on
 

147
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,750
create that mechanical disadvantage on
that but i do with my body how i'm

148
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
that but i do with my body how i'm
 

149
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,430
that but i do with my body how i'm
putting my weight there

150
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440

 

151
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,790

next you can make yourself uh when you

152
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
next you can make yourself uh when you
 

153
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,270
next you can make yourself uh when you
put your weight you can use your

154
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
put your weight you can use your
 

155
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,990
put your weight you can use your
musculature to pull him into you pull

156
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
musculature to pull him into you pull
 

157
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,309
musculature to pull him into you pull
you down to him but you don't want to

158
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
you down to him but you don't want to
 

159
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,630
you down to him but you don't want to
burn out your arms so you'll do it by

160
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
burn out your arms so you'll do it by
 

161
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,190
burn out your arms so you'll do it by
reinforcing your grips and things like

162
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
reinforcing your grips and things like
 

163
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,830
reinforcing your grips and things like
that okay

164
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
that okay
 

165
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,750
that okay
and lastly what we're going to work on

166
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
and lastly what we're going to work on
 

167
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,869
and lastly what we're going to work on
here

168
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
here
 

169
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,390
here
is that you can

170
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
is that you can
 

171
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,470
is that you can
make him uncomfortable

172
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
make him uncomfortable
 

173
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,789
make him uncomfortable
by little minor tiny attacks

174
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
by little minor tiny attacks
 

175
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,430
by little minor tiny attacks
with what you can do with your secondary

176
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
with what you can do with your secondary
 

177
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,350
with what you can do with your secondary
weight so your primary weight is

178
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
weight so your primary weight is
 

179
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,030
weight so your primary weight is
probably going to be

180
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
probably going to be
 

181
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,070
probably going to be
about attacking the respiratory system

182
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
about attacking the respiratory system
 

183
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,070
about attacking the respiratory system
if you can then

184
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
if you can then
 

185
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,630
if you can then
start deleveraging him

186
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
start deleveraging him
 

187
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,830
start deleveraging him
and then three use the remainder of your

188
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
and then three use the remainder of your
 

189
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,710
and then three use the remainder of your
weight

190
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
weight
 

191
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,190
weight
to uh start disrupting him okay

192
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
to uh start disrupting him okay
 

193
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,550
to uh start disrupting him okay
one way to disrupt is to take away his

194
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
one way to disrupt is to take away his
 

195
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,390
one way to disrupt is to take away his
posture

196
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
posture
 

197
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,030
posture
so right now he has spinal alignment but

198
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
so right now he has spinal alignment but
 

199
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,030
so right now he has spinal alignment but
we're going to take this posture away

200
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
we're going to take this posture away
 

201
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,390
we're going to take this posture away
this way and this way okay

202
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
this way and this way okay
 

203
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,270
this way and this way okay

this elbow space here
 

237
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,189
this elbow space here
then i'll do that last thing where i

238
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
then i'll do that last thing where i

if you're doing all this and we ask the
 

255
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,350
if you're doing all this and we ask the
question

256
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360

the answer is no okay so you if you do

264
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
the answer is no okay so you if you do
 

265
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,870
the answer is no okay so you if you do
all these principles

266
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
all these principles
 

267
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,270
all these principles
the way you're supposed to you it's

268
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
the way you're supposed to you it's
 

269
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,830
the way you're supposed to you it's
already ready built to address strikes

270
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
already ready built to address strikes
 

271
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,990
already ready built to address strikes
and weapons okay

and the whole time it's hard for him to
breathe

284

breathe
 

285
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,790
breathe
and he's feeling this pressure

286
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
and he's feeling this pressure
 

287
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,430
and he's feeling this pressure
right here with my shoulder okay so

288
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
right here with my shoulder okay so
 

289
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,510
right here with my shoulder okay so
again

290
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
again
 

291
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,430
again
because we train in the beginning

292
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
because we train in the beginning
 

293
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,909
because we train in the beginning
without strikes

294
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
without strikes
 

295
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,390
without strikes
you tend to milk the techniques

296
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
you tend to milk the techniques
 

297
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,950
you tend to milk the techniques
and you're doing things like this

298
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
and you're doing things like this
 

299
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,350
and you're doing things like this
you see and that arm is not attacked and

300
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
you see and that arm is not attacked and
 

301
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,830
you see and that arm is not attacked and
he can get a weapon from his waistband

302
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
he can get a weapon from his waistband
 

303
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,390
he can get a weapon from his waistband
and now stab me and i have to try to

304
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
and now stab me and i have to try to
 

305
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,909
and now stab me and i have to try to
defend you're not going to defend you're

306
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
defend you're not going to defend you're
 

307
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,710
defend you're not going to defend you're
going to get stabbed okay

308
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
going to get stabbed okay
 

309
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,990
going to get stabbed okay
so

310
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
so
 

311
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,070
so
although he has the frame it actually

312
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
although he has the frame it actually
 

313
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,550
although he has the frame it actually
helps check weapons okay

314
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
helps check weapons okay
 

315
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,629
helps check weapons okay
so let's get into that position and get

316
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
so let's get into that position and get
 

317
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,510
so let's get into that position and get
those principles going

318
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
those principles going
 

319
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,029
those principles going
okay so he's

320
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
okay so he's
 

321
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,270
okay so he's
gonna go

322
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
gonna go
 

323
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,350
gonna go
i'm framing so

324
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
i'm framing so
 

325
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,189
i'm framing so
right

326
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
right
 

327
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,150
right

um
let's come around

330
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
let's come around
 

331
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,790
let's come around
okay

332
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
okay
 

333
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,110
okay
right here there's space

334
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
right here there's space
 

335
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,189
right here there's space
you see

336
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
you see
 

337
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,189
you see
try to get rid of that

338
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
try to get rid of that
 

339
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,189
try to get rid of that
there you go you see that difference

340
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
there you go you see that difference
 

341
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,990
there you go you see that difference
no we're not done

342
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
no we're not done
 

343
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,230
no we're not done

okay
let's go

486
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200

 

487
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,990

when you transition

488
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,000
when you transition
 

489
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,069
when you transition
you have to keep employing control

490
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
you have to keep employing control
 

491
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,230
you have to keep employing control
maintenance

492
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240

 

493
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,870

it does not make sense that

494
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
it does not make sense that
 

495
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,670
it does not make sense that
you would transition

496
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
you would transition
 

497
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,150
you would transition
and lose more control

498
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
and lose more control
 

499
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,790
and lose more control
than you had if if what i have is

500
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
than you had if if what i have is
 

501
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,310
than you had if if what i have is
greater control

502
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
greater control
 

503
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,790
greater control
then i have the advantage don't move

504
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:42,800
then i have the advantage don't move
 

505
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,389
then i have the advantage don't move
into a position of disadvantage okay

506
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
into a position of disadvantage okay
 

507
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,230
into a position of disadvantage okay
but oftentimes because we're

508
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
but oftentimes because we're
 

509
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,509
but oftentimes because we're
transitioning our mind gets

510
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
transitioning our mind gets
 

511
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,590
transitioning our mind gets
fettered and you're letting control

512
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
fettered and you're letting control
 

513
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,509
fettered and you're letting control
points off okay

514
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519

 

515
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,509

keep your mind present fluid and release

516
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
keep your mind present fluid and release
 

517
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,550
keep your mind present fluid and release
and as you transition it should actually

518
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
and as you transition it should actually
 

519
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,870
and as you transition it should actually
get more control otherwise i wouldn't

520
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
get more control otherwise i wouldn't
 

521
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,269
get more control otherwise i wouldn't
have transitioned okay

522
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
have transitioned okay
 

523
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,790
have transitioned okay
