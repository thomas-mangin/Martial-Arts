00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,829

but he's a you know you can see he's a

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:01,839
but he's a you know you can see he's a
 

3
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,830
but he's a you know you can see he's a
big guy i'm a big guy and what we're

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,840
big guy i'm a big guy and what we're
 

5
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,150
big guy i'm a big guy and what we're
going to do is we're going to

6
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,160
going to do is we're going to
 

7
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,549
going to do is we're going to
a technique for mushy and over here

8
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:08,559
a technique for mushy and over here
 

9
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,629
a technique for mushy and over here
cutter i'm not going to do that you're

10
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
cutter i'm not going to do that you're
 

11
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,110
cutter i'm not going to do that you're
going to do that and who else is strong

12
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,120
going to do that and who else is strong
 

13
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,590
going to do that and who else is strong
i know matthew's strong oh you're

14
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:17,600

 

15
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,630

so somebody that doesn't know each other

16
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:20,640
so somebody that doesn't know each other
 

17
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,429
so somebody that doesn't know each other
um

18
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
um
 

19
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,029
um
hands by the side

20
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
hands by the side
 

21
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:35,830
hands by the side
all right advice is different techniques

22
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:35,840

 

23
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,270

technique is

24
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,280
technique is
 

25
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,229
technique is
this

26
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
this
 

27
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,910
this
and you know the vest

28
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
and you know the vest
 

29
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,069
and you know the vest
well he thinks he does

30
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
well he thinks he does
 

31
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,869
well he thinks he does
i want you holding a strong

32
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
i want you holding a strong
 

33
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,150
i want you holding a strong
okay

34
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
okay
 

35
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,110
okay
so how would we ever get the fork

36
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
so how would we ever get the fork
 

37
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,389
so how would we ever get the fork
theory working here

38
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
theory working here
 

39
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,709
theory working here
so so these are the challenges that we

40
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
so so these are the challenges that we
 

41
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,430
so so these are the challenges that we
come up against

42
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440

 

43
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,029

yeah

44
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
yeah
 

45
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,109
yeah
that's it good

46
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
that's it good
 

47
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,310
that's it good
all right

48
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
all right
 

49
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,190
all right
so

50
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
so
 

51
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,350
so
already puffing them up now what a lot

52
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
already puffing them up now what a lot
 

53
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,109
already puffing them up now what a lot
of peculiar what a lot of people do

54
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
of peculiar what a lot of people do
 

55
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,390
of peculiar what a lot of people do
is this they go like this and they just

56
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
is this they go like this and they just
 

57
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,590
is this they go like this and they just
you're gonna have to let me do it all

58
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
you're gonna have to let me do it all
 

59
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,590
you're gonna have to let me do it all
right because i can't

60
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
right because i can't
 

61
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,590
right because i can't
but a lot of people do this you watch

62
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
but a lot of people do this you watch
 

63
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,109
but a lot of people do this you watch
the youtube

64
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
the youtube
 

65
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,990
the youtube
this art comes up and they take a thank

66
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000

do that they lift it up maintain it

74
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
do that they lift it up maintain it
 

75
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,870
do that they lift it up maintain it
thank you

76
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
thank you
 

77
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,429
thank you
there's no way

78
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
there's no way
 

79
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,030
there's no way
look how much he struggled and he done

80
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
look how much he struggled and he done
 

81
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,190
look how much he struggled and he done
it correct

82
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200

 

83
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,149

so

84
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
so
 

85
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,190
so
you can't lift you do it by turning so

86
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
you can't lift you do it by turning so
 

87
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,830
you can't lift you do it by turning so
it's a conversion look

88
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
it's a conversion look
 

89
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,270
it's a conversion look
of getting his body to escape his body

90
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
of getting his body to escape his body
 

91
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,109
of getting his body to escape his body
escaped

92
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
escaped
 

93
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,990
escaped
you didn't see his hand go over his i've

94
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
you didn't see his hand go over his i've
 

95
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,830
you didn't see his hand go over his i've
been watching his videos

96
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
been watching his videos
 

97
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,950
been watching his videos
and you didn't see his hand go

98
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
and you didn't see his hand go
 

99
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,310
and you didn't see his hand go
separate

100
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
separate
 

101
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,910
separate
separate on its own way to ascencion and

102
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
separate on its own way to ascencion and

now i'm going to ask you to do a saint

104
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
now i'm going to ask you to do a saint
 

105
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,309
now i'm going to ask you to do a saint
pio

106
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319

 

107
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,430

so these are our contradictions that we

108
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
so these are our contradictions that we
 

109
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,070
so these are our contradictions that we
we find difficult okay

110
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
we find difficult okay
 

111
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,470
we find difficult okay
now is he off balance or could he dig in

112
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
now is he off balance or could he dig in
 

113
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,390
now is he off balance or could he dig in
there he could dig in if you didn't want

114
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
there he could dig in if you didn't want
 

115
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,750
there he could dig in if you didn't want
to hurt him

116
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
to hurt him
 

117
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,790
to hurt him
all right

118
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
all right
 

119
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,110
all right
so so the lightness once you start

120
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
so so the lightness once you start
 

121
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,190
so so the lightness once you start
getting involved in these techniques

122
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
getting involved in these techniques
 

123
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,229
getting involved in these techniques
becomes very difficult it's the ghosts

124
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
becomes very difficult it's the ghosts
 

125
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,110
becomes very difficult it's the ghosts
don't i think

126
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
don't i think
 

127
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,509
don't i think
the person who run the hole before he

128
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
the person who run the hole before he
 

129
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,190
the person who run the hole before he
was one of the helpers he was the

130
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
was one of the helpers he was the
 

131
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,750
was one of the helpers he was the
electrical whip wizard and all the

132
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
electrical whip wizard and all the
 

133
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,670
electrical whip wizard and all the
curtains start closing on their own at

134
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
curtains start closing on their own at
 

135
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,910
curtains start closing on their own at
certain times

136
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
certain times
 

137
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,990
certain times
so

138
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000

 

139
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,229

it's just to show you really

140
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
it's just to show you really
 

141
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,270
it's just to show you really
hate that you cannot

142
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
hate that you cannot
 

143
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,550
hate that you cannot
do this unless you're physically strong

144
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
do this unless you're physically strong
 

145
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,430
do this unless you're physically strong
but you can go oh i've made myself a

146
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
but you can go oh i've made myself a
 

147
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,589
but you can go oh i've made myself a
hole

148
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599

 

149
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,750

but that's the bit i wanted

150
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
but that's the bit i wanted
 

151
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,509
but that's the bit i wanted
so that when you come out you don't have

152
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
so that when you come out you don't have
 

153
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,229
so that when you come out you don't have
to take that a second bite of the

154
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
to take that a second bite of the
 

155
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,229
to take that a second bite of the
technique

156
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
technique
 

157
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,430
technique
hey

158
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
hey
 

159
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,470
hey
yeah

160
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
yeah
 

161
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,270
yeah
this hand is no good so i gotta do that

162
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
this hand is no good so i gotta do that
 

163
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,350
this hand is no good so i gotta do that
my shoulder but what i'm gonna do is i'm

164
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
my shoulder but what i'm gonna do is i'm
 

165
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,270
my shoulder but what i'm gonna do is i'm
not gonna come out

166
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
not gonna come out
 

167
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,710
not gonna come out
and now apply the same here

168
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720

 

169
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,670

quite a bad shoulder a couple years now

170
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
quite a bad shoulder a couple years now
 

171
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,430
quite a bad shoulder a couple years now
here

172
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440

 

173
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,750

it's it's up it's all there and do you

174
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
