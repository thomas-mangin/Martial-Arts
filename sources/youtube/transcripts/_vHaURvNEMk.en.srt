00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,230

okay so we're going to look at the hands

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:03,240
okay so we're going to look at the hands

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,110
okay so we're going to look at the hands
so I don't I don't

Stance and the

14
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
Stance and the
 

15
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,509

body
 

17
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:30,269
body
lowers my hands

18
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:30,279

 

19
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:36,549

one more

21
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,350

time the

22
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:38,360
time the
 

23
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,389
time the
body is

24
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
body is
 

25
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,029
body is
lowering my

hands

28
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:53,879

 

29
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,189

here body move then you lower your hands

30
00:00:58,189 --> 00:00:58,199
here body move then you lower your hands
 

31
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,869
here body move then you lower your hands
down

32
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:01,879

 

33
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:07,630

body lowers so my my EDI happens and

34
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:07,640
body lowers so my my EDI happens and
 

35
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:18,749
body lowers so my my EDI happens and
that's what lowers my

36
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:18,759

 

37
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,310

up or
down I don't want that so what it feels

00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
down I don't want that so what it feels
 

45
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,469
down I don't want that so what it feels
like to

46
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:31,479
like to
 

47
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:36,429
like to
me is about how stay here at this level

48
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:36,439
me is about how stay here at this level
 

49
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,910
me is about how stay here at this level
they don't change their articulation

50
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:38,920
they don't change their articulation
 

51
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,350
they don't change their articulation
angle related to my shoulder my

52
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,360
angle related to my shoulder my
 

53
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:55,590
angle related to my shoulder my
shoulders they stay here and I move my

point and I'll demonstrate it again in

60
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
point and I'll demonstrate it again in
 

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,550
point and I'll demonstrate it again in
this technique but then I I recommend

62
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
this technique but then I I recommend
 

63
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,270
this technique but then I I recommend
using another technique to learn it

64
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
using another technique to learn it
 

65
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,070
using another technique to learn it
here is where I have to cut the X

66
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
here is where I have to cut the X
 

67
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,750
here is where I have to cut the X
Line This

68
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:20,760
Line This
 

69
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,470
Line This
Way not that way

70
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
Way not that way
 

71
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,229
Way not that way
because I'm not trying to accelerate him

72
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
because I'm not trying to accelerate him
 

73
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:37,030
because I'm not trying to accelerate him
in the direction he's going

74
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040

 

75
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,030

so here's where I

76
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
so here's where I
 

77
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,229
so here's where I
enter against this leg so I'm going to

78
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
enter against this leg so I'm going to
 

79
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,270
enter against this leg so I'm going to
do it slowly maybe move the camera over

80
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
do it slowly maybe move the camera over
 

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,589
do it slowly maybe move the camera over
here it goes across this

82
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,599

 

83
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,830

leg do that same side

84
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:54,840

 

85
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,070

again Bo I'm not accelerating him in the

86
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
again Bo I'm not accelerating him in the
 

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,710
again Bo I'm not accelerating him in the
direction he's going I'm not going this

88
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720

 

89
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,350

way we

90
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
way we
 

91
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,750
way we
go into his base

92
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:12,760

 

93
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:20,830

here so we'll put the camera

94
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:20,840

 

95
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,509

here and we'll take the arms

96
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:24,519
here and we'll take the arms
 

97
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:29,229
here and we'll take the arms
out and this is what I am I'm getting

98
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:29,239
out and this is what I am I'm getting
 

99
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,509
out and this is what I am I'm getting
this this stop motion is not there

100
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:32,519
this this stop motion is not there
 

101
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,309
this this stop motion is not there
obviously but you'll see me

102
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
obviously but you'll see me
 

103
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,390
obviously but you'll see me
displace that

104
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
displace that
 

105
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,309
displace that
leg that's what you're trying to do

106
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:41,319
leg that's what you're trying to do
 

107
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,470
leg that's what you're trying to do
because you're generating a Topsy Turvy

108
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
because you're generating a Topsy Turvy
 

109
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,390
because you're generating a Topsy Turvy
effect where you're hitting the two

110
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:47,400
effect where you're hitting the two
 

111
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,509
effect where you're hitting the two
distal ends to start this Topsy tury

112
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
distal ends to start this Topsy tury
 

113
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,190
distal ends to start this Topsy tury
effect different from an acceleration

114
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,200
effect different from an acceleration
 

115
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,550
effect different from an acceleration
throw where I just accelerate him so

116
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:57,560
throw where I just accelerate him so
 

117
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,750
throw where I just accelerate him so
fast that he opts to take a roll

118
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:00,760
fast that he opts to take a roll
 

119
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,470
fast that he opts to take a roll
um that's ferite culture uh we're doing

120
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
um that's ferite culture uh we're doing
 

121
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,710
um that's ferite culture uh we're doing
this top

122
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:11,720

 

123
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,270

superv so the two distal ends are made

124
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:16,280
superv so the two distal ends are made
 

125
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,430
superv so the two distal ends are made
to rotate around a center that's what

126
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
to rotate around a center that's what
 

127
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,070
to rotate around a center that's what
creates it I don't accelerate

128
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,080
creates it I don't accelerate
 

129
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,670
creates it I don't accelerate
one and hope the other one gets to the

130
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:26,680
one and hope the other one gets to the
 

131
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,310
one and hope the other one gets to the
top you have a force on the top

132
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
top you have a force on the top
 

133
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,029
top you have a force on the top
and a force on the bottom so you always

134
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:34,039
and a force on the bottom so you always
 

135
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,510
and a force on the bottom so you always
create that

136
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:38,520

 

137
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,670

so on this

138
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:40,680
so on this
 

139
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,990
so on this
technique and we'll stay at this angle

140
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,000
technique and we'll stay at this angle
 

141
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,350
technique and we'll stay at this angle
again is my

142
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
again is my
 

143
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,469
again is my
kosi is that force on the

144
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
kosi is that force on the
 

145
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,550
kosi is that force on the
bottom that's making his leg come out as

146
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
bottom that's making his leg come out as
 

147
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,790
bottom that's making his leg come out as
the spirals are making his head come

148
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
the spirals are making his head come
 

149
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,350
the spirals are making his head come
down so the best place to learn that a

150
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,360
down so the best place to learn that a
 

151
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,629
down so the best place to learn that a
little more

152
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:01,639
little more
 

153
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,390
little more
simple is just n from t con so I come

154
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,400
simple is just n from t con so I come
 

155
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,189
simple is just n from t con so I come
around here and there it is again but

156
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
around here and there it is again but
 

157
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,350
around here and there it is again but
it's on this side on this leg not the

158
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
it's on this side on this leg not the
 

159
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,909
it's on this side on this leg not the
cross lateral leg so I enter if he lets

160
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
cross lateral leg so I enter if he lets
 

161
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,990
cross lateral leg so I enter if he lets
go I'm going to enter to displace that

162
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,000
go I'm going to enter to displace that
 

163
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,510
go I'm going to enter to displace that
leg it's not a

164
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
leg it's not a
 

165
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,710
leg it's not a
trip in other words I'm not here and

166
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
trip in other words I'm not here and
 

167
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,029
trip in other words I'm not here and
trying to trip him it's actually a

168
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:32,039
trying to trip him it's actually a
 

169
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,070
trying to trip him it's actually a
displacement of my base by my base of

170
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
displacement of my base by my base of
 

171
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,070
displacement of my base by my base of
his

172
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,080
his
 

173
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,749
his
base so we'll see the two variations an

174
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
base so we'll see the two variations an
 

175
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,110
base so we'll see the two variations an
acceleration throw I throw in the same

176
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,120
acceleration throw I throw in the same
 

177
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,390
acceleration throw I throw in the same
direction that he is and I just lower

178
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:47,400
direction that he is and I just lower
 

179
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,909
direction that he is and I just lower
his hand and then he takes a rooll by

180
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:54,919

 

181
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,070

culture in other words he's athletic

182
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
culture in other words he's athletic
 

183
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,909
culture in other words he's athletic
enough to just run out of

184
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:02,919

 

185
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,670

it cuz there's nothing acting on his

186
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
it cuz there's nothing acting on his
 

187
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,790
it cuz there's nothing acting on his
legs just by culture UK keeps his legs

188
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
legs just by culture UK keeps his legs
 

189
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,390
legs just by culture UK keeps his legs
still and then the head gets ahead of

190
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:11,400
still and then the head gets ahead of
 

191
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,150
still and then the head gets ahead of
the legs okay and then they do a forward

192
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
the legs okay and then they do a forward
 

193
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,469
the legs okay and then they do a forward
move but if you're trying to throw

194
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
move but if you're trying to throw
 

195
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,230
move but if you're trying to throw
someone you're going to displace the

196
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:19,240
someone you're going to displace the
 

197
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,670
someone you're going to displace the
legs as you do

198
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:22,680
legs as you do
 

199
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,950
legs as you do
that so this this technique is the one I

200
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:27,960
that so this this technique is the one I
 

201
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,790
that so this this technique is the one I
think you should use used to understand

202
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
think you should use used to understand
 

203
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,150
think you should use used to understand
the x pattern be and same for your ukan

204
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:35,160
the x pattern be and same for your ukan
 

205
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,550
the x pattern be and same for your ukan
it's not so

206
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560

 

207
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,629

precarious what you'll notice though is

208
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:41,639
precarious what you'll notice though is
 

209
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,070
precarious what you'll notice though is
I have actually have to

210
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
I have actually have to
 

211
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,070
I have actually have to
have

212
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
have
 

213
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,909
have
um Integrity of my own positioning in

214
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
um Integrity of my own positioning in
 

215
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,469
um Integrity of my own positioning in
order to displace his if I have a bad

216
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:55,479
order to displace his if I have a bad
 

217
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:01,150
order to displace his if I have a bad
place then I kind of bounce off a him

218
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:01,160
place then I kind of bounce off a him
 

219
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,189
place then I kind of bounce off a him
you don't want that you he bounces off

220
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
you don't want that you he bounces off
 

221
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,830
you don't want that you he bounces off
of

222
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:06,840
of
 

223
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:28,510
of
you okay so that would be the

224
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:28,520

 

225
00:07:28,520 --> 00:08:18,070

ex e

226
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080

 

227
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,390

all right I should add that uh if you

228
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
all right I should add that uh if you
 

229
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,869
all right I should add that uh if you
use this drill to learn the X patter you

230
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
use this drill to learn the X patter you
 

231
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,589
use this drill to learn the X patter you
can also work on your uh the fact that

232
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
can also work on your uh the fact that
 

233
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,909
can also work on your uh the fact that
uh my stance lowers my hand not my

234
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:30,919
uh my stance lowers my hand not my
 

235
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,509
uh my stance lowers my hand not my
shoulder I don't want articulation here

236
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
shoulder I don't want articulation here
 

237
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,430
shoulder I don't want articulation here
in the shoulder no matter how strong my

238
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
in the shoulder no matter how strong my
 

239
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,550
in the shoulder no matter how strong my
lats are I don't want that so when

240
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
lats are I don't want that so when
 

241
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,350
lats are I don't want that so when
you're doing this this technique I don't

242
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:42,360
you're doing this this technique I don't
 

243
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,910
you're doing this this technique I don't
have my hand go down at the shoulder

244
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
have my hand go down at the shoulder
 

245
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,670
have my hand go down at the shoulder
it's just here and The Stance is going

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
it's just here and The Stance is going
 

247
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:57,110
it's just here and The Stance is going
to lower the hand as I seek the

Center is going to get projected in
 

299
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,190
Center is going to get projected in
between those two somewhere somewhere

300
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:10,200
between those two somewhere somewhere
 

301
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,550
between those two somewhere somewhere
between 10 and two

302
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:13,560
between 10 and two
 

303
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,110
between 10 and two
okay um and we need a new chemi that

304
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
okay um and we need a new chemi that
 

305
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,350
okay um and we need a new chemi that
allows for that so the head must rotate

306
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:22,360
allows for that so the head must rotate
 

307
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,750
allows for that so the head must rotate
in this case with left foot forward the

308
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:24,760
in this case with left foot forward the
 

309
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,470
in this case with left foot forward the
head must

310
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:27,480
head must
 

311
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,389
head must
move towards this side side of the

312
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
move towards this side side of the
 

313
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,150
move towards this side side of the
mat my back foot must move towards that

314
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
mat my back foot must move towards that
 

315
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,030
mat my back foot must move towards that
side of the mat and then when I'm only

316
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
side of the mat and then when I'm only
 

317
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,230
side of the mat and then when I'm only
throwing

318
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
throwing
 

319
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,430
throwing
myself my hips will more or less stay on

320
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:42,440
myself my hips will more or less stay on
 

321
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,790
myself my hips will more or less stay on
the 12 to six line okay and then I can

322
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:47,800
the 12 to six line okay and then I can
 

323
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,629
the 12 to six line okay and then I can
receive the X powder okay the only

324
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:50,639
receive the X powder okay the only
 

325
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,069
receive the X powder okay the only
difference is there's no um CQ that's

326
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:55,079
difference is there's no um CQ that's
 

327
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,550
difference is there's no um CQ that's
going to take my center and actually

328
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
going to take my center and actually
 

329
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,030
going to take my center and actually
move it

330
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,040
move it
 

331
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,150
move it
off the 126 line it's just me okay um so

332
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,160
off the 126 line it's just me okay um so
 

333
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,430
off the 126 line it's just me okay um so
I'll demonstrate first the fedorite rule

334
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
I'll demonstrate first the fedorite rule
 

335
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,230
I'll demonstrate first the fedorite rule
which is where my head my center and my

336
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:13,240
which is where my head my center and my
 

337
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,990
which is where my head my center and my
feet pretty much stay on the 12 to six

338
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
feet pretty much stay on the 12 to six
 

339
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,910
feet pretty much stay on the 12 to six
sline okay uh so you do your your

340
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
sline okay uh so you do your your
 

341
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,590
sline okay uh so you do your your
fedorite roll and you just kind

342
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:22,600
fedorite roll and you just kind
 

343
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:29,350
fedorite roll and you just kind
of roll that way do one more rep

344
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360

 

345
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,230

I

346
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:31,240
I
 

347
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,430
I
roll more or less on the 12 to six

348
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
roll more or less on the 12 to six
 

349
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,629
roll more or less on the 12 to six
line when someone first learns of the x

350
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:39,639
line when someone first learns of the x
 

351
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,550
line when someone first learns of the x
pattern and the forward role that

352
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
pattern and the forward role that
 

353
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,470

the x pattern what they tend to do is

356
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
the x pattern what they tend to do is
 

357
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,430
the x pattern what they tend to do is
just do the fedorite roll in this case

358
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
just do the fedorite roll in this case
 

359
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,150
just do the fedorite roll in this case
with left foot forward to

360
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
with left foot forward to
 

361
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,230
with left foot forward to
2:00 as they know the head goes that way

362
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:57,240
2:00 as they know the head goes that way
 

363
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,949
2:00 as they know the head goes that way
but it's not rotating that way way they

364
00:11:59,949 --> 00:11:59,959
but it's not rotating that way way they
 

365
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,750
but it's not rotating that way way they
just

366
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
just
 

367
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,550
just
realign to this and so that if you pay

368
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
realign to this and so that if you pay
 

369
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,710
realign to this and so that if you pay
attention um I'll do it this way towards

370
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
attention um I'll do it this way towards
 

371
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,030
attention um I'll do it this way towards
the camera

372
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,040
the camera
 

373
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,949
the camera
first on the regular fedorite roll on

374
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
first on the regular fedorite roll on
 

375
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,389
first on the regular fedorite roll on
this 126 line the foot is forward when

376
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:16,399
this 126 line the foot is forward when
 

377
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,350
this 126 line the foot is forward when
someone takes the fedorite roll and

378
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:18,360
someone takes the fedorite roll and
 

379
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,829
someone takes the fedorite roll and
tries to mimic the x pattern receiving

380
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
tries to mimic the x pattern receiving
 

381
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,550
tries to mimic the x pattern receiving
roll they will always turn the foot and

382
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:25,560
roll they will always turn the foot and
 

383
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,430
roll they will always turn the foot and
now you just have a new 12 to six line

384
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:28,440
now you just have a new 12 to six line
 

385
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,750
now you just have a new 12 to six line
it's just over here here okay and so if

386
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
it's just over here here okay and so if
 

387
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,829
it's just over here here okay and so if
I'm doing it this way they'll turn the

388
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
I'm doing it this way they'll turn the
 

389
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,150
I'm doing it this way they'll turn the
foot and then they

390
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160

 

391
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,949

do a fedorite roll at the angle this is

392
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:43,959
do a fedorite roll at the angle this is
 

393
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:47,110
do a fedorite roll at the angle this is
what you're doing in the video

394
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
what you're doing in the video
 

395
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,110
what you're doing in the video
okay so a drill that I

396
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
okay so a drill that I
 

397
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,710
okay so a drill that I
recommend is to hang out in warrior

00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
recommend is to hang out in warrior
 

399
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,030
recommend is to hang out in warrior
pose and let the leg which will

400
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,040
pose and let the leg which will
 

401
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,990
pose and let the leg which will
naturally happen

402
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
naturally happen
 

403
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,110

way this is why we actually throw people

424
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:33,880
way this is why we actually throw people
 

425
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,949
way this is why we actually throw people
this way this is the natural taking of

426
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
this way this is the natural taking of
 

427
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,590
this way this is the natural taking of
balance that's what's going to happen

428
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
balance that's what's going to happen
 

429
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,189
balance that's what's going to happen
naturally so your drill would be hey hit

when you hit warrior pose it's assume
your chest is up in the fedorite roll

450
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:11,959
your chest is up in the fedorite roll
 

451
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,710

looking behind me my chest is down it's

456
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:18,199
looking behind me my chest is down it's
 

457
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,509
looking behind me my chest is down it's
clearly not warrior pose

458
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
clearly not warrior pose
 

459

okay

460
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
okay
 

461
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,150
okay
so I'm assuming your chest is open

462
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
so I'm assuming your chest is open
 

463

because I told you to do Warrior clothes
 

465
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,310
because I told you to do Warrior clothes
okay and as you start to allow that to

466
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
okay and as you start to allow that to
 

467
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,829
okay and as you start to allow that to
happen you're now going to maintain the

468
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:34,839
happen you're now going to maintain the
 

469
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,310
happen you're now going to maintain the
head and foot

470
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:37,320
head and foot
 

471
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,030
head and foot
relationship and uh and then lower

472
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,040
relationship and uh and then lower
 

473
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,749

you'll keep incrementally almost like a
 

479
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,509
you'll keep incrementally almost like a
hydraulic keep lowering your knee and

hydraulic keep lowering your knee and
try to get it close to the mat okay and

482
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:53,480
try to get it close to the mat okay and
 

483
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,350
try to get it close to the mat okay and
you'll see my head will come around this

484
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
you'll see my head will come around this
 

485
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,030
you'll see my head will come around this
way my foot will go that way but my hips

486
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,040
way my foot will go that way but my hips
 

487
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,829
way my foot will go that way but my hips
will more or less stay on this line or

488
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
will more or less stay on this line or
 

489
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,949
will more or less stay on this line or
even move a little bit to the left of

490
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:03,959
even move a little bit to the left of
 

491
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,590
even move a little bit to the left of
the line in this case as opposed to this

492
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
the line in this case as opposed to this
 

493
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,189
the line in this case as opposed to this
way with a fedorite roll at the angle

494
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:10,199
way with a fedorite roll at the angle
 

495
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,590
way with a fedorite roll at the angle
okay so as I'm moving I let that go and

496
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:14,600
okay so as I'm moving I let that go and
 

497
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,990
okay so as I'm moving I let that go and
I come out and you see I go this way do

498
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,000
I come out and you see I go this way do
 

499
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,069
I come out and you see I go this way do
it

500
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:21,079

 

501
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:23,470

again and I'm going to start lowering my

502
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:23,480
again and I'm going to start lowering my
 

503
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:38,870

and you can see that my Ru is going to
 

507
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,990
and you can see that my Ru is going to
start slowing me

508
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,000
start slowing me
 

509
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:57,910

553
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,669
foot if you're
learning the back rake fall we do this

554
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:52,679
learning the back rake fall we do this
 

555
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,750
learning the back rake fall we do this
um we do what you were doing where we

556
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
um we do what you were doing where we
 

557
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,350
um we do what you were doing where we
try to accelerate ourselves or have

558
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:58,360
try to accelerate ourselves or have
 

559
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,430
try to accelerate ourselves or have
someone else accelerate

560
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
someone else accelerate
 

561
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,950
someone else accelerate
us but we go down on the ball of the

562
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:03,960
us but we go down on the ball of the
 

563
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,950
us but we go down on the ball of the
foot so if I am accelerating

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:09,960

backwards we do

568
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,080
backwards we do
 

569
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,310
backwards we do
that but I use it to address the fear of

570
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:21,320
that but I use it to address the fear of
 

571
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,110
that but I use it to address the fear of
falling not actually how to take the

let's learn the x pattern receiving back
rle it's on the balls of foot but here's

580
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
rle it's on the balls of foot but here's
 

581
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,710
rle it's on the balls of foot but here's
the drill I recommend if you're by

582
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
the drill I recommend if you're by
 

583
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,789
the drill I recommend if you're by
yourself you're going to send your

00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:44,799
yourself you're going to send your
 

585
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,950
yourself you're going to send your
Center forward because that's going to

586
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
Center forward because that's going to
 

587
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,470
Center forward because that's going to
happen in the technique if the

588
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:49,480
happen in the technique if the
 

589
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,310
happen in the technique if the
acceleration backwards your Center goes

590
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
acceleration backwards your Center goes
 

591
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,630
acceleration backwards your Center goes
backwards and you can lower it with your

592
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:55,640
backwards and you can lower it with your
 

593
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,149
backwards and you can lower it with your
shoulders in front of your hips that'll

594
00:18:58,149 --> 00:18:58,159
shoulders in front of your hips that'll
 

595
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:00,110
shoulders in front of your hips that'll
never happen

in the back rake fall so as I am here no

598
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,000
in the back rake fall so as I am here no
 

599
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,190
in the back rake fall so as I am here no
matter how fast I go as I start to go

matter how fast I go as I start to go
 

601
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,510
matter how fast I go as I start to go
you see that my shoulders are in front

602
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
you see that my shoulders are in front

you
so shoot your hips

00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
so shoot your hips
 

611
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,070
so shoot your hips
forward as much as you

612
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
forward as much as you
 

613
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,149
forward as much as you
can contract your Center which you will

614
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:27,159
can contract your Center which you will
 

615
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,110
can contract your Center which you will
have to do in the x pattern receiving
