00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:14,120
this so it's going to go in first
 

9
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,910
this so it's going to go in first
in and it starts to generate that bend

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
in and it starts to generate that bend
 

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,990
in and it starts to generate that bend
in this

12
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,000
in this

see you want you want to take out the
slab and then then you have it okay so

24
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,200
slab and then then you have it okay so
 

25
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,030
slab and then then you have it okay so
that's how far you go so you you feel

that's how far you go so you you feel
 

27
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,869
that's how far you go so you you feel
there we are okay and I get that bend

28
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
there we are okay and I get that bend
 

29
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,549
there we are okay and I get that bend
and we won't do any movement just to

30
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
and we won't do any movement just to
 

31
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,630
and we won't do any movement just to
isolate it now okay and now what I want

32
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
isolate it now okay and now what I want
 

33

to do that and then this and then over
 

57
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,270
to do that and then this and then over
here I get a Bend boom and then I keep

58
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:28,280
here I get a Bend boom and then I keep
 

59
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,510
here I get a Bend boom and then I keep
that bend in his elbow

60
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:30,520

it put your body back and you're in

336
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
it put your body back and you're in
 

337
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:23,110
it put your body back and you're in
katata

339
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,949

okay and I want

340
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:25,959
okay and I want
 

341
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,350
okay and I want
full conditioning so I go all the this

342
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:29,360
full conditioning so I go all the this
 

343
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,750
full conditioning so I go all the this
way you go all that way to condition and

344
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
way you go all that way to condition and
 

345
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,990
way you go all that way to condition and
so the same reason I go B all this way

346
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,000
so the same reason I go B all this way
 

347
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:55,629
so the same reason I go B all this way
all that way to

348
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:55,639

 

349
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,030

condition okay try it

350
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,040
condition okay try it
 

351
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,030
condition okay try it
again

352
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
again
 

353
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,509
again
all right so now as you're going to H me

354
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
all right so now as you're going to H me
 

355
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,470
all right so now as you're going to H me
or technique you're going to use this

356
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
or technique you're going to use this
 

357
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,629
or technique you're going to use this
you combine this pattern with your I and

358
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:10,639
you combine this pattern with your I and
 

359
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,509
you combine this pattern with your I and
your Co okay so uh and your Marshall

360
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
your Co okay so uh and your Marshall
 

361
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,230
your Co okay so uh and your Marshall
components so when I uh clear the line

362
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:19,240
components so when I uh clear the line
 

363
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,949
components so when I uh clear the line
for example like this I am in his zon

364
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:23,959
for example like this I am in his zon
 

365
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,629
for example like this I am in his zon
sanctuary and that collection of his

366
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:26,639
sanctuary and that collection of his
 

367
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,150
sanctuary and that collection of his
elbow has generated an angle cancel

368
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,160
elbow has generated an angle cancel
 

369
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,949
elbow has generated an angle cancel
ation on the other arm the cross lateral

370
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:31,959
ation on the other arm the cross lateral
 

371
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,310

arm okay so there you can attack and

372
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
arm okay so there you can attack and
 

373
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,150

things like that

374
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,160
things like that
 

375
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,550
things like that
okay so as I as I go into that elbow and

376
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
okay so as I as I go into that elbow and
 

377
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,990
okay so as I as I go into that elbow and
collect it then you are now in in an

378
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
collect it then you are now in in an
 

379
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,389
collect it then you are now in in an
adhesion you're working that adhesion to

380
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
adhesion you're working that adhesion to
 

381
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,190
adhesion you're working that adhesion to
get him to go that

382
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:50,200
get him to go that
 

383
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,310
get him to go that
way so now you combine again martially

384
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:53,320
way so now you combine again martially
 

385
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,230
way so now you combine again martially
