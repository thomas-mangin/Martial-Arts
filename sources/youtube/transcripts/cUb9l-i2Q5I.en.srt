00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,550
enough you'll get it but you're not
doing like you don't know so the other

170
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
doing like you don't know so the other
 

171
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,189
doing like you don't know so the other
thing is if he has a weapon what was the

172
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
thing is if he has a weapon what was the
 

173
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,710
thing is if he has a weapon what was the
first position in the fight of my hand

174
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:09,720
first position in the fight of my hand
 

175
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,500
first position in the fight of my hand
outside the outside which is consistent

176
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:12,510
outside the outside which is consistent
 

177
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,100
outside the outside which is consistent
with weapon fighting so the first

178
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,110
with weapon fighting so the first
 

179
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,070
with weapon fighting so the first
movement is outside then the deflection

180
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,080
movement is outside then the deflection
 

181
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,339
movement is outside then the deflection
you see and there's no stopping up now

182
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:24,349
you see and there's no stopping up now
 

183
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:31,300
you see and there's no stopping up now
so we go we go slow I'm absorbing room

184
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,310

 

185
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,920

not like this slow right well you see

186
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:36,930
not like this slow right well you see
 

187
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,450
not like this slow right well you see
that difference

188
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:39,460

 

189
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:47,710

so boom absorb Oh once we get back cuz

190
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:47,720
so boom absorb Oh once we get back cuz
 

191
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,960
so boom absorb Oh once we get back cuz
right now even he's being influenced by

192
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:49,970
right now even he's being influenced by
 

193
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,900
right now even he's being influenced by
his by his training culture you're on a

194
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:52,910
his by his training culture you're on a
 

195
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,810
his by his training culture you're on a
grid so we'll go back to punching okay

196
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:55,820
grid so we'll go back to punching okay
 

197
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,180
grid so we'll go back to punching okay
and you're not gonna punch him out there

198
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:58,190
and you're not gonna punch him out there
 

199
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,080
and you're not gonna punch him out there
you understand so we're in here and he

200
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,090
you understand so we're in here and he
 

201
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,440
you understand so we're in here and he
goes to his punch do you think I'll have

202
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,450
goes to his punch do you think I'll have
 

203
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:11,800
goes to his punch do you think I'll have
to let him in so I'm here absorb absorb

204
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:11,810
to let him in so I'm here absorb absorb
 

205
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:28,000
to let him in so I'm here absorb absorb
and let it we're gonna start closer

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,010
and let it we're gonna start closer
 

207
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,060
and let it we're gonna start closer
right you could even be like old in one

208
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,070
right you could even be like old in one
 

209
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,810
right you could even be like old in one
one side do you understand so I have to

210
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:34,820
one side do you understand so I have to
 

211
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,390
one side do you understand so I have to
figure out all the technique you got it

212
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:40,400
figure out all the technique you got it
 

213
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,460
figure out all the technique you got it
you guys see where I'm at I just want

214
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:42,470
you guys see where I'm at I just want
 

215
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,760
you guys see where I'm at I just want
you guys to get away from everything's

216
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:45,770
you guys to get away from everything's
 

217
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,990
you guys to get away from everything's
out there and everything is linear so

218
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
out there and everything is linear so
 

219
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,710
out there and everything is linear so
it's not everything is a source do you

220
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:53,720
it's not everything is a source do you
 

221
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,730
it's not everything is a source do you
understand so for part of the time here

222
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:57,740
understand so for part of the time here
 

223
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,650
understand so for part of the time here
I'm going to have you keep that time

there you're not going to like it but
 

227
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,310
there you're not going to like it but
you're gonna have when you when you do

you're gonna have when you when you do
 

229
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,950
you're gonna have when you when you do
the circle you see it's works against

230
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:05,960
the circle you see it's works against
 

231
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:20,420
the circle you see it's works against
them so I'm in here

232
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:20,430

 

233
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,370

as I'm working on the great piece there

234
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:23,380
as I'm working on the great piece there
 

235
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,500
as I'm working on the great piece there
I'm gonna go to the back of him that is

236
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,510
I'm gonna go to the back of him that is
 

237
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:31,530
I'm gonna go to the back of him that is
there okay not only do you not get as

238
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:31,540
there okay not only do you not get as
 

239
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,629
there okay not only do you not get as
much reaction out of him you're not

240
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:33,639
much reaction out of him you're not
 

241
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,410
much reaction out of him you're not
conditioning your body for Coke you

242
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:36,420
conditioning your body for Coke you
 

243
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,710
conditioning your body for Coke you
you're making tactical poor decisions by

244
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
you're making tactical poor decisions by
 

245
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,900
you're making tactical poor decisions by
revealing your arteries and things like

246
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:42,910
revealing your arteries and things like
 

247
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,220
revealing your arteries and things like
that

248
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,230
that
 

249
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,970
that
but when he strikes you're not going to

250
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:47,980
but when he strikes you're not going to
 

251
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,290
but when he strikes you're not going to
be able to pull this thing do you

252
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:52,300
be able to pull this thing do you
 

253
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
be able to pull this thing do you
understand you're not going to go here

254
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:54,310
understand you're not going to go here
 

255
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,530
understand you're not going to go here
and then and get what you want like you

256
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:58,540
and then and get what you want like you
 

257
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,310
and then and get what you want like you
did in your beginner technique so I

258
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
did in your beginner technique so I
 

259
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,780
did in your beginner technique so I
caused a hook here you see and then I'm

260
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:05,790
caused a hook here you see and then I'm
 

261
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,540
caused a hook here you see and then I'm
rooting it I can't do that what made him

262
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:09,550
rooting it I can't do that what made him
 

263
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,000
rooting it I can't do that what made him
continue to go forward was that I

264
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,010
continue to go forward was that I
 

265
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,199
continue to go forward was that I
stopped the obstacles against him

266
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:15,209
stopped the obstacles against him
 

267
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:19,050
stopped the obstacles against him
do you understand that so the same thing

268
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:19,060
do you understand that so the same thing
 

269
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,939
do you understand that so the same thing
goes with when we're strike I don't care

270
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:20,949
goes with when we're strike I don't care
 

271
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:22,889
goes with when we're strike I don't care
what such same thing goes where we're

272
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:22,899
what such same thing goes where we're
 

273
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,980
what such same thing goes where we're
striking I don't stop him and then hope

274
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:25,990
striking I don't stop him and then hope
 

275
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,639
striking I don't stop him and then hope
that I'm gonna pull him in what I'm

276
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:29,649
that I'm gonna pull him in what I'm
 

277
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:32,610
that I'm gonna pull him in what I'm
going to do is move the obstacles out of

278
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:32,620
going to do is move the obstacles out of
 

279
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,139
going to do is move the obstacles out of
the way yeah I'm doing that but I am

280
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:37,149
the way yeah I'm doing that but I am
 

281
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:40,230
the way yeah I'm doing that but I am
shielding my arteries I have my anchored

282
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
shielding my arteries I have my anchored
 

283
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,110
shielding my arteries I have my anchored
elbows and I am very aggressive so you

284
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,120
elbows and I am very aggressive so you
 

285
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,090
elbows and I am very aggressive so you
can't shortchange it

286
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,100
can't shortchange it
 

287
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,519
can't shortchange it
you can't go here you shortchanged it

288
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:50,529
you can't go here you shortchanged it
 

289
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:55,139
you can't go here you shortchanged it
it's here same thing on this on the

290
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:55,149
it's here same thing on this on the
 

291
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:58,019
it's here same thing on this on the
other side it's just no same thing here

292
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:58,029
other side it's just no same thing here
 

293
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:05,210
other side it's just no same thing here
you cannot go here you have to go here

294
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:05,220
you cannot go here you have to go here
 

295
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,269
you cannot go here you have to go here
so here I am and you want to go you're

296
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
so here I am and you want to go you're
 

297
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,030
so here I am and you want to go you're
stopping him so then he's not going to

298
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,040
stopping him so then he's not going to
 

299
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,610
stopping him so then he's not going to
enter you get it and so all you're going

300
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:14,620
enter you get it and so all you're going
 

301
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,309
enter you get it and so all you're going
to do is have a clash which will work if

302
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:17,319
to do is have a clash which will work if
 

303
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,240
to do is have a clash which will work if
you're strong enough

304
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,250
you're strong enough
 

305
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:25,490
you're strong enough
instead lift the elbow up legend go

306
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:25,500

 

307
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,860

so you can make it just a force drill

308
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:30,870
so you can make it just a force drill
 

309
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:35,700
so you can make it just a force drill
stay there let's not fight anyone and I

310
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:35,710
stay there let's not fight anyone and I
 

311
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,870
stay there let's not fight anyone and I
go okay get rid of that energy that

312
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:39,880
go okay get rid of that energy that
 

313
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,660
go okay get rid of that energy that
contention point you see that okay stay

314
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:42,670
contention point you see that okay stay
 

315
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,030
contention point you see that okay stay
there now I have another contention

316
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
there now I have another contention
 

317
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,010
there now I have another contention
point right can you go forward no you

318
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:47,020
point right can you go forward no you
 

319
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,470
point right can you go forward no you
cannot go forward so get rid of that

320
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:49,480
cannot go forward so get rid of that
 

321
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,380
cannot go forward so get rid of that
contention point let's say you're my

322
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:55,390
contention point let's say you're my
 

323
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,640
contention point let's say you're my
first contention point

324
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:56,650
first contention point
 

325
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,890
first contention point
I like neutralize it second contention

326
00:12:58,890 --> 00:12:58,900
