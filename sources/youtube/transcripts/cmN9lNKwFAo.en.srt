guys are like right hey you have you

90
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:06,470
guys are like right hey you have you
 

91
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,370
guys are like right hey you have you
killed then you go ah let's do this oh

92
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:11,380
killed then you go ah let's do this oh
 

93
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,000
killed then you go ah let's do this oh
let me flip it over it makes no sense

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,010
let me flip it over it makes no sense
 

95
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,789
let me flip it over it makes no sense
not tactically not conceptually you

96
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
not tactically not conceptually you
 

97
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,250
not tactically not conceptually you
understand that so instead I'm just

98
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:24,260
understand that so instead I'm just
 

99
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:33,770
understand that so instead I'm just
working with these circles boom

100
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:33,780

 

101
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,140

okay

102
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,150

 

103
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,050

so remember the concept that that he

104
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,060
so remember the concept that that he
 

105
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,179
so remember the concept that that he
throws himself that's what I'm working

106
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:45,189
throws himself that's what I'm working
 

107
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:47,879
throws himself that's what I'm working
with here so when he tries to stand up

108
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:47,889
with here so when he tries to stand up
 

109
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,649
with here so when he tries to stand up
when I do that you see he throws himself

110
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:49,659
when I do that you see he throws himself
 

111
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:52,920
when I do that you see he throws himself
okay because of because of where I lead

112
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:52,930
okay because of because of where I lead
 

113
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,850
okay because of because of where I lead
his elbow so put your leg up he's trying

114
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:56,860
his elbow so put your leg up he's trying
 

115
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,200
his elbow so put your leg up he's trying
to stand up but this isn't where his

116
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,210
to stand up but this isn't where his
 

117
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,270
to stand up but this isn't where his
elbow is right his elbows going to be

118
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,280
elbow is right his elbows going to be
 

119
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,159
elbow is right his elbows going to be
over here so when he tries to stand up

120
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:02,169
over here so when he tries to stand up
 

121
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:06,059
over here so when he tries to stand up
it makes him makes it balanced but

122
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:06,069
it makes him makes it balanced but
 

123
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:08,249
it makes him makes it balanced but
outside of his base of support okay so

124
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:08,259
outside of his base of support okay so
 

125
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,980
outside of his base of support okay so
that so that's what we're doing in eto

126
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:10,990
that so that's what we're doing in eto
 

127
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:19,050
that so that's what we're doing in eto
dot and then he's trying to stand up

128
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,060
dot and then he's trying to stand up
 

129
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,680
dot and then he's trying to stand up
again do you see I'll go back and what

130
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:22,690
again do you see I'll go back and what
 

131
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,140
again do you see I'll go back and what
you want to do instead instead of trying

you want to do instead instead of trying
 

133
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,450
you want to do instead instead of trying
to force this hand when he tries to

134
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:27,460
to force this hand when he tries to
 

135
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,089
to force this hand when he tries to
stand up again you going over here so

136
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:33,099
stand up again you going over here so
 

137
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:40,490
stand up again you going over here so
we'll go back

138
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:40,500

 

139
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,910

home yeah you see how desperate

140
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:44,920
home yeah you see how desperate
 

141
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,300
home yeah you see how desperate
palliative okay

142
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,310
palliative okay
 

143
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:56,570
palliative okay
prioritize that over is our manipulation

144
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:56,580

 

145
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,510

franchise this okay and when you take

146
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:00,520
franchise this okay and when you take
 

147
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,170
franchise this okay and when you take
that step you see I don't have to turn

148
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:04,180
that step you see I don't have to turn
 

149
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,710
that step you see I don't have to turn
his hand his hands right there his hands

150
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:07,720
his hand his hands right there his hands
 

151
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,930
his hand his hands right there his hands
already there that just goes here and

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,050
then he does get up but he runs into the
 

155
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:23,640
then he does get up but he runs into the
Mikio DC so this takes no one's strong

156
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:23,650
Mikio DC so this takes no one's strong
 

157
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,650
Mikio DC so this takes no one's strong
enough everything is just faked like

158
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:25,660
enough everything is just faked like
 

159
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,880
enough everything is just faked like
he'll go sweetheart

160
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:26,890
he'll go sweetheart
 

161
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:33,470
he'll go sweetheart
untwist your and I could do to me right

162
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:33,480
untwist your and I could do to me right
 

163
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,050
untwist your and I could do to me right
