81
00:04:50,969 --> 00:05:08,490

okay he does the same thing so when he

82
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:08,500
okay he does the same thing so when he
 

83
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,570
okay he does the same thing so when he
comes in this cocky projection is not

84
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:12,580
comes in this cocky projection is not
 

85
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,029
comes in this cocky projection is not
from me throwing him it's from me

86
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:18,039
from me throwing him it's from me
 

87
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:29,129
from me throwing him it's from me
this happen loading descent so the

88
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:29,139
this happen loading descent so the
 

89
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:31,260
this happen loading descent so the
energy that you're using you're using

90
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:31,270
energy that you're using you're using
 

91
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,980
energy that you're using you're using
your own active energy this technique

92
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:34,990
your own active energy this technique
 

93
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:42,779
your own active energy this technique
has this yield bomb and so there's a

94
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:42,789
has this yield bomb and so there's a
 

95
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:49,350
has this yield bomb and so there's a
target boom you can't call same time

96
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
target boom you can't call same time
 

97
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,070
target boom you can't call same time
same time is no you didn't do okay all

98
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,080
same time is no you didn't do okay all
 

99
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:17,750
same time is no you didn't do okay all
right we should calculate past you know

100
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:17,760

 

101
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,080
