00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,270

so the only difference between somebody

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
so the only difference between somebody
 

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,269
so the only difference between somebody
not my level is i have to

4
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:07,279
not my level is i have to
 

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,470
not my level is i have to
not come up at this height

6
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480
not come up at this height
 

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,350
not come up at this height
i have to

8
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,360
i have to
 

9
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,150
i have to
go

10
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160
go
 

11
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,670
go
lower without taking his hand lower that

12
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
lower without taking his hand lower that
 

13
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,910
lower without taking his hand lower that
doesn't make sense really because if i

14
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,920
doesn't make sense really because if i
 

15
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,630
doesn't make sense really because if i
go lower watch his hand high if i don't

16
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
go lower watch his hand high if i don't
 

17
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,509
go lower watch his hand high if i don't
go up and drop and i've done myself no

18
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
go up and drop and i've done myself no

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,630
go up and drop and i've done myself no
favors if i go out to the side

20
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640
favors if i go out to the side
 

21
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,830
favors if i go out to the side
like this i thought hold that and then i

22
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
like this i thought hold that and then i
 

23
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,709
like this i thought hold that and then i
kept my body like this

24
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
kept my body like this
 

25
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,990
kept my body like this
not a lot

26
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
not a lot
 

27
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,069
not a lot
but i take my body just like that

28
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079

 

29
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,229

this is a technical point saying where

30
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
this is a technical point saying where
 

31
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,190
this is a technical point saying where
my shoulder is i can't set myself but my

32
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
my shoulder is i can't set myself but my
 

33
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,869
my shoulder is i can't set myself but my
shoulder should be in line with his

34
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
shoulder should be in line with his
 

35
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,029
shoulder should be in line with his
wrist

00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039

 

37
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,790

if it's there

38
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800

 

39
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,750

but here is it

40
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760

 

41
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,430

what happens is when i'm going to take

42
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
what happens is when i'm going to take
 

43
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,349
what happens is when i'm going to take
him off so he's holding strong so when i

44
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
him off so he's holding strong so when i
 

45
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,390
him off so he's holding strong so when i
don't take them off i can't get him off

46
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400

 

47
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,030

and what happens is this tip

48
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
and what happens is this tip
 

49
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,469
and what happens is this tip
here

50
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
here
 

51
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,510
here
what that does is when i go like that

52
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
what that does is when i go like that
 

53
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,510
what that does is when i go like that

it makes like a wedge
 

55
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,390
it makes like a wedge
and this wedge

56
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400

 

57
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,429

58
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:21,439
makes it slide upwards
 

59
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,429
makes it slide upwards

117
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:48,949

a little bit of movement

118
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959

 

119
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,630

you're still you know you've still got

120
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
you're still you know you've still got
 

121
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,509
you're still you know you've still got
yourself

122
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
yourself
 

123
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,309
yourself
that's the same technique as in my right

124
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
that's the same technique as in my right
 

125
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,509
that's the same technique as in my right
door

126
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
door
 

127
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,430
door
but my whole belief is please go past

128
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440

 

129
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:16,869

so

130
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879

 

131
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,949

i give him the one

132
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
i give him the one
 

133
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,710
i give him the one
of clarity

134
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
of clarity
 

135
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,630
of clarity
this is too high because it would hit

136
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
this is too high because it would hit
 

137
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,830
this is too high because it would hit
this muscle

138
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
this muscle
 

139
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,670
this muscle
and i'd never get him off

140
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
and i'd never get him off
 

141
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,910
and i'd never get him off
so i as i go out to the side i go like

142
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
so i as i go out to the side i go like
 

143
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:37,910
so i as i go out to the side i go like
that and like

144
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920

 

145
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,949

just a moment ago i actually do the same

146
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
just a moment ago i actually do the same
 

147
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:41,750
just a moment ago i actually do the same
thing

148
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
thing
 

149
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,430
thing
i'm sort of stretching it out look at

150
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
i'm sort of stretching it out look at
 

151
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,509
i'm sort of stretching it out look at
the front of the leg

152
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
the front of the leg
 

153
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,910
the front of the leg
now i drop the arm

154
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
now i drop the arm
 

155
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,309
now i drop the arm
softly

156
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
softly
 

157
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,390
softly
it comes off

158
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
it comes off
 

159
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,550
it comes off
okay

160
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560

 

161
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,550

there it

162
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560

 

163
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,830

i like this one because strength

164
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
i like this one because strength
 

165
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,830
i like this one because strength
strength will never

166
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
strength will never
 

167
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,670
strength will never
get off but strength will never get it

168
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
get off but strength will never get it
 

169
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,589
get off but strength will never get it
off

170
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599

 

171
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,310

you just get tangled up

172
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
you just get tangled up
 

173
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,789
you just get tangled up
if they're taller than you it's easier

174
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
if they're taller than you it's easier
 

175
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,030
if they're taller than you it's easier
if they're smaller than you

176
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
if they're smaller than you
 

177
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,870
if they're smaller than you
you've got to
