1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,189

so

2
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:01,199
so
 

3
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,990
so
i've never done that on sebas before

4
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,000
i've never done that on sebas before
 

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,430
i've never done that on sebas before
i've never done that

6
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,440
i've never done that
 

7
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,749
i've never done that
with the ken on you before

8
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:07,759
with the ken on you before
 

9
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,710
with the ken on you before
so

10
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:08,720
so
 

11
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,270
so
a lot of teachers they only use their

12
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:11,280
a lot of teachers they only use their
 

13
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,749
a lot of teachers they only use their
devoted uk because they know that

14
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
devoted uk because they know that
 

15
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,189
devoted uk because they know that
they're already tuned in but what i do

16
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:17,199
they're already tuned in but what i do
 

17
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,590
they're already tuned in but what i do
is i'll perhaps sort of look around and

18
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
is i'll perhaps sort of look around and
 

19
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,109
is i'll perhaps sort of look around and
i'll just you know i'm just showing you

20
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
i'll just you know i'm just showing you
 

21
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,750
i'll just you know i'm just showing you
now i'll look around and i'll go

22
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
now i'll look around and i'll go
 

23
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,910
now i'll look around and i'll go
because i'll call the person up

24
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
because i'll call the person up
 

25
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,070
because i'll call the person up
because i've plugged into them they

26
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
because i've plugged into them they
 

27
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,029
because i've plugged into them they
don't have to really be plugged into me

28
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
don't have to really be plugged into me
 

29
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,670
don't have to really be plugged into me
some people you can't do it on

30
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
some people you can't do it on
 

31
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,069
some people you can't do it on
okay some people

32
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079

got
two yangs you know it's so you can't do

38
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
two yangs you know it's so you can't do
 

39
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,950
two yangs you know it's so you can't do
when is this going to help you

hand like this
that's my my finger is just doing that

52
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
that's my my finger is just doing that
 

53
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,389
that's my my finger is just doing that
on his body

54
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
on his body
 

55
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,430
on his body
and as

56
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
and as
 

57
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,830
and as
you said quite rightly

58
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
you said quite rightly
 

59
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,390
you said quite rightly
i don't know if i felt that or not

60
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
i don't know if i felt that or not
 

61
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,070
i don't know if i felt that or not
so with danny

62
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
so with danny
 

63
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,149
so with danny
i'm gonna go like that and i know where

64
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
i'm gonna go like that and i know where
 

65
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,750
i'm gonna go like that and i know where
i'm feeling here and i'm feeling it

66
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
i'm feeling here and i'm feeling it
 

67
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,670
i'm feeling here and i'm feeling it
about there but now i've told you and

68
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
about there but now i've told you and
 

69
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,469
about there but now i've told you and
him he'll more than likely think that he

70
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
him he'll more than likely think that he
 

71
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,670
him he'll more than likely think that he
feels it there but

72
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
feels it there but
 

73
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,469
feels it there but
do you feel me going through it no okay

74
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
do you feel me going through it no okay
 

75
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,390
do you feel me going through it no okay
but i know that i've got that point

76
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
but i know that i've got that point
 

77
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,469
but i know that i've got that point
so when he say lifts for this for

78
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
so when he say lifts for this for
 

79
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,109
so when he say lifts for this for
showman

80
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119

 

81
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,749

i've got the same feeling see so when he

82
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
i've got the same feeling see so when he
 

83
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,950
i've got the same feeling see so when he
lifts my hand i've got to have my timing

84
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
lifts my hand i've got to have my timing
 

85
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,429
lifts my hand i've got to have my timing
correct because

86
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
correct because
 

87
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,749
correct because
i plugged in to him

88
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
i plugged in to him
 

89
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,350
i plugged in to him
his energy

90
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
his energy
 

91
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,190
his energy
he doesn't know i've plugged into his

92
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
he doesn't know i've plugged into his
 

93
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,830
he doesn't know i've plugged into his
energy but when he lifts it

94
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840

 

95
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,830

so that's why i'm his puppet in the end

96
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
so that's why i'm his puppet in the end
 

97
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,429
so that's why i'm his puppet in the end
because

98
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439

 

99
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,510

my timing has to be right

100
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
my timing has to be right
 

101
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,749
my timing has to be right
if you don't look for this type of

102
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
if you don't look for this type of
 

103
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,749
if you don't look for this type of
connection what happens is he lifts and

104
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
connection what happens is he lifts and
 

105
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,469
connection what happens is he lifts and
you go oh right so this is mechanical

106
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
you go oh right so this is mechanical
 

107
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,390
you go oh right so this is mechanical
you know you're ready it goes

108
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
you know you're ready it goes
 

109
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,949
you know you're ready it goes
i've got it i got it i've got it

110
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
i've got it i got it i've got it
 

111
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,949
i've got it i got it i've got it
but a certain level he'll lift it

112
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959

 

113
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,910

you can't be out of timing because you

114
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
you can't be out of timing because you
 

115
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,309
you can't be out of timing because you
become him

116
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
become him
 

117
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,790
become him
all right

118
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800

 

119
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,150

go back or hop or somewhere okay

120
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160

 

121
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,190

so

122
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
so
 

123
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,150
so
so then it gets lighter you can ask me

124
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
so then it gets lighter you can ask me
 

125
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,229
so then it gets lighter you can ask me
questions in a minute

126
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239

 

127
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,990

all right that was a little bit of

128
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
all right that was a little bit of
 

129
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,750
all right that was a little bit of
physical as well

130
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760

 

131
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,190

so you use

132
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
so you use
 

133
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,229
so you use
a mixture of physical

134
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
a mixture of physical
 

135
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,750
a mixture of physical
and energy

136
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760

 

137
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,070

what i do is i

138
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
what i do is i
 

139
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,190
what i do is i
where can it help you in daily life

140
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
where can it help you in daily life
 

141
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,070
where can it help you in daily life
you're already doing it without knowing

142
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
you're already doing it without knowing
 

143
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,869
you're already doing it without knowing
it

144
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
it
 

145
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,430
it
you might say

146
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
you might say
 

147
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,350
you might say
oh i've been a bit lazy i should go for

148
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
oh i've been a bit lazy i should go for
 

149
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,509
oh i've been a bit lazy i should go for
a walk

150
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
a walk
 

151
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,190
a walk
and you're thinking

152
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
and you're thinking
 

153
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,270
and you're thinking
i just don't want to go for walk that's

154
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
i just don't want to go for walk that's
 

155
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,470
i just don't want to go for walk that's
the outside mind sort of saying that

156
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
the outside mind sort of saying that
 

157
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,470
the outside mind sort of saying that
you're not gonna be

158
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
you're not gonna be
 

159
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,830
you're not gonna be
but

160
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
but
 

161
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,670
but
when you go to meet somebody like

162
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
when you go to meet somebody like
 

163
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,990
when you go to meet somebody like
perhaps i'll come you know meet you for

164
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
perhaps i'll come you know meet you for
 

165
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,630
perhaps i'll come you know meet you for
the first time and i come up i already

166
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
the first time and i come up i already
 

167
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,550
the first time and i come up i already
know about here whether i'm gonna like

168
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
know about here whether i'm gonna like
 

169
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,190

00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
so i'm doing the same techniques as you
 

247
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,749
so i'm doing the same techniques as you
but i'm working at it i'm working on it

248
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
but i'm working at it i'm working on it
 

249
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,110
but i'm working at it i'm working on it
from a different

250
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
from a different
 

251
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,430
from a different
level or else it would be after let's

252
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
level or else it would be after let's
 

253
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,430
level or else it would be after let's
face it after 50 years of doing the same

254
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
face it after 50 years of doing the same
 

255
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,670
face it after 50 years of doing the same
techniques it'd be pretty boring

256
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
techniques it'd be pretty boring
 

257
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,110
techniques it'd be pretty boring
you know

258
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
you know
 

259
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,430
you know
so i have to be

260
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440

 

261

265
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,629

different

266
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
different
 

267
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,150
different

numbers who would be interested in doing
 

293
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,029
numbers who would be interested in doing
this

294
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
this
 

295
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,510
this
it might be interesting to listen to

296
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
it might be interesting to listen to
 

297
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,909
it might be interesting to listen to
but you won't want to be doing it a lot

298

but you won't want to be doing it a lot
because it's

300

because it's
 

301
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,790
because it's
too hard to

00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
good energy to work with
 

345
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,870
good energy to work with

in the hospital all night can we talk

382
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
in the hospital all night can we talk
 

383
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,230
in the hospital all night can we talk
about this

384
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
about this
 

385
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,550
about this
and then you're working actually you're

386
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
and then you're working actually you're
 

387
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,550
and then you're working actually you're
best i could however because you're

388
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
best i could however because you're
 

389
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,350
best i could however because you're
you're being strong expansive but it's

390
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
you're being strong expansive but it's
 

391
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,150
you're being strong expansive but it's
about energy and then if they were to

392
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
about energy and then if they were to
 

393
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,589
about energy and then if they were to
attack you then you should i say should

394
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
attack you then you should i say should
 

395
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,469
attack you then you should i say should
be okay all right so if you can just uh

396
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
be okay all right so if you can just uh
 

397
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,710
be okay all right so if you can just uh
do the shomonucci

398
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
do the shomonucci
 

399
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,670
do the shomonucci
on each other

400
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680

 

401
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,150

if you're doing it too fast you're

402
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
if you're doing it too fast you're
 

403
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,990
if you're doing it too fast you're
you're not going to about to get it

404
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
you're not going to about to get it
 

405
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,869
you're not going to about to get it
so you've got to

406
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879

 

407
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,869

you've got to do it at your pace tell

408
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
you've got to do it at your pace tell
 

409
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,629
you've got to do it at your pace tell
them slow down if you're

410
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
them slow down if you're
 

411
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,830
them slow down if you're
if you're not feeling it

412
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840

 

413
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,070

then i can determine whether i receive

414
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
then i can determine whether i receive
 

415
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,509
then i can determine whether i receive
it

416
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
it
 

417
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,389
it
or enter it

418
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399

 

419
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,350

see perfect blend there

420
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
see perfect blend there
 

421
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,790
see perfect blend there
because he didn't know whether he was

422
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
because he didn't know whether he was
 

423
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,990
because he didn't know whether he was
going to attack me or whether i was

424
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
going to attack me or whether i was
 

425
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,509
going to attack me or whether i was
attacking him so i got him right in the

426
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
attacking him so i got him right in the
 

427
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,509
attacking him so i got him right in the
middle place

428
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
middle place
 

429
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,430
middle place
so you're going to do very slowly

430
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
so you're going to do very slowly
 

431
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,190
so you're going to do very slowly
you're trying to get that you're trying

432
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
you're trying to get that you're trying
 

433
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,470
you're trying to get that you're trying
to get

434
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
to get
 

435
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,350
to get
his energy lifting your hand up

436
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
his energy lifting your hand up
 

437
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,790
his energy lifting your hand up
it comes down

438
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800

 

439
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,710

and then you do a coat of ice that you

440
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
and then you do a coat of ice that you
 

441
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,470
and then you do a coat of ice that you
all know please do it softly because you

442
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
all know please do it softly because you
 

443
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,670
all know please do it softly because you
haven't warmed up

444
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680

 

445
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,750

if you think that

446
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
if you think that
 

447
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,150
if you think that
he's you've got this timing together but

448
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
he's you've got this timing together but
 

449
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,470
he's you've got this timing together but
you can enter

450
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
you can enter
 

451
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,990
you can enter
then ask yourself i done that

452
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
then ask yourself i done that
 

453
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,190
then ask yourself i done that
physically or i done that i decide to go

454
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
physically or i done that i decide to go
 

455
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,870
physically or i done that i decide to go
in

456
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
in
 

457
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,190
in
when it becomes

458
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200

 

459
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,630

that

460
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
that
 

461
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,910
that
what i didn't choose

462
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920

 

463
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,949

from now i'm going to go in

464
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
from now i'm going to go in
 

465
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,949
from now i'm going to go in
from that

466
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
from that
 

467
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,030
from that
so i chose to go in

468
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
so i chose to go in
 

469
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,150
so i chose to go in
that's not kind of energy connected

470
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
that's not kind of energy connected
 

471
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,350
that's not kind of energy connected
that's that's me determined

472
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360

 

473
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,750

and you've got this energy

474
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760

 

475
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,150

so this is all dominating domineering

476
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
so this is all dominating domineering
 

477
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,590
so this is all dominating domineering
right i don't know i don't want to lose

478
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
right i don't know i don't want to lose
 

479
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,310
right i don't know i don't want to lose
you

480
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
you
 

481
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,870
you
uh what i'm talking about

482
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
uh what i'm talking about
 

483
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,590
uh what i'm talking about
um but try it and see what feedback you

484
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
um but try it and see what feedback you
 

485
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,160
um but try it and see what feedback you
get about yourself
