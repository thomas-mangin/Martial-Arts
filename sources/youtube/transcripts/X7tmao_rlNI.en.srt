1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,960
Today we're going to look into how to\h
kneel and how to bow formally in aikido.\h

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,920
You have to know that there are many ways\h
to do things in traditional martial arts.\h

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,080
What I'm going to show you is one way to\h
do, but by now means is it THE way to do.\h

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,200
The more you know about different martial arts\h
and different schools, the more you realize\h\h

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,480
that there are different way to do.
This is one of those, and I'm going\h\h

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,909
to explain to you why I do those things.

7
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:35,326
We're going to start by just standing like this.

8
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,845
The way you stand is heels together,

9
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:43,172
and the feet a little bit less than 90 degrees apart from each other.

10
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:46,262
The hands have to be along the body like this.

11
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,931
The back's straight and your buttocks should be closed.

12
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:54,783
The feeling is as if your head is being pulled in the sky.

13
00:00:54,783 --> 00:00:56,166
So you're nice and straight.

14
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:58,825
The hands are along the body.

15
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:02,231
What you may see in some pictures of the old masters,

16
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,670
they may show their hands like this,

17
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:09,683
which for people who do striking arts, can look a little strange

18
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:13,602
because this is the way you're taught not to punch, but this is not for punching.

19
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:19,817
I've been told that this is a way to protect your thumbs.

20
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:24,000
If somebody was to grab your thumb, they would have control over your entire body.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,390
So you can see some old masters standing like this,

22
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:29,000
with the thimbs inside the fists.

23
00:01:29,374 --> 00:01:35,265
It could also potentially be a protection against cutting the thumb if somebody was to come and attack you.

24
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:40,183
But we're not going to do this, we're going to stand like that,

25
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:45,111
because in aikido, we are in a gendai budo, so we don7t need that safety procedure.

26
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:48,164
How do you get on your knees from that position?

27
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:49,551
It's quite easy.

28
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:51,551
You're going to take your left leg back,

29
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:53,551
like this, not too far back,

30
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:56,247
and you're going to go down on your left knee.

31
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:58,566
Left,

32
00:01:58,811 --> 00:02:01,221
right, and then, on your knees.

33
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,930
OK, I'll start again.

34
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:10,800
Imagine that you've got something on top of your head and you don't want it to fall, so you have to go down straight.

35
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,423
Left knee,

36
00:02:13,423 --> 00:02:15,423
straight down and then, 

37
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:17,655
on the knees like this.

38
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:19,340
OK, that's for kneeling down.

39
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:23,300
The reason why you bend your left leg first,

40
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,629
is that when you're in that position and you have a sword,

41
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:32,830
with that leg down, you still have access to your sword and you can draw.

42
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:39,737
If it was the other way around, it would be a little less practical to disengage you hip and to draw.

43
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:44,191
One detail I want to add in terms of kneeling down and going back up,

44
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:48,815
when you bring that leg back, you have to remain with your toes in kiza.

45
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:53,104
Kiza means that the toes are flexed on the ground like this.

46
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,310
So knee down,

47
00:02:55,741 --> 00:03:00,290
second knee like this, and only then, do you flatten your feet.

48
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,450
When you go back up,

49
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,593
same thing but opposite,

50
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:06,156
kiza,

51
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,550
right knee,

52
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:10,397
left knee,

53
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,398
and back in that stand up position.

54
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,581
So once again,

55
00:03:14,888 --> 00:03:18,853
left knee down, right knee down, and sit.

56
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:22,726
When you get back up, it's the same, opposite.

57
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:32,007
You will raise this knee first for the same reason that you want to retain access to your sword.

58
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:38,035
Then you are going to raise your second knee up and bring your heels back together, and stand straight.

59
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:40,606
That's it for going up and down.

60
00:03:40,607 --> 00:03:44,708
Once you're sitting, you have to keep your back straight like this,

61
00:03:45,177 --> 00:03:47,712
and your shoulders relaxed down,

62
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:51,788
with the idea that something is pulling the top of your head upwards.

63
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:56,303
You're nice and comfortable sitting on your buttocks, straight.

64
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:01,756
The hands shouldn't be hanging like this at the sides.

65
00:04:01,864 --> 00:04:07,345
They should be on your thighs, and the thumbs should be connecting with your belt.

66
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,260
As a result, your elbows may tend to stick out a bit.

67
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:16,700
You don't want that to happen because the danger is that somebody could cut your arm.

68
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,411
It's also quite rude, when you're sitting in a line, to have your elbows poking into people's sides.

69
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,515
So you're going to put your hands like so,

70
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:26,000
and avoid having your elbows sticking out,

71
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:29,775
elbows, like this, with the back straight.

72
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:32,203
That's the default position.

73
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:37,857
Of course, sitting on the knees like this can be a little uncomfortable at the beginning,

74
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:41,917
but with practice, you should grow quite comfortable doing so,

75
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:44,166
save some pins and needles after a while,

76
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:47,765
but for the back, it's actually quite good because it's really straight.

77
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:49,542
One more detail.

78
00:04:49,543 --> 00:04:51,319
In some schools, 

79
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:54,932
the position of the knees will be different.

80
00:04:55,478 --> 00:05:00,735
Generally, you leave two fists between your knees.

81
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:03,156
Or one fist for women.

82
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,564
It's both a cultural thing and the fact that women tend to wear kimono,

83
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:12,192
which of course limits the spread of the knees,

84
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:17,487
whereas males wear the horse-riding hakama, which has two leg separated,

85
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:19,487
and thus allows to have a bit more spread.

86
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:23,398
Some schools actually let you sit like this, much more wide,

87
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:26,886
for technical reasons, which I'm not going to get into.

88
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,311
In terms of the position of the feet,

89
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:34,334
you can site like this with both feet side by side.

90
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:39,376
Some people argue that this allows you to move even if someone crushed one of your feet,

91
00:05:39,377 --> 00:05:41,377
you can actually get up more easily.

92
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:48,421
Others will advise you to sit with the big toe on top of the other one.

93
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:54,220
Other people will sit like this with one feet completely on top of the other.

94
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:59,928
What you do is up to your personal preferences, whichever is the most comfortable.

95
00:06:00,383 --> 00:06:04,534
Personally, depending how I feel on that day, I might sit like this,

96
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,680
or like this, depending how I feel in terms of comfort.

97
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,142
Now how do we bow?

98
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:12,647
There are different ways to bow and I'm going to show you two ways.

99
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:16,998
One is more formal, and the other is a little bit more casual,

100
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,646
but it's actually the one I use and I'm going to explain to you why.

101
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
So the formal way will be...

102
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:26,323
You're going to bring your hands in a triangle like this,

103
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:29,631
in front of you, and bow like this.

104
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:31,632
Now for the formal way,

105
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:34,619
you're going to bring the left hand first,

106
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:36,870
followed by the right hand,

107
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,779
and then you're going to bow with your nose going in that triangle.

108
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:46,500
The reason why you bring the left hand first is a safety check.

109
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:51,890
As you bow and you're facing people that you don't necessarily trust a 100%, 

110
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:58,872
you're going to bring that hand down, and check what's happening around you using your peripheral vision

111
00:06:58,872 --> 00:07:02,590
and is it safe to bring the second arm and go down.

112
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:04,510
Why the left arm?

113
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:11,336
Because the left arm is less important than the right arms, which is the one going to draw your sword.

114
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:15,609
By sticking it out like this, it could potentially be cut,

115
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:20,018
so you prefer to offer you left arm than the more important right arm.

116
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,839
So left arm first,

117
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,839
look, peripheral vision,

118
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,936
safety check,

119
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:30,000
second hand like this, triangle,

120
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:32,899
and then down, like this.

121
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:41,137
When you go back up, right hand, left hand and straight.

122
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:43,243
Once again,

123
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:46,601
left, right, down, 

124
00:07:46,672 --> 00:07:47,789
1, 2, 

125
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:49,943
right, left.

126
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:55,933
I've said that it's the traditional... not the traditional way, excuse me, the formal way.

127
00:07:57,001 --> 00:08:00,000
Because we're doing aikido, which is a gendai budo,

128
00:08:00,157 --> 00:08:07,254
which is by nature more peaceful than the arts of war of the old times,

129
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:09,775
we tend to bow like this,

130
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:12,331
both hands at same time,

131
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:14,084
1, 2,

132
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:16,494
back up, both hands at same time.

133
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:21,661
What it means is that I'm no longer doing a safety check in front of you.

134
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:24,048
There is a sense of implicit trust

135
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:28,161
in the person's who are facing me.

136
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:31,836
That's what I tend to do when I'm in seminars, when I'm teaching,

137
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:35,741
because I like to manifest that trust in the people who come to see me

138
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:39,641
because we're in aikido, again, a gendai budo,

139
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:43,878
a "ningen keisei no mich", a way to become better human beings.

140
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:49,624
So I express that to you through my motions, by not doing the safety check.

141
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:53,298
Now formally speaking, what usually happens,

142
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:59,011
is that the teacher will do that safety check in front of his students,

143
00:08:59,256 --> 00:09:01,803
because there is so much that he can trust his students,

144
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:06,203
however, the students, in return, will not, they will bow like this,

145
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:09,423
to show their full commitment to their teacher.

146
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:13,639
Another time is when you bow to the shomen or the kamiza,

147
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:19,985
because when you bow to those, you're showing your respect to the dojo, to the founder of the art,

148
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,906
potentially to the kami, the spirits,

149
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:28,094
so you do not perform that safety check when you bow to the wall of honor of your dojo.

150
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:36,172
Now you know how to do both so you can pick which one you decide to do according to the circumstances.

151
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:41,825
Ideally when you bow, you don't want to round your back like this,

152
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:44,237
and the nose has to go straight down,

153
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:50,585
you neither look ahead of you, nor do you put your head in,

154
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:55,008
and you try not to lift your buttocks too much.

155
00:09:55,271 --> 00:09:59,857
Some schools will show you that instead of putting your hand flat like this in a triangle,

156
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:02,089
they will do that sort of shape here,

157
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,887
they argue that having that shape like this

158
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:12,054
will prevent somebody who might push on your head like this from breaking your nose,

159
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:16,352
or prevent them from asphyxiating you.

160
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:24,782
Again, when I bow, I keep my hands flat in the sense that I'm not doing that safety measure.

161
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,492
Same reason, because we're doing a gendai budo.

162
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,868
Another thing that teachers have to consider,

163
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:33,443
is that they have to bow to both the shomen and their students.

164
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:35,558
They're going to have to rotate their hips.

165
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:39,063
To avoid having too much of a sloppy motion,

166
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:43,258
you may have to consider how to move your knees, and I'm going to show you how.

167
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:50,213
If you're going to turn towards the shomen, one thing you can do is raise the right knee like so,

168
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:55,342
and you'll use that knee to chase the left knee.

169
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,061
Like this.

170
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,067
You raise the left knee,

171
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:05,605
and then you bring it down and you can site in front of the shomen and do your bow.

172
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:09,631
When you're done, you raise the right knee again,

173
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:13,027
chase the left knee, like so,

174
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:15,138
bring the left knee down,

175
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:17,139
and back towards your students, and you bow.

176
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:22,529
So this covers the basics of standing, kneeling, and bowing.

177
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:25,152
I hope it helps you when you practice in your dojo.
