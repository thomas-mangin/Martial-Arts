00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
I'm good to go drill
 

25
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,910
I'm good to go drill

00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
qua now one of the whole points of doing
 

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,430
qua now one of the whole points of doing
the seated C you drill set

32
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:00,440
the seated C you drill set
 

33
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,470
the seated C you drill set
is the act is to bring the qua into it

34
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:03,480
is the act is to bring the qua into it

okay uh and of course you're taking away

36
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:05,960
okay uh and of course you're taking away
 

37
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,870
okay uh and of course you're taking away
your bracing angles you should use your

38
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:07,880
your bracing angles you should use your
 

39
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,149
your bracing angles you should use your
claw when you're standing but you're a

40
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:09,159
claw when you're standing but you're a
 

41
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,429
claw when you're standing but you're a
beginner so you don't know okay so we

42
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
beginner so you don't know okay so we
 

43
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,670
beginner so you don't know okay so we
taken away the bracing angle and we're

44
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
taken away the bracing angle and we're
 

45
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,390
taken away the bracing angle and we're
more geared towards letting the clad

46
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
more geared towards letting the clad
 

47
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,109
more geared towards letting the clad
drop and uh become part of our engine

48
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:20,119
drop and uh become part of our engine
 

49
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,270
drop and uh become part of our engine
okay so on drill three he's going to

50
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
okay so on drill three he's going to
 

51
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,270
okay so on drill three he's going to
come in okay and when I catch this I

52
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,280
come in okay and when I catch this I
 

53
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,830
come in okay and when I catch this I
catch this in my

54
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:28,840
catch this in my
 

55
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,830
catch this in my
quad and then I come forward so catching

56
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:32,840
quad and then I come forward so catching
 

57
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,950
quad and then I come forward so catching
the claw when I catch in the claw I

58
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
the claw when I catch in the claw I
 

59
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,550
the claw when I catch in the claw I
don't break

60
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
don't break
 

61
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:44,469
don't break
everything okay catching the

62
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479

 

63
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,310

quaw there's a timing to catch it is a

64
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:47,320
quaw there's a timing to catch it is a
 

65
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,630
quaw there's a timing to catch it is a
timing if I'm here and then I can I can

66
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:49,640
timing if I'm here and then I can I can
 

67
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,469
timing if I'm here and then I can I can
catch that but you're going to get a

68
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:51,479
catch that but you're going to get a
 

69
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,109
catch that but you're going to get a
little less reaction as opposed to his

70
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:54,119
little less reaction as opposed to his
 

71
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,709
little less reaction as opposed to his
initial

00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:55,719
initial
 

73
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,069
initial
reaction and to move forward this is

74
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
reaction and to move forward this is
 

75
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,469
reaction and to move forward this is
more important
