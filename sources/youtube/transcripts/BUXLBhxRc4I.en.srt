situation um iido is a Marti that

88
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
situation um iido is a Marti that
 

89
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,910
situation um iido is a Marti that
doesn't fit into this context at all in

90
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:36,920
doesn't fit into this context at all in
 

91
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,109
doesn't fit into this context at all in
fact in a lot of ways it's kind of the

92
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:38,119
fact in a lot of ways it's kind of the
 

93
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,149
fact in a lot of ways it's kind of the
polar opposite of this kind of situation

94
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
polar opposite of this kind of situation
 

95
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,389

103
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,190
makes understanding iiko almost
impossible and we have to begin to open

104

impossible and we have to begin to open
 

105
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,190
impossible and we have to begin to open
up our mind to what different contexts
