00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:04,140
most techniques are complicated because
 

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,710
most techniques are complicated because
um we think we know what we're

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:06,720
um we think we know what we're
 

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,930
um we think we know what we're
we're watching and then we try and do it

6
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:08,940
we're watching and then we try and do it
 

7
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,470
we're watching and then we try and do it
but it's not quite

8
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480
but it's not quite
 

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,250
but it's not quite
it's not quite as as you see it

10
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,260
it's not quite as as you see it
 

11
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,130
it's not quite as as you see it
if my you can't see most of you can't

12
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:19,140
if my you can't see most of you can't
 

13
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,929
if my you can't see most of you can't
see where my hands are

14
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:20,939
see where my hands are
 

15
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,390
see where my hands are
I can't do the foot bring them forward

16
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:23,400
I can't do the foot bring them forward
 

17
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,670
I can't do the foot bring them forward
because they're pinned at the back I

18
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
because they're pinned at the back I
 

19
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,130
because they're pinned at the back I
can't lift them up I can't go into him

21
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,089
can't lift them up I can't go into him
I'm pretty much in we'll say a bear hug

22
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:32,099
I'm pretty much in we'll say a bear hug
 

23

I'm pretty much in we'll say a bear hug
so this right hand

24
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
so this right hand
 

25
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,790
so this right hand
the right hand I'll just show you this

26
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:37,800
the right hand I'll just show you this
 

27
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,270
the right hand I'll just show you this
is going to make an entire Chi it's like

28
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
is going to make an entire Chi it's like
 

29
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,630
is going to make an entire Chi it's like
a bird's beak all right it's a bird's

30
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
a bird's beak all right it's a bird's

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:46,200
beak so I'm going to put all my fingers
 

33
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,290
beak so I'm going to put all my fingers
together

34
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:48,300
together
 

35
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,590
together
I'm now turning on my cheek

36
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
I'm now turning on my cheek
 

37
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,250
I'm now turning on my cheek
but I can't move him so I can't move it

38
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:55,260
but I can't move him so I can't move it
 

39
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,150
but I can't move him so I can't move it
a centimeter my buttock turns as the

40
00:00:59,150 --> 00:00:59,160
a centimeter my buttock turns as the
 

41
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,709
a centimeter my buttock turns as the
bird beak turns I don't know how many

42
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
bird beak turns I don't know how many
 

43
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,990
bird beak turns I don't know how many
people can see it but if I keep there

44
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,000
people can see it but if I keep there
 

45
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,149
people can see it but if I keep there
it's starting to come out at that time

46
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:05,159
it's starting to come out at that time
 

47
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,850
it's starting to come out at that time
this hand needs to have crept over to

48
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:07,860
this hand needs to have crept over to
 

49
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,030
this hand needs to have crept over to
there so now it's keyhon because I've

50
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
there so now it's keyhon because I've
 

51
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,429
there so now it's keyhon because I've
got one hand on it now I can make it

52
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
got one hand on it now I can make it
 

53
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,230
got one hand on it now I can make it
come out I mustn't make it come out

54
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:15,240
come out I mustn't make it come out
 

55
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,490
come out I mustn't make it come out
until then

56
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:16,500
until then
 

57
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,070
until then
now this hand's going to come here and

58
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,080
now this hand's going to come here and
 

59
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,690
now this hand's going to come here and
if I had a can to cut cut him

60
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:23,700
if I had a can to cut cut him
 

61
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,429
if I had a can to cut cut him
that would do that and that's where I'd

62
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
that would do that and that's where I'd
 

63
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,870
that would do that and that's where I'd
end up

64
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:29,880

 

65
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,190

it's the same as the cadetadori one

66
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:34,200
it's the same as the cadetadori one
 

67
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,710
it's the same as the cadetadori one
I can do this one it doesn't matter

68
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
I can do this one it doesn't matter
 

69
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,410
I can do this one it doesn't matter
if I have a um an open hand let's go

70
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:39,420
if I have a um an open hand let's go
 

71
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,249
if I have a um an open hand let's go
this way if I have an open hand

72
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:43,259
this way if I have an open hand
 

73
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,649
this way if I have an open hand
it's difficult to turn it if I make a

74
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:45,659
it's difficult to turn it if I make a
 

75
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,530
it's difficult to turn it if I make a
bird's beak

76
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:48,540

 

77
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,929

it's easier

78
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:50,939
it's easier
 

79
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,109
it's easier
if it comes out before I've got my hands

80
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:54,119
if it comes out before I've got my hands
 

81
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,590
if it comes out before I've got my hands
closed then it's not keyhon and he can

82
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
closed then it's not keyhon and he can
 

83
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,429
closed then it's not keyhon and he can
take his hand away

84
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439

 

85
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,929

so

86
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:02,939
so
 

87
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,209
so
we've got another technique for that

88
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:05,219
we've got another technique for that
 

89
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,650
we've got another technique for that
so birds beak turn

90
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:09,660
so birds beak turn
 

91
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,630
so birds beak turn
it comes out too quick he takes his hand

92
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:11,640
it comes out too quick he takes his hand
 

93
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,550
it comes out too quick he takes his hand
away never mind

94
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560

 

95
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,869

all right so there's always another

96
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:17,879
all right so there's always another
 

97
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,250
all right so there's always another
technique

98
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:19,260
technique
 

99
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,490
technique
so if you find you mess up do the arimi

100
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:25,500

 

101

bird's beak

102
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:28,980

 

103
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,890

if you think about it

104
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:30,900
if you think about it
 

105
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,710
if you think about it
if you think about it

106
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720

 

107
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,369

you perhaps didn't see that earlier

108
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:40,379
you perhaps didn't see that earlier
 

109
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,890
you perhaps didn't see that earlier
the camera will have so I can't lie I

110
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:42,900
the camera will have so I can't lie I
 

111
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,930
the camera will have so I can't lie I
didn't go like that

112
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:44,940
didn't go like that
 

113
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,330
didn't go like that
I actually went

114
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:47,340
I actually went
 

115
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,729
I actually went
I said that thumb goes over there and I

116
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:49,739
I said that thumb goes over there and I
 

117
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,530
I said that thumb goes over there and I
was closing my hand up because I know I

118
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:51,540
was closing my hand up because I know I
 

119

so all right so there's a piece more to

124
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
so all right so there's a piece more to
 

125
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,890
so all right so there's a piece more to
add to it the bird's beak this is in in
