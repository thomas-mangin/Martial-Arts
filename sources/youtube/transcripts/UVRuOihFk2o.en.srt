this okay and the reason why that's

86
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:06,360
this okay and the reason why that's
 

87
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,520
this okay and the reason why that's
happening is

88
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:07,530
happening is
 

89
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,300
happening is
because you didn't neutralize the

90
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,310
because you didn't neutralize the
 

91
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,500
because you didn't neutralize the
contact point and you got stuck there so

92
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:15,510
contact point and you got stuck there so
 

93
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,120
contact point and you got stuck there so
you can't go around the harm

94
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,130
you can't go around the harm
 

95
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,970
you can't go around the harm
okay so when I go like this you you have

96
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:22,980
okay so when I go like this you you have
 

97
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,300
okay so when I go like this you you have
to let the arm fall into this place what

98
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,310
to let the arm fall into this place what
 

99
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,180
to let the arm fall into this place what
you're doing is you're trying to move

100
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,190
you're doing is you're trying to move

up you see that my elbow comes up and
 

165
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,660
up you see that my elbow comes up and
then this is the same body where you'll

176
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:02,910
and let that come up coming up allows me
 

177
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,880
and let that come up coming up allows me
to get over the top of his arm right

hey don't let this be down

184
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:26,889

 

185
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:36,240

let's look at this there right now this

186
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,250
let's look at this there right now this
 

187
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,869
let's look at this there right now this
is the same just look at it even though

188
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:39,879
is the same just look at it even though
 

189
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,559
is the same just look at it even though
you scrap it it doesn't really change

190
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:42,569
you scrap it it doesn't really change
 

191
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:47,850
you scrap it it doesn't really change
okay so I put a hat in here and I come

192
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:47,860
okay so I put a hat in here and I come
 

193
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,149
okay so I put a hat in here and I come
around and now he puts a hand on one you

194
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:54,159
around and now he puts a hand on one you
 

195
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:58,939
around and now he puts a hand on one you
see it's the same you see that okay so

196
00:07:58,939 --> 00:07:58,949
see it's the same you see that okay so
 

197
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:03,209
see it's the same you see that okay so
that's the trickery of this technique is

198
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:03,219
that's the trickery of this technique is
 

199
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:05,670
that's the trickery of this technique is
it looks like it's gonna be the same but

200
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
it looks like it's gonna be the same but
 

201
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,589
it looks like it's gonna be the same but
the difference is that I'm going around

202
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
the difference is that I'm going around
 

203
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,950
the difference is that I'm going around
to energy can see that so when I go here

204
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
to energy can see that so when I go here
 

205
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,369
to energy can see that so when I go here
and he go this is the same technique hi

206
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:14,379
and he go this is the same technique hi
 

207
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:17,100
and he go this is the same technique hi
okay I show you I show you whatever say

208
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,110

okay I show you I show you whatever say
he goes right and it he's he's strong

210
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
he goes right and it he's he's strong
 

211
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,990
he goes right and it he's he's strong
but so on he's not gonna get it either

212
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,000
but so on he's not gonna get it either
 

213
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,170
but so on he's not gonna get it either
right do you understand so you could see

214
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:30,180

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,330
but what this technique is doing and
 

235
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,200
but what this technique is doing and
instead of going here like that I'm

236
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,210
instead of going here like that I'm
 

237
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:05,750
instead of going here like that I'm
going around everything okay and we just

238
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
going around everything okay and we just
 

239
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,460
going around everything okay and we just
do that I don't know how you're going to

he's seeing I reconciled that energy and
 

415
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,699
he's seeing I reconciled that energy and
then I'm practicing the inside he's

416
