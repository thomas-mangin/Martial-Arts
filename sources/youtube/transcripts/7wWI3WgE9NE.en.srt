00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,160
and uses his energy is to bring him to
 

19
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,790
and uses his energy is to bring him to
the other side

00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
so let all the failed techniques
 

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,550
so let all the failed techniques
this energy don't brace anymore

56
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
this energy don't brace anymore
 

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,869
this energy don't brace anymore
you need to come in and you need to

58
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
you need to come in and you need to

clear the line
 

61
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,550
clear the line
this way

62
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560

 

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,990

okay let's technique he braces he's

64
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
okay let's technique he braces he's
 

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,790
okay let's technique he braces he's
coming back in

66
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
coming back in
 

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,150

77
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,430

he's getting on and this one didn't work

78
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
he's getting on and this one didn't work
 

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,710
he's getting on and this one didn't work
okay i can't get out

80
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
okay i can't get out
 

81
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,270
okay i can't get out
it failed he braced he left the hook on

82
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
it failed he braced he left the hook on
 

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,390
it failed he braced he left the hook on
me

84
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
me
 

85
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,589
me
let go of the technique go dude

86
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
let go of the technique go dude
 

87
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,070
let go of the technique go dude
come around the technique okay

88
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080

 

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:44,830

come on

90
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840

 

91
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,910

okay

92
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920

 

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,309

so his brace is what makes it work

94
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
so his brace is what makes it work
 

95
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,830
so his brace is what makes it work
come on that brace right there

96
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
come on that brace right there
 

97
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,589
come on that brace right there
that's what he's going to use to try to

98
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
that's what he's going to use to try to
 

99
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,470
that's what he's going to use to try to
get back on

100
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480

 

101
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,910

use the brace go around it

102
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920

 

103
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,390

okay we're just we're just somewhere in

104
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
okay we're just we're just somewhere in
 

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,589
okay we're just we're just somewhere in
the scramble

106
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
the scramble
 

107
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,789
the scramble
where i'm going on okay

108
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
where i'm going on okay
 

109
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,390
where i'm going on okay
he's going to do the techniques a little

110
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
he's going to do the techniques a little
 

111
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,390
he's going to do the techniques a little
fine

112
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
fine
 

113
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,810
fine
he's going to do the first technique

114
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:22,820
he's going to do the first technique
 

115
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,590
he's going to do the first technique
[Music]

116
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
[Music]
 

117
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,670
[Music]
and i'm going to keep as much as i can

118
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
and i'm going to keep as much as i can
 

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,950
and i'm going to keep as much as i can
okay

120
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
okay
 

121
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,790
okay
well let's say i keep more than i did

122
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
well let's say i keep more than i did
 

123
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,310
well let's say i keep more than i did
last time

124
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
last time
 

125
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,710
last time
so he goes one way of keeping more as he

126
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
so he goes one way of keeping more as he
 

127
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,430
so he goes one way of keeping more as he
does

128
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
does
 

129
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,390
does
than he did last time is is as he pushes

130
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
than he did last time is is as he pushes
 

131
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,990
than he did last time is is as he pushes
on me we tend to get tense

132
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
on me we tend to get tense
 

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,390
on me we tend to get tense
do you see and then you create a lever

134
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
do you see and then you create a lever
 

135
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,390
do you see and then you create a lever
for him that's what makes it work

136
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
for him that's what makes it work
 

137
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,270
for him that's what makes it work
so you have to use your eye key he goes

138
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
so you have to use your eye key he goes
 

139
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,950
so you have to use your eye key he goes
and you're just going to segment

140
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
and you're just going to segment
 

141
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,070
and you're just going to segment
you see okay but he's still got hip

142
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
you see okay but he's still got hip
 

143
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,430
you see okay but he's still got hip
pressure but still i can't go down okay

144
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
pressure but still i can't go down okay
 

145
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,390
pressure but still i can't go down okay
so again you do a yin tactic so i'm

146
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
so again you do a yin tactic so i'm
 

147
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,189
so again you do a yin tactic so i'm
gonna go around

148
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
gonna go around
 

149
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,830
gonna go around
it and then i'm back on

150
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840

 

151
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,029

so i got to here i

152
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
so i got to here i
 

153
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,950
so i got to here i
go around instead of trying to push down

154
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
go around instead of trying to push down
 

155
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,230
go around instead of trying to push down
and muscle him

156
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
and muscle him
 

157
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,350
and muscle him
i go around it by lifting up i'm back on

158
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
i go around it by lifting up i'm back on
 

159
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,909
i go around it by lifting up i'm back on
and now i'm getting a good striking push

160
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
and now i'm getting a good striking push
 

161
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,110
and now i'm getting a good striking push
okay so

162
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
okay so
 

163
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,469
okay so
segment to take away the first lever

164
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
segment to take away the first lever
 

165
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,230
segment to take away the first lever
segment means you're gonna have to relax

166
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
segment means you're gonna have to relax
 

167
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,590
segment means you're gonna have to relax
okay then

168
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
okay then
 

169
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,550
okay then
you're going on pull this relax you get

170
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
you're going on pull this relax you get
 

171
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:28,790
you're going on pull this relax you get
it

172
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
it
 

173
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,749
it
just it dies right it just dies then go

174
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
just it dies right it just dies then go
 

175
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,950
just it dies right it just dies then go
around this pressure

176
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
