1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,070

okay so some this some parameters here

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,080
okay so some this some parameters here
 

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,070
okay so some this some parameters here
okay so uh let's say you're going to get

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
okay so uh let's say you're going to get
 

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,230
okay so uh let's say you're going to get
ready to stab me okay

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
ready to stab me okay
 

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,750
ready to stab me okay
so right now you would have a marshal

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:16,760
so right now you would have a marshal
 

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,310
so right now you would have a marshal
advantage that

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:19,320
advantage that
 

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,509
advantage that
why okay so uh let's have you scoot back

12
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:24,519
why okay so uh let's have you scoot back
 

13
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,109
why okay so uh let's have you scoot back
a whole

14
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:26,119
a whole
 

15
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,189
a whole
step back to go okay you can change your

16
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:30,199
step back to go okay you can change your
 

17
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,389
step back to go okay you can change your
one okay all right so you would you

18
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:34,399
one okay all right so you would you
 

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,389
one okay all right so you would you
would picture doing what in iida I know

20
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
would picture doing what in iida I know
 

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,709
would picture doing what in iida I know
it's weird just do do it okay you you'd

22
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:40,719
it's weird just do do it okay you you'd
 

23
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,150
it's weird just do do it okay you you'd
have to take a lot of steps right to

24
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,160
have to take a lot of steps right to
 

25
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,150
have to take a lot of steps right to
start back out there okay and so you

26
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
start back out there okay and so you
 

27
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,790
start back out there okay and so you
have a marshall Advantage again why my

28
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
have a marshall Advantage again why my
 

29
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,029
have a marshall Advantage again why my
weap out okay so as you you go in a

30
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
weap out okay so as you you go in a
 

31
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,029
weap out okay so as you you go in a
little faster if you want and you can

32
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
little faster if you want and you can
 

33
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,510
little faster if you want and you can
see that it's time for me to get my

34
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
see that it's time for me to get my
 

35
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,670
see that it's time for me to get my
weapon out you see that actually no

36
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:00,680
weapon out you see that actually no
 

37
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,070
weapon out you see that actually no
Marshal advantage to you being out there

38
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
Marshal advantage to you being out there
 

39
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,910
Marshal advantage to you being out there
with your knife in your hand you see

40
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
with your knife in your hand you see
 

41
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,030
with your knife in your hand you see
that

42
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,040
that
 

43
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,350
that
okay your Marshall bandage

44
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
okay your Marshall bandage
 

45
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,749
okay your Marshall bandage
is life hand okay now if you understand

46
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
is life hand okay now if you understand
 

47
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,749
is life hand okay now if you understand
that where would you like to start up

48
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:20,759
that where would you like to start up
 

49
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,550
that where would you like to start up
close yeah up close somewhere where I

50
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
close yeah up close somewhere where I
 

51
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,310
close yeah up close somewhere where I
don't have time to get my nut out right

52
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:25,320
don't have time to get my nut out right
 

53
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,990
don't have time to get my nut out right
okay um and then if you watch this this

54
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,000
okay um and then if you watch this this
 

55
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,429
okay um and then if you watch this this
is the easy experiment so you don't have

56
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:32,439
is the easy experiment so you don't have
 

57
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,469
is the easy experiment so you don't have
to go from spe uh if I draw as you

58
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
to go from spe uh if I draw as you
 

59
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,190
to go from spe uh if I draw as you
attack at this point you see you go a

60
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
attack at this point you see you go a
 

61
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,149
attack at this point you see you go a
little faster go okay I can't get my

62
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
little faster go okay I can't get my
 

63
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,270
little faster go okay I can't get my
knife go I can't get my knife out

64
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
knife go I can't get my knife out
 

65
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,310
knife go I can't get my knife out
getting my knife out actually creates

66
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
getting my knife out actually creates
 

67
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,870
getting my knife out actually creates
the opening that he needs if you look at

68
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
the opening that he needs if you look at
 

69
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,510
the opening that he needs if you look at
it in terms of Yin and Y I'm going Yin

70
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:54,520
it in terms of Yin and Y I'm going Yin
 

71
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,510
it in terms of Yin and Y I'm going Yin
you see my arms are coming towards me

72
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
you see my arms are coming towards me
 

73
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,670
you see my arms are coming towards me
and then it's just here okay

74
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:02,680

 

75
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,709

and that happens when we're close like

76
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:05,719
and that happens when we're close like
 

77
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,270
and that happens when we're close like
this right even if I move he's going to

78
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
this right even if I move he's going to
 

79
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,990
this right even if I move he's going to
track you so you go and I try to move I

80
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,000
track you so you go and I try to move I
 

81
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,910
track you so you go and I try to move I
can't get the weapon out on time okay

82
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:16,920
can't get the weapon out on time okay
 

83
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,589
can't get the weapon out on time okay
got got that okay so uh what we have to

84
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
got got that okay so uh what we have to
 

85
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,589
got got that okay so uh what we have to
do is create a deployment space for the

86
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
do is create a deployment space for the
 

87
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,949
do is create a deployment space for the
weapon okay cuz right now you do have an

88
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:27,959
weapon okay cuz right now you do have an
 

89
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,270
weapon okay cuz right now you do have an
advantage okay uh meaning I'm not going

90
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
advantage okay uh meaning I'm not going
 

91
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,309
advantage okay uh meaning I'm not going
to

92
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
to
 

93
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,309
to
go and then try to do something like

94
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
go and then try to do something like
 

95
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,949
go and then try to do something like
that I might have to but I'd rather not

96
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:41,959
that I might have to but I'd rather not
 

97
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,350
that I might have to but I'd rather not
okay so what we do instead is deployment

98
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:46,360
okay so what we do instead is deployment
 

99
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,509
okay so what we do instead is deployment
space there's the range you get and then

100
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:48,519
space there's the range you get and then
 

101
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:50,869
space there's the range you get and then
the weapon comes out

102
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
the weapon comes out
 

103
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,110
the weapon comes out
okay so that's our drill here

104
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120

 

105
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,910

boom I'm going to open it up because

106
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:00,920
boom I'm going to open it up because
 

107
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,110
boom I'm going to open it up because
you're a little more advanced you kind

108
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
you're a little more advanced you kind
 

109
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,149
you're a little more advanced you kind
of do whatever you want

110
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:07,159

 

111
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,830

okay what would you say what skills am I

112
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:10,840
okay what would you say what skills am I
 

113
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,990
okay what would you say what skills am I
using yeah so as I come in I'm going to

114
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,000
using yeah so as I come in I'm going to
 

115
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,149
using yeah so as I come in I'm going to
connect right and then there a

116
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:17,159
connect right and then there a
 

117
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,030
connect right and then there a
projection creates the deployment space

118
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,040
projection creates the deployment space
 

119
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,030
projection creates the deployment space
okay I'm not trying to

120
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
okay I'm not trying to
 

121
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,910
okay I'm not trying to
do this stuff you guys get

122
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920

 

123
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,670

it it's just

124
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:30,680
it it's just
 

125
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,030
it it's just
out whatever I

126
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
out whatever I
 

127
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,030
out whatever I
touch I stick to Boom whatever I touch

128
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
touch I stick to Boom whatever I touch
 

129
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,070
touch I stick to Boom whatever I touch
you

130
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
you
 

131
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,750
you
see I stick to boom and then projector

132
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:42,760
see I stick to boom and then projector
 

133
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,750
see I stick to boom and then projector
create the deployment

134
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:48,760

 

135
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,830

space okay let's try Okay so uh when he

136
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:54,840
space okay let's try Okay so uh when he
 

137
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,869
space okay let's try Okay so uh when he
attacks let's see how much penetration

138
00:03:57,869 --> 00:03:57,879
attacks let's see how much penetration
 

139
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,589
attacks let's see how much penetration
you would actually have

140
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:00,599
you would actually have
 

141
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,390
you would actually have
you see and that's

142
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,400
you see and that's
 

143
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,110
you see and that's
realistic so he's not just kissing me

144
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,120
realistic so he's not just kissing me
 

145
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,429
realistic so he's not just kissing me
here you see that

146
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:08,439
here you see that
 

147
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,990
here you see that
difference that I would probably let

148
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,000
difference that I would probably let
 

149
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,990
difference that I would probably let
that stab me if it meant that I I could

150
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,000
that stab me if it meant that I I could
 

151
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,909
that stab me if it meant that I I could
come here and go okay it's probably my

152
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:16,919
come here and go okay it's probably my
 

153
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:18,990
come here and go okay it's probably my
garment is going to stop that it's not

154
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,000
garment is going to stop that it's not
 

155
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,990
garment is going to stop that it's not
they're not laser they're not

156
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000
they're not laser they're not
 

157
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,150
they're not laser they're not
lightsabers garments have an effect on

158
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
lightsabers garments have an effect on
 

159
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,430
lightsabers garments have an effect on
them okay so when he does his his thing

160
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
them okay so when he does his his thing
 

161
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,430
them okay so when he does his his thing
you can see he would have the full 6 in

162
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
you can see he would have the full 6 in
 

163
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,150
you can see he would have the full 6 in
which is fighting knife length because

164
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,160
which is fighting knife length because
 

165
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,029
which is fighting knife length because
it hits organs okay it's going to hit

166
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:35,039
it hits organs okay it's going to hit
 

167
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:38,430
it hits organs okay it's going to hit
organs for sure okay when he does his

168
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:38,440
organs for sure okay when he does his
 

169
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,830
organs for sure okay when he does his
thrust

170
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
thrust
 

171
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,510
thrust
okay um the other thing is to note is

172
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:44,520
okay um the other thing is to note is
 

173
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,110
okay um the other thing is to note is
you have to still keep in mind that this

174
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,120
you have to still keep in mind that this
 

175
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,950
you have to still keep in mind that this
is going to spiral rotate at that 90°

176
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:51,960
is going to spiral rotate at that 90°
 

177
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,990
is going to spiral rotate at that 90°
fluctuation okay so you cannot stay on

178
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,000
fluctuation okay so you cannot stay on
 

179
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,189
fluctuation okay so you cannot stay on
the line and then see

180
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:00,199
the line and then see
 

181
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,510
the line and then see
something okay you get that that's

182
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:04,520
something okay you get that that's
 

183
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,350
something okay you get that that's
you're going to

184
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,360
you're going to
 

185
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,590
you're going to
move and keep this thing rotating

186
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
move and keep this thing rotating
 

187
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,070
move and keep this thing rotating
because it's a one step it's not going

188
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
because it's a one step it's not going
 

189
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,310
because it's a one step it's not going
to be like when we're uh sparring you

190
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
to be like when we're uh sparring you
 

191
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,110
to be like when we're uh sparring you
get it but it still is going to use the

192
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
get it but it still is going to use the
 

193
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,830
get it but it still is going to use the
same thing I'm going to come

194
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
same thing I'm going to come
 

195
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,230
same thing I'm going to come
to

196
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
to
 

197
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,950
to
out off the line never on the line

198
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
out off the line never on the line
 

199
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,350
out off the line never on the line
off the line

200
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:34,360
off the line
 

201
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,309
off the line
boom whichever way cuz you can mix it up

202
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:37,319
boom whichever way cuz you can mix it up
 

203
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,230
boom whichever way cuz you can mix it up
right off the

204
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
right off the
 

205
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,150
right off the
line off the line every time you got to

206
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
line off the line every time you got to
 

207
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,029
line off the line every time you got to
get off the line okay and then towards

208
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
get off the line okay and then towards
 

209
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,670
get off the line okay and then towards
that end then you have to read the body

210
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
that end then you have to read the body
 

211
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,670
that end then you have to read the body
so you and to read the body means to

212
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:52,680
so you and to read the body means to
 

213
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,150
so you and to read the body means to
move to start moving at

214
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,160
move to start moving at
 

215
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,629
move to start moving at
intention meaning I don't wait until I

216
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
intention meaning I don't wait until I
 

217
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,309
intention meaning I don't wait until I
see it

218
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:01,319
see it
 

219
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,029
see it
I'm already moving I know that I know

220
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
I'm already moving I know that I know
 

221
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,749
I'm already moving I know that I know
it's that side you see when he when he

222
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
it's that side you see when he when he
 

223
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,390
it's that side you see when he when he
carried it low like that and it comes

224
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
carried it low like that and it comes
 

225
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,909
carried it low like that and it comes
out it's probably going to be that it's

226
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
out it's probably going to be that it's
 

227
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,070
out it's probably going to be that it's
not going to be that do you get it so I

228
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
not going to be that do you get it so I
 

229
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,189
not going to be that do you get it so I
kind of play the odds

230
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:18,199
kind of play the odds
 

231
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,830
kind of play the odds
there but in a way let's say you were

232
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:20,840
there but in a way let's say you were
 

233
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,830
there but in a way let's say you were
going to come with that belly slash it's

234
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:22,840
going to come with that belly slash it's
 

235
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,710
going to come with that belly slash it's
still there do you see because I'm

236
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:25,720
still there do you see because I'm
 

237
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,189
still there do you see because I'm
combining my angle of deflection with my

238
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:28,199
combining my angle of deflection with my
 

239
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,350
combining my angle of deflection with my
angle of deviation

240
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:30,360
angle of deviation
 

241
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,990
angle of deviation
okay um so you got to move that

242
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,000
okay um so you got to move that
 

243
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,670
okay um so you got to move that
intention you get it and create your

244
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:38,680
intention you get it and create your
 

245
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,510
intention you get it and create your
traps across what he's

246
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
traps across what he's
 

247
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,390
traps across what he's
doing on his angle of attack so for

248
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:45,400
doing on his angle of attack so for
 

249
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,990
doing on his angle of attack so for
example I don't do do something other

250
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
example I don't do do something other
 

251
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,749
example I don't do do something other
than the low thrust okay so we go and

252
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
than the low thrust okay so we go and
 

253
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,909
than the low thrust okay so we go and
you can

254
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:52,919
you can
 

255
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,950
you can
see that my hands are in a place where

256
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
see that my hands are in a place where
 

257
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,909
see that my hands are in a place where
his weapon is going to touch my trap do

258
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:02,919
his weapon is going to touch my trap do
 

259

you see he touches me and and I project
 

275
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,110
you see he touches me and and I project
when he touches me okay and you can mix

276
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,120
when he touches me okay and you can mix
 

277
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,780
when he touches me okay and you can mix
it up boom

278

283
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,830

example that was a good

284
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
example that was a good
 

285
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,070

I felt him thought he was going high but
 

289
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,790
I felt him thought he was going high but
he started to go low and so the elbow

290
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
he started to go low and so the elbow
 

291
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,189
he started to go low and so the elbow
stays there the Trap stays there and

00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:31,159
we'll still do the deployment thing go
 

305
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,949
we'll still do the deployment thing go
all right so when I

00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
kazushi cavern which means I have to
 

311
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,430
kazushi cavern which means I have to
seize his Center so I'm not here and

315
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,630

pushing there there there is

316
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
pushing there there there is
 

317
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,509
pushing there there there is
a seizure of the that's not how he he

318
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:50,519
a seizure of the that's not how he he
 

319
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,710
a seizure of the that's not how he he
goes right you know what I mean you can

320
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
goes right you know what I mean you can
 

321
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,190
goes right you know what I mean you can
you can you can feel it okay sees the

322
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
you can you can feel it okay sees the
 

323
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,550
you can you can feel it okay sees the
center that's why I can project this

324
00:08:59,550 --> 00:08:59,560
center that's why I can project this
 

325
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,230
center that's why I can project this
Center so if we go back on that

326
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:03,240
Center so if we go back on that
 

327
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,790
Center so if we go back on that

interested in that you move your
 

557
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,509

all right so we're working on UK skill

566
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:24,279
all right so we're working on UK skill
 

567
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,590
all right so we're working on UK skill
go all right so uh we we had a little

568
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
go all right so uh we we had a little
 

569
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,910
go all right so uh we we had a little
discussion here we have different levels

570
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
discussion here we have different levels
 

571
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,670
discussion here we have different levels
on the map today and so I want to do

572
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:32,680
on the map today and so I want to do
 

573
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,670
on the map today and so I want to do
something a little we we did some

574
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
something a little we we did some
 

575
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,910
something a little we we did some
Advanced Training yesterday for ronin's

576
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
Advanced Training yesterday for ronin's
 

577
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,790
Advanced Training yesterday for ronin's
level and we're doing it again today and

578
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
level and we're doing it again today and
 

579
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,110
level and we're doing it again today and
so some of my less skilled levels are

580
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
so some of my less skilled levels are
 

581
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,949
so some of my less skilled levels are
like I just can't get this going and the

582
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:45,959
like I just can't get this going and the
 

583
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:50,389
like I just can't get this going and the
reason why is that this is the same uh

584
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
reason why is that this is the same uh
 

585
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,110
reason why is that this is the same uh
mechanics right that we do in drill one

586
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
mechanics right that we do in drill one
 

587
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,749
mechanics right that we do in drill one
or two of the cou cultivation set it's

588
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:56,759
or two of the cou cultivation set it's
 

589
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,749
or two of the cou cultivation set it's
it's the same or drill one or two of the

590
00:15:59,749 --> 00:15:59,759
it's the same or drill one or two of the
 

591
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,389
it's the same or drill one or two of the
IE cultivation set however those are

592
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
IE cultivation set however those are
 

593
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,230
IE cultivation set however those are
controlled environments and this is a a

594
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:05,240
controlled environments and this is a a
 

595
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,829
controlled environments and this is a a
live environment and so what happens is

596
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:07,839
live environment and so what happens is
 

597
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,430
live environment and so what happens is
that within the live environment uh the

598
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:10,440
that within the live environment uh the
 

599
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,110
that within the live environment uh the
ego tripartite mind is more stimulated

600
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
ego tripartite mind is more stimulated
 

601
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,150
ego tripartite mind is more stimulated
because it has more of a a will to uh

602
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,160
because it has more of a a will to uh
 

603
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,309
because it has more of a a will to uh
Will To Power in it and when we have

604
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:19,319
Will To Power in it and when we have
 

605
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:22,829
Will To Power in it and when we have
that will to power uh spiritually

606
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:22,839
that will to power uh spiritually
 

607
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,710
that will to power uh spiritually
psychologically uh we're going to have

608
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
psychologically uh we're going to have
 

609
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,629
psychologically uh we're going to have
more self- attachment when we have more

610
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
more self- attachment when we have more
 

611
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,030
more self- attachment when we have more
self- attachment we can't let the the

we contest it and we start resorting to

616
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:33,480
we contest it and we start resorting to
 

617
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,949
we contest it and we start resorting to
external things and then we can't do the

618
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:35,959
external things and then we can't do the
 

619
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,550
external things and then we can't do the
drill it's just too fast okay to do it

620
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:39,560
drill it's just too fast okay to do it
 

621
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,509
drill it's just too fast okay to do it
um the whole point of the internal stuff

622
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
um the whole point of the internal stuff
 

623
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,470
um the whole point of the internal stuff
is this mid-range grappling as you see

624
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
is this mid-range grappling as you see
 

625
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,150
is this mid-range grappling as you see
uh we're kind of hanging out in this

626
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,160
uh we're kind of hanging out in this
 

627
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,829
uh we're kind of hanging out in this
area right is this area here where you

628
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:50,839
area right is this area here where you
 

629
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,829
area right is this area here where you
do mid-range grappling all right if I

and he go he goes and I go to here
 

635
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,110
and he go he goes and I go to here
what's he going to

636
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
what's he going to
 

637
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,750
what's he going to
do do you see I you you picture in your

638
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:08,760
do do you see I you you picture in your
 

639
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,309
do do you see I you you picture in your
head you're going to pick them up and

640
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
head you're going to pick them up and
 

641
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,829
head you're going to pick them up and
you're going to slam them but it's done

642

you're going to slam them but it's done
 

643
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,069
you're going to slam them but it's done
right and then in that I can't get my

644
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,079
right and then in that I can't get my
 

645
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,669
right and then in that I can't get my
knife either so weapons fighting uses uh

646

better SE yep yep good all right cycle
 

901
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,750
better SE yep yep good all right cycle
through okay so uh this is this is where

902
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:45,760
through okay so uh this is this is where
 

903
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,669
through okay so uh this is this is where
the skill comes in uh and so I've asking

904
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:48,679
the skill comes in uh and so I've asking
 

905

to see if they can deduce what's going

910
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
to see if they can deduce what's going
 

911
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,350
to see if they can deduce what's going
on okay so um I'm going to say

912
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360
on okay so um I'm going to say
 

913
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,549
on okay so um I'm going to say
say there's no seizure because remember

914
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:02,559
say there's no seizure because remember
 

915
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,669
say there's no seizure because remember
this tactical sequence requires the UK

916
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:06,679
this tactical sequence requires the UK
 

917
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:09,110
this tactical sequence requires the UK
Center to be seized then to counter the

918
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,120
Center to be seized then to counter the
 

919
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,230
Center to be seized then to counter the
seizure and then that's where you would

920
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:11,240
seizure and then that's where you would
 

921
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,269
seizure and then that's where you would
start seeing the Tactical spectrum of

922
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:13,279
start seeing the Tactical spectrum of
 

923
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,230
start seeing the Tactical spectrum of
kihon Wasa okay so we could either pose

924
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,240
kihon Wasa okay so we could either pose
 

925
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,389

this question is there a seizure or if

926
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:19,399
this question is there a seizure or if
 

927
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:22,830
this question is there a seizure or if
not when is there a seizure okay so here

928
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:22,840
not when is there a seizure okay so here
 

929
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:29,310
not when is there a seizure okay so here
we go

930
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:29,320

 

931
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,750

and uh whenever whenever you guys have

932
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:33,760
and uh whenever whenever you guys have
 

933
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,230
and uh whenever whenever you guys have
it the answer you can just take a stab

934
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,240
it the answer you can just take a stab
 

935
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,750
it the answer you can just take a stab
at

936
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:39,760

 

937
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,509

it still no Ronin not even I come in for

938
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:43,519
it still no Ronin not even I come in for
 

939
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,149
it still no Ronin not even I come in for
this second attack

940
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:47,159
this second attack
 

941
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,230
this second attack
nope nope that's not where there's

942
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,240
nope nope that's not where there's
 

943
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,070
nope nope that's not where there's
something that's okay so you got a

944
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,080
something that's okay so you got a
 

945
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,710
something that's okay so you got a
little projected there at the end do you

946
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
little projected there at the end do you
 

947
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,830
little projected there at the end do you
see that so clearly she has the

948
00:27:59,830 --> 00:27:59,840
see that so clearly she has the
 

949
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,389
see that so clearly she has the
Center at

950
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:02,399
Center at
 

951
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,950
Center at
where at the at projection do you see

952
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:05,960
where at the at projection do you see
 

953
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,190
where at the at projection do you see
that okay and um go down your skill tree

954
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,200
that okay and um go down your skill tree
 

955
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,230
that okay and um go down your skill tree
which is easier to get out of the two

956
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:13,240
which is easier to get out of the two
 

957
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,750
which is easier to get out of the two
internals Co C projection is easier to

958
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:16,760
internals Co C projection is easier to
 

959
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,110
internals Co C projection is easier to
get than the adhesion the II do you see

960
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,120
get than the adhesion the II do you see
 

961
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,430
get than the adhesion the II do you see
okay so that's your clue so here we go

962
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,440
okay so that's your clue so here we go
 

963
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:37,070
okay so that's your clue so here we go
and let's see

964
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,080

 

965
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,509

so when the forces are sufficiently high

966
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:40,519
so when the forces are sufficiently high
 

967
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,990
so when the forces are sufficiently high
she can generate the adhesion with when

968
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,000
she can generate the adhesion with when
 

969
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,430
she can generate the adhesion with when
it's not the matching of the Y values

970
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
it's not the matching of the Y values
 

971
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,789
it's not the matching of the Y values
when it's that she can generate a

972
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:48,799
when it's that she can generate a
 

973
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,590
when it's that she can generate a
greater y value to initiate the

974
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:50,600
greater y value to initiate the
 

975
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,430
greater y value to initiate the
projection uh I'm going to say no okay

976
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:54,440
projection uh I'm going to say no okay
 

977
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,430
projection uh I'm going to say no okay
so let's say I go here and do I have

978
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:57,440
so let's say I go here and do I have
 

979
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,789
so let's say I go here and do I have

00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,669
deflecting a fighter they're just going
to go around the external deflections do

1002
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:34,679
to go around the external deflections do
 

1003
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,430
to go around the external deflections do
you see that but if on contact you're
