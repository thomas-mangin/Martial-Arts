think when they're rolling that they're
 

49
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,389
think when they're rolling that they're
going straight down but you're not

more of the force of falling to the

56
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,000
more of the force of falling to the
 

57
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,910
more of the force of falling to the
ground to be dissipated in the roll so

58
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920
ground to be dissipated in the roll so
 

59

instead of taking it all at once
straight down that force is dissipated

62
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:02,680
straight down that force is dissipated
 

63
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,750

out so as I get low to the ground I push

forward squatting roll is a great next
step in the forward roll from there once

72
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:22,439
step in the forward roll from there once
 

73
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,870
step in the forward roll from there once
you've got that Master the forward roll

74
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:23,880
you've got that Master the forward roll
 

75
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,670
you've got that Master the forward roll
really shouldn't be very difficult I'm

76
