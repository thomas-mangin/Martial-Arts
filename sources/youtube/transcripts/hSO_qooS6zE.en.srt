00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,750

so

450
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760

 

451
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,590

456
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
needs to evolve
 

457
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,670
needs to evolve
because we're evolving

458
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680

 

459
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,670

we're evolving by learning and

460
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
we're evolving by learning and
 

461
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,829
we're evolving by learning and
understanding more

462
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
understanding more
 

463
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,910
understanding more
we're understanding more and then we're

464
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
we're understanding more and then we're
 

465
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,389
we're understanding more and then we're
going deeper inside ourself

466
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
going deeper inside ourself
 

467
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,630
going deeper inside ourself
and we change

468
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
and we change
 

469
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,630
and we change
but so many like
