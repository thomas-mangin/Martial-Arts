13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,630

my power has to be in there then i'm

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
my power has to be in there then i'm
 

15

it's still grounded

40
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
it's still grounded
 

41
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,950
it's still grounded
it's still grounded boom

42
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960

 

43
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,590
