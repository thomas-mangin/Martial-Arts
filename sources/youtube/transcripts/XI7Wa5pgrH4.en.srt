and say those are ridiculous because
there's nothing to those right so

122
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159

a transitory position to get into a

128
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
a transitory position to get into a
 

129
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,110
a transitory position to get into a
deeper hold and the deeper hold holds

130
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
deeper hold and the deeper hold holds
 

131
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,350
deeper hold and the deeper hold holds
them better so one of the problems you

132
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
them better so one of the problems you
 

133
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,990
them better so one of the problems you
have with any of the the tet dory the

134
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
have with any of the the tet dory the
 

135

138
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
controlling the body so if i grab josh's
 

139
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,589
controlling the body so if i grab josh's
hand everything else in josh's body can

140
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
hand everything else in josh's body can
 

141
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,510
hand everything else in josh's body can
move around right now if i'm grappling

142
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
move around right now if i'm grappling
 

143
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,869
move around right now if i'm grappling
with that that means he can get a lot of

144
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
with that that means he can get a lot of
 

145
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,270
with that that means he can get a lot of
power behind by moving the rest of his

146
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
power behind by moving the rest of his
 

147
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,910
power behind by moving the rest of his
body to escape this hand hold right so

148

00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
forced me to kind of make a set of
 

217
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,190
forced me to kind of make a set of
clinches that were our additional grabs

218
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
clinches that were our additional grabs
 

219
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,630
clinches that were our additional grabs
that we had and i'll put a picture of

220
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
that we had and i'll put a picture of
 

221
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,309
that we had and i'll put a picture of
them on here so you can see them but i

222
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
them on here so you can see them but i
 

223
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,470
them on here so you can see them but i
created a set of additional clinches

224
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
created a set of additional clinches
 

225
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,070
created a set of additional clinches
that you need and those clinches are

226
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
that you need and those clinches are
 

227
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,990
that you need and those clinches are
just how you would hold the hand while

228
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
just how you would hold the hand while
 

229
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,990
just how you would hold the hand while
moving around the body so when something

230
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
moving around the body so when something
 

231
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,149
moving around the body so when something
like a shiro kubashima when you look at

232
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
like a shiro kubashima when you look at
 

233
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,750
like a shiro kubashima when you look at
this kind of grab oh this suddenly

00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
this kind of grab oh this suddenly
 

235
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,110
this kind of grab oh this suddenly
starts to make sense as to why you're

236
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
starts to make sense as to why you're
 

237
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,390
starts to make sense as to why you're
holding their hand while you're choking

238
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
holding their hand while you're choking
 

239
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,309
holding their hand while you're choking
them because i have to check this weapon

240
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
them because i have to check this weapon
 

241
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,830
them because i have to check this weapon
now there's a set of those that go all

242
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
now there's a set of those that go all
 

243
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,589
now there's a set of those that go all
the way around the body and i outline

244
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
the way around the body and i outline
 

245
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,190
the way around the body and i outline
them and when i was looking at aikido's

246
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
them and when i was looking at aikido's
 

247
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,710
them and when i was looking at aikido's
jitsu system that was one of the real

248
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
jitsu system that was one of the real
 

249
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,070
jitsu system that was one of the real
confusing things to me because i was

250
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
confusing things to me because i was
 

251
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,869
confusing things to me because i was
like it it has to have these kinds of

252
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
like it it has to have these kinds of
 

253
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,869
like it it has to have these kinds of
holes and the fact that no aikido style

254
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
holes and the fact that no aikido style
 

255
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,870
holes and the fact that no aikido style
talks about holds that look like this or

256
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
talks about holds that look like this or
 

257
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,189
talks about holds that look like this or
not any style that i discovered

258
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
not any style that i discovered
 

259
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,830
not any style that i discovered
then it's silly that these don't exist

260
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
then it's silly that these don't exist
 

261
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,590
then it's silly that these don't exist
but when you look at it as the guys with

262
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
but when you look at it as the guys with
 

263
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,150
but when you look at it as the guys with
the weapon the emphasis becomes on josh

264
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
the weapon the emphasis becomes on josh
 

265
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,909
the weapon the emphasis becomes on josh
being able to clear this as soon as

266
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
being able to clear this as soon as
 

267
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,990
being able to clear this as soon as
possible right so if it gets into a

268
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
possible right so if it gets into a
 

269
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,350
possible right so if it gets into a
deeper hold well that's beyond the

270
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
deeper hold well that's beyond the
 

271
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,790
deeper hold well that's beyond the
martial art of aikido but at this

272
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
martial art of aikido but at this
 

273
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,189
martial art of aikido but at this
beginning hold now he needs to find some

274
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
beginning hold now he needs to find some
 

275
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,629
beginning hold now he needs to find some
way to escape and then get his weapon

276
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
way to escape and then get his weapon
 

277
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,469
way to escape and then get his weapon
back in the game so it's very important

278
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
back in the game so it's very important
 

279
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,110
back in the game so it's very important
for him that he master how to deal with

280
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
for him that he master how to deal with
 

281
