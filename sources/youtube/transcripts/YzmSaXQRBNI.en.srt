1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,269

okay uh so

2
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:04,279

 

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,709

KAG is going to follow everything

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:08,719
KAG is going to follow everything
 

5
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,270
KAG is going to follow everything
exactly of of ago as far as the throwing

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,280
exactly of of ago as far as the throwing
 

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,150
exactly of of ago as far as the throwing
architecture goes okay um so you're

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,160
architecture goes okay um so you're
 

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,830
architecture goes okay um so you're
you're not going to

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
you're not going to
 

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,509
you're not going to
do this stuff okay my kids don't even

12
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:24,519
do this stuff okay my kids don't even
 

13
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,910
do this stuff okay my kids don't even
know how to take that but pretend

14
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:26,920
know how to take that but pretend
 

15
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,230
know how to take that but pretend
you're going to bend backwards for me

16
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:29,240
you're going to bend backwards for me
 

17
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,670
you're going to bend backwards for me
and then I

18
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:32,680

 

19
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,670

I you're not going to do that okay some

20
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:36,680
I you're not going to do that okay some
 

21
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,110
I you're not going to do that okay some
of the things that we pointed out is

22
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
of the things that we pointed out is
 

23
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,750
of the things that we pointed out is
remember they have to spinally

24
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
remember they have to spinally
 

25
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,389
remember they have to spinally
displace um the back break fall has to

26
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399
displace um the back break fall has to
 

27
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,510
displace um the back break fall has to
be going forward I don't push him I I

28
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:50,520
be going forward I don't push him I I
 

29
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,910
be going forward I don't push him I I
spiral rotate him into the

30
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:52,920
spiral rotate him into the
 

31
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,910
spiral rotate him into the
throw um

32
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
throw um
 

33
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,750
throw um
so uh you have to pay attention to all

34
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
so uh you have to pay attention to all
 

35
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,230
so uh you have to pay attention to all
the ways that you stop their forward

36
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:05,240
the ways that you stop their forward
 

37
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,830
the ways that you stop their forward
progress um and there's many of them as

38
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
progress um and there's many of them as
 

39
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,190
progress um and there's many of them as
I watched all of all of you uh you and

40
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
I watched all of all of you uh you and
 

41
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,870
I watched all of all of you uh you and
Kathy do the technique so obviously we

42
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
Kathy do the technique so obviously we
 

43
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,590
Kathy do the technique so obviously we
have the one with the hand going this

44
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
have the one with the hand going this
 

45
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,749
have the one with the hand going this
way like you can't go forward if you're

46
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
way like you can't go forward if you're
 

47
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,950
way like you can't go forward if you're
making his hand go backwards you just

48
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:21,960
making his hand go backwards you just
 

49
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,469
making his hand go backwards you just
can't okay

50
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:25,479
can't okay
 

51
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:31,390
can't okay
um but the other one is is this one you

52
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:31,400
um but the other one is is this one you
 

53
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,910
um but the other one is is this one you
see it's kind

54
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:32,920
see it's kind
 

55
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,870
see it's kind
of into into his shoulder

56
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:37,880
of into into his shoulder
 

57
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,789
of into into his shoulder
okay it can't be in his it can't be in

58
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
okay it can't be in his it can't be in
 

59
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,590
okay it can't be in his it can't be in
his

60
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
his
 

61
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,830
his
shoulder uh and he can't make it in his

62
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:44,840
shoulder uh and he can't make it in his
 

63
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,429
shoulder uh and he can't make it in his
shoulder that's what also is key

64
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:48,439
shoulder that's what also is key
 

65
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,950
shoulder that's what also is key
so uh if

66
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
so uh if
 

67
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,310
so uh if
I push into his shoulder he could turn

68
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:55,320
I push into his shoulder he could turn
 

69
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,389
I push into his shoulder he could turn
and that's and again no my UK cannot be

70
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
and that's and again no my UK cannot be
 

71
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,550
and that's and again no my UK cannot be
allowed to turn okay

72
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
allowed to turn okay
 

73
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,550
allowed to turn okay
there's only two reasons why the UK

74
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
there's only two reasons why the UK
 

75
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,870
there's only two reasons why the UK
turned I turned them and then they're

76
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:05,880
turned I turned them and then they're
 

77
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,229
turned I turned them and then they're
not having forward progress or the UK

78
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
not having forward progress or the UK
 

79
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,229
not having forward progress or the UK
did not per prescription do the forward

80
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:11,239
did not per prescription do the forward
 

81
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,509
did not per prescription do the forward
progress okay there's the only two ways

82
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:14,519
progress okay there's the only two ways
 

83
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:17,110
progress okay there's the only two ways
um taking that

84
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
um taking that
 

85
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,270
um taking that
out if for whatever weird reason my

86
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,280
out if for whatever weird reason my
 

87
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,390
out if for whatever weird reason my
attacker was so athletic there are those

88
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:27,400
attacker was so athletic there are those
 

89
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,309
attacker was so athletic there are those
people out there that even though I got

90
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
people out there that even though I got
 

91
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,350
people out there that even though I got
their Center and I'm turning

92
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
their Center and I'm turning
 

93
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,270
their Center and I'm turning
them um or or I I'm spiral rotating them

94
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:38,280
them um or or I I'm spiral rotating them
 

95
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,990
them um or or I I'm spiral rotating them
and they can like a cat turn and their

96
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
and they can like a cat turn and their
 

97
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,430
and they can like a cat turn and their
Center you lost the technique you you

98
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,440
Center you lost the technique you you
 

99
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,270
Center you lost the technique you you
have you would abandon that technique

100
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,280
have you would abandon that technique
 

101
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,030
have you would abandon that technique
not force that technique okay um very

102
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,040
not force that technique okay um very
 

103
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,309
not force that technique okay um very
much like in eeko I said if for whatever

104
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:53,319
much like in eeko I said if for whatever
 

105
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,470
much like in eeko I said if for whatever
reason the UK's shoulder turned back

106
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:55,480
reason the UK's shoulder turned back
 

107
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,270
reason the UK's shoulder turned back
towards me then EO opening is done you

108
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:58,280
towards me then EO opening is done you
 

109
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,190
towards me then EO opening is done you
don't keep trying for it okay um all

110
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,200
don't keep trying for it okay um all
 

111
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,430
don't keep trying for it okay um all
right

112
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:04,440
right
 

113
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,509
right
so what is what is missing here is

114
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
so what is what is missing here is
 

115
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,149
so what is what is missing here is
another one of those tactical insights

116
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:11,159
another one of those tactical insights
 

117
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,030
another one of those tactical insights
from fighting

118
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,040
from fighting
 

119
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,190
from fighting
um you are in this technique uh moving

120
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,200
um you are in this technique uh moving
 

121
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,589
um you are in this technique uh moving
from wrist

122
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
from wrist
 

123
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,350
from wrist
control through the elbow to spinal

124
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
control through the elbow to spinal
 

125
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,589
control through the elbow to spinal
control just like you did on the ago at

126
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
control just like you did on the ago at
 

127
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,830
control just like you did on the ago at
you're looking for the spinal control

128
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
you're looking for the spinal control
 

129
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,710
you're looking for the spinal control
um and this is something that is always

130
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:33,720
um and this is something that is always
 

131
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,869
um and this is something that is always
present in a lot of the iido techniques

132
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
present in a lot of the iido techniques
 

133
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,030
present in a lot of the iido techniques
but again people don't don't see it is

134
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,040
but again people don't don't see it is
 

135
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,429
but again people don't don't see it is
you're learning how to go from the grip

136
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:44,439
you're learning how to go from the grip
 

137
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:49,509
you're learning how to go from the grip
to the Head we do this a lot in iido so

138
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
to the Head we do this a lot in iido so
 

139
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,190
to the Head we do this a lot in iido so
one of the most obvious examples that

140
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,200
one of the most obvious examples that
 

141
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,350
one of the most obvious examples that
that I talked about recently is um Berna

142
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
that I talked about recently is um Berna
 

143
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,270
that I talked about recently is um Berna
was trying to take my

144
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:00,280
was trying to take my
 

145
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,670
was trying to take my
uh footwork here but lack the

146
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
uh footwork here but lack the
 

147
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,270
uh footwork here but lack the
understanding the Strategic

148
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
understanding the Strategic
 

149
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,229
understanding the Strategic
understanding of how to move from the

150
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:07,239
understanding of how to move from the
 

151
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,509
understanding of how to move from the
grip to the head but also lacked the ey

152
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:10,519
grip to the head but also lacked the ey
 

153
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,309
grip to the head but also lacked the ey
key so he couldn't do anything about it

154
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
key so he couldn't do anything about it
 

155
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,949
key so he couldn't do anything about it
so he he's on the grip and then he's

156
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
so he he's on the grip and then he's
 

157
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,430
so he he's on the grip and then he's
trying to do the grip again to make him

158
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
trying to do the grip again to make him
 

159
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,469
trying to do the grip again to make him
go and that just doesn't work because he

160
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
go and that just doesn't work because he
 

161
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,830
go and that just doesn't work because he
you'll you'll undo every advantage that

162
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
you'll you'll undo every advantage that
 

163
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,550
you'll you'll undo every advantage that
you tried to get originally as you go

164
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
you tried to get originally as you go
 

165
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,150
you tried to get originally as you go
through that motion so as I go here you

166
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
through that motion so as I go here you
 

167
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,590
through that motion so as I go here you
get more disturbance but as you start to

168
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
get more disturbance but as you start to
 

169
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,189
get more disturbance but as you start to
go through everything goes right back to

170
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:36,199
go through everything goes right back to
 

171
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,870
go through everything goes right back to
where now you can't do it okay you have

172
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
where now you can't do it okay you have
 

173
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,189
where now you can't do it okay you have
to learn to bypass the grid and what

174
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:42,199
to learn to bypass the grid and what
 

175
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,629
to learn to bypass the grid and what
you're doing here is passing his head to

176
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
you're doing here is passing his head to
 

177
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,150
you're doing here is passing his head to
your arm your arm is is adhering and

178
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
your arm your arm is is adhering and
 

179
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,430
your arm your arm is is adhering and
doing the Sensei yield on the head uh

180
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
doing the Sensei yield on the head uh
 

181
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,550
doing the Sensei yield on the head uh
and then you find the

182
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560

 

183
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,270

technique in tension n that's what you

184
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,280
technique in tension n that's what you
 

185
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,510
technique in tension n that's what you
do but on the

186
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:02,520
do but on the
 

187
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,150
do but on the
inside so this what he's doing here I

188
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
inside so this what he's doing here I
 

189
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,909
inside so this what he's doing here I
pass it to here on that's what I want

190
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:12,919
pass it to here on that's what I want
 

191
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,830
pass it to here on that's what I want
okay and now his grip is irrelevant he

192
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:16,840
okay and now his grip is irrelevant he
 

193
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,870
okay and now his grip is irrelevant he
can let go it doesn't

194
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:19,880
can let go it doesn't
 

195
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,350
can let go it doesn't
matter you not that's the whole point I

196
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
matter you not that's the whole point I
 

197
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,309
matter you not that's the whole point I
don't need your grip I don't want your

198
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:25,319
don't need your grip I don't want your
 

199
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,790
don't need your grip I don't want your
grip anymore um and the reason why

200
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
grip anymore um and the reason why
 

201
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,150
grip anymore um and the reason why
that's a point

202
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
that's a point
 

203
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,670
that's a point
is if I have a weapon and he grabs it

204
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
is if I have a weapon and he grabs it
 

205
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,230
is if I have a weapon and he grabs it
you're going to make I can't use my

206
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
you're going to make I can't use my
 

207
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,710
you're going to make I can't use my
weapon do you see and uh I don't I want

208
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:39,720
weapon do you see and uh I don't I want
 

209
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,870
weapon do you see and uh I don't I want
to make his grip ineffective so I go

210
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
to make his grip ineffective so I go
 

211
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,150
to make his grip ineffective so I go
here and I make the grip in ineffective

212
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
here and I make the grip in ineffective
 

213
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,029
here and I make the grip in ineffective
okay that that's what you're trying to

214
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
okay that that's what you're trying to
 

215
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,390
okay that that's what you're trying to
do um

216
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:51,400
do um
 

217
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,550
do um
so very

218
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:53,560
so very
 

219
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,590
so very
similarly as in uh

220
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:56,600
similarly as in uh
 

221
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,830
similarly as in uh
AO it's just a little more two

222
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
AO it's just a little more two
 

223
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,070
AO it's just a little more two
dimensionally looking but not really in

224
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
dimensionally looking but not really in
 

225
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,830
dimensionally looking but not really in
terms of functioning when you touch the

226
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:06,840

 

227
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,550

chin that is what you're doing

228
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:11,560

 

229
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,270

here

230
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
here
 

231
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,270
here
well that's exactly what you're doing

232
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:16,280
well that's exactly what you're doing
 

233
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,510
well that's exactly what you're doing
instead of touching this chin you bring

234
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
instead of touching this chin you bring
 

235
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,230
instead of touching this chin you bring
him to

236
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240

 

237
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,430

here and that's the technique okay

238
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
here and that's the technique okay
 

239
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,029
here and that's the technique okay
so some key things

240
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
so some key things
 

241
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,790
so some key things
don't stop him prescribe him to come

242
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
don't stop him prescribe him to come
 

243
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,070
don't stop him prescribe him to come
forward don't pull him

244
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
forward don't pull him
 

245
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,830
forward don't pull him
backwards and don't try to shove these

246
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:40,840
backwards and don't try to shove these
 

247
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,270
backwards and don't try to shove these
shoulders here see we're stuck here okay

248
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,280
shoulders here see we're stuck here okay
 

249
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,309
shoulders here see we're stuck here okay
and so this is

250
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
and so this is
 

251
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,990
and so this is
where the strong do pushes through but

252
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,000
where the strong do pushes through but
 

253
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,469
where the strong do pushes through but
you he would just walk out of it so

254
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:55,479
you he would just walk out of it so
 

255
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:56,950
you he would just walk out of it so
we'll come this

256
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
we'll come this
 

257
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,029
we'll come this
way here here he's driving here I'm

258
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:00,039
way here here he's driving here I'm
 

259
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:03,390
way here here he's driving here I'm
driving and if I push through he's he

260
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:03,400
driving and if I push through he's he
 

261
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,710
driving and if I push through he's he
will he'll be able to move his base back

262
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:05,720
will he'll be able to move his base back
 

263
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,510
will he'll be able to move his base back
under as he

264
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
under as he
 

265
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,710
under as he
goes that's all I got okay

266
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:11,720
goes that's all I got okay
 

267
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,390
goes that's all I got okay
or at that right here at that stale mate

268
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
or at that right here at that stale mate
 

269
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,990
or at that right here at that stale mate
he can turn on you you see and then

270
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,000
he can turn on you you see and then
 

271
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,670
he can turn on you you see and then
you're doing that's not the technique

272
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:20,680
you're doing that's not the technique
 

273
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,469
you're doing that's not the technique
you lost the technique okay

274
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
you lost the technique okay
 

275
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,990
you lost the technique okay
um I saw the solution you came up with

276
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,000
um I saw the solution you came up with
 

277
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,869
um I saw the solution you came up with
which is is to bring him to your

278
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:31,879
which is is to bring him to your
 

279
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,550
which is is to bring him to your
shoulder your here on your on your

280
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
shoulder your here on your on your
 

281
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,189
shoulder your here on your on your
shoulder okay um but

282
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:38,199
shoulder okay um but
 

283
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,830
shoulder okay um but
again that that is just giving you a

284
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:42,840
again that that is just giving you a
 

285
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,189
again that that is just giving you a
long a a shorter lever so it feels more

286
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
long a a shorter lever so it feels more
 

287
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,830
long a a shorter lever so it feels more
powerful um where he doesn't have the

288
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
powerful um where he doesn't have the
 

289
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,469
powerful um where he doesn't have the
distal end advantage over my grip it's

290
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:53,479
distal end advantage over my grip it's
 

291
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:54,950
distal end advantage over my grip it's
still a

292
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
still a
 

293
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,710
still a
contestation if you did come to the

294
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:57,720
contestation if you did come to the
 

295
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,230
contestation if you did come to the
shoulder you'd still have have to do the

296
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
shoulder you'd still have have to do the
 

297
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,390
shoulder you'd still have have to do the
same

298
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:01,400
same
 

299
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,990
same

you understand the tension notet so
 

329
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,430
you understand the tension notet so
we're play for that for a little bit and

means it's staying up with his head not

trying to shove his head down and his
 

577
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,070

head is only going to descend at a r and

head is only going to descend at a r and

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
forward okay so you can get you can get
 

585
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,990

here and then you're

587
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,149

like that's the wrong rate in radius

00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:07,159
like that's the wrong rate in radius
 

589
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:10,630
like that's the wrong rate in radius
okay or you can also be very

okay or you can also be very
 

591
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,350

late that's the wrong radius too so my

late that's the wrong radius too so my

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,470

um Heaven is a
 

694
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,750
um Heaven is a
contrast to the Earth which is a

695
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:12,760
contrast to the Earth which is a
 

696
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,430
contrast to the Earth which is a
contrast to heaven so you don't it

697
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:16,440
contrast to heaven so you don't it
 

698
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,870

verticality and then I also

701
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:21,320
verticality and then I also
 

702
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,590
verticality and then I also
know um that my cross has to spirally

703
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:25,600
know um that my cross has to spirally
 

704
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,789
know um that my cross has to spirally
rotate so there's no way it's in the two

705
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:27,799
rotate so there's no way it's in the two
 

706
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,190
rotate so there's no way it's in the two
dimensions of straight up and straight

707
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:30,200
dimensions of straight up and straight
 

708
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,669
dimensions of straight up and straight
down that's not going to work okay I

709
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
down that's not going to work okay I
 

710
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,750
down that's not going to work okay I
also know that I have only two spirals

711
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:36,760
also know that I have only two spirals
 

712
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,750
also know that I have only two spirals
so I can't be doing this kind of stuff

713
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:40,760
so I can't be doing this kind of stuff
 

714

the arm and the head okay work with
what's in the center what's in the

can't touch it but I can feel it okay um
 

762
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,630
can't touch it but I can feel it okay um
that is the center of Heaven and Earth

763
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
that is the center of Heaven and Earth
 

764
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,870
that is the center of Heaven and Earth
there in their

765
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:55,880
there in their
 

766
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,789
there in their
Str uh also

767
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:00,799

 

768
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,149

um the UK do different things with their

769
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:05,159
um the UK do different things with their
 

770
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,710
um the UK do different things with their
hands

771
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
hands
 

772
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,149
hands
so if you see my hand go here it's

773
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:11,159
so if you see my hand go here it's
 

774
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,310
so if you see my hand go here it's
because in the breakfall that he's

775
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
because in the breakfall that he's
 

776
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,870
because in the breakfall that he's
taking he

777
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
taking he
 

778
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,149
taking he
he for me to keep my hand where it was

779
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:20,159
he for me to keep my hand where it was
 

780
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,470
he for me to keep my hand where it was
would have pulled on his shoulder okay

781
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:23,480
would have pulled on his shoulder okay
 

782
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,070
would have pulled on his shoulder okay
so if if he is going back you'll see my

783
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080
so if if he is going back you'll see my
 

784
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,269
so if if he is going back you'll see my
hand go forward because you won't ever

785
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:31,279
hand go forward because you won't ever
 

786
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:36,990
hand go forward because you won't ever
see me pull this thing out okay so the

787
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,000
see me pull this thing out okay so the
 

788
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,950

go of the of the grip but if they don't

795
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
go of the of the grip but if they don't
 

796
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,870
go of the of the grip but if they don't
it's the say let's say he's going back

no into the fall just do the

799
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:54,760
no into the fall just do the

you you don't get pulled so you don't
 

804
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,950
you you don't get pulled so you don't
pull this but you also don't make

805
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:05,960
pull this but you also don't make
 

806
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,230
pull this but you also don't make
yourself pullable by kind of just

807
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:09,240
yourself pullable by kind of just
 

808
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,870
yourself pullable by kind of just
simulate the fall and keep my grip or

809
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:12,880
simulate the fall and keep my grip or
 

810
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,750
simulate the fall and keep my grip or
keep your grip to try to pull me okay so

811
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:15,760
keep your grip to try to pull me okay so
 

812
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,510
keep your grip to try to pull me okay so
I don't try to go like

813
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520

 

814
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,830

that and as he falls I also don't help

815
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:22,840
that and as he falls I also don't help
 

816
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,669
that and as he falls I also don't help
him up or help him from falling I don't

817
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:25,679
him up or help him from falling I don't
 

818
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,549
him up or help him from falling I don't
do that

819
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:28,559
do that
 

820
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,990
do that
but I also don't make myself pullable so

821
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,000
but I also don't make myself pullable so
 

822
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,590
but I also don't make myself pullable so
he pulls me down and I'm like that I

823
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
he pulls me down and I'm like that I
 

824
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,430
he pulls me down and I'm like that I
don't do that either okay so the first

825
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
don't do that either okay so the first
 

826
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,750
don't do that either okay so the first
thing you do is I don't pull on it and I

827
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:42,760
thing you do is I don't pull on it and I
 

828
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,669
thing you do is I don't pull on it and I
don't resist it I go with it so as he's

829
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
don't resist it I go with it so as he's
 

830
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,710
don't resist it I go with it so as he's
falling I go with it and I'll have him

831
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:50,720
falling I go with it and I'll have him
 

832
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,630
