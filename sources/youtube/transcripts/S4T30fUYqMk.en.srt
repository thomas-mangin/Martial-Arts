00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,929

his elbow in the right place so let's

2
00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:02,939
his elbow in the right place so let's
 

3
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,710
his elbow in the right place so let's
look at it just structures I need his

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:06,720
look at it just structures I need his
 

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,980
look at it just structures I need his
body to be cheap in that relationship to

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:09,990
body to be cheap in that relationship to
 

7
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,589
body to be cheap in that relationship to
where his elbow is to see that do you

8
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:12,599
where his elbow is to see that do you
 

9
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,600
where his elbow is to see that do you
guys see that if it's here like that is

10
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:14,610
guys see that if it's here like that is
 

11
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,810
guys see that if it's here like that is
not inch pocket okay so I need this

12
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:17,820
not inch pocket okay so I need this
 

13
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,390
not inch pocket okay so I need this
angle this body relationship at a

14
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
angle this body relationship at a
 

15
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,929
angle this body relationship at a
minimum now I parked at his face so he

16
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:26,939
minimum now I parked at his face so he
 

17
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,120
minimum now I parked at his face so he
walks back we rewind the film she sing

00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,130
walks back we rewind the film she sing
 

19
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,080
walks back we rewind the film she sing
so I wait for his elbow now I like his

20
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,090
so I wait for his elbow now I like his
 

21
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,200
so I wait for his elbow now I like his
body keep going and leave the elbow

22
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,210
body keep going and leave the elbow
 

23
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,400
body keep going and leave the elbow
there there he goes

24
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:45,410

 

25
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,610

then I don't push on this elbow there

26
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:49,620
then I don't push on this elbow there
 

27
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,709
then I don't push on this elbow there
you go like this see in doubles in front

28
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:51,719
you go like this see in doubles in front
 

29
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,910
you go like this see in doubles in front
and now I pushing it back I live there

30
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
and now I pushing it back I live there
 

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,700
and now I pushing it back I live there
as you come in and then I send this out

32
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:58,710
as you come in and then I send this out
 

33
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,260
as you come in and then I send this out
later

34
00:00:59,260 --> 00:00:59,270
later
 

35
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,520
later
then his elbow will be in the right

36
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:01,530
then his elbow will be in the right
 

37
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,770
then his elbow will be in the right
place his face and that's where he hits

38
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:03,780
place his face and that's where he hits
 

39
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,219
place his face and that's where he hits
my mouth so he comes in you see I'm

53
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,240
let's have me come forward around don't
clash with it and then you just same way

54
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,250
clash with it and then you just same way
 

55
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,330

if you energy go out it will not work
that mass will override the movies will

you're way stronger than that there is a

84
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:05,420
you're way stronger than that there is a
 

85
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,580
you're way stronger than that there is a
force output component to all I kielbasa

86
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:08,590
force output component to all I kielbasa

so if we watch our farm

88
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:11,770
so if we watch our farm
 

89
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:21,210
so if we watch our farm
you're letting energy out in some very

90
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:21,220

 

91
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:29,790

adopt this angle look at this angle it

98
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:51,350
adopt this angle look at this angle it
 

99
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,130
adopt this angle look at this angle it
is it is more that ankle angle that is

100
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,140
is it is more that ankle angle that is
 

101
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,240
is it is more that ankle angle that is
the problem okay so some of you will get

102
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,250
the problem okay so some of you will get
 

103
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,980
the problem okay so some of you will get
your foot down but you still have that

104
00:03:59,980 --> 00:03:59,990
your foot down but you still have that
 

105
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,350
your foot down but you still have that
ankle angle which is why I complain

106
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:02,360
ankle angle which is why I complain
 

107
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,780
ankle angle which is why I complain
about your arch not being alive or the

110
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:07,700
outside edge not being down the angle of
 

111
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,600
outside edge not being down the angle of
the back leg is here look at that angle

112
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:10,610
the back leg is here look at that angle

here like that so when I have energy I

116
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:24,430

 

117

I did that so you can get the elbow in
that zero space fast directly you can do

124
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:53,570
that zero space fast directly you can do
 

125
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,790
that zero space fast directly you can do
a ten colony that's the bottom okay

126
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
a ten colony that's the bottom okay
 

127
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,990
