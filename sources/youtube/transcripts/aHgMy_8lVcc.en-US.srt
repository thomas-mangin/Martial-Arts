00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:08,316
Before I extend my New Year's greetings to everyone, 

2
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:17,756
I would like to offer my deepest condolences and pray for those who lost their lives in the Great Noto Earthquake.

3
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:25,515
My heart goes out to all those affected by the current disaster.

4
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:33,557
Once again, I would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year. 

5
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:49,439
I am very happy to be able to hold a New Year's event with so many people for the first time in four years without any restrictions.

6
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:58,848
I'm sure the last three years have been tough for many people, 

7
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:12,449
but I am convinced that it is our positivity and perseverance that has led us to where we are today. 

8
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:20,974
I believe that we must continue our effort to follow in the spirit of the Founder's Aikido,

9
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:30,858
to help make society even a little more prosperous as much as possible. 

10
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:41,175
The founder went to Hawaii for the first time in 1961, a little over 60 years ago,

11
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:56,687
and said that he was going with the intent of building a silver bridge and see the world with a spirit of harmony, and to contribute in making society as prosperous as possible.

12
00:01:56,687 --> 00:02:06,551
I think we need to cherish that feeling and do our best to help society become that kind of prosperous society.

13
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:20,677
I think that what we can do is practice Aikido hard every day and try to get as close as possible to the founder's feelings.

14
00:02:20,677 --> 00:02:29,708
I want to continue to practice hard this year and move forward. 

15
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:33,840
I hope you all move forward with that same feeling.

16
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,930
In this New Year, I would like to express my faith in you. Thank you very much.
