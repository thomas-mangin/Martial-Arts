00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,669

my energy and your energy go to the

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:02,679
my energy and your energy go to the
 

3
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:05,909
my energy and your energy go to the
ground Vector here I don't have his

4
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:05,919
ground Vector here I don't have his
 

5
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,950
ground Vector here I don't have his
energy I still have my energy okay so

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:09,960
energy I still have my energy okay so
 

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,470
energy I still have my energy okay so
I'm just working on my energy right your

8
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,480
I'm just working on my energy right your
 

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,349
I'm just working on my energy right your
mass has to be in that ground Vector so

10
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:18,359
mass has to be in that ground Vector so
 

11
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,509
mass has to be in that ground Vector so
that my energy of my

12
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:20,519
that my energy of my
 

13
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,750
that my energy of my
materiality is going down through me

14
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
materiality is going down through me
 

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,029
materiality is going down through me
onto the ground vector and just like if

16
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
onto the ground vector and just like if
 

17
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,790
onto the ground vector and just like if
he has his hands his energy now I go

18
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
he has his hands his energy now I go
 

19
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,670
he has his hands his energy now I go
ahead and I take that down he's

20
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
ahead and I take that down he's
 

21
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,030
ahead and I take that down he's
pushing push push push push push push

22
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,040
pushing push push push push push push
 

23
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,270
pushing push push push push push push
push push push push all that energy is

24
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,280
push push push push all that energy is
 

25
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,709
push push push push all that energy is
going down I don't need a

26
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:40,719
going down I don't need a
 

27
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,670
going down I don't need a
base energy just like I I can do it on

28
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
base energy just like I I can do it on
 

29
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,709
base energy just like I I can do it on
one leg well of course I can do it on

30
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:45,719
one leg well of course I can do it on
 

31
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,350
one leg well of course I can do it on
two without a base okay I'm not leaning

32
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:50,360
two without a base okay I'm not leaning
 

33
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,590
two without a base okay I'm not leaning
if you're not grounded when he pushes

34
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:52,600
if you're not grounded when he pushes
 

35
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,590
if you're not grounded when he pushes
you you will of course get push because

36
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
you you will of course get push because
 

37
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,590
you you will of course get push because
you need a brace angle cuz you're not

38
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:58,600
you need a brace angle cuz you're not
 

39
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,270
you need a brace angle cuz you're not
ground vectoring the energy is not

40
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,280
ground vectoring the energy is not
 

41
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,950
ground vectoring the energy is not
passing through you you're stopping it

42
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:01,960
passing through you you're stopping it
 

43
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,390
passing through you you're stopping it
here at the hand so you need that foot

44
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
here at the hand so you need that foot
 

45
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,590
here at the hand so you need that foot
okay when the energy passes through you

46
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:06,600
okay when the energy passes through you
 

47
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,749
okay when the energy passes through you
you don't need that foot even to project

48
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:08,759
you don't need that foot even to project
 

49
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:12,830
you don't need that foot even to project
him off again if he lets go I should not

50
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:12,840
him off again if he lets go I should not
 

51
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,030
him off again if he lets go I should not
go flying forward because my energy is

52
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,040
go flying forward because my energy is
 

53
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,390
go flying forward because my energy is
just going down he lets go and I don't

54
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400
just going down he lets go and I don't
 

55
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,400
just going down he lets go and I don't
fly forward
