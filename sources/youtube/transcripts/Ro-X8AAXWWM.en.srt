00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
okay it's not that I'm shoving them down
 

173
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,050
okay it's not that I'm shoving them down
I'm not pulling from the out to the end

174
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:39,060
I'm not pulling from the out to the end
 

175
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,409
I'm not pulling from the out to the end
he's gonna resist I project that forward

176
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:42,419
he's gonna resist I project that forward
 

177
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,230
he's gonna resist I project that forward
but I don't stay still though I project

178
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,240
but I don't stay still though I project
 

179
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,510
but I don't stay still though I project
not moving myself

180
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
not moving myself
 

181
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,810
not moving myself
at a ring and in a space where I can

182
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:50,820
at a ring and in a space where I can
 

183
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,570
at a ring and in a space where I can
keep projecting and all my hand is doing

184
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:53,580
keep projecting and all my hand is doing
 

185
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,170
keep projecting and all my hand is doing
is staying up with him

186
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:57,180
is staying up with him
 

187
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,890
is staying up with him
so any any projection you can't project

188
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:00,900
so any any projection you can't project
 

189
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,170
so any any projection you can't project
with your fingertips so he goes to stand

190
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:03,180
with your fingertips so he goes to stand
 

191
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,689
with your fingertips so he goes to stand
up you can keep projecting but I can't

192
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:05,699
up you can keep projecting but I can't
 

193
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,210
up you can keep projecting but I can't
stay still or my hand will come off so

194
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,220
stay still or my hand will come off so
 

195
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,290
stay still or my hand will come off so
he goes to stand up I project I project

196
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:12,300
he goes to stand up I project I project
 

197
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,790
he goes to stand up I project I project
Ed

198
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800

 

199
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,790

same thing here I'll give it a an

200
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:19,800
same thing here I'll give it a an
 

201
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,370
same thing here I'll give it a an
egregious example which is very common

202
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:22,380
egregious example which is very common
 

203
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,650
egregious example which is very common
here or here

204
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:24,660
here or here
 

205
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,770
here or here
you see I mean I'm pulling it

206
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:30,780

 

207
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,570

okay

208
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:32,580
okay
 

209
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,390
okay
he saw it on me

210
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,400
he saw it on me
 

211
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,070
he saw it on me
and his energy is going forward

212
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080

 

213
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,830

all right energy is going that way

214
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:42,840
all right energy is going that way
 

215
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,930
all right energy is going that way
and I'm gonna pull

216
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:44,940
and I'm gonna pull
 

217
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:52,790
and I'm gonna pull
no no I'm not I'm not good okay

218
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800

 

219
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,370

so instead

220
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:55,380
so instead
 

221
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,529
so instead
let's say

222
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:57,539
let's say
 

223
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,909
let's say
I

224
00:05:58,909 --> 00:05:58,919
I
 

225
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,330
I
hear and again you see the fingertips

226
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:01,340
hear and again you see the fingertips
 

227
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,050
hear and again you see the fingertips
and his energy is going forward and each

228
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,060
and his energy is going forward and each
 

229
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,570
and his energy is going forward and each
one I just keep projecting you see

230
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:08,580
one I just keep projecting you see
 

231
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,510
one I just keep projecting you see
each little increment he'll resist again

232
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
each little increment he'll resist again
 

233
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,270
each little increment he'll resist again
and I keep projecting and what I'm doing

234
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,280
and I keep projecting and what I'm doing
 

235
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,050
and I keep projecting and what I'm doing
with my turning is staying so my is

236
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:18,060
with my turning is staying so my is
 

237
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,469
with my turning is staying so my is
moving at a rate and at a rotation that

238
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:21,479
moving at a rate and at a rotation that
 

239
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,029
moving at a rate and at a rotation that
my hand stays in place it's not that I'm

240
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:26,039
my hand stays in place it's not that I'm
 

241
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,309
my hand stays in place it's not that I'm
occupational tour

242
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
occupational tour
 

243
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,249
occupational tour
so for example let's see I don't even

244
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:31,259
so for example let's see I don't even
 

245
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,029
so for example let's see I don't even
know if this will work you come here

246
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
know if this will work you come here
 

247
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,090
know if this will work you come here
and you you're going to help him you're

248
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,100
and you you're going to help him you're
 

249
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,070
and you you're going to help him you're
going to help him go that way you can

250
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
going to help him go that way you can
 

251
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,830
going to help him go that way you can
see no no way that's not going work okay

252
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:42,840
see no no way that's not going work okay
 

253
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,370
see no no way that's not going work okay
so what I'm going to do as he pulls I

254
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,380
so what I'm going to do as he pulls I
 

255
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,749
so what I'm going to do as he pulls I
just keep grounding you can feel how

256
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
just keep grounding you can feel how
 

257
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,029
just keep grounding you can feel how
much tired I stand on your neck you do

258
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:50,039
much tired I stand on your neck you do
 

259
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,790
much tired I stand on your neck you do
you feel that so talk and you'll see

260
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800

 

261
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,010

yeah okay

262

yeah okay
 

263
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,070
yeah okay
same thing goes for example

264
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,080
same thing goes for example
 

265
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,950
same thing goes for example
and this is where I wanted to get to

266
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:03,960
and this is where I wanted to get to
 

267
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,409
and this is where I wanted to get to
same thing goes here

268
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:06,419
same thing goes here
 

269
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,170
same thing goes here
on the throat okay

270
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,180
on the throat okay
 

271
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,629
on the throat okay
uh you guys are going around

272
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:11,639
uh you guys are going around
 

273
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,290
uh you guys are going around
or you're trying to shove them down

274
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:14,300
or you're trying to shove them down
 

275
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,890
or you're trying to shove them down
or your kid does it for you

276
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:18,900
or your kid does it for you
 

277
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,830
or your kid does it for you
so he comes here and your UK does it for

278
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
so he comes here and your UK does it for
 

279
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,920
so he comes here and your UK does it for
you

so same thing as I get you're going

284
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,020
so same thing as I get you're going
 

285
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,570
so same thing as I get you're going
you could say the yin space so the young

286
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:34,580
you could say the yin space so the young
 

287
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,390
you could say the yin space so the young
cycle only goes so far on that hand and

288
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
cycle only goes so far on that hand and
 

289
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,129
cycle only goes so far on that hand and
on that energy going forward so he's

290
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:40,139
on that energy going forward so he's
 

291
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,490
on that energy going forward so he's
going forward and I keep moving it off

292
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:43,500
going forward and I keep moving it off
 

293
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,770
going forward and I keep moving it off
the ground now it's done

294
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:45,780
the ground now it's done
 

295
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,650
the ground now it's done
he's gonna get up I can do it for a

296
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:48,660
he's gonna get up I can do it for a
 

297
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,390
he's gonna get up I can do it for a
little bit now it's off again it's

298
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
little bit now it's off again it's
 

299
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,309
little bit now it's off again it's
interesting to get it's Yin phase okay

300
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
interesting to get it's Yin phase okay
 

301
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,529
interesting to get it's Yin phase okay
and that should be where the second hand

302
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:54,539
and that should be where the second hand
 

303
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,570
and that should be where the second hand
comes over but now the second hand

304
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:56,580
comes over but now the second hand
 

305
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,089
comes over but now the second hand
doesn't do one of those two options go

306
00:07:59,089 --> 00:07:59,099
doesn't do one of those two options go
 

307
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:02,450
doesn't do one of those two options go
around or mayukafa or shove them down

308
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:02,460
around or mayukafa or shove them down
 

309
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,450
around or mayukafa or shove them down
so for example if he does not fall down

310
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:05,460
so for example if he does not fall down
 

311
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,790
so for example if he does not fall down
and he's resisted

312
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:07,800
and he's resisted
 

313
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,129
and he's resisted
well nothing's gonna happen if he's

314
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:10,139
well nothing's gonna happen if he's
 

315
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,529
well nothing's gonna happen if he's
resisting he's stronger than me but it's

316
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:12,539
resisting he's stronger than me but it's
 

317
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,450
resisting he's stronger than me but it's
nothing's gonna happen but if I keep

318
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:14,460
nothing's gonna happen but if I keep
 

319
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,450
nothing's gonna happen but if I keep
taking his resistance go and I project

320
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:17,460
taking his resistance go and I project
 

321
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,330
taking his resistance go and I project
you see he wants to keep falling

322
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:20,340
you see he wants to keep falling
 

323
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,469
you see he wants to keep falling
Folly falling and then what is my arm

324
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
Folly falling and then what is my arm
 

325
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,110
Folly falling and then what is my arm
doing just staying up

326
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
doing just staying up
 

327
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,689
doing just staying up
so that it can keep projecting it's not

328
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:29,699
so that it can keep projecting it's not
 

329
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,810
so that it can keep projecting it's not
throwing him okay

330
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:32,820
throwing him okay
 

331
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,870
throwing him okay
boom

332
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:35,880

 

333
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:45,230

boom

334
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,240

 

335
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,610

now you can see his body is Unified

336
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:48,620
now you can see his body is Unified
 

337

345
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,210

so resist

your right arm do you see that with the

350
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:18,779
your right arm do you see that with the
 

351
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,930

do you understand there's no there's no
more there here's where the left arm

356
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:25,260
more there here's where the left arm
 

357
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,290

young phase is supposed to begin but

358
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,300
young phase is supposed to begin but
 

359
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,269
young phase is supposed to begin but
she's resisting and there's this there's

360
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
she's resisting and there's this there's
 

361
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,370
she's resisting and there's this there's
no way because you weren't doing it the

362
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:31,380
no way because you weren't doing it the
 

363
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,170
no way because you weren't doing it the
other way you were having her fall for

364
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:33,180
other way you were having her fall for
 

365
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,310
other way you were having her fall for
you so she's resisting

366
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,320

 

367
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,050

and you're trying to go around it you

368
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,060
and you're trying to go around it you
 

369
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,090
and you're trying to go around it you
see you're trying to do an external

370
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,100
see you're trying to do an external
 

371
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,889

391
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:13,910

now we're going around everything okay

392
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920

 

393
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,570

we keep resisting
 

419
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,949
we keep resisting
keep more

420
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
keep more
 

421
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,329
keep more
there you go yes

422
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:53,339

 

423
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,410

yes okay uh we're here sure if you want

424
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:57,420
yes okay uh we're here sure if you want
 

425
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,670
yes okay uh we're here sure if you want
to be that high

426
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:58,680
to be that high
 

427
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,829
to be that high
because normally you're here but I don't

428
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:00,839
because normally you're here but I don't
 

429
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,069
because normally you're here but I don't
it doesn't matter okay so uh you're

430
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
it doesn't matter okay so uh you're
 

431
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,889
it doesn't matter okay so uh you're
trying to be strong that's it and I just

432
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:06,899
trying to be strong that's it and I just
 

433
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,170
trying to be strong that's it and I just
keep projecting to the ground projecting

434
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:09,180
keep projecting to the ground projecting
 

435
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,810
keep projecting to the ground projecting
to the ground projecting to the ground

436
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:11,820
to the ground projecting to the ground
 

437
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,389
to the ground projecting to the ground
projecting to the ground projecting to

438
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
projecting to the ground projecting to
 

439
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,750
projecting to the ground projecting to
the ground okay now

440
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
the ground okay now
 

441
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,269
the ground okay now
instead of letting you

442
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:20,279
instead of letting you
 

443
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,590
instead of letting you
uh Fallout where you'll see I want to

444
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:24,600
uh Fallout where you'll see I want to
 

445
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,350
uh Fallout where you'll see I want to
point it out to you resist boom there's

446
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
point it out to you resist boom there's
 

447
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,170
point it out to you resist boom there's
the projection instead of here you're

448
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:30,180
the projection instead of here you're
 

449
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,110
the projection instead of here you're
falling you see that okay I use that

450
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
falling you see that okay I use that
 

451
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,530
falling you see that okay I use that
falling energy to keep it going this way

452
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:36,540
falling energy to keep it going this way
 

453
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,030
falling energy to keep it going this way
see that difference

454
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,040
see that difference
 

455
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,370
see that difference
so I don't I'm not going to let you fall

456
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:40,380
so I don't I'm not going to let you fall
 

457
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,870
so I don't I'm not going to let you fall
out free

458
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880

 

459
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,170

your energy I keep using

460
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,180
your energy I keep using
 

461
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,530
your energy I keep using
to get it to go this way okay all right

462
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:51,540
to get it to go this way okay all right
 

463
00:11:51,540 --> 00:12:00,769
to get it to go this way okay all right
try it again

464
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:00,779

 

465
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:05,389

okay so on the initial prescribed

466
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:05,399
okay so on the initial prescribed
 

467
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,389
okay so on the initial prescribed
energy print that okay has energy linear

468
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
energy print that okay has energy linear
 

469
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,790
energy print that okay has energy linear
going in the opposite direction that I

470
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
going in the opposite direction that I
 

471
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,190
going in the opposite direction that I
was going okay so I would be over here

472
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
was going okay so I would be over here
 

473
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,130
was going okay so I would be over here
so it's coming towards me okay and on

474
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,140
so it's coming towards me okay and on
 

475
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,710
so it's coming towards me okay and on
the first kazushi

476
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
the first kazushi
 

477
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,650
the first kazushi
it's the fact that that energy keeps

478
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:21,660
it's the fact that that energy keeps
 

479
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,590
it's the fact that that energy keeps
going that way that when I create a turn

480
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600

 

481
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,569

this energy is still going that way

482
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:29,579
this energy is still going that way
 

483
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,430
this energy is still going that way
still going that way still going that

484
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
still going that way still going that
 

485
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,650
still going that way still going that
way through the incremental rotation

486
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:33,660
way through the incremental rotation
 

487
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,910
way through the incremental rotation
that's what allows him to stick to uh my

488
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:37,920
that's what allows him to stick to uh my
 

489
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,009
that's what allows him to stick to uh my
curvature that's why I don't have to

490
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:40,019
curvature that's why I don't have to
 

491
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,910
curvature that's why I don't have to
pull his uh collar or anything weird

492
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
pull his uh collar or anything weird
 

493
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,310
pull his uh collar or anything weird
like that okay so I'll show you what

494
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
like that okay so I'll show you what
 

495
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,590
like that okay so I'll show you what
that means that that's this is why in

496
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:48,600
that means that that's this is why in
 

497
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,769
that means that that's this is why in
that one example when Tristan pulls

498
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:51,779
that one example when Tristan pulls
 

499
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,329
that one example when Tristan pulls
ronin's

500
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:53,339
ronin's
 

501
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,009
ronin's
further that way it generated more

502
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:57,019
further that way it generated more
 

503
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:59,629
further that way it generated more
pressure at your neck remember and I

504
00:12:59,629 --> 00:12:59,639
pressure at your neck remember and I
 

505
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,670
pressure at your neck remember and I
said look listen to your voice my

506
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
said look listen to your voice my
 

507
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,790
said look listen to your voice my
fingers are digging into you which they

508
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
fingers are digging into you which they
 

509
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,430
fingers are digging into you which they
can't if I'm just on the side but

510
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
can't if I'm just on the side but
 

511
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,769
can't if I'm just on the side but
because I'm turning then you're pulling

512
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:09,779
because I'm turning then you're pulling
 

513
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,990
because I'm turning then you're pulling
against this centripetal you're you're

514
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
against this centripetal you're you're
 

515
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,730
against this centripetal you're you're
actually generating this centripetal

516
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:13,740
actually generating this centripetal
 

517
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,949
actually generating this centripetal
energy in an equal and opposite way okay

518
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:15,959
energy in an equal and opposite way okay
 

519
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:21,410
energy in an equal and opposite way okay
so as his energy is going that way

520
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:21,420

 

521
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,790

and if I take his uh that energy that's

522
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:25,800
and if I take his uh that energy that's
 

523
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,430
and if I take his uh that energy that's
going that way and I just am

524
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:28,440
going that way and I just am
 

525
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,610
going that way and I just am
incrementally he keeps going that way

526
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:30,620
incrementally he keeps going that way
 

527
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,629
incrementally he keeps going that way
incrementally you feel the pressure on

528
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
incrementally you feel the pressure on
 

529
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,690
incrementally you feel the pressure on
your neck you see that if I stop it and

530
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:35,700
your neck you see that if I stop it and
 

531
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,050
your neck you see that if I stop it and
pull it back there's it's not possible

532
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:39,060
pull it back there's it's not possible
 

533
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,110
pull it back there's it's not possible
if I try to shove it really fast past

534
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:42,120
if I try to shove it really fast past
 

535
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,009
if I try to shove it really fast past
its value it will lose it I do it at a

536
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:46,019
its value it will lose it I do it at a
 

537
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,610
its value it will lose it I do it at a
rate that is utilizing the energy that's

538
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:49,620
rate that is utilizing the energy that's
 

539
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,470
rate that is utilizing the energy that's
going that way so he's going that way

540
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:51,480
going that way so he's going that way
 

541
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,449
going that way so he's going that way
and I can keep pulling it you see

542
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:53,459
and I can keep pulling it you see
 

543
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,650
and I can keep pulling it you see
you see

544
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:54,660
you see
 

545
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:01,069
you see
that okay

547
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,530

how you what how you do that energy

548
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:03,540
how you what how you do that energy
 

549
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,750
how you what how you do that energy
though

he's going to stand up for prescription
 

589
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,790
he's going to stand up for prescription
in the form okay he's going to try to

590
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:07,800
in the form okay he's going to try to
 

591
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,110
in the form okay he's going to try to
stand up all right so as he stands up

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,120
stand up all right so as he stands up
 

593
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,930
stand up all right so as he stands up
that's where I make another of one of

594
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:14,940
that's where I make another of one of
 

595
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,250
that's where I make another of one of
those curves

596
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:16,260
those curves
 

597
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,509
those curves
and it's his his desire to stand up

598
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:20,519
and it's his his desire to stand up
 

599
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,629
and it's his his desire to stand up
that I keep projecting back down to the

600
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:23,639
that I keep projecting back down to the
 

601
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,730
that I keep projecting back down to the
ground and that creates that Ikea

602
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:25,740
ground and that creates that Ikea
 

603
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,129
ground and that creates that Ikea
adhesion where I again don't have to

604
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:28,139
adhesion where I again don't have to
 

605
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,210
adhesion where I again don't have to
pull him

606
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:29,220
pull him
 

607
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,790
pull him
he stuck to me

608
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:31,800
he stuck to me
 

609
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,670
he stuck to me
and he is moving from projection to

610
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:34,680
and he is moving from projection to
 

611
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,650
and he is moving from projection to
projection to projection

projection to projection
so we got the first one we'll just get

614
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:38,820
so we got the first one we'll just get
 

615
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,490
so we got the first one we'll just get
there okay

616
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:40,500
there okay
 

617
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,189
there okay
this one here there's Pierce's energy

618
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
this one here there's Pierce's energy
 

619
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,310
this one here there's Pierce's energy
standing up you see and that energy

620
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
standing up you see and that energy
 

621
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,310
standing up you see and that energy
standing up I make a curve

622
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:49,320
standing up I make a curve
 

623
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,850
standing up I make a curve
on that same energy as he's going up I

624
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:52,860
on that same energy as he's going up I
 

625
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,829
on that same energy as he's going up I
keep uh

626
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:54,839
keep uh
 

627
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,530
keep uh
this curve here

628
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:57,540
this curve here
 

629
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,530
this curve here
okay uh but it's not that I'm moving my

630
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:00,540
okay uh but it's not that I'm moving my
 

631
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,710
okay uh but it's not that I'm moving my
arm externally he stands up and IT

632
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:03,720
arm externally he stands up and IT
 

633
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,990
arm externally he stands up and IT
projects you see he stands up IT

634
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
projects you see he stands up IT
 

635
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,110
projects you see he stands up IT
projects he stand up a little there up

636
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
projects he stand up a little there up
 

637
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,730
projects he stand up a little there up
and IT projects

638
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:10,740
and IT projects
 

639
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,490
and IT projects
that's what creates the IQ adhesion so

640
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:13,500
that's what creates the IQ adhesion so
 

641
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,430
that's what creates the IQ adhesion so
he goes warm and I keep this to here you

642
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:16,440
he goes warm and I keep this to here you
 

643
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,870
he goes warm and I keep this to here you
see

644
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:17,880
see
 

645
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,990
see
so it was your energy to the contrary

646
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,000
so it was your energy to the contrary
 

647
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,470
so it was your energy to the contrary
that I curved and now used to generate

648
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
that I curved and now used to generate
 

649
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,129
that I curved and now used to generate
the adhesion or friction at my touch

650
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:28,139
the adhesion or friction at my touch
 

651
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:38,269
the adhesion or friction at my touch
Point okay

652
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:38,279

 

653
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,030

then that Kazuki is going to pass into

654
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040
then that Kazuki is going to pass into
 

655
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,829
then that Kazuki is going to pass into
yitz Yin phase on the other arm enters

656
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
yitz Yin phase on the other arm enters
 

657
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,490
yitz Yin phase on the other arm enters
into its yawn phase okay and that person

658
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:49,500
into its yawn phase okay and that person
 

659
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,590
into its yawn phase okay and that person
is resisting

660
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
is resisting
 

661
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,509
is resisting
so they have an energy that's going this

662
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:56,519
so they have an energy that's going this
 

663
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,470
so they have an energy that's going this
way

664
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:57,480
way
 

665
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,009
way
the on the other ones I had a kind of uh

666
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:01,019
the on the other ones I had a kind of uh
 

667
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,030
the on the other ones I had a kind of uh
inward orientation to my ik adhesion and

668
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,040
inward orientation to my ik adhesion and
 

669
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,409
inward orientation to my ik adhesion and
this one's going to be an outward

670
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:06,419
this one's going to be an outward
 

671
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:10,610
this one's going to be an outward
orientation okay because my curve is now

672
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:10,620
orientation okay because my curve is now
 

673
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,110
orientation okay because my curve is now
going this way

674
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,120
going this way
 

675
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,929
going this way
okay and their energy is going into it

676
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:14,939
okay and their energy is going into it
 

677
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,689
okay and their energy is going into it
so every time they project they get

678
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:17,699
so every time they project they get
 

679
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,210
so every time they project they get
stuck on my inner arm

680
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:20,220
stuck on my inner arm
 

681
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,030
stuck on my inner arm
I take that energy I ground it I ground

682
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,040
I take that energy I ground it I ground
 

683
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,470
I take that energy I ground it I ground
it and that's what moves it

684
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
it and that's what moves it
 

685
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,710
it and that's what moves it
incrementally through the throat

686
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720

 

687
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,549

foreign

688
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559

 

689
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,850

so here we are this is why I don't have

690
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:37,860
so here we are this is why I don't have
 

691
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,789
so here we are this is why I don't have
to pull him I don't need to crank this

692
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
to pull him I don't need to crank this
 

693
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,330
to pull him I don't need to crank this
this arm's done this arm is now it okay

694
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:44,340
this arm's done this arm is now it okay
 

695
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,529
this arm's done this arm is now it okay
so this arm has the adhesion

696
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:48,539
so this arm has the adhesion
 

697
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:52,310
so this arm has the adhesion
this does it I'm not knocking him down

698
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
this does it I'm not knocking him down
 

699
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,529
this does it I'm not knocking him down
his Mass

700
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:54,539
his Mass
 

701
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:58,270
his Mass
has energy and that energy I ground

702
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:58,280
has energy and that energy I ground
 

703
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,430
has energy and that energy I ground
which gets Amplified on the person that

704
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
which gets Amplified on the person that
 

705
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,130
which gets Amplified on the person that
is resisting so he resists well that

706
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,140
is resisting so he resists well that
 

707
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,090
is resisting so he resists well that
makes more energy that I can boom

708
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,100
makes more energy that I can boom
 

709
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,970
makes more energy that I can boom
to his arm he's using that arm you can

710
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:10,980
to his arm he's using that arm you can
 

711
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,070
to his arm he's using that arm you can
do it it doesn't matter he's using that

712
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,080
do it it doesn't matter he's using that
 

713
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,090
do it it doesn't matter he's using that
arm to base okay so push and I use that

714
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:17,100
arm to base okay so push and I use that
 

715
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,549
arm to base okay so push and I use that
arm and I project the arm out you see

716
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:19,559
arm and I project the arm out you see
 

717
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,350
arm and I project the arm out you see
that all right

718
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
that all right
 

719
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,049
that all right
so we're here but now you can feel that

720
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:24,059
so we're here but now you can feel that
 

721
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,970
so we're here but now you can feel that
it's starting to go off there's a little

722
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:25,980
it's starting to go off there's a little
 

723
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,130
it's starting to go off there's a little
bit you see but it's starting to go off

724
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,140
bit you see but it's starting to go off
 

725
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:38,029
bit you see but it's starting to go off
do you feel that okay

726
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:38,039

 

727
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,370

in the bench why is it going off it's

728
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,380
in the bench why is it going off it's
 

729
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,049
in the bench why is it going off it's
because you're starting to fall

730
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:42,059
because you're starting to fall
 

731
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,630
because you're starting to fall
you're you're no longer offering that

732
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
you're you're no longer offering that
 

733
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,330
you're you're no longer offering that
resistance to this curve you're starting

734
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:47,340
resistance to this curve you're starting
 

735
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,289
resistance to this curve you're starting
to fall out of it so as we get further

736
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:50,299
to fall out of it so as we get further
 

737
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:53,630
to fall out of it so as we get further
up this increment gravity is starting to

738
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:53,640
up this increment gravity is starting to
 

739
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,549
up this increment gravity is starting to
generate another energy where you start

740
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:55,559
generate another energy where you start
 

741
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,710
generate another energy where you start
to fall this way you start to fall down

742
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:57,720
to fall this way you start to fall down
 

743
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,909
to fall this way you start to fall down
towards the ground

744
00:18:58,909 --> 00:18:58,919
towards the ground
 

745
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:05,690
towards the ground
okay

746
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:05,700

 

747
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,669

well

748
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
well
 

749
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,730
well
I can use that energy

750
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:10,740
I can use that energy
 

751
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,070
I can use that energy
to pass through

752
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,080
to pass through
 

753
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,510
to pass through
a young face into a Yin phase and now it

754
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
a young face into a Yin phase and now it
 

755
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,450
a young face into a Yin phase and now it
can still do the same thing as it's

756
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:20,460
can still do the same thing as it's
 

757
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,390
can still do the same thing as it's
pushing here

758
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:23,400

 

759
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,930

you get about an inch or two more

760
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:26,940
you get about an inch or two more
 

761
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,310
you get about an inch or two more
projection but again in combat inches

762
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:31,320
projection but again in combat inches
 

763
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,830
projection but again in combat inches
are Miles okay

764
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
are Miles okay
 

765
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,130
are Miles okay
so uh I want you you'll you'll feel I'll

766
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:37,140
so uh I want you you'll you'll feel I'll
 

767
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,650
so uh I want you you'll you'll feel I'll
try to tell you when to feel okay so

768
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:39,660
try to tell you when to feel okay so
 

769
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,529
try to tell you when to feel okay so
your energy is going that way that's

770
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:42,539
your energy is going that way that's
 

771
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,230
your energy is going that way that's
that friction point energy is coming up

772
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:45,240
that friction point energy is coming up
 

773
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,090
that friction point energy is coming up
that's that friction point you feel the

774
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,100
that's that friction point you feel the
 

775
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,029
that's that friction point you feel the
pulls on your finger okay then here is

776
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:50,039
pulls on your finger okay then here is
 

777
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,630
pulls on your finger okay then here is
that you feel that okay now as you start

778
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:53,640
that you feel that okay now as you start
 

779
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,850
that you feel that okay now as you start
to fall out of it you see how it went

780
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:55,860
to fall out of it you see how it went
 

781
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,990
to fall out of it you see how it went
off

782
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,000
off
 

783
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,590
off
but I can use this downward energy to

784
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:00,600
but I can use this downward energy to
 

785
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,010
but I can use this downward energy to
keep the same friction going

786
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,020
keep the same friction going
 

787
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,650
keep the same friction going
feel that

788
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:06,660
feel that
 

789
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,750
feel that
and what we tend to do is the guy's

790
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:08,760
and what we tend to do is the guy's
 

791
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,130
and what we tend to do is the guy's
falling and then we let them fall

792
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:13,140

 

793
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,830

but if you were to do an inward spiral

794
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840

 

795
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,870

here

796
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
here
 

797
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,990
here
so Evie Minogue is the same thing it

798
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,000
so Evie Minogue is the same thing it
 

799
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,450
so Evie Minogue is the same thing it
doesn't stop here it doesn't stop here

800
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:26,460
doesn't stop here it doesn't stop here
 

801
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,330
doesn't stop here it doesn't stop here
keeps going

802
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:28,340
keeps going
 

803
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,430
keeps going
and you watch his head you can see his

804
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
and you watch his head you can see his
 

805
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,230
and you watch his head you can see his
head that probably where it's visible

806
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,240
head that probably where it's visible
 

807
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,230

okay so here is in the center you wash

808
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
okay so here is in the center you wash
 

809
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,230
okay so here is in the center you wash
his head all exaggerate it that little

810
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:39,240
his head all exaggerate it that little
 

811
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,350
his head all exaggerate it that little
jerking back in at the end okay kind of

812
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:42,360
jerking back in at the end okay kind of
 

813
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,510
jerking back in at the end okay kind of
like in the days you had Harlem

814
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:44,520
like in the days you had Harlem
 

815
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,730

Globetrotters and they're passing that
 

817
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,310
Globetrotters and they're passing that
ball back and forth okay all the way the

ball back and forth okay all the way the
 

819
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,010

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,149
went back
on the throat and your Center went up

834
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:29,159
on the throat and your Center went up
 

835
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,510
on the throat and your Center went up
okay this is the external this is that

836
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:32,520
okay this is the external this is that
 

837
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,750
okay this is the external this is that
the external yield to take energy off

838
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
the external yield to take energy off
 

839
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,950
the external yield to take energy off
right and then the up to to push them

840
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:39,960
right and then the up to to push them
 

841
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,690
right and then the up to to push them
away okay if I was doing it internally I

842
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:44,700
away okay if I was doing it internally I
 

843
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,149
away okay if I was doing it internally I
would sink down and I wouldn't have to

844
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:47,159
would sink down and I wouldn't have to
 

845
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,070
would sink down and I wouldn't have to
take energy off because the energy is

846
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,080
take energy off because the energy is
 

847
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,010
take energy off because the energy is
passing in between me so to get you on

848
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:52,020
passing in between me so to get you on
 

849
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,750
passing in between me so to get you on
the same page or for those who didn't

850
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
the same page or for those who didn't
 

851
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,350
the same page or for those who didn't
see it coming around

852
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
see it coming around
 

853
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,470
see it coming around
boom there's a lot of

854
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:00,480
boom there's a lot of
 

855
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,710
boom there's a lot of
um you see and you're gonna go around it

856
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:03,720
um you see and you're gonna go around it
 

857
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,409
um you see and you're gonna go around it
you see the yield right there and then

858
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:06,419
you see the yield right there and then
 

859
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:13,250
you see the yield right there and then
in here

860
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:13,260

 

861
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,090

it's it's good to know but you want to

862
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:17,100
it's it's good to know but you want to
 

863
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,930
it's it's good to know but you want to
try to gain the internal aspect okay so

864
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:20,940
try to gain the internal aspect okay so
 

865
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,549
try to gain the internal aspect okay so
as as we already saw for example uh

866
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:25,559
as as we already saw for example uh
 

867
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,230
as as we already saw for example uh
you guys have seen

868
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,240
you guys have seen
 

869
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,049
you guys have seen
both both of my sons now lift way more

870
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:30,059
both both of my sons now lift way more
 

871
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,149
both both of my sons now lift way more
than me okay

872
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
than me okay
 

873
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,950
than me okay
um

874
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:33,960
um
 

875
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,289
um
so if I take

876
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:36,299
so if I take
 

877
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,330
so if I take
if I have one person even if I don't

878
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:38,340
if I have one person even if I don't
 

879
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,070
if I have one person even if I don't
give them a victim is his bracing angle

880
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
give them a victim is his bracing angle
 

881
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,529
give them a victim is his bracing angle
you see last time he used his bracelet I

882
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:42,539
you see last time he used his bracelet I
 

883
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,529
you see last time he used his bracelet I
don't give him any bracing angle

884
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:45,539
don't give him any bracing angle
 

885
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:49,789
don't give him any bracing angle
he resists I cannot do it I cannot do it

886
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:49,799
he resists I cannot do it I cannot do it
 

887
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,409
he resists I cannot do it I cannot do it
and if I do that

888
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:51,419
and if I do that
 

889
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,370
and if I do that
that Yin that external Yin yield it

890
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:55,380
that Yin that external Yin yield it
 

891
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,710
that Yin that external Yin yield it
creates a weakness here that now now

892
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:57,720
creates a weakness here that now now
 

893
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,730
creates a weakness here that now now
he's got me using

894
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:01,740

 

895
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,590

so

896
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:03,600
so
 

897
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,890
so
I have to just like the shihonage I have

898
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:06,900
I have to just like the shihonage I have
 

899
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,090
I have to just like the shihonage I have
to take his resistance and keep bouncing

900
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,100
to take his resistance and keep bouncing
 

901
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,250
to take his resistance and keep bouncing
it through me it has to pass through me

902
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:13,260
it through me it has to pass through me
 

903
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,909
it through me it has to pass through me
in which case I can't go up okay and in

904
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:16,919
in which case I can't go up okay and in
 

905
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,730
in which case I can't go up okay and in
which case I can't do a yield okay

906
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:19,740
which case I can't do a yield okay
 

907
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,169
which case I can't do a yield okay
so

908
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:21,179
so
 

909
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:22,090
so
um

910
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:22,100
um
 

911
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,730
um
just so you can say so be strong be

912
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:25,740
just so you can say so be strong be
 

913
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,770
just so you can say so be strong be
strong don't let me show you don't want

914
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:27,780
strong don't let me show you don't want
 

915
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,350
strong don't let me show you don't want
me for you

916
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:30,360

 

917
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,049

there's just no there's no way my arm is

918
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:33,059
there's just no there's no way my arm is
 

919
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,090
there's just no there's no way my arm is
not strong enough okay

920
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:35,100
not strong enough okay
 

921
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,730
not strong enough okay
but again if you take

922
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:37,740
but again if you take
 

923
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,690
but again if you take
the same he pushes right and I take that

924
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:41,700
the same he pushes right and I take that
 

925
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,149
the same he pushes right and I take that
energy I release it down and I project

926
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
energy I release it down and I project
 

927
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,850
energy I release it down and I project
it out you see I'm projecting it out

928
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:46,860
it out you see I'm projecting it out
 

929
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,649
it out you see I'm projecting it out
projecting it out projecting the balance

930
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:51,659

 

931
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:54,590

if you add

932
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:54,600
if you add
 

933
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,210
if you add
his energy to it you see

934
00:23:59,210 --> 00:23:59,220

 

935
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,850

same thing there's no way I'm strong

936
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:01,860
same thing there's no way I'm strong
 

937
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,669
same thing there's no way I'm strong
enough but I can keep projecting keep

938
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:04,679
enough but I can keep projecting keep
 

939
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,049
enough but I can keep projecting keep
projecting

940
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:06,059
projecting
 

941
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:12,049
projecting
keep projecting that energy

942
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:12,059

 

943
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:15,049

when the guy's standing

944
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:15,059
when the guy's standing
 

945
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:18,770
when the guy's standing
it's even tougher because he has so much

946
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:18,780
it's even tougher because he has so much
 

947
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,630
it's even tougher because he has so much
of his leg strength

948
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
of his leg strength
 

949
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,130
of his leg strength
do you see

950
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:22,140
do you see
 

951
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,090
do you see
it's like oh God no okay

952
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:26,100
it's like oh God no okay
 

953
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,430
it's like oh God no okay
and I want to know how to connect his

954
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:28,440
and I want to know how to connect his
 

955
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,450
and I want to know how to connect his
Center because I don't want my throw to

956
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:32,460
Center because I don't want my throw to
 

957
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,810
Center because I don't want my throw to
come from a pulling there's no pull you

958
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:35,820
come from a pulling there's no pull you
 

959
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,430
come from a pulling there's no pull you
can't pull people I wanted to come from

960
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
can't pull people I wanted to come from
 

961
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,909
can't pull people I wanted to come from
moving his center around itself okay so

962
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
moving his center around itself okay so
 

963
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,630
moving his center around itself okay so
if he resists and I try to pull now and

964
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:47,640
if he resists and I try to pull now and
 

965
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,049
if he resists and I try to pull now and
I try to shop right he'll move his feet

966
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:51,059
I try to shop right he'll move his feet
 

967
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,610
I try to shop right he'll move his feet
no

968
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:52,620
no
 

969
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,770
no
but if you resist

970
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:54,780
but if you resist
 

971
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,870
but if you resist
I can turn him

972
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
I can turn him
 

973
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,090
I can turn him
doing the same thing that we drew on the

974
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,100
doing the same thing that we drew on the
 

975
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,909
doing the same thing that we drew on the
board so I use the same thing I'm going

976
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
board so I use the same thing I'm going
 

977
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,370
board so I use the same thing I'm going
to spin his center around by grounding

978
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:04,380
to spin his center around by grounding
 

979
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,430
to spin his center around by grounding
it

980
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:10,440

 

981
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,169

here we are

982
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:12,179
here we are
 

983
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:16,310
here we are
okay I have this energy and I'm going to

984
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,320
okay I have this energy and I'm going to
 

985
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,289
okay I have this energy and I'm going to
make it go on a circle

986
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:18,299
make it go on a circle
 

987
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,230
make it go on a circle
oh he's strong strong he's not going to

988
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:21,240
oh he's strong strong he's not going to
 

989
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:29,590
oh he's strong strong he's not going to
bend for me but I can spin it

990
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:29,600

 

991
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,970

boom here

992
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:31,980
boom here
 

993
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,590
boom here
pop

pop
 

995
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,289
pop
every every resistance every strength he

996
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:36,299
every every resistance every strength he
 

997
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:38,950
every every resistance every strength he
does I ground

998
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:38,960
does I ground
 

999
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,010
does I ground
