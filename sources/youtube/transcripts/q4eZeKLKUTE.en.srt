133
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,420
understand
in tactics if your understanding of yen

134
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:23,430
in tactics if your understanding of yen
 

135
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,390
in tactics if your understanding of yen
is weakness

136
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:25,400
is weakness
 

137
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,670
is weakness
it's absolutely you're going to be 100%

138
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:28,680
it's absolutely you're going to be 100%
 

139
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,740
it's absolutely you're going to be 100%
off the market this is a

140
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:30,750
off the market this is a
 

141
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,400
off the market this is a
misunderstanding

142
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:33,410

 

143
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,840

so yen has its power and it's made more

144
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:38,850
so yen has its power and it's made more
 

145
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,690
so yen has its power and it's made more
powerful by young and inverse the

146
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:41,700
powerful by young and inverse the
 

147
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,280
powerful by young and inverse the
inverse is true as well

148
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,290
inverse is true as well
 

149
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,130
inverse is true as well
Young has his power and it's made more

150
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:46,140
Young has his power and it's made more
 

151
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,140
Young has his power and it's made more
powerful but again not not weak so we

152
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,150
powerful but again not not weak so we
 

153
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,140
powerful but again not not weak so we
just want to say okay I got to be strong

154
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,150
just want to say okay I got to be strong
 

155
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,150
just want to say okay I got to be strong
because I got to train and I got a deal

156
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
because I got to train and I got a deal

stronger is going to have me be able to

164
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,150
stronger is going to have me be able to
 

165
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,170
stronger is going to have me be able to
endure that beating longer and have me

166
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:15,180
endure that beating longer and have me
 

167
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,740
endure that beating longer and have me
heal faster and that gives me more time

168
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:18,750
heal faster and that gives me more time
 

169
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,230
heal faster and that gives me more time
on the math and that allows me to

170
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,240
on the math and that allows me to
 

171
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,990
on the math and that allows me to
advance so you have to be stronger but

172
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,000
advance so you have to be stronger but
 

173
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,750
advance so you have to be stronger but
