think

10
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440
think
 

11
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,910
think
is that it's going to go like this in

12
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:16,920
is that it's going to go like this in
 

13
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,790
is that it's going to go like this in
some way so sometimes you have some ukas

14
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
some way so sometimes you have some ukas
 

15
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,589
some way so sometimes you have some ukas
that will slide

16
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:22,599
that will slide
 

17
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:25,429
that will slide
under okay and then sometimes you have

18
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
under okay and then sometimes you have
 

19
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,669
under okay and then sometimes you have
ukas like if this had a hinge here and

20
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:28,679
ukas like if this had a hinge here and
 

21
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,509
ukas like if this had a hinge here and
this top part goes like this they Bend

22
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
this top part goes like this they Bend
 

23
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,110
this top part goes like this they Bend
backwards okay at at the back and then

24
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
backwards okay at at the back and then
 

25
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,030
backwards okay at at the back and then
they go B they go backwards into the

26
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
they go B they go backwards into the
 

27
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,389
they go B they go backwards into the
back breakfall but either way uh if we

28
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
back breakfall but either way uh if we
 

29
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,310
back breakfall but either way uh if we
just look at the head

30
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
just look at the head
 

31
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,350
just look at the head
area uh it's going that way which in our

32
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:46,360
area uh it's going that way which in our
 

33
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,389
area uh it's going that way which in our
Dojo is east and then the head is

34
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
Dojo is east and then the head is
 

35
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,670
Dojo is east and then the head is
brought West okay in either way whether

36
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
brought West okay in either way whether
 

37
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,150
brought West okay in either way whether
the feet keep going or whether it bends

38
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
the feet keep going or whether it bends
 

39
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,270
the feet keep going or whether it bends
here and then they do the step back back

40
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,280
here and then they do the step back back
 

41
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,270
here and then they do the step back back
break fall whatever none of that stuff

42
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
break fall whatever none of that stuff
 

43
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,270
break fall whatever none of that stuff
is what we want to do because they're

44
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:06,280
is what we want to do because they're
 

45
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,390
is what we want to do because they're
coming from west to east and we pushing

46
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:09,400
coming from west to east and we pushing
 

47
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,710
coming from west to east and we pushing
that head back from east to west so

48
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:11,720
that head back from east to west so
 

49
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,230
that head back from east to west so
that's a y young Clash so if uh this is

50
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
that's a y young Clash so if uh this is
 

51
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,469
that's a y young Clash so if uh this is
where the heaven arm would be what we

52
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:19,479
where the heaven arm would be what we
 

53
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,950
where the heaven arm would be what we
want to do

54
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
want to do
 

55
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
want to do
instead is we know for the head to

56
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,280
instead is we know for the head to
 

57
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,830
instead is we know for the head to
go

58
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
go
 

59
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,030
go
from back to West then it has to be

60
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,040
from back to West then it has to be
 

61
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,630
from back to West then it has to be
brought on that Circle the kagay circle

brought on that Circle the kagay circle
so that it's forward inertia is

64
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:36,840
so that it's forward inertia is
 

65
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,030
so that it's forward inertia is
maintained you you have to do that in

66
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
maintained you you have to do that in
 

67
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,149
maintained you you have to do that in
every technique any technique where

68

00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,950
there's a back breakfall there's this

little yield here um I've come to this
 

73
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,389
little yield here um I've come to this
is a yid yield but I've come to actually

does all the time okay you're going to

80
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
does all the time okay you're going to
 

81
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,429
does all the time okay you're going to
go this way you make that little Loop

82
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:04,439
go this way you make that little Loop
 

83
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,870
go this way you make that little Loop
and now you come this

84
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
and now you come this
 

85
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,110
and now you come this
way then your hip goes in here and this

86
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
way then your hip goes in here and this
 

87
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,110
way then your hip goes in here and this
part starts to now ful them around this

88
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,120
part starts to now ful them around this
 

89
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,869
part starts to now ful them around this
way and as the feet are

90
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:17,879
way and as the feet are
 

91
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,790
way and as the feet are
lifting the head is getting light so the

92
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
lifting the head is getting light so the
 

93
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,309
lifting the head is getting light so the
head we know is going down but I'm not

94
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:23,319
head we know is going down but I'm not
 

95
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,589
head we know is going down but I'm not
actually throwing it down it's more I

96
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
actually throwing it down it's more I
 

97
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,470
actually throwing it down it's more I
pick the feet up and I help pick the

98
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
pick the feet up and I help pick the
 

99
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,830
pick the feet up and I help pick the
feet up by moving the head this way and

100
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
feet up by moving the head this way and
 

101
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,150
feet up by moving the head this way and
then eventually that head Falls over on

102
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
then eventually that head Falls over on
 

103
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,990
then eventually that head Falls over on
this side head is going forward it's

104
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,000
this side head is going forward it's
 

105
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,509
this side head is going forward it's
going to do that

106
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:38,519
going to do that
 

107
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,910
going to do that
c on the head now the forward inertia is

108
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
c on the head now the forward inertia is
 

109
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,470
c on the head now the forward inertia is
going rearward okay then I got to get

110
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:45,480
going rearward okay then I got to get
 

111
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,589
going rearward okay then I got to get
weight off the feet and so I bring the

112
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:48,599
weight off the feet and so I bring the
 

113
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,670
weight off the feet and so I bring the
head this way with my hip over here the

114
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
head this way with my hip over here the
 

115
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,949
head this way with my hip over here the
head goes this way the feet go that way

116
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959
head goes this way the feet go that way
 

117
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,309
head goes this way the feet go that way
and the feet start to lower the head and

118
00:02:57,309 --> 00:02:57,319
and the feet start to lower the head and
 

119
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:30,070
and the feet start to lower the head and
the guy falls down okay just around

120
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080

 

121
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,080
