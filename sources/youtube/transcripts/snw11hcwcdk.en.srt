00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,040
Thank you for waiting.

2
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:44,080
Now, the 2016 edition of the Kagamibiraki ceremony of the Aikikai foundation will begin.

3
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:52,400
We will begin by a speech by Aikido Doshu, Ueshiba Moriteru.

4
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,360
Happy new year everybody.

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,180
I am very grateful to see that so many people gathered today

6
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,200
to celebrate together this Kagamibiraki of the Aikikai Hombu Dojo.

7
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,960
From the bottom of my heart, I wish to thank you very much.

8
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,120
It is generally accepted that Aikido has been going for 60 years.

9
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:36,460
Since then, Aikido has spread tremendously and it is now present in 130 countries.

10
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:44,240
Of course, it is the pursuit of the dynamic created by the founder Morihei Ueshiba

11
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,300
and continued by the second Doshu, Kisshomaru Ueshiba,

12
00:01:48,460 --> 00:02:00,040
supported by your sincerity in practice, which has allowed the creation of such harmony.

13
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:08,400
From now also, I want to continue this great feeling of Aikido for the ages to come.

14
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,200
Take advantage of the spirit of Aikido

15
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,820
to contribute in enhancing oneself and society.

16
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:24,260
To do this, we must appreciate everyday's practice.

17
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,420
I want this approach to Aikido practice to continue this year.

18
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,420
Thank you very much.
