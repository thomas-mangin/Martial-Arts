1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:08,310

my level I'm

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,320

 

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:23,230

oning

4
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,240

 

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,589

on when the person to do

6
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:28,599
on when the person to do
 

7
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:31,470
on when the person to do
something that

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:31,480
something that
 

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,430
something that
so you can't mechanically work out so

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
so you can't mechanically work out so
 

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,030
so you can't mechanically work out so
all the stages you're going to go

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
all the stages you're going to go
 

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,590
all the stages you're going to go
through you will get better and better

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
through you will get better and better
 

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,790
through you will get better and better
and better

16
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
and better
 

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,069
and better
technique so you we start going up and

18
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
technique so you we start going up and
 

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,430
technique so you we start going up and
then coming down a bit close I push

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
then coming down a bit close I push
 

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,750
then coming down a bit close I push
myself

22
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:48,760
myself
 

23
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,990
myself
away and if I was a bit more clumsy i'

24
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000
away and if I was a bit more clumsy i'
 

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,310
away and if I was a bit more clumsy i'
push J and I would go away until until

26
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
push J and I would go away until until
 

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,310
push J and I would go away until until
go away and so we go through all these

28
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,320
go away and so we go through all these
 

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,349
go away and so we go through all these
different

30
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:57,359
different
 

31
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:09,429
different
phases until

32
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439

 

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,950

means that Jenny doesn't know what angle

34
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
means that Jenny doesn't know what angle
 

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,230
means that Jenny doesn't know what angle
I'm working she'll think I'm actually

36
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
I'm working she'll think I'm actually
 

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,149
I'm working she'll think I'm actually
working at this angle that's where she's

38
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
working at this angle that's where she's
 

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,630
working at this angle that's where she's
pushing I'm actually working

40
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:25,640

 

41
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,670

towards yeah I'm nearly used to your

42
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:28,680
towards yeah I'm nearly used to your
 

43
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,910
towards yeah I'm nearly used to your
name we come together I come here even

44
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
name we come together I come here even
 

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,749
name we come together I come here even
I'm

46
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759

 

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,670

coming first did right so I I added that

48
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
coming first did right so I I added that
 

49
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,749
coming first did right so I I added that
in

50
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:42,759
in
 

51
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,910
in
there so just by thinking of

52
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920

 

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,190

La so until you react you won't feel a

54
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:52,200
La so until you react you won't feel a
 

55
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,109
La so until you react you won't feel a
Direction but it's

56
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
Direction but it's
 

57
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,550
Direction but it's
it's but you know

58
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:01,560

 

59
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,149

or you break you break the so last time

60
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
or you break you break the so last time
 

61
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,309
or you break you break the so last time
you weren't all here but last

62
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:09,319
you weren't all here but last
 

63
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:12,110
you weren't all here but last
time

64
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,120
time
 

65
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,990
time
here so I'm going to come here and

66
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
here so I'm going to come here and
 

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,990
here so I'm going to come here and
here's

68
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
here's
 

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,790
here's
my I'm to come here and I'm I got

70
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:23,800
my I'm to come here and I'm I got
 

71
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,030
my I'm to come here and I'm I got
straight on if I come in too

72
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
straight on if I come in too
 

73
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,070
straight on if I come in too
quick then it's a block

74
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
quick then it's a block
 

75
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,550
quick then it's a block
so what I've got to do is I've actually

76
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:31,560
so what I've got to do is I've actually
 

77
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:46,110
so what I've got to do is I've actually
got

78
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,120

 

79
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:53,750

go this is what we

80
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760

 

81
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,830

call this what you're looking for you're

82
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
call this what you're looking for you're
 

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,430
call this what you're looking for you're
looking this

84
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:00,440

 

85
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,350

and the key is not to bring it

86
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:04,360
and the key is not to bring it
 

87
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,589
and the key is not to bring it
in to give it

88
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
in to give it
 

89
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,430
in to give it
out

90
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
out
 

91
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,990
out
so don't do this and then bring it

92
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,000

 

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,070

in that's the difference between

94
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
in that's the difference between
 

95
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,630
in that's the difference between
using come here take it out to the

96
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:23,640

 

97
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,149

wall has a different feeling on my

98
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:27,159
wall has a different feeling on my
 

99
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,149
wall has a different feeling on my
partner it's

100
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
partner it's
 

101
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,910
partner it's
it could

102
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:36,920

 

103
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,710

be it can be called lots of things the

104
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
be it can be called lots of things the
 

105
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,550
be it can be called lots of things the
the action is

106
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
the action is
 

107
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:53,509
the action is
Road said all techniques become

108
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519

 

109
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,710

Road and then from here my hand turn it

110
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
Road and then from here my hand turn it
 

111
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,429
Road and then from here my hand turn it
this way

112
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:00,439
this way
 

113
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,350
this way
see my hand

114
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:02,360
see my hand
 

115
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,789
see my hand
spiral the spiral

116
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:05,799
spiral the spiral
 

117
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,519
spiral the spiral
is the spiral ends
