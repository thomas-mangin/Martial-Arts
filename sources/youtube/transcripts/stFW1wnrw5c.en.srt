147
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,070

his elbow is still going that way

148
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080

 

149
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,110

well my face is attacking his face
 

151
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,790
well my face is attacking his face
so i let the elbow go around me and i

152
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
so i let the elbow go around me and i
 

153
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,829
so i let the elbow go around me and i
attack his face

154
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
attack his face
 

155
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,990
attack his face
instead that's not possible in this

156
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,389
instead that's not possible in this
what he was aversion you can't

163
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,870

so anytime his arm goes parallel around

164
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
so anytime his arm goes parallel around
 

165
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,230
so anytime his arm goes parallel around
this elbow has not been made yen

166
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
this elbow has not been made yen
 

167
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,750
this elbow has not been made yen
not by the prescribed attack

168
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
not by the prescribed attack
 

169
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,110
not by the prescribed attack
a choreographed bouquet will do it

170
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
a choreographed bouquet will do it
 

171
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,110
a choreographed bouquet will do it
but that's not the art okay

172
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
but that's not the art okay
 

173
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,110
but that's not the art okay
so when my arm his arm is parallel

174
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
so when my arm his arm is parallel
 

175
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,550
so when my arm his arm is parallel
and the elbow came in like this you see

176
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
and the elbow came in like this you see
 

177
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,389
and the elbow came in like this you see
it's always going to be the hand

178
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
it's always going to be the hand
 

179
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,550
it's always going to be the hand
that's pushing on his mouse okay

180
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
that's pushing on his mouse okay
 

181
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,630
that's pushing on his mouse okay
and in this case his elbow is pushing on

182
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
and in this case his elbow is pushing on
 

183
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,470
and in this case his elbow is pushing on
me so it's a yang and yang clash

184
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
me so it's a yang and yang clash

this place not to come in

200
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
this place not to come in
 

201
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,630
this place not to come in
and then turn

202
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640

 

203
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,230

so the second his hand moves my

204
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
so the second his hand moves my
 

205
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,790
so the second his hand moves my
hand this way and my arm is parallel you

206
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
hand this way and my arm is parallel you
 

207
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,910
hand this way and my arm is parallel you
can use it

208

can use it
 

209
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,590
can use it
as a sign that there's a clash thing

210
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
as a sign that there's a clash thing
 

211
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,069
as a sign that there's a clash thing
okay if the hand is parallel he's going

212
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
okay if the hand is parallel he's going
 

213
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,350
okay if the hand is parallel he's going
to need the elbow

214
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
to need the elbow
 

215
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,910
to need the elbow
to do it or i'm going to be the one to

216
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
to do it or i'm going to be the one to
 

217
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,350
to do it or i'm going to be the one to
reconcile the clutch

218
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
reconcile the clutch
 

219
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,790
reconcile the clutch
which is not right so what we're doing

220
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
which is not right so what we're doing
 

221
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,230
which is not right so what we're doing
instead

222
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
instead
 

223
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,670
instead
is having him land with his

224
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
is having him land with his
 

225
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,790
is having him land with his
his energy on this

226
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
his energy on this
 

227
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,910
his energy on this
if you look at his forearm it's

228
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
if you look at his forearm it's
 

229
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,110
if you look at his forearm it's
vertical you see

230
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
vertical you see
 

231
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,269
vertical you see
not parallel to the ground

232
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
not parallel to the ground
 

233
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,949
not parallel to the ground
but his energy is going here around the

234
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
but his energy is going here around the
 

235
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,790
but his energy is going here around the
corner

236
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
corner
 

237
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,069
corner
and let that hit the ground

238
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
and let that hit the ground
 

239
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,670
and let that hit the ground
boom here

240
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680

 

241
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,190

so it's going around and

242
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200

 

243
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,310

around and

244
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
around and
 

245
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,150
around and
but in the aikido way

246
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
but in the aikido way
 

247
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,269
but in the aikido way
so i'm not projecting he is hitting the

248
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
so i'm not projecting he is hitting the
 

249
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,630
so i'm not projecting he is hitting the
ground

250
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
ground
 

251
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:24,310
ground
not me pushing him away he comes in

252
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320

 

253
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,350

not here around you see that difference

254
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
not here around you see that difference
 

255
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:39,350
not here around you see that difference
he goes in

256
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360

 

257
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:54,829

okay just to there

258
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:54,839

 

259

let's go uh
i have one skill set here

264
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
i have one skill set here
 

265
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,110
i have one skill set here
my next skill set is going to be

266
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
my next skill set is going to be
 

267
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,069
my next skill set is going to be
developed

268
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:18,079
developed
 

269

00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
on this yin blend
 

271
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,750
on this yin blend
but it's happening in a twerking motion

272
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
but it's happening in a twerking motion
