when you let your hand go here
you see and you collapsed that aren't

you see and you collapsed that aren't
 

319
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,790
you see and you collapsed that aren't
that arms collapsed it's not that it's

close to you that's not what makes it
 

323
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,410
close to you that's not what makes it
collapse is that you separated it from

324
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:24,420
collapse is that you separated it from
 

325
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,650
collapse is that you separated it from
your tandem field and now the adhesion

326

your tandem field and now the adhesion
 

327
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,829
your tandem field and now the adhesion
is on your body do you see that and so

328
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:30,839
is on your body do you see that and so
 

329
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,069
is on your body do you see that and so
what you did is you tried to push on it

330
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
what you did is you tried to push on it
 

331
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,050
what you did is you tried to push on it
and you're we're not going anywhere okay

so again you're here generate the field

so again you're here generate the field
 

335
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:41,329
so again you're here generate the field
you feel the field okay so I can come

336
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:41,339
you feel the field okay so I can come
 

337
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,730
you feel the field okay so I can come
back here do you see anything push on it

338
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:43,740
back here do you see anything push on it
 

339
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,490
back here do you see anything push on it
and I can still move you

340
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:46,500
and I can still move you
 

341
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,610
and I can still move you
you see I don't I don't want to go

342
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:51,620
you see I don't I don't want to go
 

343
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,949
you see I don't I don't want to go
collapse and then try to get back off of

there there's no need for that okay and
 

347
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,910
there there's no need for that okay and
that's what you did is when you felt

348
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:58,920
that's what you did is when you felt
 

349
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,490
that's what you did is when you felt
that it collapsed it freaked you out and

350

that it collapsed it freaked you out and
 

351
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,269
that it collapsed it freaked you out and
you try to push on it okay but instead

357
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,530

where'd it go

358
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:12,540
where'd it go
 

359
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,190
where'd it go
let's let it collapse again and you go

360
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:16,200
let's let it collapse again and you go
 

361
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,170
let's let it collapse again and you go
I know I don't give it back to you

because I would have to take my Tom
 

365
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,569
because I would have to take my Tom
denfield off okay so you collapsed again

366
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:23,579
denfield off okay so you collapsed again
 

367
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,090
denfield off okay so you collapsed again
where you take this arm out I don't turn

368
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:26,100
where you take this arm out I don't turn
 

369

okay so making making stuff like this

372
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
okay so making making stuff like this
 

373
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:41,290
okay so making making stuff like this
let's go that way making this stuff

374
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:41,300

 

375
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,970

do you see that okay

376
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:43,980
do you see that okay
 

377
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,430
do you see that okay
oh and uh

378
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:46,440
oh and uh
 

379
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,930
oh and uh

can do the technique from Lucas point

392
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:06,420
can do the technique from Lucas point
 

393
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,889
can do the technique from Lucas point
okay

394
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:09,899

 

395
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:13,190

which is the rotating of my taunted

400
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:17,579
which is the rotating of my taunted
 

401
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,690
which is the rotating of my taunted
fields on that rotating cross pattern

402
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:19,700
fields on that rotating cross pattern
 

403
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,610
fields on that rotating cross pattern
but from the yin point of view you're

404
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:22,620
but from the yin point of view you're
 

405
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:29,150
but from the yin point of view you're
gonna rotate

406
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,160

 

407
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,670

you're so you're just leaning to me

408
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
you're so you're just leaning to me
 

409
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,050
you're so you're just leaning to me
that's all you're doing you're leaning

410
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,060
that's all you're doing you're leaning
 

411
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,850
that's all you're doing you're leaning
me leaning me you see leaning me

412
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:37,860
me leaning me you see leaning me
 

413
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,009
me leaning me you see leaning me
and then the battery there will turn

414
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:40,019
and then the battery there will turn
 

415
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,730
and then the battery there will turn
themselves exactly

416
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:43,740

 

417
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,850

but you want to hold the relationship

418
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:46,860
but you want to hold the relationship
 

419
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,629
but you want to hold the relationship
so I'll lean you if I want to but then I

420
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
so I'll lean you if I want to but then I
 

421
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,750
so I'll lean you if I want to but then I
have to rotate it I have to rotate it my

422
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
have to rotate it I have to rotate it my
 

423
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,850
have to rotate it I have to rotate it my
field rotates then your field rotates to

424
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:55,860
field rotates then your field rotates to
 

425
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,629
field rotates then your field rotates to
see

426
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
see
 

427
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,269
see
it's not it's not about my hands because

428
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
it's not it's not about my hands because
 

429
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,190
it's not it's not about my hands because
that's you're doing your hands but

430
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,200
that's you're doing your hands but
 

431
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,410
that's you're doing your hands but
you're just taking the time Midfield

432
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:03,420
you're just taking the time Midfield
 

433
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,530
you're just taking the time Midfield
back in and out so my condent has to

434
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:06,540
back in and out so my condent has to
 

435
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,970
back in and out so my condent has to
rotate oh

436
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:10,980

 

437
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,769

see if you can feel it okay oh wrong I'm

438
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:15,779
see if you can feel it okay oh wrong I'm
 

439
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:26,269
see if you can feel it okay oh wrong I'm
gonna just jiggle it okay

440
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:26,279

 

441
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,009

oh
