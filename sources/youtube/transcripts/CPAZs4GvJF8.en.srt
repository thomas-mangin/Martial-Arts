00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,370

you may have your own store cushions

10
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:19,380
you may have your own store cushions

you may have your own store cushions
or a place where you can sit

you may have decided to make a small
part designated in one of your wounds

00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
part designated in one of your wounds
 

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,970
part designated in one of your wounds
in your house apartment

18
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:34,980
in your house apartment
 

19
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,470
in your house apartment
or

20
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
or
 

21
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:45,709
or
out in nature

22
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:45,719

 

23
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,170

when I build my first dojo in 1982.

24
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:51,180

 

25
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,850

before meeting cytosity

26
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:55,860

 

27
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,209

I did believe a lot in

28
00:00:59,209 --> 00:00:59,219
I did believe a lot in
 

29
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:06,050
I did believe a lot in
the desire to find peace for myself

30
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,060

 

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,490

I've grown up with a very troubled mind

32
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:09,500
I've grown up with a very troubled mind
 

33
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,670
I've grown up with a very troubled mind
and I don't know why it's so troubled

34
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
and I don't know why it's so troubled
 

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,550
and I don't know why it's so troubled
I think it's because

36
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
I think it's because
 

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,130
I think it's because
I want more

38
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,140
I want more
 

39
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,870
I want more
than what is available

40
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:23,880

 

41
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,390

and I always wanted

42
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
and I always wanted
 

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,149
and I always wanted
in a hurry

44
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:29,159
in a hurry
 

45
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,070
in a hurry
what I did back then

46
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:34,080

 

47
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,870

so I didn't have time for meditation

48
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
so I didn't have time for meditation
 

49
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,109
so I didn't have time for meditation
Charles work

50
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:42,119

 

51
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,810

and even now

52
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:44,820
and even now
 

53
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,490
and even now

54
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:46,500

50 years on

56
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:48,780
50 years on
 

57
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,149
50 years on
yes it's 50 years old now

58
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:53,159

 

59
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,850

I'm still in the hungry

60
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:55,860
I'm still in the hungry
 

61
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,350
I'm still in the hungry
we hope we change but

62
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,360

 

63
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,230

some parts though some parts we've

64
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,240
some parts though some parts we've
 

65
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,969
some parts though some parts we've
become wiser for

66
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:07,979

 

67
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,210

but this is My Sanctuary

68
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,220
but this is My Sanctuary
 

69
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,150
but this is My Sanctuary
and I hope in these meditations it

70
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
and I hope in these meditations it
 

71
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,250
and I hope in these meditations it
becomes your sanctuary as well

72
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:19,260

 

73
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,890

try not to

74
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:21,900
try not to
 

75
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,750
try not to
bed like me and spend most of your life

76
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:26,760
bed like me and spend most of your life
 

77
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,710
bed like me and spend most of your life
having a troubled mind

78
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720

 

79
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,210

because

80
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:32,220
because
 

81
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,390
because
we feed this troubled mind rather than

82
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:35,400
we feed this troubled mind rather than
 

83
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,949
we feed this troubled mind rather than
accept that we haven't traveled behind

84
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:39,959
accept that we haven't traveled behind
 

85
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,949
accept that we haven't traveled behind
we may find that it was our upbringing

86
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
we may find that it was our upbringing
 

87
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,229
we may find that it was our upbringing
we may put it down to all sorts of

88
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:45,239
we may put it down to all sorts of
 

89
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,030
we may put it down to all sorts of
things

90
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
things
 

91
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,150
things
but when we are perhaps down

92
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
but when we are perhaps down
 

93
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,930
but when we are perhaps down
or as I say have a troubled mind a busy

94
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:53,940
or as I say have a troubled mind a busy
 

95
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,190
or as I say have a troubled mind a busy
mind

96
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,200

 

97
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,390

trying to know that it will pass

98
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400

 

99
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,050

and you can help it pass by taking time

100
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:06,060
and you can help it pass by taking time
 

101
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,369
and you can help it pass by taking time
out

102
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:07,379
out
 

103
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,390
out
and sit in meditation

104
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:11,400
and sit in meditation
 

105
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,729
and sit in meditation
or once you go a little bit deeper than

106
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:13,739
or once you go a little bit deeper than
 

107
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,070
or once you go a little bit deeper than
meditation as with the bowel

108
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,080

 

109
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,809

then

110
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:20,819
then
 

111
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,770
then
you go into what I call trials where you

112
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:24,780
you go into what I call trials where you
 

113
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,869
you go into what I call trials where you
don't feel your body

114
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
don't feel your body
 

115
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,990
don't feel your body
physically anymore and yet you know

116
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
physically anymore and yet you know
 

117
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,330
physically anymore and yet you know
you're sitting there

118
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:32,340
you're sitting there
 

119
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,830
you're sitting there
it's almost you could say hypnotherapy

120
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
it's almost you could say hypnotherapy
 

121
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,930
it's almost you could say hypnotherapy
on yourself and

122
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:41,940

 

123
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,050

trying to beat yourself up

124
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,060
trying to beat yourself up
 

125
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,070
trying to beat yourself up
that you are because people don't

126
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
that you are because people don't
 

127
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,009
that you are because people don't
consider themselves as a really good

128
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:52,019
consider themselves as a really good
 

129
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,970
consider themselves as a really good
person they spend more time

130
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:55,980
person they spend more time
 

131
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,470
person they spend more time
thinking

132
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:57,480
thinking
 

133
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,130
thinking
that they are a bad person or perhaps

134
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,140
that they are a bad person or perhaps
 

135
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,589
that they are a bad person or perhaps
that's just me

136
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
that's just me
 

137
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,910
that's just me
let's

138
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:04,920
let's
 

139
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:11,470
let's
get down to the meditation for today

140
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:11,480

 

141
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,869

mentally Place yourself in on the stall

142
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
mentally Place yourself in on the stall
 

143
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,390
mentally Place yourself in on the stall
in front of us

144
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:17,400
in front of us
 

145
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,370
in front of us
or

146
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:19,380
or
 

147
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,590
or
comfortable place in your own home

148
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:24,600
comfortable place in your own home
 

149
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,909
comfortable place in your own home
or as I said out in nature

150
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:28,919
or as I said out in nature
 

151
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,490
or as I said out in nature
in the early days

152
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:31,500
in the early days
 

153
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,210
in the early days
in 1982 83

154
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,220
in 1982 83
 

155
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,890
in 1982 83
I used to find

156
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:36,900
I used to find
 

157
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,249
I used to find
down by the river a wonderful large tree

158
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:43,259

 

159
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,490

and this is the meditation I can talk

160
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:46,500
and this is the meditation I can talk
 

161
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,570
and this is the meditation I can talk
about to you today

162
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:50,580

 

163
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,150

so first of all when you're ready

164
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,160
so first of all when you're ready
 

165
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:07,850
so first of all when you're ready
calm yourself close your eyes

166
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:07,860

 

167
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,030

mean that you have to clear your throats

168
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:11,040
mean that you have to clear your throats
 

169
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,550
mean that you have to clear your throats
or have a sip of water that is close by

170
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
or have a sip of water that is close by
 

171
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,129
or have a sip of water that is close by
there's always a good thing

172
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:19,139
there's always a good thing
 

173
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,990
there's always a good thing
because the mouth

174
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,000
because the mouth
 

175
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,330
because the mouth
can get dry

176
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:23,340
can get dry
 

177
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:32,810
can get dry
and disturb your time and meditation

178
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:32,820

 

179
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,510

so once you're relaxed with your eyes

180
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
so once you're relaxed with your eyes
 

181
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,450
so once you're relaxed with your eyes
closed

00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:51,050

any time we wish to be on this journey

546
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,060

 

547
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,629

552
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:57,420
take the pieces
 

553
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,730
take the pieces
back

554
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:58,740
back
 

555
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:05,030
back
to the gate

556
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,040

 

557
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,669

voice

564
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:23,699

 

565
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,990

when you go to the gate

566
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,000
when you go to the gate
 

567
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,810
when you go to the gate
and goes past through the other side of

568
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:29,820
and goes past through the other side of
 

569
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,010

571
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,370

back onto the stone or wherever you are

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,549
decided
to sit

576
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:43,559

 

577
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,970

just with you immensely being

578
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:46,980

581
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,490

with an outward breath when you're ready

582
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:52,500
with an outward breath when you're ready
 

583
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,010
with an outward breath when you're ready
open your eyes

584
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:55,020
open your eyes
 

585
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,549
open your eyes
and bring yourself back into the room

586
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:57,559
and bring yourself back into the room
 

587
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,010
and bring yourself back into the room
either here in the dojo

588
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,020
either here in the dojo
 

589
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,669

00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:26,390
all back at your own
environment

592
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,400

 

593
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,930

this visualization

594
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:29,940

 

595
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,160
