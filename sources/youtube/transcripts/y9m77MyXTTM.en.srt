00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,430

let me context

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:04,440
let me context
 

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,070
let me context
the contextualize the what we're going

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
the contextualize the what we're going
 

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,870
the contextualize the what we're going
to do and what we've been doing uh

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
to do and what we've been doing uh
 

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,350
to do and what we've been doing uh
lately like you you guys are you're in

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:14,360
lately like you you guys are you're in
 

9
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,150
lately like you you guys are you're in
the middle to the bottom and the skill

10
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:17,160
the middle to the bottom and the skill
 

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,710
the middle to the bottom and the skill
development right and um you've been

12
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,720
development right and um you've been
 

13
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,029
development right and um you've been
dominating in terms of majority like

14
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
dominating in terms of majority like
 

15
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,109
dominating in terms of majority like
who's here what's the bul of the class

16
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:26,119
who's here what's the bul of the class
 

17
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,950
who's here what's the bul of the class
okay so we're really personalizing it

18
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:29,960
okay so we're really personalizing it
 

19
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,069
okay so we're really personalizing it
towards you you also have your knee

20
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
towards you you also have your knee
 

21
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,430
towards you you also have your knee
problems right and so

22
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:34,440
problems right and so
 

23
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,470
problems right and so
we're doing things you could do okay I

24
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
we're doing things you could do okay I
 

25
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,190
we're doing things you could do okay I
think first of all you guys should pay

26
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,200
think first of all you guys should pay
 

27
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,510
think first of all you guys should pay
attention to

28
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
attention to
 

29
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,549
attention to
that um and be aware of that for you A

30
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
that um and be aware of that for you A
 

31
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,590
that um and be aware of that for you A
lot of the stuff is intuitive like you

32
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:48,600
lot of the stuff is intuitive like you
 

33
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,830
lot of the stuff is intuitive like you
just grew up in it and you kind of just

34
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:52,840
just grew up in it and you kind of just
 

35
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,470
just grew up in it and you kind of just
and it's probably the best way of

36
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
and it's probably the best way of
 

37
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,349
and it's probably the best way of
training but it won't be the best way of

38
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:57,359
training but it won't be the best way of
 

39
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,670
training but it won't be the best way of
teaching okay and so what I'm giving

40
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:00,680
teaching okay and so what I'm giving
 

41
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,550
teaching okay and so what I'm giving
you is um the concepts behind why you do

42
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:07,560
you is um the concepts behind why you do
 

43
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,270
you is um the concepts behind why you do
things the way you do which you'll need

44
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
things the way you do which you'll need
 

45
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,590
things the way you do which you'll need
to teach people okay because most people

46
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:12,600
to teach people okay because most people
 

47
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,710
to teach people okay because most people
obviously they can't do just by watching

48
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
obviously they can't do just by watching
 

49
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,710
obviously they can't do just by watching
everything gets filtered and

50
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
everything gets filtered and
 

51
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,390
everything gets filtered and
changes and that's kind of what happened

52
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:21,400
changes and that's kind of what happened
 

53
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,109
changes and that's kind of what happened
and why it will be helpful to you to

54
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:24,119
and why it will be helpful to you to
 

55
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,950
and why it will be helpful to you to
return to the basics because when you

56
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:25,960
return to the basics because when you
 

57
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,830
return to the basics because when you
first got them you changed them ever so

58
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:28,840
first got them you changed them ever so
 

59
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,590
first got them you changed them ever so
slightly

60
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:30,600
slightly
 

61
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,230
slightly
um and in and done so in a way that they

62
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:35,240
um and in and done so in a way that they
 

63
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,350
um and in and done so in a way that they
make it difficult for you to get to the

64
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,360
make it difficult for you to get to the
 

65
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,310
make it difficult for you to get to the
higher levels Okay the reason for this

66
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,320
higher levels Okay the reason for this
 

67
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,310
higher levels Okay the reason for this
is is that concentric nature between

68
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
is is that concentric nature between
 

69
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,630
is is that concentric nature between
things right so you have a kind of uh

70
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
things right so you have a kind of uh
 

71
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,109
things right so you have a kind of uh
let's just call it character for the the

72
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
let's just call it character for the the
 

73
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,190
let's just call it character for the the
beginning here uh the ability to receive

74
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,200
beginning here uh the ability to receive
 

75
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,950
beginning here uh the ability to receive
something purely without any filtration

76
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
something purely without any filtration
 

77
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,190
something purely without any filtration
right is a kind of release of self do

78
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,200
right is a kind of release of self do
 

79
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,670
right is a kind of release of self do
you see that and ultimately where you're

80
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:02,680
you see that and ultimately where you're
 

81
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,270
you see that and ultimately where you're
headed is a release of self so when we

82
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:06,280
headed is a release of self so when we
 

83
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,190
headed is a release of self so when we
filter something at the beginning we're

84
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,200
filter something at the beginning we're
 

85
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,990
filter something at the beginning we're
not releasing self in some ways it's

86
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,000
not releasing self in some ways it's
 

87
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,430
not releasing self in some ways it's
going to be

88
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:12,440
going to be
 

89
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,949
going to be
antithetical uh to whatever you're doing

90
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
antithetical uh to whatever you're doing
 

91
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,070
antithetical uh to whatever you're doing
and then at a certain point it will be

92
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,080
and then at a certain point it will be
 

93
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,509
and then at a certain point it will be
antithetical to such a degree that you

94
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:19,519
antithetical to such a degree that you
 

95
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:22,070
antithetical to such a degree that you
now can't do this other thing okay so

96
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
now can't do this other thing okay so
 

97
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,070
now can't do this other thing okay so
we're going back and you're going to get

98
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,080
we're going back and you're going to get
 

99
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,670
we're going back and you're going to get
another chance at it okay so let's we're

100
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:28,680
another chance at it okay so let's we're
 

101
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,830
another chance at it okay so let's we're
going to work at test test iaki okay uh

102
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:32,840
going to work at test test iaki okay uh
 

103
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,430
going to work at test test iaki okay uh
a lot of times for example as you're

104
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
a lot of times for example as you're
 

105
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,790
a lot of times for example as you're
trying to ground let's just use that one

106
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
trying to ground let's just use that one
 

107
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,869
trying to ground let's just use that one
as you're trying to ground or root it

108
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:41,879
as you're trying to ground or root it
 

109
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,910
as you're trying to ground or root it
gets trapped in your shoulder and in

110
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
gets trapped in your shoulder and in
 

111
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,030
gets trapped in your shoulder and in
your bicep and while ultimately it

112
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,040
your bicep and while ultimately it
 

113
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,309
your bicep and while ultimately it
doesn't really matter what position your

114
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:51,319
doesn't really matter what position your
 

115
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:54,910
doesn't really matter what position your
arm is or what geometry your arm takes

116
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:54,920
arm is or what geometry your arm takes
 

117
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,949
arm is or what geometry your arm takes
it's very

118
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
it's very
 

119
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,110
it's very
difficult to get yourself in the

120
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
difficult to get yourself in the
 

121
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,750
difficult to get yourself in the
ballpark

122
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:00,760
ballpark
 

123
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,430
ballpark
with an arm geometry that is not

124
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:04,440
with an arm geometry that is not
 

125
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,030
with an arm geometry that is not
conducive towards getting in the

126
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,040
conducive towards getting in the
 

127
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,710
conducive towards getting in the
ballpark okay so we want to understand

128
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:09,720
ballpark okay so we want to understand
 

129
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,750
ballpark okay so we want to understand
how our arms move okay and why they move

130
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:12,760
how our arms move okay and why they move
 

131
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,589
how our arms move okay and why they move
that way all right how about we hand

132
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
that way all right how about we hand
 

133
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,350
that way all right how about we hand
that to and you could get your chair or

134
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
that to and you could get your chair or
 

135
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,430
that to and you could get your chair or
whatever so when I say you can do

136
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:22,440
whatever so when I say you can do
 

137
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,869
whatever so when I say you can do
whatever then you need to do whatever

138
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:25,879
whatever then you need to do whatever
 

139
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:29,470
whatever then you need to do whatever
okay my expectation is that you're not

140
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:29,480
okay my expectation is that you're not
 

141
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,630
okay my expectation is that you're not
going to beat yourself up in any way

142
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:33,640
going to beat yourself up in any way
 

143
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,550
going to beat yourself up in any way
emotionally mentally you're it's your

144
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
emotionally mentally you're it's your
 

145
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,429
emotionally mentally you're it's your
thing on

146
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:38,439
thing on
 

147
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,750
thing on
how left in or left out you feel

148
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:42,760
how left in or left out you feel
 

149
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,429
how left in or left out you feel
okay does that make sense

150
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:46,439
okay does that make sense
 

151
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,910
okay does that make sense
okay um and same thing you be

152
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:48,920
okay um and same thing you be
 

153
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,990
okay um and same thing you be
comfortable all

154
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,000
comfortable all
 

155
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,149
comfortable all
right

156
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159

 

157
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,670

um

158
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680
um
 

159
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,990
um
so in the

160
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,000
so in the
 

161
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,910
so in the
tabaki you know you have you have an

162
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
tabaki you know you have you have an
 

163
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,949
tabaki you know you have you have an
inward spiral and you you have your

164
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
inward spiral and you you have your
 

165
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,390
inward spiral and you you have your
outward spiral okay they kind of make

166
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:09,400
outward spiral okay they kind of make
 

167
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,589
outward spiral okay they kind of make
that heart shape and everything I do I

that my arms don't go up and down and
 

173
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,229
that my arms don't go up and down and
they don't go in and out okay I have my

they don't go in and out okay I have my
 

175
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,430
they don't go in and out okay I have my
inward

inward
 

177
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,110
inward
spiral and I have my outward

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,120

 

179
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,390

spiral even though I name it in and out

180
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,400
spiral even though I name it in and out
 

181
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,469
spiral even though I name it in and out
you you have to

182
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:33,479

 

183
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,670

understand that in those two movements

184
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:36,680
understand that in those two movements
 

185
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,510
understand that in those two movements
of the arm you will be able to be what

186
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:40,520
of the arm you will be able to be what
 

187
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,710
of the arm you will be able to be what
the inward spiral can work on its

188
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:43,720
the inward spiral can work on its
 

189
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,189
the inward spiral can work on its
outside as well as on its inside and

190
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
outside as well as on its inside and
 

191
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,390
outside as well as on its inside and
same thing goes for the outer spiral

192
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:49,400
same thing goes for the outer spiral
 

193
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,070
same thing goes for the outer spiral
okay like for example in the in the suto

194
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
okay like for example in the in the suto
 

195
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,270
okay like for example in the in the suto
kiten from last night you had an inward

00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
kiten from last night you had an inward
 

197
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,990
kiten from last night you had an inward
spiral but you were on the outside of

198
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,000
spiral but you were on the outside of
 

199
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,950
spiral but you were on the outside of
the arm and and that was really freaking

200
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
the arm and and that was really freaking
 

201
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,070
the arm and and that was really freaking
you guys out okay but remember the

202
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
you guys out okay but remember the
 

203
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,670
you guys out okay but remember the
ultimate aim of the art is that DST aim

204
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
ultimate aim of the art is that DST aim
 

205
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,189
ultimate aim of the art is that DST aim
of Jang ding which is a Reconciliation

206
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
of Jang ding which is a Reconciliation
 

207
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,150
of Jang ding which is a Reconciliation
of dichotomy so it doesn't make sense

208
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
of dichotomy so it doesn't make sense
 

209
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,350
of dichotomy so it doesn't make sense
that you would have an art that

210
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
that you would have an art that
 

211
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,309
that you would have an art that
ultimately goes in and out okay in and

212
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:18,319
ultimately goes in and out okay in and
 

213
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,270
ultimately goes in and out okay in and
out has to be able to become out and in

out has to be able to become out and in
 

215
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,550
out has to be able to become out and in

so I I have those two moves we're going

222
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:33,160
so I I have those two moves we're going
 

223
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,309

all the time is I now once I know how to
 

335
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,790
all the time is I now once I know how to
fuse it I can know how to release it

336
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:41,800
fuse it I can know how to release it
 

337
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,470
fuse it I can know how to release it
okay and that releasing is something you

338
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
okay and that releasing is something you
 

339
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,750
okay and that releasing is something you
always do in your Yin yields so recently

340
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
always do in your Yin yields so recently
 

341
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,269
always do in your Yin yields so recently
we did tenaga remember and Bo there was

342
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:52,279
we did tenaga remember and Bo there was
 

343
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,030
we did tenaga remember and Bo there was
my Yin yield on that arm going this way

here do you remember

348
00:08:59,949 --> 00:08:59,959
here do you remember
 

349
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,069
here do you remember
and I'm not going to go like this that's

350
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:03,079
and I'm not going to go like this that's
 

351
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:04,990
and I'm not going to go like this that's
going to hurt it I'm going to release

352
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,000
going to hurt it I'm going to release
 

353
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,030
going to hurt it I'm going to release
the shoulder release the shoulder okay

354
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
the shoulder release the shoulder okay
 

355
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,670
the shoulder release the shoulder okay
or in koku going this

00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:23,640
the shoulder boom and then they go
 

365
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,110
the shoulder boom and then they go
backwards okay so I want to learn how to

366
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,120
backwards okay so I want to learn how to
 

367
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,710
backwards okay so I want to learn how to
fuse it for integrity reasons

368

fuse it for integrity reasons
 

369
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,350
fuse it for integrity reasons
but I also want to know how to release

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
but I also want to know how to release
 

371
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,389
but I also want to know how to release
it for U iy strategies

373
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,750

okay if my elbow goes outside here you

374
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
okay if my elbow goes outside here you
 

375
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,670
okay if my elbow goes outside here you
can do this looks like an inward spiral

376
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:44,680
can do this looks like an inward spiral
 

377
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,710
can do this looks like an inward spiral
do you see that but it's not

378
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
do you see that but it's not
 

379
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,630
do you see that but it's not
accomplishing what I want okay in terms

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
accomplishing what I want okay in terms
 

381
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,310
accomplishing what I want okay in terms
of that shoulder Integrity so we have to

382
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:53,320
of that shoulder Integrity so we have to
 

383
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,310
of that shoulder Integrity so we have to
pay attention to these lines okay and

384
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
pay attention to these lines okay and
 

385
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,550
pay attention to these lines okay and
we're going to work with three levels

386
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
we're going to work with three levels
 

387
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,630
we're going to work with three levels
again in a Triune cosmology there's that

00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
again in a Triune cosmology there's that
 

389
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,430
again in a Triune cosmology there's that
three again we have

okay and I will transition between these

400
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:24,279
okay and I will transition between these
 

401
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,190
okay and I will transition between these
levels with either an inward spiral or

402
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:28,200
levels with either an inward spiral or
 

403
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,230
levels with either an inward spiral or
outward spiral or a combination of the

404
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
outward spiral or a combination of the
 

405
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,230
outward spiral or a combination of the
two which

406
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
two which
 

407
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,990
two which
means you don't do these differently

408
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
means you don't do these differently
 

409
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,509
means you don't do these differently
like Chiba Sensei did you just

410
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
like Chiba Sensei did you just
 

411
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,470
like Chiba Sensei did you just
extend or

412
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:41,480
extend or
 

413
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,629
extend or
inverse the Inward and outward spiral so

414
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:44,639
inverse the Inward and outward spiral so
 

415
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,910
inverse the Inward and outward spiral so
keep that in mind because I know some of

416
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:46,920
keep that in mind because I know some of
 

417
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,750
keep that in mind because I know some of
you do this Chiba Sensei thing what is

418
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760

 

419
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,269

that because we're going to prioritize

420
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:56,279
that because we're going to prioritize
 

421
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,870
that because we're going to prioritize
the positioning of the elbow and the

422
00:10:59,870 --> 00:10:59,880
the positioning of the elbow and the
 

423
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,990
the positioning of the elbow and the
structural Integrity of the

424
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000

 

425
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,269

shoulder you don't want to

00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
shoulder you don't want to
 

427
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,590
shoulder you don't want to
hinge at the elbow this should not this

428
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:10,600
hinge at the elbow this should not this
 

429
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,629
hinge at the elbow this should not this
should never happen Okay what I want to

430
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:13,639
should never happen Okay what I want to
 

431
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,990
should never happen Okay what I want to
do instead is the upper arm bone is

432
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
do instead is the upper arm bone is
 

433
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,350
do instead is the upper arm bone is
actually where all my extension is once

434
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:22,360
actually where all my extension is once
 

435
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,670
actually where all my extension is once
I set the shoulder in place as

436
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
I set the shoulder in place as
 

437
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,590
I set the shoulder in place as
described so right now if I

438
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
described so right now if I
 

439
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,550
described so right now if I
am using if I'm thinking I'm holding

440
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
am using if I'm thinking I'm holding
 

441
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,310
am using if I'm thinking I'm holding
them out and I'm maintaining positional

442
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
them out and I'm maintaining positional
 

443
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,230
them out and I'm maintaining positional
Integrity here this is where you start

444
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,240
Integrity here this is where you start
 

445
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,509
Integrity here this is where you start
to use the bicep and

446
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:42,519
to use the bicep and
 

447
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,670
to use the bicep and
tricep but if you set the

448
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
tricep but if you set the
 

449
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,230
tricep but if you set the
shoulder and you realize it's the upper

450
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:49,240
shoulder and you realize it's the upper
 

451
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,710
shoulder and you realize it's the upper
arm bone that's actually

452
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:51,720
arm bone that's actually
 

453
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,110
arm bone that's actually
doing that maintenance of that

454
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,120
doing that maintenance of that
 

455
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,509
doing that maintenance of that
positional Integrity such that's why we

456
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:56,519
positional Integrity such that's why we
 

457
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,550
positional Integrity such that's why we
do this drill he's pushing

458
00:11:59,550 --> 00:11:59,560
do this drill he's pushing
 

459
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,190
do this drill he's pushing
it doesn't it doesn't change the feeling

460
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:02,200
it doesn't it doesn't change the feeling
 

461
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,230
it doesn't it doesn't change the feeling
I set this and the key thing here is

462
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,240
I set this and the key thing here is
 

463
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,069
I set this and the key thing here is
there's no hinge

464
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
there's no hinge
 

465
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,190
there's no hinge
here and so the bicep and the tricep do

466
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
here and so the bicep and the tricep do
 

467
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,949
here and so the bicep and the tricep do
not have to flex okay I keep this elbow

468
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
not have to flex okay I keep this elbow
 

469
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,069
not have to flex okay I keep this elbow
in place which happens by making my

470
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:19,079
in place which happens by making my
 

471
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,790
in place which happens by making my
upper arm

472
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
upper arm
 

473
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,790
upper arm
bone my

474
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:23,800
bone my
 

475
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,829
bone my
extension maintenance okay by keeping my

476
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:26,839
extension maintenance okay by keeping my
 

477
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,069
extension maintenance okay by keeping my
shoulder locked if I don't keep my

478
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:29,079
shoulder locked if I don't keep my
 

479
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,069
shoulder locked if I don't keep my
shoulder lock this is where you start to

480
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:31,079
shoulder lock this is where you start to
 

481
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,590
shoulder lock this is where you start to
see all this stuff do you see okay so

482
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:34,600
see all this stuff do you see okay so
 

483
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,350
see all this stuff do you see okay so
we're going to look for this I'm not

484
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
we're going to look for this I'm not
 

485
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,710
we're going to look for this I'm not
flexing my

486
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
flexing my
 

487
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,110
flexing my
elbow not bringing in tricep and bicep

488
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,120
elbow not bringing in tricep and bicep
 

489
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,470
elbow not bringing in tricep and bicep
into it my elbow never goes outside my

490
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:45,480
into it my elbow never goes outside my
 

491
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,710
into it my elbow never goes outside my
outer rim and I only make use of these

492
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
outer rim and I only make use of these
 

493
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,990
outer rim and I only make use of these
movements here for all the movements

494
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,000
movements here for all the movements
 

495
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,949
movements here for all the movements
okay but these movements here are going

496
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:53,959
okay but these movements here are going
 

497
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:56,750
okay but these movements here are going
to be understood in a Transcendence kind

498
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:56,760
to be understood in a Transcendence kind
 

499
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,790
to be understood in a Transcendence kind
of way so when I'm moving in inside I

500
00:12:59,790 --> 00:12:59,800
of way so when I'm moving in inside I
 

501
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,509
of way so when I'm moving in inside I
could be using the outside okay when I'm

502
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:02,519
could be using the outside okay when I'm
 

503
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,910
could be using the outside okay when I'm
moving down I could actually be bringing

504
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:04,920
moving down I could actually be bringing
 

505
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,389
moving down I could actually be bringing
them up Etc and at some

506
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
them up Etc and at some
 

507
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,230
them up Etc and at some
point when you

508
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:11,240
point when you
 

509
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,110
point when you
go from gon to Chon to jodon you're

510
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
go from gon to Chon to jodon you're
 

511
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,509
go from gon to Chon to jodon you're
going to take one of those

512
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
going to take one of those
 

513
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,030
going to take one of those
Spirals and convert it from working on

514
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,040
Spirals and convert it from working on
 

515
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,150
Spirals and convert it from working on
the sagittal plane to working on the

516
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
the sagittal plane to working on the
 

517
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,470
the sagittal plane to working on the
vertical plane like we did yesterday in

518
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:27,480
vertical plane like we did yesterday in
 

519
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,269
vertical plane like we did yesterday in
uchai 10 okay we'll do that a lot so

520
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:32,279
uchai 10 okay we'll do that a lot so
 

521
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,750
uchai 10 okay we'll do that a lot so
here we

522
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:34,760

 

523
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,990

go and we'll just use Tenon okay or tyo

524
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,000
go and we'll just use Tenon okay or tyo
 

525
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,629
go and we'll just use Tenon okay or tyo
heno so you can see it's it's like a

526
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
heno so you can see it's it's like a
 

527
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,509
heno so you can see it's it's like a
magic trick now that now that you

528
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:44,519
magic trick now that now that you
 

529
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,550
magic trick now that now that you
understand what's going as I always show

530
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
understand what's going as I always show
 

531
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,629
understand what's going as I always show
you relax right relax and but if you pay

532
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
you relax right relax and but if you pay
 

533
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,110
you relax right relax and but if you pay
attention this part doesn't really move

534
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
attention this part doesn't really move
 

535
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,949
attention this part doesn't really move
I'm not going like this do you see that

536
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:55,959
I'm not going like this do you see that
 

537
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,470
I'm not going like this do you see that
so because as I mentioned it's the upper

538
00:13:59,470 --> 00:13:59,480
so because as I mentioned it's the upper
 

539
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,590
so because as I mentioned it's the upper
arm bone that's actually giving me my

540
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:02,600
arm bone that's actually giving me my
 

541
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,150
arm bone that's actually giving me my
positional Integrity that you can wiggle

542
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,160
positional Integrity that you can wiggle
 

543
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,110
positional Integrity that you can wiggle
the other stuff around see that

544
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
the other stuff around see that
 

545
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,430
the other stuff around see that
okay so we're here and we'll do gon and

546
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:12,440
okay so we're here and we'll do gon and
 

547
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,590
okay so we're here and we'll do gon and
gon is going to be part of your outward

548
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:16,600
gon is going to be part of your outward
 

549
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,310
gon is going to be part of your outward
spiral so you can see it it's your

550
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:19,320
spiral so you can see it it's your
 

551
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,670
spiral so you can see it it's your
outward spiral is in h you

552
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:24,680

 

553
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,350

ho so gon goes this way

554
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,360
ho so gon goes this way
 

555
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,590
ho so gon goes this way
we should see that angle of cancellation

556
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
we should see that angle of cancellation
 

557
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,110
we should see that angle of cancellation
in his elbow and already the beginning

because I rotate you'll see that you

562
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519
because I rotate you'll see that you
 

563
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,189
because I rotate you'll see that you
will it'll be hard to recognize the

will it'll be hard to recognize the
 

565
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,150
will it'll be hard to recognize the
outward spiral because I'm not going to

00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,160
outward spiral because I'm not going to
 

567
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,870
outward spiral because I'm not going to
stay here if I stay here you would

stay here if I stay here you would
 

569
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,509
stay here if I stay here you would
eventually see the shape but because I'm

570
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,519
eventually see the shape but because I'm

here's a dynamic equilibrium I went too

606
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
here's a dynamic equilibrium I went too
 

607
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,990
here's a dynamic equilibrium I went too
far and now I entered and turned you see

608
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,000
far and now I entered and turned you see
 

609
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,629
far and now I entered and turned you see
that I don't know if you caught that

610
00:15:59,629 --> 00:15:59,639
that I don't know if you caught that
 

611
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,910
that I don't know if you caught that
do it this

612
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
do it this
 

613
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,829
do it this
way y y pass Dynamic pass the spine and

00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:07,839
way y y pass Dynamic pass the spine and
 

615
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,670
way y y pass Dynamic pass the spine and
you get this closed off area you see and

616
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:10,680
you get this closed off area you see and
 

617
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,990
you get this closed off area you see and
now you enter and it's all

618
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,000
now you enter and it's all
 

619
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,230
now you enter and it's all
constricted so when do you rotate when

620
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
constricted so when do you rotate when
 

621
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:27,509
constricted so when do you rotate when
your hand hits that middle of

627
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,230

in all right let's

628
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
in all right let's
 

629
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,389
in all right let's
try let's go back a step because

630
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:47,399

 

631
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,150

uh in order to make my upper arm work

632
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,160
uh in order to make my upper arm work
 

633
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,629
uh in order to make my upper arm work
the way that I

634
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639
the way that I
 

635
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,350
the way that I
described you have to not put your lower

636
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360
described you have to not put your lower
 

637
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,509
described you have to not put your lower
arm in a place where you're going to

638
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:57,519
arm in a place where you're going to
 

639
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,949
arm in a place where you're going to
want to use your body bicep okay so

640
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
want to use your body bicep okay so
 

641
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,350
want to use your body bicep okay so
there is a a

642
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
there is a a
 

643
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,029
there is a a
natural degree of articulation in the

644
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:06,039
natural degree of articulation in the
 

645
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,270
natural degree of articulation in the
elbow that achieves that and the way to

646
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:08,280
elbow that achieves that and the way to
 

647
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,549
elbow that achieves that and the way to
find it is to lean over and let your

648
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
find it is to lean over and let your
 

649
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,789
find it is to lean over and let your
arms hang naturally with no tension and

650
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:15,799
arms hang naturally with no tension and
 

651
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:19,909
arms hang naturally with no tension and
that bend is what comes back making this

652
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
that bend is what comes back making this
 

653
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,510
that bend is what comes back making this
incorrect you see that if I'm hanging

654
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:22,520
incorrect you see that if I'm hanging
 

655
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,829
incorrect you see that if I'm hanging
over and I went like that you'd go relax

656
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:24,839
over and I went like that you'd go relax
 

657
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,549
over and I went like that you'd go relax
relax I am no you're not okay just let

658
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:27,559
relax I am no you're not okay just let
 

659
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,190
relax I am no you're not okay just let
your hands hang

660
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
your hands hang
 

661
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,630
your hands hang
hyperextending them again that would not

662
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:31,640
hyperextending them again that would not
 

663
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,590
hyperextending them again that would not
be relaxing so you find your natural

664
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:34,600
be relaxing so you find your natural
 

665
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,510
be relaxing so you find your natural
Bend then you bring that up and you keep

666
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
Bend then you bring that up and you keep
 

667
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,110
Bend then you bring that up and you keep
that okay let's try it again

668
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
that okay let's try it again
 

669
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,390
that okay let's try it again
go all right just going back a little

670
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
go all right just going back a little
 

671
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,510
go all right just going back a little
bit so you can understand how martially

672
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:48,520
bit so you can understand how martially
 

673
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,710
bit so you can understand how martially
precarious this joint

674
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:51,720
precarious this joint
 

675
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,230
precarious this joint
is okay he's going to try to bring me in

676
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
is okay he's going to try to bring me in
 

677
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:04,270
is okay he's going to try to bring me in
utilizing that inner deltoid

678
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:04,280

 

679
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,149

um now I'll give him some back muscle by

680
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:08,159
um now I'll give him some back muscle by
 

681
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,230
um now I'll give him some back muscle by
anchoring his elbow a little bit but

682
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
anchoring his elbow a little bit but
 

683
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,590
anchoring his elbow a little bit but
there's still a lot of inner and upper

684
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:12,600
there's still a lot of inner and upper
 

685
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,190
there's still a lot of inner and upper
deltoid here you go it's a little

686
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200

 

687
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,710

stronger but you can still feel it right

688
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
stronger but you can still feel it right
 

689
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,190
stronger but you can still feel it right
okay and this is actually how a lot of

690
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
okay and this is actually how a lot of
 

691
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,909
okay and this is actually how a lot of
people get injured as I've mentioned

692
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:24,919
people get injured as I've mentioned
 

693
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:27,270
people get injured as I've mentioned
earlier okay you're you're using these

694
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,280
earlier okay you're you're using these
 

695
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,390
earlier okay you're you're using these
muscle roots all right what he's going

696
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,400
muscle roots all right what he's going
 

697
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,549
muscle roots all right what he's going
to do instead if you pay attention now

698
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:31,559
to do instead if you pay attention now
 

699
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,909
to do instead if you pay attention now
with our grid this elbow is way outside

700
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:34,919
with our grid this elbow is way outside
 

701
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,310
with our grid this elbow is way outside
that Y Line and that's what makes it

702
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,320
that Y Line and that's what makes it
 

703
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,789
that Y Line and that's what makes it
precarious it's also way outside the

704
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:39,799
precarious it's also way outside the
 

705
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:42,750
precarious it's also way outside the
outer rim which makes it not Marshal

706
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:42,760
outer rim which makes it not Marshal
 

707
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,149
outer rim which makes it not Marshal
what he's going to do instead is by

708
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:44,159
what he's going to do instead is by
 

709
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:47,430
what he's going to do instead is by
turning his qua he now brings the elbow

710
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
turning his qua he now brings the elbow
 

711
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,270
turning his qua he now brings the elbow
back on the Y

712
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
back on the Y
 

713
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,070
back on the Y
Line okay and what he's going to do

714
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
Line okay and what he's going to do
 

715
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,470
Line okay and what he's going to do
instead instead of doing this

716
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
instead instead of doing this
 

717
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,750
instead instead of doing this
part he's going to do the inward spiral

718
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
part he's going to do the inward spiral
 

719
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,669
part he's going to do the inward spiral
okay so he'd go

720
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:01,679

 

721
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,549

here so he brings that and when he turns

722
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:05,559
here so he brings that and when he turns
 

723
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:09,510
here so he brings that and when he turns
his hand he brings his quaw into it and

724
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,520
his hand he brings his quaw into it and
 

725
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,710
his hand he brings his quaw into it and
he's way way stronger okay that's what

726
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:13,720
he's way way stronger okay that's what
 

727
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,470
he's way way stronger okay that's what
we're trying to

728
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:15,480
we're trying to
 

729
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,669
we're trying to
do all right here we

730
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:20,679

 

731
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:24,510

go so as you as and I I hope you can see

732
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:24,520
go so as you as and I I hope you can see
 

733
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,830
go so as you as and I I hope you can see
that now what he's what he's hitting is

734
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:26,840
that now what he's what he's hitting is
 

735
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,270
that now what he's what he's hitting is
that upper armb

736
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
that upper armb
 

737
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,029
that upper armb
that's why this is all relaxed like this

738
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
that's why this is all relaxed like this
 

739
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,149
that's why this is all relaxed like this
okay so again y it's going to go to Yin

740
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:38,159
okay so again y it's going to go to Yin
 

741
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,350
okay so again y it's going to go to Yin
the hand going to go to the spine and

742
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:40,360
the hand going to go to the spine and
 

743
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,470
the hand going to go to the spine and
that's where the turn happens this is

744
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
that's where the turn happens this is
 

745
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,230
that's where the turn happens this is
where the Turning

746
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:45,240
where the Turning
 

747
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,230
where the Turning
happens don't let your elbows go back

748
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
happens don't let your elbows go back
 

749
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,990
happens don't let your elbows go back
out elbows are on that young line my

750
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
out elbows are on that young line my
 

751
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,549
out elbows are on that young line my
hands are outside it which is

752
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
hands are outside it which is
 

753
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,640
hands are outside it which is
fine

754
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:55,650
fine
 

755
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,230
fine

756
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,240
[Music]
 

757
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:07,870
[Music]
again

758
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:07,880

 

759
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,029

and again it

760
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:10,039
and again it
 

761
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,710
and again it
is the hour spiral being used to appear

762
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:13,720
is the hour spiral being used to appear
 

763
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,230
is the hour spiral being used to appear
to go in okay try okay so we'll go back

764
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:17,240
to go in okay try okay so we'll go back
 

765
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,950
to go in okay try okay so we'll go back
a little bit he's going to bend over and

766
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:19,960
a little bit he's going to bend over and
 

767
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,710
a little bit he's going to bend over and
learn his natural arm angle he's going

768
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:23,720
learn his natural arm angle he's going
 

769
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,310
learn his natural arm angle he's going
to get a kinesthetic feeling of what

770
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:27,320
to get a kinesthetic feeling of what
 

771
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,909
to get a kinesthetic feeling of what
that is he comes up and he keeps it okay

772
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
that is he comes up and he keeps it okay
 

773
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,270
that is he comes up and he keeps it okay
what this armed angle does at the elbow

774
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
what this armed angle does at the elbow
 

775
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,470
what this armed angle does at the elbow
is it actually sets the upper arm at a

776
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
is it actually sets the upper arm at a
 

777
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,549
is it actually sets the upper arm at a
particular angle and that particular

778
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:41,559
particular angle and that particular
 

779
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:44,270
particular angle and that particular
angle is what allows the shoulder

780
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,280
angle is what allows the shoulder
 

781
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,230
angle is what allows the shoulder
mechanism to set in place as we want it

782
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,240
mechanism to set in place as we want it
 

783
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,909
mechanism to set in place as we want it
to be okay if he bends his arm you can

784
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:51,919
to be okay if he bends his arm you can
 

785
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,029
to be okay if he bends his arm you can
see that it changed the angle of the

786
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:54,039
see that it changed the angle of the
 

787
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:57,430
see that it changed the angle of the
upper arm and of course then it changes

788
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
upper arm and of course then it changes
 

789
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,029
upper arm and of course then it changes
the angle of the shoulder mechanism now

790
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:00,039
the angle of the shoulder mechanism now
 

791
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,070
the angle of the shoulder mechanism now
putting it in a less setable

792
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,080
putting it in a less setable
 

793
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,430
putting it in a less setable
position if we come back out to his

794
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:05,440
position if we come back out to his
 

795
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,430
position if we come back out to his
natural angle you can see that upper arm

796
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
natural angle you can see that upper arm
 

797
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,830
natural angle you can see that upper arm
changed its angle and therefore we're

798
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
changed its angle and therefore we're
 

799
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,510
changed its angle and therefore we're
now in the setable position for the

800
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
now in the setable position for the
 

801
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,990
now in the setable position for the
shoulder if we go the other way and he

802
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,000
shoulder if we go the other way and he
 

803
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,190
shoulder if we go the other way and he
extends that again the upper arm changed

804
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
extends that again the upper arm changed
 

805
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,630
extends that again the upper arm changed
its angle the shoulder changed its

806
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:19,640
its angle the shoulder changed its
 

807
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,230
its angle the shoulder changed its
setability as well okay so as he's doing

808
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:23,240
setability as well okay so as he's doing
 

809
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,950
setability as well okay so as he's doing
tenon for example just on your own like

810
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:26,960
tenon for example just on your own like
 

811
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,470
tenon for example just on your own like
you're doing it you go

812
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:29,480
you're doing it you go
 

813
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,310
you're doing it you go
a lot of times even on here slightly he

814
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,320
a lot of times even on here slightly he
 

815
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,669
a lot of times even on here slightly he
came in do you see slightly this arm

816
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
came in do you see slightly this arm
 

817
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,070
came in do you see slightly this arm
bent more that's not the natural angle

818
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,080
bent more that's not the natural angle
 

819
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,190
bent more that's not the natural angle
that he had before that's going to

820
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:40,200
that he had before that's going to
 

821
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,310
that he had before that's going to
change this angle this shoulder is now

822
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,320
change this angle this shoulder is now
 

823
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,230
change this angle this shoulder is now
not setable so from here he has to do

824
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:45,240

Jon so what I was what I was trying to

1004
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,600
Jon so what I was what I was trying to
 

1005
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,789
Jon so what I was what I was trying to
say is that as you go into Chon I went

1006
00:26:57,789 --> 00:26:57,799
say is that as you go into Chon I went
 

1007
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:01,549
say is that as you go into Chon I went
low and Chon is what moves him forward

1008
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:01,559
low and Chon is what moves him forward
 

1009
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:05,029
low and Chon is what moves him forward
and up and since he's going up there's a

1010
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:05,039
and up and since he's going up there's a
 

1011
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,870
and up and since he's going up there's a
Yin space and that's where jodon happens

1012
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880
Yin space and that's where jodon happens
 

1013
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,909
Yin space and that's where jodon happens
jodon is not him down and then I lift

1014
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
jodon is not him down and then I lift
 

1015
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,990
jodon is not him down and then I lift
him up and he keeps his

1016
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,000
him up and he keeps his
 

1017
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,590
him up and he keeps his
grip I move him on Chon boom Chon boom

1018
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:19,600
grip I move him on Chon boom Chon boom
 

1019
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,630
grip I move him on Chon boom Chon boom
is going this way judon moves him up I

how high my hand is and then I would

1028
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:39,399
how high my hand is and then I would
 

1029
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:42,990
how high my hand is and then I would
just move myself into that

1030

place so resist here and then you
pulling his hand up like that you can

1034
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:49,880
pulling his hand up like that you can
 

1035
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,430
pulling his hand up like that you can
see there's way less action in his

1036
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:52,440
see there's way less action in his
 

1037

Center so Bo boom that's what you want
okay then it is effortless you're not

1040
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,240
okay then it is effortless you're not
 

1041
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,509
okay then it is effortless you're not
using the bicep okay

1042
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:02,519
using the bicep okay
 

1043

go so just at the beginning I said this

1044
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:05,840
go so just at the beginning I said this

is the hour spiral and gon but it

1046
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:08,440
is the hour spiral and gon but it
 

1047
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,870
is the hour spiral and gon but it
doesn't look like it because I changed

1048
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:11,880
doesn't look like it because I changed
 

1049
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,389
doesn't look like it because I changed
my orientation to it so it looks like it

1050
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:15,399
my orientation to it so it looks like it
 

1051
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:18,029
my orientation to it so it looks like it
was going in this

1052
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:18,039
was going in this
 

1053
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:21,990
was going in this
way jodon is your inward

way jodon is your inward
 

1055
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,269
way jodon is your inward
spiral but I changed my orientation to

1056
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:25,279
spiral but I changed my orientation to
 

1057
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,070
spiral but I changed my orientation to
it and allowing me to convert it from

1058
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
it and allowing me to convert it from
 

1059
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,830
it and allowing me to convert it from
working on the sagittal plane to the

1060
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:30,840
working on the sagittal plane to the
 

1061
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,190
working on the sagittal plane to the
vertical plane again okay which is why I

1062
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
vertical plane again okay which is why I
 

1063
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,509
vertical plane again okay which is why I
don't just go here that's not one of my

00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:38,519
don't just go here that's not one of my
 

1065

passing through and then I Chang my
 

1069
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,509
passing through and then I Chang my
orientation to it if I didn't change my

1070
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:49,519
orientation to it if I didn't change my

to move myself over here and lower
 

1079
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,950
to move myself over here and lower
myself and this is where you have your

I'm going to keep that movement going
 

1095
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,230
I'm going to keep that movement going
it's

attention where my hand ends
 

1103
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,830
attention where my hand ends
up is

1113
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,110

okay because I want that elbow closer to

1114
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,120
okay because I want that elbow closer to
 

1115
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,669
okay because I want that elbow closer to
my Center Line I I move this out like

1116
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:07,679
my Center Line I I move this out like
 

1117
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,870
my Center Line I I move this out like
this no that's not where that elbow

1118
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:10,880
this no that's not where that elbow
 

1119
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,590
this no that's not where that elbow
goes okay grab is on the Janine line

1120
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:14,600
goes okay grab is on the Janine line
 

1121
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,909
goes okay grab is on the Janine line
elbows on the yin line okay prior okay

we we ran into a common uh problem here

1124
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:22,480
we we ran into a common uh problem here
 

1125
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,750
we we ran into a common uh problem here
and uh it is part of of the tabaki

1126
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:26,760
and uh it is part of of the tabaki
 

1127
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,430
and uh it is part of of the tabaki
because we use the Tachi in the tenom

1128
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:29,440
because we use the Tachi in the tenom
 

1129
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,789
because we use the Tachi in the tenom
maneuver okay uh so the the problem the

1130
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:32,799
maneuver okay uh so the the problem the
 

1131
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,590
maneuver okay uh so the the problem the
goal that we want is that I don't start

1132
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:35,600
goal that we want is that I don't start
 

1133
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,029
goal that we want is that I don't start
entering and rotating until the grip

1134
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:38,039
entering and rotating until the grip
 

1135
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:41,110
entering and rotating until the grip
comes to that Center Line on me that

1136
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,120
comes to that Center Line on me that
 

1137
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,029
comes to that Center Line on me that
equilibrium between Yin and

1138
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:43,039
equilibrium between Yin and
 

1139
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,630
equilibrium between Yin and
Yong but if I bring the grip there and

1140
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:45,640
Yong but if I bring the grip there and
 

1141
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,990
Yong but if I bring the grip there and
don't move my body at all you get

1142
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,000
don't move my body at all you get
 

1143
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,070
don't move my body at all you get
crunched here and that's going to cause

1144
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,080
crunched here and that's going to cause
 

1145
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,029
crunched here and that's going to cause
problems so what our people here today

1146
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:54,039
problems so what our people here today
 

1147
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:57,230
problems so what our people here today
were doing is they go well I I'm feel

1148
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:57,240
were doing is they go well I I'm feel
 

1149
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,029
were doing is they go well I I'm feel
feeling crutched and so now they start

1150
00:30:59,029 --> 00:30:59,039
feeling crutched and so now they start
 

1151

to what the elbow is doing in its role
in the inward spiral the same thing here

1188
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:57,279
in the inward spiral the same thing here
 

1189
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,149
in the inward spiral the same thing here
here as you wouldn't turn them equally

it already started and then the quaw
 

1213
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,430
it already started and then the quaw
picks it up the hand is traveling at a

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:51,350
faster
rate push

1218
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,360

 

1219
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,470

now
