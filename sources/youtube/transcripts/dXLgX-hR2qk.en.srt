Boom. I got to wait for you to get here.
So, don't you haven't turned yet. You're

176
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
So, don't you haven't turned yet. You're
 

177
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,870
So, don't you haven't turned yet. You're
going this way. Okay.

178
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
going this way. Okay.
 

179
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,269
going this way. Okay.
Boom.

180
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
Boom.
 

181
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,190
Boom.
Haven't turned

182
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
Haven't turned
 

183
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,990
Haven't turned
this way. There it is.

184
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
this way. There it is.
 

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,269
this way. There it is.
There it is.

186
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279

 

187
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,190

There it is.

188
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
There it is.
 

189
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:27,350
There it is.
Feel the different placement now.

190
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360

 

191
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:35,350

I have to be on the side of your head.

192
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360

 

193
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,710

Okay. Try it again. You you you guys are

194
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
Okay. Try it again. You you you guys are
 

195
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,949
Okay. Try it again. You you you guys are
pulling out.

196
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
pulling out.
 

197
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,110
pulling out.
You have to do some reverse engineering.

198
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
You have to do some reverse engineering.
 

199
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,470
You have to do some reverse engineering.
Okay. So, you're even if it was my

200
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
Okay. So, you're even if it was my
 

201
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,350
Okay. So, you're even if it was my
height in Kihon, the head is higher than

202
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
height in Kihon, the head is higher than
 

203
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,310
height in Kihon, the head is higher than
that. So you have to you have there's

204
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
that. So you have to you have there's
 

205
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,470
that. So you have to you have there's
some downness. Do do you get that?

206
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
some downness. Do do you get that?
 

207
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:54,949
some downness. Do do you get that?
>> Right.

208
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
>> Right.
 

209
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,069
>> Right.
>> But if I if I rip, please. But if I'm

210
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
>> But if I if I rip, please. But if I'm
 

211
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,230
>> But if I if I rip, please. But if I'm
making your center go forward, your

212
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
making your center go forward, your
 

213
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,230
making your center go forward, your
head's not going to get down. Do you get

214
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
head's not going to get down. Do you get
 

215
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,550
head's not going to get down. Do you get
that?

216
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
that?
 

217
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,269
that?
>> Yes.

218
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
>> Yes.
 

219
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,470
>> Yes.
>> So your head does does have to go down.

220
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
>> So your head does does have to go down.
 

221
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,710
>> So your head does does have to go down.
Do you see? And I can't make your center

222
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
Do you see? And I can't make your center
 

223
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,069
Do you see? And I can't make your center
go forward first.

224
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
go forward first.
 

225
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:10,790
go forward first.
>> Right.

226
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
>> Right.
 

227
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,550
>> Right.
>> So I'm making your head go down

228
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
>> So I'm making your head go down
 

229
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,670
>> So I'm making your head go down
to there. Okay. Got it?

230
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
to there. Okay. Got it?
 

231
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,430
to there. Okay. Got it?
>> All right. Now I have the problem that

232
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
>> All right. Now I have the problem that
 

233
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,710
>> All right. Now I have the problem that
energy is going this way and I can't go

234
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
energy is going this way and I can't go
 

235
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,630
energy is going this way and I can't go
back. That's going to clash. So the

236
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
back. That's going to clash. So the
 

237
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,350
back. That's going to clash. So the
energy that's coming down I keep taking

238
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
energy that's coming down I keep taking
 

239
00:11:31,360 --> 00:13:07,670
energy that's coming down I keep taking
around to let your center go up.

240
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680

 

241
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,710

Okay. So, they're here and they they're

242
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
Okay. So, they're here and they they're
 

243
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,069
Okay. So, they're here and they they're
not going to come in.

244
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
not going to come in.
 

245
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,829
not going to come in.
You you'll feel that the the yin yield

246
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
You you'll feel that the the yin yield
 

247
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,550
You you'll feel that the the yin yield
is they're keeping it out and you're

248
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
is they're keeping it out and you're
 

249
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,150
is they're keeping it out and you're
here.

257
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,710

If he's in front,

258
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720

 

259
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,750

if he gets behind you, it's the reverse.

260
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
if he gets behind you, it's the reverse.
 

261
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,710
if he gets behind you, it's the reverse.
Okay, we're over here. And it's this

Lose it. Boom.
Find the center again. So, what I'm

272
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
Find the center again. So, what I'm
 

273
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,790
Find the center again. So, what I'm
doing here is I'm finding the other

274
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
doing here is I'm finding the other
 

275
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,150
doing here is I'm finding the other
control point.

276
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
control point.
 

277
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,550
control point.
>> Right there. Okay.

278
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560

 

279
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,949

If he gives you back, this one and it's

280
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
If he gives you back, this one and it's
 

281
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,990
If he gives you back, this one and it's
right there.

right there.
 

283
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,430
right there.
Just always touching the center.

284
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440

 

285
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,030

should feel that. She's doing it.
So you go to something else. Don't go

302
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
So you go to something else. Don't go
 

303
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,949
So you go to something else. Don't go
here and she does it for you. You you

304
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
here and she does it for you. You you
 

305
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,870
here and she does it for you. You you
you can't you're not going to be able to

306
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
you can't you're not going to be able to
 

307
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,269
you can't you're not going to be able to
fix that. U

308
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
fix that. U
 

309
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,990
fix that. U
like that. Do you understand? So you fix

310
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
like that. Do you understand? So you fix
 

311
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,550
like that. Do you understand? So you fix
your technique. I'm trying. No, she

312
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
your technique. I'm trying. No, she
 

313
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:37,030
your technique. I'm trying. No, she
didn't do it

314
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040

 

315
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,990

there. Now you know that's real. Okay.

316
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
there. Now you know that's real. Okay.
 

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,910
there. Now you know that's real. Okay.
Do you understand? Like you can feel

318
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
Do you understand? Like you can feel
 

319
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,829
Do you understand? Like you can feel
ahead of time if you have the adhesion

320
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
ahead of time if you have the adhesion
 

321
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,509
ahead of time if you have the adhesion
and you have the center then do that. So

322
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
and you have the center then do that. So
 

323
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,749
and you have the center then do that. So
even though

324
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:49,759
even though
 

325
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,629
even though
you're she's she you should feel that

326
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
you're she's she you should feel that
 

327
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,389
you're she's she you should feel that
she's in control. You don't have to let

328
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
she's in control. You don't have to let
 

329
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,749
she's in control. You don't have to let
go, do you? Okay. So, one and I can

330
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:57,759
go, do you? Okay. So, one and I can
 

331
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,550
go, do you? Okay. So, one and I can
change it.

332
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
change it.
 

333
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,389
change it.
So,

334
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
So,
 

335
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,590
So,
she doesn't quite feel it, but

336
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600
she doesn't quite feel it, but
 

337
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,710
she doesn't quite feel it, but
you see I have her center. Do you see?

338
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
