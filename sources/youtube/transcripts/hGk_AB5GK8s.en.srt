they say there's only one hasso but in

46
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
they say there's only one hasso but in
 

47
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,830
they say there's only one hasso but in
my opinion there's

48
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840
my opinion there's
 

49
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,750
my opinion there's
definitely two and then you've got

50
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
definitely two and then you've got
 

51
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,429
definitely two and then you've got
variations

52
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
variations
 

53
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:23,190
variations
on those two

54
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200

 

55
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,550

the standard one is you go to the middle

56
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
the standard one is you go to the middle
 

57
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,910
the standard one is you go to the middle
of the joe

58
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
of the joe
 

59
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,590
of the joe
and if you're a beginner and you see it

60
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
and if you're a beginner and you see it
 

61
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,510
and if you're a beginner and you see it
doing that you're not quite in the

62
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
doing that you're not quite in the
 

63
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,990
doing that you're not quite in the
middle you need to be the exact middle

64
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
middle you need to be the exact middle
 

65
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,710
middle you need to be the exact middle
so

66
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
so
 

67
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,069
so

if it's slightly out and you open your
 

71
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,550
if it's slightly out and you open your
hand that will happen

72
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
hand that will happen
 

73
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,990
hand that will happen
it's rare that that happens

74
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
it's rare that that happens
 

75
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,350
it's rare that that happens
but you need to get used to that

76
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
but you need to get used to that
 

77
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,069
but you need to get used to that

217
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,589

the points on what i do they're more

218
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
the points on what i do they're more
 

219
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,189
the points on what i do they're more
than basic obviously but that's covering

220
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
than basic obviously but that's covering
 

221
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,430
than basic obviously but that's covering
that the footwork

222
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
that the footwork
 

223
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,469
that the footwork
the first one like i said steps forward

224
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
the first one like i said steps forward
 

225

232
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:39,840

 

233
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,189

open the back foot step back

234
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199

 

235
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,350

the details
 

239
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,869
the details
perhaps i don't talk about but i do i'm

240
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
perhaps i don't talk about but i do i'm

trying to time
my head to my toe with the turning of

244
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
my head to my toe with the turning of
 

245
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:04,070
my head to my toe with the turning of
the joe so everything's moving as well

246
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080

249
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:38,829

backwards

250
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839

 

251
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:59,910

so

252
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920

 

253
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,470

there's feet together

254
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480

 

255
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:13,509

still across the line

256
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519

 

257
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,070

feet together but this one slightly here

258
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
feet together but this one slightly here
 

259
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,790
feet together but this one slightly here
because

260
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
because
 

261
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,350
because
that's what you're doing you're patting

262
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
that's what you're doing you're patting

265
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,910

on all the hasso's this part is the same

266
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
on all the hasso's this part is the same
 

267
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,670
on all the hasso's this part is the same
the feet are the same

268
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
the feet are the same
 

269
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,750
the feet are the same
the movement's the same because on all

270
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
the movement's the same because on all
 

271
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,670
the movement's the same because on all
hassles you go

272
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
hassles you go
 

273
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,230
hassles you go
you do this part first before the skis

274
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
you do this part first before the skis
 

275
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:46,470
you do this part first before the skis
or the rides

276
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480

 

277
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:54,070

this is if they're skiing to the chest

278
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080

 

279
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,949

what about the skis lower down

280
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959

 

281
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,710

i've asked this question many times when

282
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
i've asked this question many times when
 

283
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,470
i've asked this question many times when
i used to go to america and they said no

284
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
i used to go to america and they said no
 

285
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,430
i used to go to america and they said no
this

286
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
this
 

287
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,550
this
there's only one hasso but

288
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
there's only one hasso but
 

289
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,150
there's only one hasso but
i've seen this so i'll show it

290
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160

 

291
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,870

where it comes here not across the body

292
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
where it comes here not across the body
 

293
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,949
where it comes here not across the body
but it pats it away their lower strike

294
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
but it pats it away their lower strike
 

295
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,389
but it pats it away their lower strike
it pats it away that way

296
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
it pats it away that way
 

297
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:31,670
it pats it away that way
and then you gather it in

298
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680

 

299
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,829

so here

300
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
so here
 

301
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:46,389
so here
we pat it away

302
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
we pat it away
 

303
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,550
we pat it away
you can do it the same as all of them

304
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
you can do it the same as all of them
 

305
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,069
you can do it the same as all of them
forwards

306
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
forwards
 

307
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,269
forwards
cut it away

308
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279

 

309
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:03,750

310
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760

 

311
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:13,590

or you can do the back foot

312
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
