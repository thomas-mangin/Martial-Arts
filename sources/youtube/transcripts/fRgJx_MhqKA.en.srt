00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,749
hi I'm Christopher hin and today we're
going to be talking about motos and roio

4
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:06,759
going to be talking about motos and roio
 

5
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,470
going to be talking about motos and roio
so myoto is a technique uh it's known by

6
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:09,480
so myoto is a technique uh it's known by
 

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,870
so myoto is a technique uh it's known by
a lot of different names in fact the

8
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
a lot of different names in fact the
 

9
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,749
a lot of different names in fact the
style I learned it in we called it KAG

10
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:14,759
style I learned it in we called it KAG
 

11
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,550
style I learned it in we called it KAG
um but there are so many things called

12
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:16,560
um but there are so many things called
 

13
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,590
um but there are so many things called
KAG that when I started teaching I

14
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:18,600
KAG that when I started teaching I
 

15
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,630
KAG that when I started teaching I
needed a different name for it so I

16
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:20,640
needed a different name for it so I
 

17
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,429
needed a different name for it so I
pulled my otoshi from another style of

18
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:22,439
pulled my otoshi from another style of
 

19
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,750
pulled my otoshi from another style of
iido to use the term motoshi um it's a

20
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:26,760
iido to use the term motoshi um it's a
 

21
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,790
iido to use the term motoshi um it's a
really good technique that I think kind

22
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
really good technique that I think kind
 

23
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,870
really good technique that I think kind
of gets a bad rep because it looks kind

24
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
of gets a bad rep because it looks kind
 

25
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,590
of gets a bad rep because it looks kind
of weird um and in fact I believe it is

26
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:34,600
of weird um and in fact I believe it is
 

27
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,750
of weird um and in fact I believe it is
just another variation on aoko so we're

28
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
just another variation on aoko so we're
 

29
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,270
just another variation on aoko so we're
also going to talk about rokio in this

30
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
also going to talk about rokio in this
 

31
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,470
also going to talk about rokio in this
and I think rokio is the big category

32
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:41,480
and I think rokio is the big category
 

33
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,549
and I think rokio is the big category
and motos is kind of a subcategory that

34
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:43,559
and motos is kind of a subcategory that
 

35
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:44,830
and motos is kind of a subcategory that
but I'm gonna get Josh over here we're

00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
sport in the top knot today uh in true
 

45
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,189
sport in the top knot today uh in true
samurai fashion all right so uh what is

46
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
samurai fashion all right so uh what is
 

47
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,150
samurai fashion all right so uh what is
my so we call myoto this thing right so

48
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,160
my so we call myoto this thing right so
 

49
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,869
my so we call myoto this thing right so
I'm sure your school has some name for

50
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
I'm sure your school has some name for
 

51
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,390
I'm sure your school has some name for
this that this equivalent kind of

52
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
this that this equivalent kind of
 

53
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,950
this that this equivalent kind of
technique um in this uh the way it's

54
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
technique um in this uh the way it's
 

55
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,990
technique um in this uh the way it's
kind of classically shown is the

56
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,000
kind of classically shown is the
 

57
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,030
kind of classically shown is the
teachers will roll someone up onto the

58
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
teachers will roll someone up onto the
 

59
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,350
teachers will roll someone up onto the
tip of the toes and then project them

60
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
tip of the toes and then project them
 

61
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,270
tip of the toes and then project them
forward into the mat right and that's

62
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
forward into the mat right and that's
 

63
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,870
forward into the mat right and that's
kind of the the the root idea or the the

64
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:19,880
kind of the the the root idea or the the
 

65
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,749
kind of the the the root idea or the the
thing you most commonly see in different

66
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
thing you most commonly see in different
 

67
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,270
thing you most commonly see in different
styles um when I learned that I thought

68
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,280
styles um when I learned that I thought
 

69
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,230
styles um when I learned that I thought
it was really kind of dumb because I was

70
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
it was really kind of dumb because I was
 

71
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,149
it was really kind of dumb because I was
like well who the heck's going to stand

72
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
like well who the heck's going to stand
 

73
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,429
like well who the heck's going to stand
there while you lift the them off the

74
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:30,439
there while you lift the them off the
 

75
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,429
there while you lift the them off the
ground like this and then project them

76
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:32,439
ground like this and then project them
 

77
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,190
ground like this and then project them
forward and and I don't know it just

78
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:34,200
forward and and I don't know it just
 

79
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,710
forward and and I don't know it just
didn't didn't make too much sense to me

80
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:35,720
didn't didn't make too much sense to me
 

81
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,429
didn't didn't make too much sense to me
but um as I started to work with more

82
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:38,439
but um as I started to work with more
 

83
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,310
but um as I started to work with more
live practice I noticed myself basically

84
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,320
live practice I noticed myself basically
 

85
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,350
live practice I noticed myself basically
doing that technique and something that

86
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
doing that technique and something that
 

87
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,149
doing that technique and something that
looked a little simpler than that but

88
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:45,159
looked a little simpler than that but
 

89
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,429
looked a little simpler than that but
but basically doing that technique and

90
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:46,439
but basically doing that technique and
 

91
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,749
but basically doing that technique and
it would happen a lot if I was caught

92
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
it would happen a lot if I was caught
 

93
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,069
it would happen a lot if I was caught
like this and I needed to turn quick and

94
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
like this and I needed to turn quick and
 

95
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,830
like this and I needed to turn quick and
pop someone's arm off right and that's

96
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
pop someone's arm off right and that's
 

97
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,149
pop someone's arm off right and that's
how I did it and saw it a lot and so

98
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
how I did it and saw it a lot and so
 

99
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,670
how I did it and saw it a lot and so
once I started doing that I was like oh

100
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
once I started doing that I was like oh
 

101
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,469
once I started doing that I was like oh
yeah this is a pretty legit technique

102
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:57,479
yeah this is a pretty legit technique
 

103
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,310
yeah this is a pretty legit technique
you know but it took me a while to kind

104
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,320
you know but it took me a while to kind
 

105
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,429
you know but it took me a while to kind
of figure out what all the little

106
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:00,439
of figure out what all the little
 

107
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,590
of figure out what all the little
details are right so one part of that I

108
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
details are right so one part of that I
 

109
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,310
details are right so one part of that I
believe this part is actually an attempt

110
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:05,320
believe this part is actually an attempt
 

111
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,789
believe this part is actually an attempt
to clear and no he's not going to stand

112
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:07,799
to clear and no he's not going to stand
 

113
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,749
to clear and no he's not going to stand
there generally while I do this what

114
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
there generally while I do this what
 

115
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,790
there generally while I do this what
he's going to do is hate that and he's

116
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:11,800
he's going to do is hate that and he's
 

117
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,190
he's going to do is hate that and he's
going to come off on my wrist which is

118
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
going to come off on my wrist which is
 

119
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,589
going to come off on my wrist which is
what I want right and so this is just a

120
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
what I want right and so this is just a
 

121
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,710
what I want right and so this is just a
way to really extend into it right so as

122
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:17,720
way to really extend into it right so as
 

123
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,750
way to really extend into it right so as
I'm twisting kind of lining up my arm a

124
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
I'm twisting kind of lining up my arm a
 

125
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,229
I'm twisting kind of lining up my arm a
little bit and really going into the

126
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:21,239
little bit and really going into the
 

127
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,390
little bit and really going into the
back of that elbow and I'm using that

128
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:23,400
back of that elbow and I'm using that
 

129
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,430
back of that elbow and I'm using that
elbow to raise him up right now a lot of

130
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
elbow to raise him up right now a lot of
 

131
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,030
elbow to raise him up right now a lot of
times when you see it in schools you'll

132
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
times when you see it in schools you'll
 

133
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,470
times when you see it in schools you'll
see people kind of doing it like this

134
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
see people kind of doing it like this
 

135
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,309
see people kind of doing it like this
and this is a really impossible way to

136
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:31,319
and this is a really impossible way to
 

137
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,150
and this is a really impossible way to
get this to come off and you know maybe

138
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,160
get this to come off and you know maybe
 

139
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,190
get this to come off and you know maybe
I'm missing some subtlety but I I did

140
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
I'm missing some subtlety but I I did
 

141
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,869
I'm missing some subtlety but I I did
originally learn it this way also um but

142
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:37,879
originally learn it this way also um but
 

143
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,550
originally learn it this way also um but
this is a real difficult way to get

144
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:39,560
this is a real difficult way to get
 

145
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,390
this is a real difficult way to get
anything to happen because he's really

146
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:41,400
anything to happen because he's really
 

147
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,229
anything to happen because he's really
stable right here he has no reason to

148
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:43,239
stable right here he has no reason to
 

149
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,309
stable right here he has no reason to
want to to move at all and so I could

150
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:45,319
want to to move at all and so I could
 

151
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,630
want to to move at all and so I could
probably wrestle with them a lot like

152
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
probably wrestle with them a lot like
 

153
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,910
probably wrestle with them a lot like
this and it's not until I add the

154
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
this and it's not until I add the
 

155
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,869
this and it's not until I add the
emphasis to the Elbow here now I could

156
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:49,879
emphasis to the Elbow here now I could
 

157
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,990
emphasis to the Elbow here now I could
be here and put this on my body and use

158
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
be here and put this on my body and use
 

159
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,910
be here and put this on my body and use
my body to do that it's just not quite

160
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
my body to do that it's just not quite
 

161
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,790
my body to do that it's just not quite
as tight if I slide my arm over a little

162
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:55,800
as tight if I slide my arm over a little
 

163
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,390
as tight if I slide my arm over a little
more I get a little bit more out of it

164
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:57,400
more I get a little bit more out of it
 

165
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,030
more I get a little bit more out of it
right and as far as the throwing goes

166
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,040
right and as far as the throwing goes
 

167
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,830
right and as far as the throwing goes
this is how I feel about anything sure

168
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
this is how I feel about anything sure
 

169
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,830
this is how I feel about anything sure
someone might be thrown by that and it

170
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
someone might be thrown by that and it
 

171
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,789
someone might be thrown by that and it
is called otoshi and OSI means to drop

172
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:05,799
is called otoshi and OSI means to drop
 

173
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,589
is called otoshi and OSI means to drop
something down so it could be that I did

174
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
something down so it could be that I did
 

175
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,830
something down so it could be that I did
it really hard and they smashed their

176
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:08,840
it really hard and they smashed their
 

177
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,710
it really hard and they smashed their
face on the ground but in my opinion

178
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
face on the ground but in my opinion
 

179
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,110
face on the ground but in my opinion
it's more a hoki right so the idea is

180
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
it's more a hoki right so the idea is
 

181
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,550
it's more a hoki right so the idea is
more like hoki and kind of the way I

182
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
more like hoki and kind of the way I
 

183
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,630
more like hoki and kind of the way I
teach everything is really hoki at its

184
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
teach everything is really hoki at its
 

185
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,270
teach everything is really hoki at its
core and then if they stayed on they

186
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
core and then if they stayed on they
 

187
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,270
core and then if they stayed on they
would get thrown or dropped or whatever

188
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
would get thrown or dropped or whatever
 

189
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,270
would get thrown or dropped or whatever
right but that's the basic idea seeing

190
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
right but that's the basic idea seeing
 

191
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,110
right but that's the basic idea seeing
it from gak is a really nice way to see

192
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
it from gak is a really nice way to see
 

193
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,990
it from gak is a really nice way to see
it comes off really really clean um but

194
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,000
it comes off really really clean um but
 

195
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,070
it comes off really really clean um but
it could come off lots of ways it could

196
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
it could come off lots of ways it could
 

197
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,990
it could come off lots of ways it could
have come off if he had something in his

198
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,000
have come off if he had something in his
 

199
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,270
have come off if he had something in his
hand too and I was holding and trying to

200
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:30,280
hand too and I was holding and trying to
 

201
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,710
hand too and I was holding and trying to
pop his hand off of it as well right so

202
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
pop his hand off of it as well right so
 

203
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,750
pop his hand off of it as well right so
that's my basic idea with that I think

204
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
that's my basic idea with that I think
 

205
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,190
that's my basic idea with that I think
this technique is a roo technique and so

206
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
this technique is a roo technique and so
 

207
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,149
this technique is a roo technique and so
when I talk about technique uh the

208
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:41,159
when I talk about technique uh the
 

209
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,149
when I talk about technique uh the
technique of rokio I'm talking about the

210
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:43,159
technique of rokio I'm talking about the
 

211
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,270
technique of rokio I'm talking about the
principle of locking the elbow out so to

212
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
principle of locking the elbow out so to
 

213
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,789
principle of locking the elbow out so to
me anything that does this hyperextends

214
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
me anything that does this hyperextends
 

215
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,830
me anything that does this hyperextends
this elbow joint is a roio so anything

216
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:50,840
this elbow joint is a roio so anything
 

217
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,149
this elbow joint is a roio so anything
that does that's a roio so that means

218
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:53,159
that does that's a roio so that means
 

219
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,190
that does that's a roio so that means
this which is the classic Roo I'm doing

220
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
this which is the classic Roo I'm doing
 

221
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,830
this which is the classic Roo I'm doing
that against my body here so I'm pulling

222
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:56,840
that against my body here so I'm pulling
 

223
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,350
that against my body here so I'm pulling
my body in and driving it like that

224
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:58,360
my body in and driving it like that
 

225
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,190
my body in and driving it like that
that's a roo if you see any kind of

226
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,200
that's a roo if you see any kind of
 

227
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,550
that's a roo if you see any kind of
variation of a throw like this where

228
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:01,560
variation of a throw like this where
 

229
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,550
variation of a throw like this where
it's on my shoulder here and I'm

230
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
it's on my shoulder here and I'm
 

231
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,589
it's on my shoulder here and I'm
cranking down on this that's a rokio so

232
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:04,599
cranking down on this that's a rokio so
 

233
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,869
cranking down on this that's a rokio so
anytime I lock this arm out so I think

234
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
anytime I lock this arm out so I think
 

235
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,710
anytime I lock this arm out so I think
You' just call it an armar bar in modern

236
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
You' just call it an armar bar in modern
 

237
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,910
You' just call it an armar bar in modern
lingo right so anything like that would

238
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:10,920
lingo right so anything like that would
 

239
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,309
lingo right so anything like that would
be a roo so we're hyperextending the

240
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:13,319
be a roo so we're hyperextending the
 

241
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,229
be a roo so we're hyperextending the
elbow it's a really important principle

242
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:15,239
elbow it's a really important principle
 

243
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,150
elbow it's a really important principle
because when I talk about the arm I like

244
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:17,160
because when I talk about the arm I like
 

245
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,550
because when I talk about the arm I like
to say that the arm really has three

246
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
to say that the arm really has three
 

247
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,110
to say that the arm really has three
main configurations that's hand up hand

248
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
main configurations that's hand up hand
 

249
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,310
main configurations that's hand up hand
down and straight arm right so stuff for

250
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
down and straight arm right so stuff for
 

251
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,390
down and straight arm right so stuff for
in iido that's for this is like um the

252
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:27,400
in iido that's for this is like um the
 

253
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,310
in iido that's for this is like um the
kotay Kish is for this stuff for things

254
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
kotay Kish is for this stuff for things
 

255
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,150
kotay Kish is for this stuff for things
like this or eeko Sono right so there's

256
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
like this or eeko Sono right so there's
 

257
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,550
like this or eeko Sono right so there's
lots of stuff for that for this rokio is

258
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
lots of stuff for that for this rokio is
 

259
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,909
lots of stuff for that for this rokio is
our main go-to right and that's

260
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
our main go-to right and that's
 

261
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,430
our main go-to right and that's
basically what's going to happen as I as

262
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
basically what's going to happen as I as
 

263
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,629
basically what's going to happen as I as
I work this guy some way where so like

264
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:39,639
I work this guy some way where so like
 

265
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,510
I work this guy some way where so like
if I'm really trying to turn a kod hard

266
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
if I'm really trying to turn a kod hard
 

267
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,870
if I'm really trying to turn a kod hard
and he wants to resist that he'll lock

268
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
and he wants to resist that he'll lock
 

269
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,790
and he wants to resist that he'll lock
that arm out that immediately gives me

270
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
that arm out that immediately gives me
 

271
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,510
that arm out that immediately gives me
this roko boom that I can turn into

272
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:46,520
this roko boom that I can turn into
 

273
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,590
this roko boom that I can turn into
right here so anytime I turn into that

274
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:48,600
right here so anytime I turn into that
 

275
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,629
right here so anytime I turn into that
uh elbow right there we're getting a roo

276
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
uh elbow right there we're getting a roo
 

277
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,790
uh elbow right there we're getting a roo
and so that's the principal roko and my

278
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
and so that's the principal roko and my
 

279
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,550
and so that's the principal roko and my
to is just a variation on this principle

280
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,560
to is just a variation on this principle
 

281
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,749
to is just a variation on this principle
of rokio so understanding straight arms

282
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
of rokio so understanding straight arms
 

283
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,870
of rokio so understanding straight arms
Super Key you got to be able to do it um

284
00:04:59,870 --> 00:04:59,880
Super Key you got to be able to do it um
 

285
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,430
Super Key you got to be able to do it um
there are times when other ier

286
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
there are times when other ier
 

287
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,830
there are times when other ier
techniques will make good sense off of a

288
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
techniques will make good sense off of a
 

289
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,150
techniques will make good sense off of a
straight arm right so like one of my

290
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,160
straight arm right so like one of my
 

291
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,189
straight arm right so like one of my
favorite things to show is a shag and I

292
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
favorite things to show is a shag and I
 

293
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,029
favorite things to show is a shag and I
think in the Shag talk that I did just a

294
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
think in the Shag talk that I did just a
 

295
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,469
think in the Shag talk that I did just a
little bit ago like two weeks ago I

296
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
little bit ago like two weeks ago I
 

297
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,189
little bit ago like two weeks ago I
talked about this but if I'm really

298
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:12,199
talked about this but if I'm really
 

299
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,230
talked about this but if I'm really
cranking here and he tries to pull his

300
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
cranking here and he tries to pull his
 

301
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,150
cranking here and he tries to pull his
arm back this quickly leads to a really

302
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
arm back this quickly leads to a really
 

303
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,150
arm back this quickly leads to a really
nice shag really nice shag comes out of

304
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
nice shag really nice shag comes out of
 

305
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,469
nice shag really nice shag comes out of
that and that's because I'm trying to

306
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:19,479
that and that's because I'm trying to
 

307
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,390
that and that's because I'm trying to
crank his arm there and you might say

308
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:21,400
crank his arm there and you might say
 

309
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,590
crank his arm there and you might say
you know why would you crank on his arm

310
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:24,600
you know why would you crank on his arm
 

311
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,150
you know why would you crank on his arm
like that in iido um if I was trying to

312
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,160
like that in iido um if I was trying to
 

313
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,550
like that in iido um if I was trying to
