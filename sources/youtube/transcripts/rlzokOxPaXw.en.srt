doing was you just turned it here. Then
 

121
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,790
doing was you just turned it here. Then
the then the centrifugal energy takes

00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
the then the centrifugal energy takes
 

123
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,590

172
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
Wait.
 

173
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,309
Wait.
Okay. Um,

174
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319

 

175
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,830

again ground. Okay. Ground cuz stuff

176
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
again ground. Okay. Ground cuz stuff
 

177
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,390
again ground. Okay. Ground cuz stuff
goes stuff goes wrong. Um,

178
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
goes stuff goes wrong. Um,
 

179
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,629
goes stuff goes wrong. Um,
what what I mean by this is let's say

180
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
what what I mean by this is let's say
 

181
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,270
what what I mean by this is let's say
let me

182
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
let me
 

183
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,469
let me
So I'm kind of like this. Yeah. You can

184
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
So I'm kind of like this. Yeah. You can
 

185
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,710
So I'm kind of like this. Yeah. You can
can use that force like that, right?

186
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
can use that force like that, right?
 

187
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,150
can use that force like that, right?
It's a real force. It's not a magic

188
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
It's a real force. It's not a magic
 

189
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,550
It's a real force. It's not a magic
force. But I'm not grounding there. Do

190
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
force. But I'm not grounding there. Do
 

191
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,990
force. But I'm not grounding there. Do
do you understand? So

192
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
do you understand? So
 

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,430
do you understand? So
as you're as you're doing as you're

194
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
as you're as you're doing as you're
 

195
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,070
as you're as you're doing as you're
feeling the forces you're here, someone

196
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
feeling the forces you're here, someone
 

197
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,950
feeling the forces you're here, someone
should be able and you're like let's go

198
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
should be able and you're like let's go
 

199
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,550
should be able and you're like let's go
and they're not going to move. You get

200
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
and they're not going to move. You get
 

201
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,790
and they're not going to move. You get
that? Okay. That we're kind of getting

202
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
that? Okay. That we're kind of getting
 

203
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,029
that? Okay. That we're kind of getting
floaty here.

204
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
floaty here.
 

205
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,150
floaty here.
You don't know if you're going to have

206
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
You don't know if you're going to have
 

207
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,909
You don't know if you're going to have
to hit them with the elbow or something.

208
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
to hit them with the elbow or something.
 

209
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,189
to hit them with the elbow or something.
Okay. So you have to be always in this

210
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
Okay. So you have to be always in this
 

211
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,230
Okay. So you have to be always in this
mobile stability, not just mobility.

212
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
mobile stability, not just mobility.
 

213
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,150
mobile stability, not just mobility.
Okay.

214
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
Okay.
 

215
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,909
Okay.
All right. Sh stand up. Shake it out.

216
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919

 

217
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:42,469

and get a new partner and go.

218
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479

 

219
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,150

You went with someone light. Go with

220
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
You went with someone light. Go with
 

221
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,469
You went with someone light. Go with
someone bigger.

222
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
someone bigger.
 

223
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,150
someone bigger.
Good bases.

224
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160

 

225
00:07:50,160 --> 00:08:02,309

Got to get that neck

226
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319

 

227
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,189

and the UK doesn't do anything. Some of

228
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
and the UK doesn't do anything. Some of
 

229
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,869
and the UK doesn't do anything. Some of
you are already falling just from the

230
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
you are already falling just from the
 

231
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,610
you are already falling just from the
centrifugal energy.

232
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:09,620
centrifugal energy.
 

233
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,950
centrifugal energy.

That's it.

236
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400

241
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,029

Don't wait for her, Angelo. She's

242
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
Don't wait for her, Angelo. She's
 

243
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,750
Don't wait for her, Angelo. She's
moving. Don't really start moving.

244
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
moving. Don't really start moving.
 

245
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,230
moving. Don't really start moving.
Move. Yes, there it is. Be ready. Get

246
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
Move. Yes, there it is. Be ready. Get
 

247
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,909
Move. Yes, there it is. Be ready. Get
your other hand ready. A little late on

your other hand ready. A little late on

00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
the other hand. Move. That's it. There
 

251
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,990
the other hand. Move. That's it. There
it is. Yeah, that much easier now.

252
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
it is. Yeah, that much easier now.

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,870

down. It's so easy. It gets stupid now.

256
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
down. It's so easy. It gets stupid now.
 

257
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,110
down. It's so easy. It gets stupid now.
It is. It's stupid. Okay. So, let's say

258
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
It is. It's stupid. Okay. So, let's say
 

259
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,550
It is. It's stupid. Okay. So, let's say
I go over here and this isn't working.

260
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
I go over here and this isn't working.
 

261
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,630
I go over here and this isn't working.
Well, that's where the other hand comes

262
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
Well, that's where the other hand comes
 

263
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,350
Well, that's where the other hand comes
in, right? And the same thing. Don't try

264
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
in, right? And the same thing. Don't try
 

265
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,269
in, right? And the same thing. Don't try
to hook the head. You're going to use

266
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
to hook the head. You're going to use
 

267
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,470
to hook the head. You're going to use
the centrifugal energy this way.

268
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
the centrifugal energy this way.
 

269
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,430
the centrifugal energy this way.
The same stop. See, I did that stop

270
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
The same stop. See, I did that stop
 

271
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,750
The same stop. See, I did that stop
again. Okay? And it's just if it's

272
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
again. Okay? And it's just if it's
 

273
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,590
again. Okay? And it's just if it's
there. If I'm over here, I don't cut it.

274
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
there. If I'm over here, I don't cut it.
 

275
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,030
there. If I'm over here, I don't cut it.
It's not that I am I don't know. I'm not

276
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
It's not that I am I don't know. I'm not
 

277
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,269
It's not that I am I don't know. I'm not
going like this.

278
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
going like this.
 

279
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,150
going like this.
Can you guys see that? I got to get that

280
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
Can you guys see that? I got to get that
 

281
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,750
Can you guys see that? I got to get that
other force to come back

282
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
other force to come back
 

283
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,630
other force to come back
here.

284
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
here.
 

285
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,790
here.
So by you can see that my co is going

286
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
So by you can see that my co is going
 

287
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,990
So by you can see that my co is going
changing feet. Okay, make sense? Now I'm

288
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
changing feet. Okay, make sense? Now I'm
 

289
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,070
changing feet. Okay, make sense? Now I'm
not saying do it. I'm not saying try it.

290
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
not saying do it. I'm not saying try it.
 

291
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,990
not saying do it. I'm not saying try it.
But if this is not there, that's there.

292
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
But if this is not there, that's there.
 

293
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,670
But if this is not there, that's there.
And then you're using the same force

294
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
And then you're using the same force
 

295
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,470
And then you're using the same force
just on the other side. Okay, change

296
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
just on the other side. Okay, change
 

297
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,389
just on the other side. Okay, change
partners.

298
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399

 

299
00:09:52,399 --> 00:10:01,829

That's the tension no arm.

301
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,110

Right. Try to move before she's coming.

302
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
Right. Try to move before she's coming.
 

303
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,269
Right. Try to move before she's coming.
Don't wait. Don't wait. There. There you

304
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
Don't wait. Don't wait. There. There you
 

305
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,690
Don't wait. Don't wait. There. There you
go.

306
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:12,700

That's it. Get a good face. Kind of move

310
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
That's it. Get a good face. Kind of move
 

311
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,310
That's it. Get a good face. Kind of move
like this.

312

like this.
 

313
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,990
like this.
That's it. You got to spin it back

314
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
That's it. You got to spin it back
 

315
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,190

towards you.

Okay. So, I get that going. Then a sharp
 

327
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,790
Okay. So, I get that going. Then a sharp
turn. You feel that?

328
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
turn. You feel that?
 

329
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,870
turn. You feel that?
A sharp turn. It could be fast.

You feel it? And I do the same thing on

332
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
You feel it? And I do the same thing on
 

333
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,750
You feel it? And I do the same thing on
this side. So, I'm not taking you around

334
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
this side. So, I'm not taking you around
 

335
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,110
this side. So, I'm not taking you around
the circle. Eventually, you're going to

336
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
the circle. Eventually, you're going to
 

337
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,430
the circle. Eventually, you're going to
get out of the circle.

338
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
get out of the circle.
 

339
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,230
get out of the circle.
I have to go here.

340
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
I have to go here.
 

341
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,870
I have to go here.
Okay. Does that make sense? Okay. Try

342
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
Okay. Does that make sense? Okay. Try
 

343
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,269
Okay. Does that make sense? Okay. Try
it.

344
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279

 

345
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,389

This was not This is what makes it not

346
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
This was not This is what makes it not
 

347
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,630
This was not This is what makes it not
an acceleration throw. Remember, you've

348
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
an acceleration throw. Remember, you've
 

349
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,870
an acceleration throw. Remember, you've
heard me complain about acceleration

350
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
heard me complain about acceleration
 

351
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,509
heard me complain about acceleration
throws. I'm not just accelerating him.

352
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
throws. I'm not just accelerating him.
 

353
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,949
throws. I'm not just accelerating him.
Okay, try it. And be as light as you can

354
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
Okay, try it. And be as light as you can
 

355
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,069
Okay, try it. And be as light as you can
be moving first. You're late. You're

356
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
be moving first. You're late. You're
 

357
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,509
be moving first. You're late. You're
late on the catch. Already have a good

00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
late on the catch. Already have a good
 

359
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,350
late on the catch. Already have a good
possibility

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
possibility
 

361
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,430

after there. It's time for the ball or

362
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
after there. It's time for the ball or
 

363
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,829
after there. It's time for the ball or
you got hit. Okay.

364
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
you got hit. Okay.
 

365
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:49,750
you got hit. Okay.
One more.

366
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760

 

367
00:11:49,760 --> 00:12:03,430

Feel better.

368
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
Here's
 

371
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:14,069
Here's
the inside.

So again, you got to watch me. Don't

394
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
So again, you got to watch me. Don't
 

395
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,389
So again, you got to watch me. Don't
want Don't watch.

396
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399

 

397
00:12:52,399 --> 00:13:01,110

Just look at me.

398
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120

 

399
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,069

What do I look like? That's This is what

400
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
What do I look like? That's This is what
 

401
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,870
What do I look like? That's This is what
I look like. But what's it feel like?

402
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
I look like. But what's it feel like?
 

403
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,910
I look like. But what's it feel like?
 that. Okay. Right. I'm winded and

404
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
that. Okay. Right. I'm winded and
 

405
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,590
that. Okay. Right. I'm winded and
tired already. Okay. Even you can see he

406
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
tired already. Okay. Even you can see he
 

407
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,030
tired already. Okay. Even you can see he
had a lot of downwardness, right? Why

408
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
had a lot of downwardness, right? Why
 

409
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,030
had a lot of downwardness, right? Why
would I try to go over the top of that?

410
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
would I try to go over the top of that?
 

411
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,110
would I try to go over the top of that?
I just let him go out of the way.

412
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
I just let him go out of the way.
 

413
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,870
I just let him go out of the way.
Connect from there. There's the There it

414
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
Connect from there. There's the There it
 

415
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,030
Connect from there. There's the There it
is. Okay. Try it again.

416
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,040

 

417
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,990

Lighter, lighter, lighter.

418
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000

 

419
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,240

Good base. Let's get a better base.

420
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,250

 

421
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:48,230

[Music]

422
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240

 

423
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,190

Lighter. Lighter. Last.

424
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:51,200

427
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,030

face your feet got twisted.

428
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040

 

429
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,110

Okay.

430
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120

 

431
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,470

So again if I right space time is my

432
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
So again if I right space time is my
 

433
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,389
So again if I right space time is my
that's how I define my what's the space

434
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
that's how I define my what's the space
 

435
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,189
that's how I define my what's the space
time. Okay.

436
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199

 

437
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,949

Space confidence determine what I want

438
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:22,959
Space confidence determine what I want
 

439
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,710
Space confidence determine what I want
to do, what I can do. What's my

440
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
to do, what I can do. What's my
 

441
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,790
to do, what I can do. What's my
environment incident?

442
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
environment incident?
 

443
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,350
environment incident?
It's not fully determined by what I want

444
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
It's not fully determined by what I want
 

445
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,110
It's not fully determined by what I want
to do.

446
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
to do.
 

447
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,030
to do.
I want it to come over the top. It's too

448
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
I want it to come over the top. It's too
 

449
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:44,710
I want it to come over the top. It's too
much pressure. Fine.

450
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720

 

451
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,870

But in that again I have to use the

452
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
But in that again I have to use the
 

453
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,949
But in that again I have to use the
right force engines.

454
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
right force engines.
 

455
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,189
right force engines.
Can't just use the other force engines

456
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
Can't just use the other force engines
 

457
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,829
Can't just use the other force engines
because I have to know while I'm working

458
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:55,839
because I have to know while I'm working
 

459
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,829
because I have to know while I'm working
on this technique. This technique is not

460
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
on this technique. This technique is not
 

461
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,629
on this technique. This technique is not
the fight technique.

462
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
the fight technique.
 

463
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,590
the fight technique.
The fight technique is what again what

464
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
The fight technique is what again what
 

465
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,790
The fight technique is what again what
we just said. It's totally dependent

466
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
we just said. It's totally dependent
 

467
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,949
we just said. It's totally dependent
upon the particular totality of

468
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
upon the particular totality of
 

469
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,829
upon the particular totality of
circumstances.

470
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839

 

471
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,829

So I have to be in this universal

472
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
So I have to be in this universal
 

473
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,310
So I have to be in this universal
ability. That's my true force engine.

474
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
ability. That's my true force engine.
 

475
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,310
ability. That's my true force engine.
That's all I use in my training. Okay.

476
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
That's all I use in my training. Okay.
 

477
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,710
That's all I use in my training. Okay.
So if I feeling tension, I got no I

478
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
So if I feeling tension, I got no I
 

479
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,710
So if I feeling tension, I got no I
don't don't send that round down. You

480
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
don't don't send that round down. You
 

481
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,790
don't don't send that round down. You
did not focus.

482
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
did not focus.
 

483
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,710
did not focus.
You do not see the grains on the tape.

484
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
You do not see the grains on the tape.
 

485
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,030
You do not see the grains on the tape.
You just see a haze down there in the

486
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
You just see a haze down there in the
 

487
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,509
You just see a haze down there in the
shape of a silhouette. Don't throw lead.

488
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
shape of a silhouette. Don't throw lead.
 

489
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,230
shape of a silhouette. Don't throw lead.
I feel tension or anxiety in my body.

490
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
I feel tension or anxiety in my body.
 

491
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,230
I feel tension or anxiety in my body.
Just stop.

492
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
Just stop.
 

493
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,829
Just stop.
Just stop the technique. Don't try to

494
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
Just stop the technique. Don't try to
 

495
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,230
Just stop the technique. Don't try to
get that technique anymore cuz that's

496
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
get that technique anymore cuz that's
 

497
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,550
get that technique anymore cuz that's
not the force engines. Does that make

498
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
not the force engines. Does that make
 

499
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,629
not the force engines. Does that make
sense? So that's where the discipline

500
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
sense? So that's where the discipline
 

501
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,069
sense? So that's where the discipline
comes in that you come in. You yourself,

502
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
comes in that you come in. You yourself,
 

503
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,189
comes in that you come in. You yourself,
you're going to say, "No, no, no." And

504
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
you're going to say, "No, no, no." And
 

505
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,389
you're going to say, "No, no, no." And
you're going to try for this.

506
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
you're going to try for this.

You're ahead, Chris. Don't do it. You
 

567
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,190
You're ahead, Chris. Don't do it. You
didn't have this center. You're ahead.

568
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
didn't have this center. You're ahead.
 

569

didn't have this center. You're ahead.
Maya, you're hooking.

570

571
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,150

You don't have the the reverse spiral,

572
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160
You don't have the the reverse spiral,
 

573
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,830
You don't have the the reverse spiral,
right? No base.

574
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:47,840
right? No base.
 

575
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,310
right? No base.
No reverse spirals.

00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320

 

577
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,270

There it is. Good. So, one out of four.

578
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
There it is. Good. So, one out of four.
 

579
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,350
There it is. Good. So, one out of four.
You're at 25%.

00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
You're at 25%.
 

581
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,029
You're at 25%.
Okay.

00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
Okay.
 

583
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:06,070
Okay.
So, take you train. Wait. You train.

585
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,830

Let's say you train, you had the

586
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
Let's say you train, you had the
 

587
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,750
Let's say you train, you had the
potential to train four days a week, but

588
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
potential to train four days a week, but
 

589
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,870
potential to train four days a week, but
you dropped down to one day a week,

590
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:12,880
you dropped down to one day a week,
 

591
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,950
you dropped down to one day a week,
right? You see now you do it one day a

592
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
right? You see now you do it one day a
 

593
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,549
right? You see now you do it one day a
week.

594
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
week.
 

595
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,590
week.
Someone do the math.

596
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
Someone do the math.
 

597
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,350
Someone do the math.
One day a week, 72 weeks,

598
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
One day a week, 72 weeks,
 

599
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,669
One day a week, 72 weeks,
I got 72 hours.

600
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679

 

601
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,390

Got it? Versus someone else who's

602
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,400
Got it? Versus someone else who's
 

603
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,390
Got it? Versus someone else who's
actually training,

604
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
actually training,
 

605
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,470
actually training,
accumulating the reps, four times that

606
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:34,480
accumulating the reps, four times that
 

607
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,669
accumulating the reps, four times that
amount. Same thing with Tristan. You go,

608
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
amount. Same thing with Tristan. You go,
 

609
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,310
amount. Same thing with Tristan. You go,
"Hey, it's 10 free throws. Let's get a

610
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
"Hey, it's 10 free throws. Let's get a
 

611
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,870
"Hey, it's 10 free throws. Let's get a
percentage every time so he stops

612
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
percentage every time so he stops
 

613
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,669
percentage every time so he stops
throwing up shit."

614
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
throwing up shit."
 

615
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,110
throwing up shit."
25. He shoots a 25% out of 10.

616
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
25. He shoots a 25% out of 10.
 

617
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,669
25. He shoots a 25% out of 10.
That's got to be unacceptable.

618
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
That's got to be unacceptable.
 

619
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,630
That's got to be unacceptable.
Okay? So, you got to hold yourself. You

620
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:56,640
Okay? So, you got to hold yourself. You
 

621
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,310
Okay? So, you got to hold yourself. You
don't need me. I'm not saying anything

622
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
don't need me. I'm not saying anything
 

623
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,230
don't need me. I'm not saying anything
you haven't heard already. I'm not

624
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
you haven't heard already. I'm not
 

625
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,830
you haven't heard already. I'm not
saying anything that need explaining,

626
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
saying anything that need explaining,
 

627
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,909
saying anything that need explaining,
which means you knew it. You're just not

628
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
which means you knew it. You're just not
 

629
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,110
which means you knew it. You're just not
holding yourself to it. So, sometimes I

630
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,120
holding yourself to it. So, sometimes I
 

631
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,430
holding yourself to it. So, sometimes I
go too fast for me to stay in the moment

632
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,440
go too fast for me to stay in the moment
 

633
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,230
go too fast for me to stay in the moment
because my mind is fed. Go slow. Go

634
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
because my mind is fed. Go slow. Go
 

635
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,710
because my mind is fed. Go slow. Go
slower. Just go smoother. You just can't

636
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720
slower. Just go smoother. You just can't
 

637
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,350
slower. Just go smoother. You just can't
stop. But there's no there's no rule

638
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,360
stop. But there's no there's no rule
 

639
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,310
stop. But there's no there's no rule
against how slow you're going. Just rule

640
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
against how slow you're going. Just rule
 

641
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,789
against how slow you're going. Just rule
against stopping. Okay. And try it

642
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
against stopping. Okay. And try it
 

643
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,350
against stopping. Okay. And try it
again. Tell your come in a little slower

644
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,360
again. Tell your come in a little slower
 

645
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:35,430
again. Tell your come in a little slower
for me. Go.

646
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440

657
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:59,270
perfect example of what I was talking
about.

658
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280

 

659
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,950

You got a lot of tension in your glutes.

660
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:04,960

 

661
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,630

I don't know if there's a stick up

662
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
I don't know if there's a stick up
 

663
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,710
I don't know if there's a stick up
there, but it looks like it. Okay,

664
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
there, but it looks like it. Okay,
 

665
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,150
there, but it looks like it. Okay,
relax, relax, relax, relax, relax,

666
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,160
relax, relax, relax, relax, relax,
 

667
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,029
relax, relax, relax, relax, relax,
relax. Okay,

668
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039
relax. Okay,
 

669
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,750
relax. Okay,
you're like you're like this. Okay, so

670
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
you're like you're like this. Okay, so
 

671
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,909
you're like you're like this. Okay, so
don't do that. And then the desire

672
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
don't do that. And then the desire
 

673
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,870
don't do that. And then the desire
to succeed is making it worse as you're

674
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
to succeed is making it worse as you're
 

675
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,029
to succeed is making it worse as you're
moving. So, I'll relax as long as I keep

676
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,039
moving. So, I'll relax as long as I keep
 

677
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,270
moving. So, I'll relax as long as I keep
him moving. Keep him moving.

678
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,280

 

679
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,149

get the technique. Okay. As long as I

680
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,159
get the technique. Okay. As long as I
 

681
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,470
get the technique. Okay. As long as I
keep him moving, that of course the

682
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
keep him moving, that of course the
 

683
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,110
keep him moving, that of course the
centrifugal energy together.

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,870

00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
All right. But I'm going to try to
 

687
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,149
All right. But I'm going to try to
relax. And just like today when I said

688
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
relax. And just like today when I said
 

689
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,870
relax. And just like today when I said
you're closer, you're further along in

you're closer, you're further along in

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,789
you're closer, you're further along in
the cultivation set. If you flex,

692
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
the cultivation set. If you flex,
 

693
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,270

release, and then got this place, you're

694
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280

695
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,510

closer. Same thing here. You're closer

696
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:03,520
closer. Same thing here. You're closer
 

697
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,590
closer. Same thing here. You're closer
to getting this if you release that

698
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,600
to getting this if you release that
 

699
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,470
to getting this if you release that
tension and keep him moving while the

700
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:08,480
tension and keep him moving while the
 

701
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,909
tension and keep him moving while the
tension is released than if you throw

702
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
tension is released than if you throw
 

703
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,310

him really fast and hard and we're all

him really fast and hard and we're all
stiff like this. Okay, let's go.
