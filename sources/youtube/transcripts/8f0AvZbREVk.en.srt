doubt that they'll ever get the golden

242
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
doubt that they'll ever get the golden
 

243
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,430
doubt that they'll ever get the golden
um

244
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
um
 

245
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,590
um
equivalent of this one which i think is

246
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
equivalent of this one which i think is
 

247
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,509
equivalent of this one which i think is
a million subscribers so that is not

248
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
a million subscribers so that is not
 

249
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,510
a million subscribers so that is not
going to happen but really hundred

250
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
going to happen but really hundred
 

251
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,270
going to happen but really hundred
thousand subscribers that's that's a big

252
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
thousand subscribers that's that's a big
 

253
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,830
thousand subscribers that's that's a big
