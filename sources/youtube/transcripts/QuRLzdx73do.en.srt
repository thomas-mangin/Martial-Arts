1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,949

okay so when we do the the uh

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:03,959
okay so when we do the the uh
 

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,670
okay so when we do the the uh
sensitivity releasing drill you you're

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:06,680
sensitivity releasing drill you you're
 

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,830
sensitivity releasing drill you you're
it's you got to start out with the hands

6
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:08,840
it's you got to start out with the hands
 

7
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,870
it's you got to start out with the hands
because it's a more sophisticated skill

8
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
because it's a more sophisticated skill
 

9
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,709
because it's a more sophisticated skill
that you're doing things with your body

10
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719
that you're doing things with your body
 

11
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,589
that you're doing things with your body
okay uh so now we'll do the same drill

12
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,599
okay uh so now we'll do the same drill
 

13
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,029
okay uh so now we'll do the same drill
but I know that at full speed there's

14
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:18,039
but I know that at full speed there's
 

15
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,509
but I know that at full speed there's
going to be a tou he's going to try to

16
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:20,519
going to be a tou he's going to try to
 

17
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,269
going to be a tou he's going to try to
get my Center okay and so uh no matter

18
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:24,279
get my Center okay and so uh no matter
 

19
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:27,550
get my Center okay and so uh no matter
how relaxed you are in your hands uh you

20
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:27,560
how relaxed you are in your hands uh you
 

21
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,990
how relaxed you are in your hands uh you
have to absorb that in your in your

22
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
have to absorb that in your in your
 

23
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,910
have to absorb that in your in your
Center okay which means is the energy is

24
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:32,920
Center okay which means is the energy is
 

25
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,869
Center okay which means is the energy is
going down uh and forward then my energy

26
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:36,879
going down uh and forward then my energy
 

27
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:40,270
going down uh and forward then my energy
has to go back and down as well and we

28
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:40,280
has to go back and down as well and we
 

29
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,950
has to go back and down as well and we
do this all the time in iido so if we

30
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
do this all the time in iido so if we
 

31
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,790
do this all the time in iido so if we
have a uh he has spinal displacement

32
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:45,800
have a uh he has spinal displacement
 

33
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,270
have a uh he has spinal displacement
here and we're doing eal I don't stay

34
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
here and we're doing eal I don't stay
 

35
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,950
here and we're doing eal I don't stay
upright and and just move over and try

36
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:51,960
upright and and just move over and try
 

37
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,869
upright and and just move over and try
to do the maneuver okay as as he's press

38
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:55,879
to do the maneuver okay as as he's press
 

39
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:59,470
to do the maneuver okay as as he's press
pressing there's that's where I go back

40
00:00:59,470 --> 00:00:59,480
pressing there's that's where I go back
 

41
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,869
pressing there's that's where I go back
to his his pressure and I go down to his

42
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
to his his pressure and I go down to his
 

43
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,829
to his his pressure and I go down to his
pressure and then that's where the

44
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:04,839
pressure and then that's where the
 

45
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,190
pressure and then that's where the
technique happens so very similar here

46
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,200
technique happens so very similar here
 

47
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,350
technique happens so very similar here
I'm still going to try to keep as

48
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
I'm still going to try to keep as
 

49
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,510
I'm still going to try to keep as
relaxed in my hands as possible but I'm

50
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:14,520
relaxed in my hands as possible but I'm
 

51
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,310
relaxed in my hands as possible but I'm
going to go ahead and close my fingers

52
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:17,320
going to go ahead and close my fingers
 

53
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,749
going to go ahead and close my fingers
he's going to go ahead and bring his

54
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
he's going to go ahead and bring his
 

55
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,830
he's going to go ahead and bring his
second hand into the Joe work but not

56
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:22,840
second hand into the Joe work but not
 

57
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,710
second hand into the Joe work but not
back to where we started and why we

58
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
back to where we started and why we
 

59
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,870
back to where we started and why we
needed the drill and then to the drill

60
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
needed the drill and then to the drill
 

61
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,630
needed the drill and then to the drill
I'm going to add my ground vectoring and

62
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:29,640
I'm going to add my ground vectoring and
 

63
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,069
I'm going to add my ground vectoring and
here is going to add his ground vectory

64
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
here is going to add his ground vectory
 

65
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,950
here is going to add his ground vectory
and we should still be able to do it

66
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:33,960
and we should still be able to do it
 

67
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:58,830
and we should still be able to do it
don't go fast just working on the

68
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840

 

69
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:19,910

in it's right here okay so here here he
 

103
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,029
in it's right here okay so here here he
was and just like before have your

104
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:50,039
was and just like before have your
 

105
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,670
was and just like before have your
better base there you go just like

106
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:52,680
better base there you go just like
 

107
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,510
better base there you go just like
before I have a cross how do I have that

108
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
before I have a cross how do I have that
 

109
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,909
before I have a cross how do I have that
cross I will continue the iy

110
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
cross I will continue the iy
 

111
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,629
cross I will continue the iy
adhesion under

112
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
adhesion under
 

113
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,110
adhesion under
fear I would tense up and if I tensed up

114
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,120
fear I would tense up and if I tensed up
 

115
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,270
fear I would tense up and if I tensed up
at full speed I will try to maintain

116
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
at full speed I will try to maintain
 

117
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,670
at full speed I will try to maintain
yangong at a mechanical disadvantage

118
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:14,680
yangong at a mechanical disadvantage
 

119
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,749
yangong at a mechanical disadvantage
what would happen is I'll get my foot

120
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
what would happen is I'll get my foot
 

121
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,390
what would happen is I'll get my foot
pinned on the atos on his atos and my

122
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:21,400
pinned on the atos on his atos and my
 

123
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,469
pinned on the atos on his atos and my
weapon will go flying off creating the

124
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
weapon will go flying off creating the
 

125
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,749
weapon will go flying off creating the
angle of deflection that he wanted and

126
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
angle of deflection that he wanted and
 

127
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,270
angle of deflection that he wanted and
now he would cut my hand off

128
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:30,280
now he would cut my hand off
 

129
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,390
now he would cut my hand off
okay but what my counter is because the

130
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:33,400
okay but what my counter is because the
 

131
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,990
okay but what my counter is because the
set requires me to counter is not for

132
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
set requires me to counter is not for
 

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,350
set requires me to counter is not for
him to half acid and not for me to not

134
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
him to half acid and not for me to not
 

135
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,469
him to half acid and not for me to not
engage in my thrust but to stay and

136
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:43,479
engage in my thrust but to stay and
 

137
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,469
engage in my thrust but to stay and
maintain the IE adhesion in essence I'm

138
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
maintain the IE adhesion in essence I'm
 

139
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,670
maintain the IE adhesion in essence I'm
going to do a counter rotation of the

140
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:48,680
going to do a counter rotation of the
 

141
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,710
going to do a counter rotation of the
cross that he rotated so when he goes on

142
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
cross that he rotated so when he goes on
 

143
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,270
cross that he rotated so when he goes on
his atos I keep the adhesion on the

144
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,280
his atos I keep the adhesion on the
 

145
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,909
his atos I keep the adhesion on the
inside and as he starts to come in to

146
00:06:58,909 --> 00:06:58,919
inside and as he starts to come in to
 

147
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,510
inside and as he starts to come in to
cut my hand I rotate

148
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:02,520
cut my hand I rotate
 

149
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,990
cut my hand I rotate
that okay I won't go all the way over

150
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
that okay I won't go all the way over
 

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,950
that okay I won't go all the way over
like on the first Joe rotation because

152
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
like on the first Joe rotation because
 

153
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,469
like on the first Joe rotation because
the hands I will attack from the

154
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
the hands I will attack from the
 

155
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,189
the hands I will attack from the
homolateral side and this is where I'll

156
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
homolateral side and this is where I'll
 

157
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,790
homolateral side and this is where I'll
I'll smack that down

158
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:15,800
I'll smack that down
 

159
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,670
I'll smack that down
okay so first let me just show you the

160
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:18,680
okay so first let me just show you the
 

161
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,589
okay so first let me just show you the
the hand attack because that is the

162
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:20,599
the hand attack because that is the
 

163
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,749
the hand attack because that is the
strategy of the Joe the strategy of the

164
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:24,759
strategy of the Joe the strategy of the
 

165
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,749
strategy of the Joe the strategy of the
bul in here in this set is to defang the

166
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
bul in here in this set is to defang the
 

167
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,390
bul in here in this set is to defang the

yes you didn't you didn't write it over

224
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
yes you didn't you didn't write it over
 

225
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,509
yes you didn't you didn't write it over
you let it go over yes then it comes

226
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:52,519
you let it go over yes then it comes
 

227
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,829
you let it go over yes then it comes
back got

228
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:54,839
back got
 

229
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,310
back got
it so we'll try it again okay looking at

230
00:08:59,310 --> 00:08:59,320
it so we'll try it again okay looking at
 

231
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,030
it so we'll try it again okay looking at
the Joe's strategy is to attack the

232
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,040
the Joe's strategy is to attack the
 

233
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,509
the Joe's strategy is to attack the
hands so I go up boom and here's where I

234
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:06,519
hands so I go up boom and here's where I
 

235
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,389
hands so I go up boom and here's where I
attack the hands to create my angle of

236
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:09,399
attack the hands to create my angle of
 

237
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,750
attack the hands to create my angle of
deflection there's my angle of attack

238
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
deflection there's my angle of attack
 

239
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,150
deflection there's my angle of attack
now and now I'm going to do it again as

240
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
now and now I'm going to do it again as
 

241
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,550
now and now I'm going to do it again as
he comes

242
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:15,560
he comes
 

243
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,470
he comes
back boom I'm going to attack the hands

244
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
back boom I'm going to attack the hands
 

245
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,990
back boom I'm going to attack the hands
there in

246
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,000
there in
 

247
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,110
there in
makios again why does the Joe do this

248
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,120
makios again why does the Joe do this
 

249
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,269
makios again why does the Joe do this
well this has an advantage in it's

250
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:28,279
well this has an advantage in it's
 

251
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,310
well this has an advantage in it's
trying to defang the snake if I never

252
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
trying to defang the snake if I never
 

253
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,550
trying to defang the snake if I never
let it get out of the gate it's not

254
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
let it get out of the gate it's not
 

255
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,150
let it get out of the gate it's not
going to defang the snake also my

256
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,160
going to defang the snake also my
 

257
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,230
going to defang the snake also my
follow-up attack is a ski and I don't

258
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
follow-up attack is a ski and I don't
 

259
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,310
follow-up attack is a ski and I don't
want him running away from the ski for

260
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:41,320
want him running away from the ski for
 

261
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,069
want him running away from the ski for
me to have a viable ski I have to have

262
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:45,079
me to have a viable ski I have to have
 

263
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:49,190
me to have a viable ski I have to have
resistance to the weapon so he if I

264
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
resistance to the weapon so he if I
 

265
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,150
resistance to the weapon so he if I
plant him and have downward energy his

266
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
plant him and have downward energy his
 

267
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,190
plant him and have downward energy his
MK plus that inertia is now going to add

268
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
MK plus that inertia is now going to add
 

269
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,590
MK plus that inertia is now going to add
resistance to the ski generating

270
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
resistance to the ski generating
 

271
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,990
resistance to the ski generating
opposing forces at impact making it more

272
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,000

damaging so I have to try to pin him

274
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
damaging so I have to try to pin him
 

275
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,509
damaging so I have to try to pin him
okay so we go again one two

276
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:10,519
okay so we go again one two
 

277
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:15,670
okay so we go again one two

uh
 

299
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,190
uh
it comes straight down the weapon

300
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
it comes straight down the weapon
 

301
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,790
it comes straight down the weapon
straight down the

weapon two hands hit the
 

305
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:20,069
weapon two hands hit the
atos okay and then you spin

306
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079

 

307
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,310

it careful you're you're not moving it

308
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:23,320
it careful you're you're not moving it
 

309
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,310
it careful you're you're not moving it
that way

310
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
that way
 

311
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,069
that way
okay so that's the first it does doesn't

312
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:29,079
okay so that's the first it does doesn't
 

313
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:30,590
okay so that's the first it does doesn't
move laterally it comes straight down to

314
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:30,600
move laterally it comes straight down to
 

315
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,030
move laterally it comes straight down to

and it hits with two hands the second

322
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
and it hits with two hands the second
 

323
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,550
and it hits with two hands the second
common mistake rewind a little is that

324
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:45,560
common mistake rewind a little is that
 

325
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,590
common mistake rewind a little is that
people hit with one

326
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
people hit with one
 

327
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,629
people hit with one
hand on the spin no it hits with two

328
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
hand on the spin no it hits with two
 

329
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,430
hand on the spin no it hits with two
hands and then the third common mistake

330
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
hands and then the third common mistake
 

331
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,350
hands and then the third common mistake
is a hit and then spin it it's not it I

332
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:58,360
is a hit and then spin it it's not it I
 

333
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,550
is a hit and then spin it it's not it I
hit with two hands and immediately it

334
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:01,560
hit with two hands and immediately it
 

335
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,550
hit with two hands and immediately it
transitions into the spin to give me

336
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
transitions into the spin to give me
 

337
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,750
transitions into the spin to give me
that little extra bit of deflection and

338
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
that little extra bit of deflection and
 

339
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,550
that little extra bit of deflection and

with one I'm hitting with one hand cuz
I'm going to turn it third mistake I hit

350
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:27,480
I'm going to turn it third mistake I hit
 

351
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,030
I'm going to turn it third mistake I hit
and then turn it after the five the

352
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,040
and then turn it after the five the
 

353
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,389
and then turn it after the five the
movement is going to

354
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
movement is going to
 

355
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,910
movement is going to
go so I hit with two hands and

356
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:36,920
go so I hit with two hands and
 

357

00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,030
mistakes
lateral no correction straight down

366
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
lateral no correction straight down
 

367
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,470

second mistake one hand a tush cuz

368
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:55,480
second mistake one hand a tush cuz
 

369
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,389
second mistake one hand a tush cuz
you're turning it no two hands hit boom

370
00:13:59,389 --> 00:13:59,399
you're turning it no two hands hit boom
 

371
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,949
you're turning it no two hands hit boom
is where you do it third mistake is two

372
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:03,959
is where you do it third mistake is two
 

373
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,030
is where you do it third mistake is two
hands hit and then this is after the

374
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,040
hands hit and then this is after the
 

375
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,350
hands hit and then this is after the
fact no it goes together and around okay

376
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
fact no it goes together and around okay
 

377
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:27,670
fact no it goes together and around okay
let's try it

378
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680

 

379
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680

again
