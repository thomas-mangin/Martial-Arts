Nagaywaza. I've already given you guys a
 

33
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,069
Nagaywaza. I've already given you guys a
Nagaywaza overview and talked basically

34
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
Nagaywaza overview and talked basically
 

35
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,229
Nagaywaza overview and talked basically
about how I think about the Nagaywaza.

36
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
about how I think about the Nagaywaza.
 

37
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,990
about how I think about the Nagaywaza.
And I think there are seven orthodox

38
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
And I think there are seven orthodox
 

39
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,590
And I think there are seven orthodox
Nagwaza. So, Kokyag, Kaitenag, Koshi

40
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
Nagwaza. So, Kokyag, Kaitenag, Koshi
 

41
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,150
Nagwaza. So, Kokyag, Kaitenag, Koshi
Nag, Kagash, Idimag, Shihonag, and

42
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
Nag, Kagash, Idimag, Shihonag, and
 

43
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,350
Nag, Kagash, Idimag, Shihonag, and
Jujinag. So, those are not, of course,

44
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360
Jujinag. So, those are not, of course,
 

45
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,189
Jujinag. So, those are not, of course,
all the throws that exist in Aikido.

46
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
all the throws that exist in Aikido.
 

47
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,389
all the throws that exist in Aikido.
There's tons of other throws, right?

48
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
There's tons of other throws, right?
 

49
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,990
There's tons of other throws, right?
Teninag is a good example. A lot of

50
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
Teninag is a good example. A lot of
 

51
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,549
Teninag is a good example. A lot of
styles have teninagumoto

52
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
styles have teninagumoto
 

53
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,270
styles have teninagumoto
tosh, mayotosh, iikyotosh, tons of other

54
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
tosh, mayotosh, iikyotosh, tons of other
 

55
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,870
tosh, mayotosh, iikyotosh, tons of other
throws that you see in iikido styles,

56
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
throws that you see in iikido styles,
 

57
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,310
throws that you see in iikido styles,
but those seven, you're kind of

58
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
but those seven, you're kind of
 

59
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,870
but those seven, you're kind of
hardressed to not find some variation of

60
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
hardressed to not find some variation of
 

61
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,390
hardressed to not find some variation of
those. And they might use a different

62
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
those. And they might use a different
 

63
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,950
those. And they might use a different
name, but the way those throws play out,

64
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
name, but the way those throws play out,
 

65
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,510
name, but the way those throws play out,
they exist kind of in all iikido styles.

66
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
they exist kind of in all iikido styles.
 

67
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,390
they exist kind of in all iikido styles.
So, uh, once I kind of figured that out,

68
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
So, uh, once I kind of figured that out,
 

69
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,310
So, uh, once I kind of figured that out,
I just I geared all of my training

70
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
I just I geared all of my training
 

71
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,070
I just I geared all of my training
basically towards those seven and and

72
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
basically towards those seven and and
 

73
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,429
basically towards those seven and and
those are the main throws we learn in

74
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
those are the main throws we learn in
 

75
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,789
those are the main throws we learn in
the school. And you know about a year a

76
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
the school. And you know about a year a
 

77
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,230
the school. And you know about a year a
little more than a year or so back about

78
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
little more than a year or so back about
 

79
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,510
little more than a year or so back about
the time actually that I was working on

80
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
the time actually that I was working on
 

81
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,149
the time actually that I was working on
the um the the Nagaywaza overview I was

82
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
the um the the Nagaywaza overview I was
 

83
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,109
the um the the Nagaywaza overview I was
kind of thinking about why why why are

84
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
kind of thinking about why why why are
 

85
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,710
kind of thinking about why why why are
those you know and and the thoughts have

86
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:38,720
those you know and and the thoughts have
 

87
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,990
those you know and and the thoughts have
kind of come through my head at

88
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
kind of come through my head at
 

89
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,590
kind of come through my head at
different times and and now I just kind

90
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
different times and and now I just kind
 

91
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,950
different times and and now I just kind
of have a different way to talk about it

92
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
of have a different way to talk about it
 

93
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,710
of have a different way to talk about it
and uh I'm just just kind of just

94
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
and uh I'm just just kind of just
 

95
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,990
and uh I'm just just kind of just
working into this new way talking about

96
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
working into this new way talking about
 

97
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,749
working into this new way talking about
and I think it makes a lot of sense. So

98
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
and I think it makes a lot of sense. So
 

99
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,670
and I think it makes a lot of sense. So
let's look at our basic positions that

100
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
let's look at our basic positions that
 

101
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,389
let's look at our basic positions that
we have right. So we have muhani and

102
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
we have right. So we have muhani and
 

103
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,149
we have right. So we have muhani and
that's without hanmi and I'm square to

104
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
that's without hanmi and I'm square to
 

105
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,230
that's without hanmi and I'm square to
Josh and in iikido situation this is the

106
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
Josh and in iikido situation this is the
 

107
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,590
Josh and in iikido situation this is the
worst position and the reason for that

108
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
worst position and the reason for that
 

109
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,429
worst position and the reason for that
simple Josh is going to be stronger and

110
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
simple Josh is going to be stronger and
 

111
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,630
simple Josh is going to be stronger and
better than me so he's going to beat me

112
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
better than me so he's going to beat me
 

113
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,789
better than me so he's going to beat me
in this position. So I always want some

114
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
in this position. So I always want some
 

115
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,429
in this position. So I always want some
kind of positional advantage. So the

116
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
kind of positional advantage. So the
 

117
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,350
kind of positional advantage. So the
first thing that's not terrible in

118
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
first thing that's not terrible in
 

119
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,830
first thing that's not terrible in
iikido is a hanmi right? Okay. And so

120
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
iikido is a hanmi right? Okay. And so
 

121
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,110
iikido is a hanmi right? Okay. And so
from hani we have gaku hani and ihani

122
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
from hani we have gaku hani and ihani
 

123
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,790
from hani we have gaku hani and ihani
depending on how I'm aligned to him.

124
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
depending on how I'm aligned to him.
 

125
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,190
depending on how I'm aligned to him.
Right. Okay. Then an improved position

126
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
Right. Okay. Then an improved position
 

127
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,949
Right. Okay. Then an improved position
from that's hitoi side by side and

128
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
from that's hitoi side by side and
 

129
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,309
from that's hitoi side by side and
there's you know several ways to do

130
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
there's you know several ways to do
 

131
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,710
there's you know several ways to do
hitoi but we're side by side and then

132
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
hitoi but we're side by side and then
 

133
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,949
hitoi but we're side by side and then
edi the best position I'm behind him.

134
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959
edi the best position I'm behind him.
 

135
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,830
edi the best position I'm behind him.
Okay. Now, when we're looking at our

136
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
Okay. Now, when we're looking at our
 

137
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,589
Okay. Now, when we're looking at our
nagwaza, what is it we're trying to do?

138
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
nagwaza, what is it we're trying to do?
 

139
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,869
nagwaza, what is it we're trying to do?
So, in nagwaza, we are trying to move

140
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
So, in nagwaza, we are trying to move
 

141
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,869
So, in nagwaza, we are trying to move
someone away from us. That's what nag

142
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
someone away from us. That's what nag
 

143
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,070
someone away from us. That's what nag
means to project away. And because of

144
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
means to project away. And because of
 

145
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,589
means to project away. And because of
the way we think about martial arts, we

146
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
the way we think about martial arts, we
 

147
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,990
the way we think about martial arts, we
tend to think that throwing naga has to

148
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
tend to think that throwing naga has to
 

149
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,589
tend to think that throwing naga has to
do with throwing something on the

150
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
do with throwing something on the
 

151
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,589
do with throwing something on the
ground, right? But that's kind of weird

152
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
ground, right? But that's kind of weird
 

153
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,350
ground, right? But that's kind of weird
because in English, if I say throw

154
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
because in English, if I say throw
 

155
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,430
because in English, if I say throw
something, no one throws it like that,

156
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
something, no one throws it like that,
 

157
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,350
something, no one throws it like that,
right? Everyone almost always throws it

158
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
right? Everyone almost always throws it
 

159
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,670
right? Everyone almost always throws it
out. Okay? So projecting something out

160
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
out. Okay? So projecting something out
 

161
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,509
out. Okay? So projecting something out
is another way to do nagwaza. And I've

162
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
is another way to do nagwaza. And I've
 

163
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,030
is another way to do nagwaza. And I've
talked about this before, but I think

164
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
talked about this before, but I think
 

165
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,630
talked about this before, but I think
it's important to understand when I'm

166
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
it's important to understand when I'm
 

167
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,949
it's important to understand when I'm
doing nagwaza, I just want someone away

168
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
doing nagwaza, I just want someone away
 

169
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,710
doing nagwaza, I just want someone away
from me. That's the whole purpose of

170
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
from me. That's the whole purpose of
 

171
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,710
from me. That's the whole purpose of
nagwaza. So if we ask why might I need

172
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
nagwaza. So if we ask why might I need
 

173
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,030
nagwaza. So if we ask why might I need
to do nagwaza? Well, it's because other

174
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
to do nagwaza? Well, it's because other
 

175
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,710
to do nagwaza? Well, it's because other
stuff's not working out for me and

176
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
stuff's not working out for me and
 

177
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,309
stuff's not working out for me and
they're close to me. Now, they're going

178
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
they're close to me. Now, they're going
 

179
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,910
they're close to me. Now, they're going
to be close to me in one of those

180
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
to be close to me in one of those
 

181
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,229
to be close to me in one of those
positions we just talked about, right?

182
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
positions we just talked about, right?
 

183
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,910
positions we just talked about, right?
Okay. For the purpose of the naggi was

184
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:17,920
Okay. For the purpose of the naggi was
 

185
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,790
Okay. For the purpose of the naggi was
in the way I'm going to talk about it

186
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
in the way I'm going to talk about it
 

187
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,589
in the way I'm going to talk about it
right now. We're going to look at muhani

188
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
right now. We're going to look at muhani
 

189
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,790
right now. We're going to look at muhani
and hanmi about in the same situation

190
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:24,800
and hanmi about in the same situation
 

191
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,470
and hanmi about in the same situation
and they're really not very good because

192
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
and they're really not very good because
 

193
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,309
and they're really not very good because
I'm still on this frontal plane of Josh

194
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
I'm still on this frontal plane of Josh
 

195
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,390
I'm still on this frontal plane of Josh
where Josh has got a lot of power. So

196
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
where Josh has got a lot of power. So
 

197
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,229
where Josh has got a lot of power. So
yes, it's a little better for me here

198
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
yes, it's a little better for me here
 

199
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,990
yes, it's a little better for me here
and I I need to at least be in this

200
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
and I I need to at least be in this
 

201
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,910
and I I need to at least be in this
position to be doing some kind of iikido

202
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
position to be doing some kind of iikido
 

203
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,190
position to be doing some kind of iikido
stuff. It's always the first place I'm

204
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
stuff. It's always the first place I'm
 

205
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,430
stuff. It's always the first place I'm
getting but it's not hugely better for

206
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
getting but it's not hugely better for
 

207
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,509
getting but it's not hugely better for
me. This is significantly better. Right.

208
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
me. This is significantly better. Right.
 

209
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,430
me. This is significantly better. Right.
So Josh is much more weakened in the

210
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
So Josh is much more weakened in the
 

211
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,509
So Josh is much more weakened in the
state. Um, and then this of course is

212
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
state. Um, and then this of course is
 

213
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,470
state. Um, and then this of course is
way better. In iikido, we're working

214
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
way better. In iikido, we're working
 

215
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,830
way better. In iikido, we're working
throws from the most common position,

216
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
throws from the most common position,
 

217
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,509
throws from the most common position,
which I believe in Iikido is going to be

218
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
which I believe in Iikido is going to be
 

219
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,149
which I believe in Iikido is going to be
in just turn he side by side. Okay? And

220
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
in just turn he side by side. Okay? And
 

221
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,309
in just turn he side by side. Okay? And
it's because this is what we're likely

222
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
it's because this is what we're likely
 

223
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,550
it's because this is what we're likely
to get into when we're doing stuff. If

224
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
to get into when we're doing stuff. If
 

225
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,990
to get into when we're doing stuff. If
you wrestle around with weapons, you'll

226
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
you wrestle around with weapons, you'll
 

227
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,309
you wrestle around with weapons, you'll
find yourself in this position all the

228
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
find yourself in this position all the
 

229
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,830
find yourself in this position all the
time, right? If you're doing rondor,

230
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
time, right? If you're doing rondor,
 

231
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,949
time, right? If you're doing rondor,
you're going to find yourself in this

232
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
you're going to find yourself in this
 

233
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,589
you're going to find yourself in this
position all the time. So, this is where

234
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
position all the time. So, this is where
 

235
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,229
position all the time. So, this is where
the majority of our throws come from.

236
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
the majority of our throws come from.
 

237
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,270
the majority of our throws come from.
And we have fewer throws back here and

238
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
And we have fewer throws back here and
 

239
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,469
And we have fewer throws back here and
fewer throws up here. Okay, so I know I

240
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
fewer throws up here. Okay, so I know I
 

241
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,909
fewer throws up here. Okay, so I know I
know I'm taking a long time to get here,

242
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
know I'm taking a long time to get here,
 

243
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,230
know I'm taking a long time to get here,
but um I I'm setting this up so you guys

244
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
but um I I'm setting this up so you guys
 

245
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,950
but um I I'm setting this up so you guys
can can follow along. There are only two

246
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
can can follow along. There are only two
 

247
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,430
can can follow along. There are only two
major iikido throws that happen from

248
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
major iikido throws that happen from
 

249
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,670
major iikido throws that happen from
this frontal position. Okay, those

250
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
this frontal position. Okay, those
 

251
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,030
this frontal position. Okay, those
throws are koshi nag and kitanag. Those

252
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
throws are koshi nag and kitanag. Those
 

253
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,950
throws are koshi nag and kitanag. Those
are the major throws that happen from

254
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
are the major throws that happen from
 

255
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,310
are the major throws that happen from
here. If Josh is overwhelming me on this

256
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
here. If Josh is overwhelming me on this
 

257
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,070
here. If Josh is overwhelming me on this
line, right? So he's overwhelming me on

258
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
line, right? So he's overwhelming me on
 

259
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,310
line, right? So he's overwhelming me on
this line. I have basically two options.

260
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
this line. I have basically two options.
 

261
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,070
this line. I have basically two options.
One, he's overwhelming me like this

262
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
One, he's overwhelming me like this
 

263
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,310
One, he's overwhelming me like this
where he's high and I go low and this

264
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
where he's high and I go low and this
 

265
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,510
where he's high and I go low and this
sets up our koshi nag, right? Okay. Or

266
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
sets up our koshi nag, right? Okay. Or
 

267
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,749
sets up our koshi nag, right? Okay. Or
he's overwhelming me and he's going low

268
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
he's overwhelming me and he's going low
 

269
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,150
he's overwhelming me and he's going low
and that's our kitanag. Okay. So that's

270
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
and that's our kitanag. Okay. So that's
 

271
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,430
and that's our kitanag. Okay. So that's
why we have two throws from the front

272
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
why we have two throws from the front
 

273
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,990
why we have two throws from the front
position. I can't get out of the front

274
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
position. I can't get out of the front
 

275
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,830
position. I can't get out of the front
position. And Josh is either going to be

276
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
position. And Josh is either going to be
 

277
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,749
position. And Josh is either going to be
a high Josh or a low Josh. If he's a

278
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
a high Josh or a low Josh. If he's a
 

279
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,590
a high Josh or a low Josh. If he's a
high Josh, I go low. That gives me

280
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
high Josh, I go low. That gives me
 

281
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,029
high Josh, I go low. That gives me
advantage. He falls over me. That's

282
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
advantage. He falls over me. That's
 

283
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,430
advantage. He falls over me. That's
koshiag. or Josh is going to try to get

284
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
koshiag. or Josh is going to try to get
 

285
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,070
koshiag. or Josh is going to try to get
under me and I do kitanag by turning and

286
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
under me and I do kitanag by turning and
 

287
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,150
under me and I do kitanag by turning and
that gives us kiteanag. So there's only

288
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
that gives us kiteanag. So there's only
 

289
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,990
that gives us kiteanag. So there's only
two throws that happen from here. Now

290
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
two throws that happen from here. Now
 

291
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,830
two throws that happen from here. Now
when we're investigating forearms and

292
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
when we're investigating forearms and
 

293
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,350
when we're investigating forearms and
trying to understand how stuff works,

294
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
trying to understand how stuff works,
 

295
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,350
trying to understand how stuff works,
this a lot of times confuses us and

296
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
this a lot of times confuses us and
 

297
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,270
this a lot of times confuses us and
makes us go to a bad position. So for

298
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
makes us go to a bad position. So for
 

299
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,950
makes us go to a bad position. So for
example, if we were doing katate dori

300
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
example, if we were doing katate dori
 

301
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,270
example, if we were doing katate dori
koshinag, in order to do katori koshag,

302
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
koshinag, in order to do katori koshag,
 

303
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,590
koshinag, in order to do katori koshag,
I have to go to a worse position than I

304
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
I have to go to a worse position than I
 

305
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,710
I have to go to a worse position than I
was in and then do my throw. Okay. The

306
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
was in and then do my throw. Okay. The
 

307
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,189
was in and then do my throw. Okay. The
problem with that is we don't we we

308
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
problem with that is we don't we we
 

309
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,430
problem with that is we don't we we
think that the throw for some reason is

310
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
think that the throw for some reason is
 

311
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,950
think that the throw for some reason is
more important than the position we're

312
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
more important than the position we're
 

313
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,189
more important than the position we're
in. And that's not true because actually

314
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
in. And that's not true because actually
 

315
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,310
in. And that's not true because actually
what's happening is I'm not going here.

316
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
what's happening is I'm not going here.
 

317
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,270
what's happening is I'm not going here.
Josh is coming here to get me. And as he

318
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
Josh is coming here to get me. And as he
 

319
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,029
Josh is coming here to get me. And as he
comes here to get me, I let him come to

320
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
comes here to get me, I let him come to
 

321
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,189
comes here to get me, I let him come to
get me. And that gives me a koshiaki.

322
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
get me. And that gives me a koshiaki.
 

323
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,029
get me. And that gives me a koshiaki.
Sorry, Violet. And you weren't prepared

324
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
Sorry, Violet. And you weren't prepared
 

325
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,390
Sorry, Violet. And you weren't prepared
for that. But um so I was watching. So

326
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
for that. But um so I was watching. So
 

327
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,830
for that. But um so I was watching. So
Oh, my mic packed. That was that was

328
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
Oh, my mic packed. That was that was
 

329
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,350
Oh, my mic packed. That was that was
sweet of you. Um anyway, so so the koshi

330
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
sweet of you. Um anyway, so so the koshi
 

331
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,990
sweet of you. Um anyway, so so the koshi
nag comes from him coming around to get

332
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
nag comes from him coming around to get
 

333
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,670
nag comes from him coming around to get
me better, right? So that's what he's

334
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
me better, right? So that's what he's
 

335
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,029
me better, right? So that's what he's
looking for is to come around and get me

336
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
looking for is to come around and get me
 

337
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,150
looking for is to come around and get me
better. So that's why I have to do

338
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
better. So that's why I have to do
 

339
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,870
better. So that's why I have to do
koshag. Okay, we could also be at an

340
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
koshag. Okay, we could also be at an
 

341
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,550
koshag. Okay, we could also be at an
inside position like this and Josh tries

342
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
inside position like this and Josh tries
 

343
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,550
inside position like this and Josh tries
to get under my arm and then that's what

344
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
to get under my arm and then that's what
 

345
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,029
to get under my arm and then that's what
sets up our kiteag. So the frontal

346
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
sets up our kiteag. So the frontal
 

347
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,749
sets up our kiteag. So the frontal
position has koshag and kitanag. So if

348
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:19,759
position has koshag and kitanag. So if
 

349
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,110
position has koshag and kitanag. So if
you start to understand that's like well

350
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
you start to understand that's like well
 

351
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,469
you start to understand that's like well
if I'm stuck in that position the way I

352
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
if I'm stuck in that position the way I
 

353
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,629
if I'm stuck in that position the way I
project someone away is either I go low

354
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
project someone away is either I go low
 

355
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,790
project someone away is either I go low
and they go over the top or they go low

356
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
and they go over the top or they go low
 

357
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,189
and they go over the top or they go low
and I go on top and and do kitanag but

358
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
and I go on top and and do kitanag but
 

359
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,029
and I go on top and and do kitanag but
turning. Okay now the sidebyside

360
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
turning. Okay now the sidebyside
 

361
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,710
turning. Okay now the sidebyside
position there's a ton of things that

362
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
position there's a ton of things that
 

363
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,150
position there's a ton of things that
are going to happen from this. Now we

364
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
are going to happen from this. Now we
 

365
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,390
are going to happen from this. Now we
will again get kitanag. So if Josh came

366
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
will again get kitanag. So if Josh came
 

367
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,790
will again get kitanag. So if Josh came
low from this position I do kiteanag

368
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
low from this position I do kiteanag
 

369
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,230
low from this position I do kiteanag
right? So that works just the same from

370
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
right? So that works just the same from
 

371
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,350
right? So that works just the same from
hitoi. It's our basic technique for low

372
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
hitoi. It's our basic technique for low
 

373
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,830
hitoi. It's our basic technique for low
stuff. However we're going to get a lot

374
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
stuff. However we're going to get a lot
 

375
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,070
stuff. However we're going to get a lot
of other throws from here as well.

376
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
of other throws from here as well.
 

377
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,309
of other throws from here as well.
Kokunag is our main throw from here.

378
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
Kokunag is our main throw from here.
 

379
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,990
Kokunag is our main throw from here.
This throw coming through like this,

380
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
This throw coming through like this,
 

381
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,189
This throw coming through like this,
right? Where I'm shearing his hips in

382
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
right? Where I'm shearing his hips in
 

383
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,189
right? Where I'm shearing his hips in
half. Okay. Now, that can be done this

384
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
half. Okay. Now, that can be done this
 

385
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,309
half. Okay. Now, that can be done this
way. And this is going to look tricky

386
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
way. And this is going to look tricky
 

387
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,909
way. And this is going to look tricky
because it's gonna look like an edi for

388
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
because it's gonna look like an edi for
 

389
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,029
because it's gonna look like an edi for
a second. And I believe a version of

390
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
a second. And I believe a version of
 

391
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,110
a second. And I believe a version of
Edidy Minag does this, but I could also

392
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
Edidy Minag does this, but I could also
 

393
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,110
Edidy Minag does this, but I could also
do it like this, right? So either way,

394
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
do it like this, right? So either way,
 

395
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,790
do it like this, right? So either way,
where I'm facing same side as him or

396
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
where I'm facing same side as him or
 

397
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,629
where I'm facing same side as him or
opposite him. By throwing my hips

398
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
opposite him. By throwing my hips
 

399
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,070
opposite him. By throwing my hips
through his, I start to knock him away

400
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
through his, I start to knock him away
 

401
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,589
through his, I start to knock him away
from me. Right now, understand, I don't

402
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
from me. Right now, understand, I don't
 

403
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,350
from me. Right now, understand, I don't
care if he falls. If he just stumbles

404
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
care if he falls. If he just stumbles
 

405
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,589
care if he falls. If he just stumbles
away when I do this, I got the distance

406
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
away when I do this, I got the distance
 

407
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,510
away when I do this, I got the distance
I want. Right? So that's very valuable

408
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
I want. Right? So that's very valuable
 

409
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,909
I want. Right? So that's very valuable
to me. So, our main throw from Hitoi is

410
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
to me. So, our main throw from Hitoi is
 

411
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,510
to me. So, our main throw from Hitoi is
going to be kokunag. That's going to be

412
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
going to be kokunag. That's going to be
 

413
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,390
going to be kokunag. That's going to be
an important throw. Okay. But what if he

414
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
an important throw. Okay. But what if he
 

415
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,230
an important throw. Okay. But what if he
had something in his hand and I had to

416
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
had something in his hand and I had to
 

417
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,469
had something in his hand and I had to
check it or I had something in my hand

418
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
check it or I had something in my hand
 

419
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,629
check it or I had something in my hand
and he wants to check it, right? Then

420
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
and he wants to check it, right? Then
 

421
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,909
and he wants to check it, right? Then
we're going to get a lot of other

422
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
we're going to get a lot of other
 

423
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,749
we're going to get a lot of other
throws. So, for example, let's say he

424
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
throws. So, for example, let's say he
 

425
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,350
throws. So, for example, let's say he
was holding this hand. So, we went to

426
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
was holding this hand. So, we went to
 

427
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,350
was holding this hand. So, we went to
gaku, right? Maybe I came over here,

428
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
gaku, right? Maybe I came over here,
 

429
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,710
gaku, right? Maybe I came over here,
bang, and I tried to get him off with a

430
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
bang, and I tried to get him off with a
 

431
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,790
bang, and I tried to get him off with a
royo or something. It doesn't work. If I

432
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
royo or something. It doesn't work. If I
 

433
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,230
royo or something. It doesn't work. If I
switched and put the knife in this hand

434
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
switched and put the knife in this hand
 

435
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,749
switched and put the knife in this hand
and come here, we're going to get all

436
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
and come here, we're going to get all
 

437
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,550
and come here, we're going to get all
juji stuff, right? Same situation. If I

438
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
juji stuff, right? Same situation. If I
 

439
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,749
juji stuff, right? Same situation. If I
had his hand here and I'm going to do

440
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
had his hand here and I'm going to do
 

441
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,670
had his hand here and I'm going to do
Rokio and he comes to attack me high

442
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:47,680
Rokio and he comes to attack me high
 

443
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,950
Rokio and he comes to attack me high
with that other hand, then we're going

444
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
with that other hand, then we're going
 

445
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,230
with that other hand, then we're going
to go here and we're going to get Juji

446
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
to go here and we're going to get Juji
 

447
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,990
to go here and we're going to get Juji
again. So Juji is the throw we're going

448
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
again. So Juji is the throw we're going
 

449
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,469
again. So Juji is the throw we're going
to go to from Hito and me. If we're

450
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
to go to from Hito and me. If we're
 

451
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,629
to go to from Hito and me. If we're
striking and holding a hand, right?

452
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
striking and holding a hand, right?
 

453
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,749
striking and holding a hand, right?
That's the throw that's going to happen.

454
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
That's the throw that's going to happen.
 

455
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,230
That's the throw that's going to happen.
That's jujag. Our arms become entangled.

456
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
That's jujag. Our arms become entangled.
 

457
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,469
That's jujag. Our arms become entangled.
Now, what if I'm isolating a hand? Okay.

458
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
Now, what if I'm isolating a hand? Okay.
 

459
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,390
Now, what if I'm isolating a hand? Okay.
So, I could be isolating a hand like

460
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400
So, I could be isolating a hand like
 

461
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,469
So, I could be isolating a hand like
this and we're going to get kaggishas

462
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
this and we're going to get kaggishas
 

463
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,390
this and we're going to get kaggishas
from that, right? So, so meaning I need

464
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
from that, right? So, so meaning I need
 

465
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,589
from that, right? So, so meaning I need
to get this guy away from me, but I got

466
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
to get this guy away from me, but I got
 

467
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,790
to get this guy away from me, but I got
to hold this hand when I do it. I'm

468
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
to hold this hand when I do it. I'm
 

469
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,550
to hold this hand when I do it. I'm
going to tear at it this way and that's

470
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
going to tear at it this way and that's
 

471
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,670
going to tear at it this way and that's
going to give me a projection. and he's

472
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
going to give me a projection. and he's
 

473
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,270
going to give me a projection. and he's
going to stumble away from me that way

474
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
going to stumble away from me that way
 

475
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,510
going to stumble away from me that way
while I'm checking for this hand, right?

476
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
while I'm checking for this hand, right?
 

477
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,270
while I'm checking for this hand, right?
Same would be true if he had my hand in

478
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
Same would be true if he had my hand in
 

479
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,950
Same would be true if he had my hand in
some kind of configuration, right? And I

480
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
some kind of configuration, right? And I
 

481
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,469
some kind of configuration, right? And I
came up here like this and I get a I get

482
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
came up here like this and I get a I get
 

483
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,790
came up here like this and I get a I get
a kodish, right? So, we're isolating a

484
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
a kodish, right? So, we're isolating a
 

485
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,350
a kodish, right? So, we're isolating a
hand. And the same is true for shihonag

486
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
hand. And the same is true for shihonag
 

487
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,110
hand. And the same is true for shihonag
if we're isolating a hand and continuing

488
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
if we're isolating a hand and continuing
 

489
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,029
if we're isolating a hand and continuing
soot to the backside. So, if I'm

490
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
soot to the backside. So, if I'm
 

491
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,790
soot to the backside. So, if I'm
isolating his hand here and I want to

492
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
isolating his hand here and I want to
 

493
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,029
isolating his hand here and I want to
turn to the backside, we get a shihonag

494
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
turn to the backside, we get a shihonag
 

495
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,949
turn to the backside, we get a shihonag
for it. And if he was holding me,

496
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
for it. And if he was holding me,
 

497
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,790
for it. And if he was holding me,
exactly the same thing. And I turn to

498
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
exactly the same thing. And I turn to
 

499
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,110
exactly the same thing. And I turn to
the backside and we get a koshag for or

500
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
the backside and we get a koshag for or
 

501
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,310
the backside and we get a koshag for or
sorry shyonag for it. Right? So shionag

502
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
sorry shyonag for it. Right? So shionag
 

503
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,750
sorry shyonag for it. Right? So shionag
are going to appear because we're

504
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
are going to appear because we're
 

505
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,509
are going to appear because we're
isolating a hand. Kagashas are going to

506
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
isolating a hand. Kagashas are going to
 

507
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,269
isolating a hand. Kagashas are going to
appear because we're isolating a hand.

508
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:49,279
appear because we're isolating a hand.
 

509
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,949
appear because we're isolating a hand.
Jujinag are going to appear because

510
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
Jujinag are going to appear because
 

511
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,470
Jujinag are going to appear because
we're we're holding one hand and

512
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
we're we're holding one hand and
 

513
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,190
we're we're holding one hand and
attacking with the other hand. Kokunag

514
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
attacking with the other hand. Kokunag
 

515
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,310
attacking with the other hand. Kokunag
are going to happen simply because we're

516
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
are going to happen simply because we're
 

517
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,030
are going to happen simply because we're
in side by side position. Hitoi and

518
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
in side by side position. Hitoi and
 

519
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,389
in side by side position. Hitoi and
kaunag are going to happen because he

520
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
kaunag are going to happen because he
 

521
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,630
kaunag are going to happen because he
goes low from here. Right? So now we

522
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
goes low from here. Right? So now we
 

523
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,310
goes low from here. Right? So now we
understand all those throws that happen

524
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
understand all those throws that happen
 

525
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,910
understand all those throws that happen
and why they would happen and where they

526
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
and why they would happen and where they
 

527
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,670
and why they would happen and where they
come from. So this position should

528
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
come from. So this position should
 

529
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,509
come from. So this position should
immediately start alerting you to these

530
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
immediately start alerting you to these
 

531
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,110
immediately start alerting you to these
things are going to become available.

532
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
things are going to become available.
 

533
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,829
things are going to become available.
The last set we have in that is edi. So

534
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
The last set we have in that is edi. So
 

535
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,829
The last set we have in that is edi. So
eddy minag are throws that happen when I

536
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
eddy minag are throws that happen when I
 

537
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,030
eddy minag are throws that happen when I
get here behind. Okay. Now the classic

538
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
get here behind. Okay. Now the classic
 

539
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,509
get here behind. Okay. Now the classic
edi that we talk about always looks kind

540
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
edi that we talk about always looks kind
 

541
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,269
edi that we talk about always looks kind
of like this. I pull him down. I'm

542
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
of like this. I pull him down. I'm
 

543
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,030
of like this. I pull him down. I'm
watching my mic here. Uh I come across

544
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
watching my mic here. Uh I come across
 

545
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,310
watching my mic here. Uh I come across
the top and I step through and that's

546
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
the top and I step through and that's
 

547
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,910
the top and I step through and that's
the one we see a lot. Now that can

548
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
the one we see a lot. Now that can
 

549
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,910
the one we see a lot. Now that can
happen for one of a few reasons, right?

550
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
happen for one of a few reasons, right?
 

551
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,590
happen for one of a few reasons, right?
One is I just do what I think the most

552
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
One is I just do what I think the most
 

553
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,509
One is I just do what I think the most
basic edidim minag is which is to pull

554
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
basic edidim minag is which is to pull
 

555
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,670
basic edidim minag is which is to pull
him down from here like this. Okay.

556
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
him down from here like this. Okay.
 

557
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,590
him down from here like this. Okay.
Another could be Josh is turning and I

558
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
Another could be Josh is turning and I
 

559
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,110
Another could be Josh is turning and I
lock his head in place and he throws

560
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
lock his head in place and he throws
 

561
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,389
lock his head in place and he throws
himself off balance because his head

562
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
himself off balance because his head
 

563
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,389
himself off balance because his head
can't turn as his body turns. Okay. And

564
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399
can't turn as his body turns. Okay. And
 

565
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,030
can't turn as his body turns. Okay. And
the other one is a kokunag really I

566
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
the other one is a kokunag really I
 

567
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,949
the other one is a kokunag really I
believe which is I'm moving his hips out

568
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
believe which is I'm moving his hips out
 

569
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,790
believe which is I'm moving his hips out
of the way as I'm in that position.

570
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
of the way as I'm in that position.
 

571
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,670
of the way as I'm in that position.
Right. So those three are all apparent

572
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
Right. So those three are all apparent
 

573
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,470
Right. So those three are all apparent
in that one version of edimag but really

574
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
in that one version of edimag but really
 

575
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,470
in that one version of edimag but really
any throw that happens from the edimi

576
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
any throw that happens from the edimi
 

577
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,870
any throw that happens from the edimi
position. Now we only have one throw

578
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
position. Now we only have one throw
 

579
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,470
position. Now we only have one throw
done a few different ways. But the

580
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
done a few different ways. But the
 

581
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,310
done a few different ways. But the
reason for that is I'm in the dominant

582
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
reason for that is I'm in the dominant
 

583
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,150
reason for that is I'm in the dominant
position most of the time. I don't need

584
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
position most of the time. I don't need
 

585
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,590
position most of the time. I don't need
to worry about knocking him away from

586
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
to worry about knocking him away from
 

587
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,590
to worry about knocking him away from
me. And the main edidimi nag we see is

588
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
me. And the main edidimi nag we see is
 

589
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,590
me. And the main edidimi nag we see is
an edimag that keeps him from turning

590
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
an edimag that keeps him from turning
 

591
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,829
an edimag that keeps him from turning
and taking away my edimi position.

592
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
and taking away my edimi position.
 

593
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,110
and taking away my edimi position.
Right? So, and that's the one where I

594
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
Right? So, and that's the one where I
 

595
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,230
Right? So, and that's the one where I
lock his head in place and we

596
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
lock his head in place and we
 

597
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,710
lock his head in place and we
classically see a lot. So, if you use

598
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
classically see a lot. So, if you use
 

599
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,949
classically see a lot. So, if you use
this kind of positional ranking system

600
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
this kind of positional ranking system
 

601
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,190
this kind of positional ranking system
to start understanding the throws, it

602
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
to start understanding the throws, it
 

603
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,269
to start understanding the throws, it
will be more apparent when the throws

604
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
will be more apparent when the throws
 

605
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,350
will be more apparent when the throws
come out. Right? So, so this is a new

606
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
come out. Right? So, so this is a new
 

607
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,550
come out. Right? So, so this is a new
way I'm working on talking about. I'm

608
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
way I'm working on talking about. I'm
 

609
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,750
way I'm working on talking about. I'm
actually going to make a set of videos

610
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
actually going to make a set of videos
 

611
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,509
actually going to make a set of videos
for you guys on each one of these throws

612
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
for you guys on each one of these throws
 

613
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,910
for you guys on each one of these throws
individually from this positional

614
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
individually from this positional
 

615
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,509
individually from this positional
situation stuff. And so you'll be seeing

616
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
situation stuff. And so you'll be seeing
 

617
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,350
situation stuff. And so you'll be seeing
them over the next seven weeks, I guess.

618
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
them over the next seven weeks, I guess.
 

619
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,710
them over the next seven weeks, I guess.
Um, so I'm going to make a series of

620
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
Um, so I'm going to make a series of
