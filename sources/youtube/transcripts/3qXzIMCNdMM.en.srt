maladies
 

55
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,030
maladies
however when

56
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,040
however when
 

57
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,750
however when
I'm in those States it seems like it's

58
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:17,760
I'm in those States it seems like it's
 

59
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,910
I'm in those States it seems like it's
really difficult to dissolve that so

60
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
really difficult to dissolve that so
 

61
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,910
really difficult to dissolve that so
even when we talk about

even when we talk about
 

63
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,370
even when we talk about
releasing and I remember there's been

64
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:25,380
releasing and I remember there's been
 

65
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,469
releasing and I remember there's been
times where you have just said

[Music]
it was actually another

96
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:05,399
it was actually another
 

97
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,069
it was actually another
um

98
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
um
 

99
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,809
um
patreon subscriber actually asks the

00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:08,819
patreon subscriber actually asks the
 

101
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,330
patreon subscriber actually asks the
same exact question

102
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:11,340
same exact question
 

103
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,270
same exact question
um and it's one that you have to first

104
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:14,280
um and it's one that you have to first
 

105
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,729
um and it's one that you have to first
understand

106
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:16,739

 

107
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,369

the question itself is produced by the

108
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:19,379
the question itself is produced by the
 

109
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,949
the question itself is produced by the
ego tripartite mine do you see because

110
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:21,959
ego tripartite mine do you see because
 

111
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,750
ego tripartite mine do you see because
the question

112
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
the question
 

113
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,570
the question
if you look at the question

114
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:26,580
if you look at the question
 

115
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,910
if you look at the question
underneath it you're going to see a

116
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:28,920
underneath it you're going to see a
 

117
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,770
underneath it you're going to see a
dichotomous framework

118
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:30,780
dichotomous framework
 

119
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,229
dichotomous framework
you're going to see the self right and

120
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
you're going to see the self right and
 

121
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,670
you're going to see the self right and
um

122
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
um
 

123
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,369
um
what's happening is

124
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:40,379
what's happening is
 

125
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,930
what's happening is
that you

126
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:41,940
that you
 

127
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,570
that you
you kind of I call it a language game it

128
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:44,580
you kind of I call it a language game it
 

129
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,449
you kind of I call it a language game it
turns into a language game that your

130
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:47,459
turns into a language game that your
 

131
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,869
turns into a language game that your
mind your intellect in particular which

132
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
mind your intellect in particular which
 

133
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,170
mind your intellect in particular which
is the ego tripart type mind

134
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,180
is the ego tripart type mind
 

135
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,830
is the ego tripart type mind
um is trying to figure out how to solve

136
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
um is trying to figure out how to solve
 

137
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,729
um is trying to figure out how to solve
this uh Transcendence of dichotomy and

138
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:01,739
this uh Transcendence of dichotomy and
 

139
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,630
this uh Transcendence of dichotomy and
it cannot do it okay and hence my phrase

140
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:05,640
it cannot do it okay and hence my phrase
 

141
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,530
it cannot do it okay and hence my phrase
which is the the mind which by which I

142
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:09,540
which is the the mind which by which I
 

143
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,530
which is the the mind which by which I
mean the ego tripartite mind so the my

144
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:12,540
mean the ego tripartite mind so the my
 

145
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,270
mean the ego tripartite mind so the my
phrase that I usually say is the Mind

146
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:14,280
phrase that I usually say is the Mind
 

147
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,009
phrase that I usually say is the Mind
cannot cure itself

148
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:16,019
cannot cure itself
 

149
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,009
cannot cure itself
so if you want to spell it out the ego

150
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:19,019
so if you want to spell it out the ego
 

151
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,070
so if you want to spell it out the ego
tripartite mind cannot stop being the

152
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
tripartite mind cannot stop being the
 

153
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,369
tripartite mind cannot stop being the
ego tripartite mind

154
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:25,379

 

155
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,550

and the question arises from that and in

156
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
and the question arises from that and in
 

157
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,009
and the question arises from that and in
that question you're actually seeing the

158
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:31,019
that question you're actually seeing the
 

159
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,369
that question you're actually seeing the
ego tripartite mind

160
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:33,379
ego tripartite mind
 

161
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,770
ego tripartite mind
reefine itself in continuing its

162
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:36,780
reefine itself in continuing its
 

163
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,410
reefine itself in continuing its
functioning because all it deduces is

164
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:39,420
functioning because all it deduces is
 

165
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,390
functioning because all it deduces is
this makes no sense

166
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,400
this makes no sense
 

167
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,449
this makes no sense
reducing

168
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:44,459

 

169
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,729

so

170
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:46,739
so
 

171
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,869
so
this

172
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:49,879

 

173
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,910

lack of

174
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:52,920

that problem and they did it in the the
 

271
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,189
that problem and they did it in the the
very same way okay and the first premise

00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:33,479
okay in Silk Road cultures
 

319
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:34,370
okay in Silk Road cultures
um

320
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,380
um
 

321
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,670

uh you had you had three parts of you
 

323
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,230
uh you had you had three parts of you
okay so we would say you would have your

324

uh and and we can core and this
 

327
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,809
uh and and we can core and this
corresponds to your training methodology

328
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:47,819
corresponds to your training methodology
 

329
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,830
corresponds to your training methodology
okay so you have your physical part and

330
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
okay so you have your physical part and
 

331
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,050
okay so you have your physical part and
in the physical part is that material

332
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,060
in the physical part is that material
 

333
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,749
in the physical part is that material
part and is that ego tripartite part

334
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:56,759
part and is that ego tripartite part
 

335
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,189
part and is that ego tripartite part

stand in contrast to it it's an
 

481
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,949
stand in contrast to it it's an
extension in Silk Road culture it's an

482
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:45,959
extension in Silk Road culture it's an
 

483
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,490

um they have it's it is uh the hole in

488
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:57,540
um they have it's it is uh the hole in
 

489
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,569
um they have it's it is uh the hole in
the wagon wheel

490
00:11:59,569 --> 00:11:59,579
the wagon wheel
 

491
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,990
the wagon wheel
that makes it useful it's not the wheel

492
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,000
that makes it useful it's not the wheel
 

493
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,690
that makes it useful it's not the wheel
itself it's the emptiness in the hole

494
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:05,700
itself it's the emptiness in the hole
 

495
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,630
itself it's the emptiness in the hole
that allows the axle to go in there do

496
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:08,640
that allows the axle to go in there do
 

497
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,250
that allows the axle to go in there do
you see

498
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:10,260
you see
 

499
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,710
you see
um and so while empty and while not

500
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
um and so while empty and while not
 

501
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,590
um and so while empty and while not
material is actually if there was no

502
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
material is actually if there was no
 

503
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,130
material is actually if there was no
empty space for it then the axle could

504
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,140
empty space for it then the axle could
 

505
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,190
empty space for it then the axle could
not function do you see or The Emptiness

506
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,200
not function do you see or The Emptiness
 

507
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,670
not function do you see or The Emptiness
in the cup is what actually creates the

508
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
in the cup is what actually creates the
 

509
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,509
in the cup is what actually creates the
cup not the Cup itself do you see that

510
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
cup not the Cup itself do you see that
 

511
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,150
cup not the Cup itself do you see that
so you have that Dallas concept going

512
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
so you have that Dallas concept going
 

513
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,370
so you have that Dallas concept going
okay well the same thing is going on in

514
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:34,380
okay well the same thing is going on in
 

515
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,310
okay well the same thing is going on in
you now if you want to say that the

516
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:37,320
you now if you want to say that the
 

517
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,710
you now if you want to say that the
emptiness in the cup or the hole in the

518
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:39,720
emptiness in the cup or the hole in the
 

519
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,970
emptiness in the cup or the hole in the
wagon wheel is a subtler part to the

520
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:43,980
wagon wheel is a subtler part to the
 

521
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,810
wagon wheel is a subtler part to the
wheel I'm not sure that is solving the

522
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:47,820
wheel I'm not sure that is solving the
 

523
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,230
wheel I'm not sure that is solving the
problem that domo's trying to solve

524
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:51,240
problem that domo's trying to solve
 

525
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,710
problem that domo's trying to solve
but he's trying to say that

526
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
but he's trying to say that
 

527
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,210
but he's trying to say that
there is a concreteness or there is

528
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,220
there is a concreteness or there is
 

529
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,530
there is a concreteness or there is
let's say this

530
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:00,540
let's say this
 

531
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,970
let's say this
that emptiness in the cup is as real as

532
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:04,980
that emptiness in the cup is as real as
 

533
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,329
that emptiness in the cup is as real as
the Cup itself do see that so when he's

534
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:08,339
the Cup itself do see that so when he's
 

535
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,210
the Cup itself do see that so when he's
trying to say that it's subtle he does

536
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:11,220
trying to say that it's subtle he does
 

537
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,190
trying to say that it's subtle he does
he's trying to say that there's some

538
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
he's trying to say that there's some
 

539
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,129
he's trying to say that there's some
substance to it but it's not this

540
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:16,139
substance to it but it's not this
 

541
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,410
substance to it but it's not this
substance that's so gross

542
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:18,420
substance that's so gross
 

543
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,170
substance that's so gross
do you understand that okay

544
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:21,180
do you understand that okay
 

545
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,750
do you understand that okay
I get what he's saying I've heard that

546
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
I get what he's saying I've heard that
 

547
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,350
I get what he's saying I've heard that
that variant of expression you can see

548
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
that variant of expression you can see
 

549
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,990
that variant of expression you can see
it throughout history they're trying to

550
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
it throughout history they're trying to
 

551
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,750
it throughout history they're trying to
do that but you could see that for

552
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:32,760
do that but you could see that for
 

553
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,629
do that but you could see that for
example if you say

554
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:35,639
example if you say
 

555
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,790
example if you say
um

556
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:37,800

 

557
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,670

there's young energy

558
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:40,680
there's young energy
 

559
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,810
there's young energy
and it's subtle all you will try to do

560
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:44,820
and it's subtle all you will try to do
 

561
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,810
and it's subtle all you will try to do
as a practitioner is try to really feel

562
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:47,820
as a practitioner is try to really feel
 

563
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,410
as a practitioner is try to really feel
it you know what I mean

564
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:50,420
it you know what I mean
 

565
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,410
it you know what I mean
so what with what with this

566
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:54,420
so what with what with this
 

567
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,329
so what with what with this
do you see that so it doesn't really

568
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:56,339
do you see that so it doesn't really
 

569
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,690
do you see that so it doesn't really
help in my opinion okay but it makes

570
00:13:59,690 --> 00:13:59,700
help in my opinion okay but it makes
 

571
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,990
help in my opinion okay but it makes
sense I'm not saying it's wrong okay

572
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,000
sense I'm not saying it's wrong okay
 

573
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,769
sense I'm not saying it's wrong okay
these are apathetic Concepts so this is

574
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:06,779
these are apathetic Concepts so this is
 

575
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,190
these are apathetic Concepts so this is
not that and not this but this is not

576
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:10,200
not that and not this but this is not
 

577
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,129
not that and not this but this is not
that in that either okay or another way

578
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:13,139
that in that either okay or another way
 

579
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,449
that in that either okay or another way
of saying if you want to put it in

580
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:14,459
of saying if you want to put it in
 

581
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,569
of saying if you want to put it in
positive terms uh everything else that

582
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:17,579
positive terms uh everything else that
 

583
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:21,410
positive terms uh everything else that
is not this or that is this

584
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:21,420
is not this or that is this
 

585
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,810
is not this or that is this
okay

586
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:23,820
okay
 

587
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,750
okay
and I'll tell you why they reached that

588
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:26,760
and I'll tell you why they reached that
 

589
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,250
and I'll tell you why they reached that
conclusion because we're working

590
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:28,260
conclusion because we're working
 

591
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,690
conclusion because we're working
backwards

592
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:29,700
backwards
 

593
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,150
backwards
it looks like we're working forward in

594
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
it looks like we're working forward in
 

595
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,009
it looks like we're working forward in
understanding this but we're actually

596
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:34,019
understanding this but we're actually
 

597
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,949
understanding this but we're actually
working backwards okay because this is

598
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:36,959
working backwards okay because this is
 

599
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,889
working backwards okay because this is
not how it starts and sometimes when you

600
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:39,899
not how it starts and sometimes when you
 

601
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:43,670
not how it starts and sometimes when you
train you think that this is like a

602
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
train you think that this is like a
 

603
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,310
train you think that this is like a
linear progression do you see

604
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
linear progression do you see
 

605
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,550
linear progression do you see
just like shuhadi so you'll hear modern

606
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:49,560
just like shuhadi so you'll hear modern
 

607
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,790
just like shuhadi so you'll hear modern
modern aikidoka

608
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800
modern aikidoka
 

609
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,810
modern aikidoka
will uh talk about this and they will

610
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:56,820
will uh talk about this and they will
 

611
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,610
will uh talk about this and they will
understand it materially of this level

612
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:00,620
understand it materially of this level
 

613
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,170
understand it materially of this level
and they understand it as a linear

614
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:03,180
and they understand it as a linear
 

615
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,810
and they understand it as a linear
progression you start with shoe then you

616
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:05,820
progression you start with shoe then you
 

617
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,569
progression you start with shoe then you
go to ha and then you go to we and that

618
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:08,579
go to ha and then you go to we and that
 

619
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,790
go to ha and then you go to we and that
is not how that Buddhist Theory works

620
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
is not how that Buddhist Theory works
 

621
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,329
is not how that Buddhist Theory works
okay this stuff happens concentrically

622
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:14,339
okay this stuff happens concentrically
 

623
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,530
okay this stuff happens concentrically
which means it's not linearly it's

624
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:17,540
which means it's not linearly it's
 

625
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,189
which means it's not linearly it's
simultaneously so if you're in your

626
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:22,199
simultaneously so if you're in your
 

627
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,889
simultaneously so if you're in your
being you are doing this simultaneously

628
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:26,899
being you are doing this simultaneously
 

629
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,530
being you are doing this simultaneously
uh in your training you don't go I'm

630
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:30,540
uh in your training you don't go I'm
 

631
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,569
uh in your training you don't go I'm
going to learn a form and then I'm going

632
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:32,579
going to learn a form and then I'm going
 

633
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,730
going to learn a form and then I'm going
to break the form and then I'm going to

634
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:34,740
to break the form and then I'm going to
 

635
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,250
to break the form and then I'm going to
reconcile form and non-form it either

636
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:37,260
reconcile form and non-form it either
 

637
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,829
reconcile form and non-form it either
happens all at once or it does not

638
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:39,839
happens all at once or it does not
 

639
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,269
happens all at once or it does not
happen ever okay so I have to do all

640
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:44,279
happen ever okay so I have to do all
 

641
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,790
happen ever okay so I have to do all
this at once what's happening to the

642
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800
this at once what's happening to the
 

643
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,650
this at once what's happening to the
beginner is the beginner can only

644
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:48,660
beginner is the beginner can only
 

645
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,710
beginner is the beginner can only
function at this level okay and as I

646
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:51,720
function at this level okay and as I
 

647
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,670
function at this level okay and as I
said

648
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:52,680
said
 

649
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,550
said
if we're looking at this you're going to

650
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:55,560
if we're looking at this you're going to
 

651
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,530
if we're looking at this you're going to
think that it's a line and you're going

652
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:57,540
think that it's a line and you're going
 

653
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,870
think that it's a line and you're going
to think it goes this way better

654
00:15:59,870 --> 00:15:59,880
to think it goes this way better
 

655
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,370
to think it goes this way better
Michelle I'm going to tell you that it

656
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:01,380
Michelle I'm going to tell you that it
 

657
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,949
Michelle I'm going to tell you that it
does not okay I'll just get there all

658
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:03,959
does not okay I'll just get there all
 

659
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:07,370
does not okay I'll just get there all
right so first let's move here this

660
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:07,380
right so first let's move here this
 

661
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,889
right so first let's move here this

order of things okay and that process
 

687
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,670
order of things okay and that process
which you've heard me refer to as the

you're looking at a cosmological Act of
 

713
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,470
you're looking at a cosmological Act of
moving from nothingness to somethingness

moving from nothingness to somethingness
 

715
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,590
moving from nothingness to somethingness
well you can reverse that act and you're

716
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:42,600
well you can reverse that act and you're
 

717
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,590
well you can reverse that act and you're
going to go from somethingness back to

718
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
going to go from somethingness back to
 

719
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,150
going to go from somethingness back to
nothingness okay or in judeo-christian

720
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:49,160
nothingness okay or in judeo-christian

uh you got your ass kicked out of the

722
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
uh you got your ass kicked out of the
 

723
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,770
uh you got your ass kicked out of the
garden do you see and because you

724
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:54,780
garden do you see and because you
 

725
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,090
garden do you see and because you
learned about uh the knowledge uh that

726
00:17:59,090 --> 00:17:59,100
learned about uh the knowledge uh that
 

727
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,789
learned about uh the knowledge uh that
you had you ate of the tree of knowledge

728

you had you ate of the tree of knowledge
 

729
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,630
you had you ate of the tree of knowledge
and so you had dichotomous thinking

730
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:05,640
and so you had dichotomous thinking
 

731
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,870
and so you had dichotomous thinking
right good and bad good and evil right

732
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
right good and bad good and evil right
 

733

and wrong to all this all dichotomous
 

735
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,029
and wrong to all this all dichotomous
thought and you had your identity in

then you get this you bring some agency

1206
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:14,700
then you get this you bring some agency
 

1207
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,549
then you get this you bring some agency
to this do you understand do you get

1208
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:16,559
to this do you understand do you get
 

1209
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,070
to this do you understand do you get
that okay but when you pay attention

1210
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,080
that okay but when you pay attention
 

1211
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,230
that okay but when you pay attention
remember I said it happens

1212
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,240
remember I said it happens
 

1213
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,330
remember I said it happens
simultaneously concentrically it does it

1214
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:23,340
simultaneously concentrically it does it
 

1215
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,510
simultaneously concentrically it does it
does it happens concentrically

1216
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:25,520
does it happens concentrically
 

1217
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,549
does it happens concentrically
simultaneously but in terms of training

1218
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:28,559
simultaneously but in terms of training
 

1219
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,669
simultaneously but in terms of training
this will happen and then this develops

1220
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:31,679
this will happen and then this develops
 

1221
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,289
this will happen and then this develops
agency in it

1222
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:33,299
agency in it
 

1223
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,810
agency in it
and that allows you to have this

1224
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:35,820
and that allows you to have this
 

1225
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,450
and that allows you to have this
manifest itself simultaneously as

1226
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:38,460
manifest itself simultaneously as
 

1227
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,090

the way it will come in this is the
 

1309
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,669
the way it will come in this is the
natural workings of the universe you're

1310

obstructing it from coming into you
 

1313
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,950
obstructing it from coming into you
so for example

1314
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
so for example
 

1315
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,590
so for example
the person comes the person pushes in

1316
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:51,600
the person comes the person pushes in
 

1317

1653
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,849
way we're supposed to follow them
so when you look at nageuke it's just a

1654
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:37,859
so when you look at nageuke it's just a
 

1655
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:40,609
so when you look at nageuke it's just a
microcosm of that very process there is

1656
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:40,619
microcosm of that very process there is
 

1657
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:44,030
microcosm of that very process there is
a way to do the kilo nozza do you see

1658
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,040
a way to do the kilo nozza do you see
 

1659
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,170
a way to do the kilo nozza do you see
but that way requires that this has to

1660
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:48,180
but that way requires that this has to
 

1661
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,970
but that way requires that this has to
be let go

1662
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:49,980
be let go
 

1663
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,790
be let go
okay so for example

1664
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:52,800
okay so for example
 

1665
