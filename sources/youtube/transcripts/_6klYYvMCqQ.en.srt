00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:48,690
and I change my stance I mean upon me at
 

7
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,320
and I change my stance I mean upon me at
the right angle so I'm not in Pisa okay

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,330
the right angle so I'm not in Pisa okay
 

9
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,890
the right angle so I'm not in Pisa okay
and my timing has to be that my hand my

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,220

this when I do the initial Bushido tank

56
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:43,230
this when I do the initial Bushido tank
 

57
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,340

on I want you to point this in space you

58
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,350
on I want you to point this in space you
 

59
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:55,370
on I want you to point this in space you

62
00:03:59,550 --> 00:03:59,560
this one it doesn't move okay so you go
 

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,720
this one it doesn't move okay so you go
you anchor your point and I go like this

64
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:02,730
you anchor your point and I go like this
 

65
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,030
you anchor your point and I go like this
no I leave it there you see and I go

66
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,040
no I leave it there you see and I go
 

67
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,690
no I leave it there you see and I go
round it and then once I'm disengaging

68
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:08,700
round it and then once I'm disengaging
 

69
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,000
round it and then once I'm disengaging
what I'm going to do is not pull it I

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,010
what I'm going to do is not pull it I
 

71
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,350
what I'm going to do is not pull it I
can't

72
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
can't
 

73
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,140
can't
I'm going to move it this way you see

74
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,150
I'm going to move it this way you see
 

75
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,080
I'm going to move it this way you see
how to do that okay so it's going this

76
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,090
how to do that okay so it's going this
 

77
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:23,190
how to do that okay so it's going this
way it's not going this way okay and

78
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,200
way it's not going this way okay and
 

79
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,380
way it's not going this way okay and
we're gonna trade places going around

80
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,390
we're gonna trade places going around
 

81
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:36,850
we're gonna trade places going around
you see that now you guys come on

82
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:36,860

 

83
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,510

yes I turned it into space before and

84
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:40,520
yes I turned it into space before and
 

85
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,570
yes I turned it into space before and
then I'm moving his arm this way you see

86
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:43,580
then I'm moving his arm this way you see
 

87
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,240
then I'm moving his arm this way you see
where I can move it doesn't want to go

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,250
where I can move it doesn't want to go
 

89
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:55,890
where I can move it doesn't want to go
that way so one he goes this way you see

90
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:55,900
that way so one he goes this way you see
 

91
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,190
that way so one he goes this way you see
okay and now we have his balance right

92
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,200
okay and now we have his balance right
 

93
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,290
okay and now we have his balance right
and I'm gonna just sit down into this

94
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:02,300
and I'm gonna just sit down into this
 

95
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:27,730
and I'm gonna just sit down into this
empty space change the geometry change

96
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:27,740
empty space change the geometry change
 

97
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:34,630
empty space change the geometry change
the geometry okay this is just a check

98
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:34,640
the geometry okay this is just a check
 

99
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,150
the geometry okay this is just a check
that's not always kinda more with this

100
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
that's not always kinda more with this
 

101

you to deviate without moving you're
 

157
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,540
you to deviate without moving you're
having to move your feet and you can get

158
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:13,550
having to move your feet and you can get
 

159
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,610
having to move your feet and you can get
angles a deviation with just your body

160
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:15,620
angles a deviation with just your body
 

161
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,320
angles a deviation with just your body
