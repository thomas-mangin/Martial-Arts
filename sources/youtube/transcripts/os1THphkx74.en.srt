your circular angle of daeviation is

your circular angle of daeviation is
 

503
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,920
your circular angle of daeviation is
going to work much better for connection

so when i'm dv/dt see this is straight

510
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:02,490
so when i'm dv/dt see this is straight
 

511
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,700
so when i'm dv/dt see this is straight
it's generally straight so this

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:05,710
it's generally straight so this
 

513
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,680
it's generally straight so this

angle deviation it's because you're
