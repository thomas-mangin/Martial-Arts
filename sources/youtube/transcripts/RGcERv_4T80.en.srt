stuck to me so while I can do a

164
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,170
stuck to me so while I can do a
 

165
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,140
stuck to me so while I can do a
technical Hinoki this way and I would

166
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,150
technical Hinoki this way and I would
 

167
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,550
technical Hinoki this way and I would
accept that on a test from one of my

168
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
accept that on a test from one of my
 

169
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,290
accept that on a test from one of my
students it's something we can't

170
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:52,300
students it's something we can't
 

171
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,910
students it's something we can't
necessarily count on because if the grip

172
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
necessarily count on because if the grip
 

173
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,170
necessarily count on because if the grip
doesn't break I'm not gonna make the

174
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:55,180
doesn't break I'm not gonna make the
 

175
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,540
doesn't break I'm not gonna make the
enemy so those are the basic ideas I'm

enemy so those are the basic ideas I'm
 

177
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,730
enemy so those are the basic ideas I'm
gonna be dealing with now core to icater

now while I'm doing this I'm also gonna

218
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,100
now while I'm doing this I'm also gonna
 

219
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,610
now while I'm doing this I'm also gonna
put one hand towards his face now look I

could be hitting him from wrong worth
and if my life were on the line I would

224
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:38,860
and if my life were on the line I would
 

225
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,530
and if my life were on the line I would
hit him prom word but I'm not expecting

to knock him out all I really expected
 

229
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,699
to knock him out all I really expected
to do is freeze him in one position lock

230
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:44,709
to do is freeze him in one position lock
 

231
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:46,920
to do is freeze him in one position lock
into one position while I stretch myself

232
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:46,930
into one position while I stretch myself
 

233
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,930
into one position while I stretch myself
out as wide as I possibly can now you

234
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:48,940
out as wide as I possibly can now you
 

235
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,520
out as wide as I possibly can now you
see how much room I got I'm able to

236
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:50,530
see how much room I got I'm able to
 

237
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,170
see how much room I got I'm able to
really pull away from him here with the

238
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:52,180
really pull away from him here with the
 

239
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,910
really pull away from him here with the
triangle and also the triangle is now

240
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
triangle and also the triangle is now
 

241
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,680
triangle and also the triangle is now
controlling this area of contention so

242
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:55,690
controlling this area of contention so
 

243
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,290
controlling this area of contention so
if you look at our techniques are given

244
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:58,300
if you look at our techniques are given
 

245
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,570
if you look at our techniques are given
birth to the the the children of

246
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:00,580
birth to the the the children of
 

247
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,190
birth to the the the children of
positions you understand from this

248
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,200
positions you understand from this
 

249
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,229
positions you understand from this
position now if he continued to try and

250
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
position now if he continued to try and
 

251
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,330
position now if he continued to try and
dismantle this position we get all kinds

252
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:06,340
dismantle this position we get all kinds
 

253
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,220
dismantle this position we get all kinds
of techniques from this so triangle is

254
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:08,230
of techniques from this so triangle is
 

255
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,110
of techniques from this so triangle is
one of my tried-and-true I'm gonna work

256
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,120
one of my tried-and-true I'm gonna work
 

257
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,580
one of my tried-and-true I'm gonna work
triangle a lot in the objective the

258
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:11,590
triangle a lot in the objective the
 

259
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,290
triangle a lot in the objective the
triangle is just that to clear and

260
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:13,300
triangle is just that to clear and
 

261
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,680
triangle is just that to clear and
control the area of contention

262
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:15,690
control the area of contention
 

263
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,180
control the area of contention
another key technique I'm going to use

264
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,190
another key technique I'm going to use
 

265
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:18,509
another key technique I'm going to use
for

266
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:18,519
for
 

267
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,189
for
this is a soap bubble warrior so it

268
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:20,199
this is a soap bubble warrior so it
 

269
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,379
this is a soap bubble warrior so it
turned to the outside now if I just make

270
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:22,389
turned to the outside now if I just make
 

271
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:24,210
turned to the outside now if I just make
my turn to the outside like that I'm

272
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:24,220
my turn to the outside like that I'm
 

273
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,980
my turn to the outside like that I'm
probably not going to clear this grab I

274
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:25,990
probably not going to clear this grab I
 

275
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,540
probably not going to clear this grab I
might need to do that depending if

276
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:27,550
might need to do that depending if
 

277
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,920
might need to do that depending if
someone else coming in and someone's

278
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:28,930
someone else coming in and someone's
 

279
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,510
someone else coming in and someone's
coming on on this line I might need to

280
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:30,520
coming on on this line I might need to
 

281
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,980
coming on on this line I might need to
kind of try and move Josh there so that

282
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:31,990
kind of try and move Josh there so that
 

283
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,779
kind of try and move Josh there so that
way he'll defend me against that guy

284
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:33,789
way he'll defend me against that guy
 

285
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:35,939
way he'll defend me against that guy
but I'm also usually going to try some

286
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:35,949
but I'm also usually going to try some
 

287
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,650
but I'm also usually going to try some
kind of escape when I'm doing that now

288
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:37,660
kind of escape when I'm doing that now
 

289
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,659
kind of escape when I'm doing that now
one of the easiest escapes for this is a

290
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:39,669
one of the easiest escapes for this is a
 

291
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:42,330
one of the easiest escapes for this is a
Yahoo yoga or Yahoo gokyo so I bring my

292
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:42,340
Yahoo yoga or Yahoo gokyo so I bring my
 

293
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,339
Yahoo yoga or Yahoo gokyo so I bring my
hand up here like this and I turn out to

00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:44,349
hand up here like this and I turn out to
 

295
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:46,409
hand up here like this and I turn out to
the outside this way to breaking it free

296
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:46,419
the outside this way to breaking it free
 

297
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,270
the outside this way to breaking it free
so as he's grabbing it here my hands

298
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:48,280
so as he's grabbing it here my hands
 

299
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,370

lengthening those ligament so it's

312
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:00,909
lengthening those ligament so it's
 

313
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,129
lengthening those ligament so it's
harder and harder and harder for him to

314
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:02,139
harder and harder and harder for him to
 

315

make an adaption right so let's say I

320
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
make an adaption right so let's say I
 

321
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,129
make an adaption right so let's say I
try a soap bubble War II and it doesn't

322
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:11,139
try a soap bubble War II and it doesn't
 

323
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:12,719
try a soap bubble War II and it doesn't
work and he comes around that will

324
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:12,729
work and he comes around that will
 

325
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,430
work and he comes around that will
immediately lead me into this triangle

326
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:14,440
immediately lead me into this triangle
 

327
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,580
immediately lead me into this triangle
which is really nice now I can also try

328
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,590
which is really nice now I can also try
 

329
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,589
which is really nice now I can also try
Bucci mawari from this so I could go to

330
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:19,599
Bucci mawari from this so I could go to
 

331
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:22,170
Bucci mawari from this so I could go to
the inside here this position like this

332
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,180
the inside here this position like this
 

333
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,200
the inside here this position like this
now that will again really nicely con

334
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,210
now that will again really nicely con
 

335
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,050
now that will again really nicely con
rim right so meaning let's say I tried a

336
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,060
rim right so meaning let's say I tried a
 

337
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,540
rim right so meaning let's say I tried a
soap the Mauri didn't work then I heard

a triangle didn't work now I can try
 

341
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,800

Moochie muara here right now what this

342
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:34,810
Moochie muara here right now what this
 

343
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,409
Moochie muara here right now what this
has done for me he might let go because

344
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:37,419
has done for me he might let go because
 

345
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:38,939
has done for me he might let go because
he thinks his hands in a crappy position

346
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:38,949
he thinks his hands in a crappy position
 

347
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:39,839
he thinks his hands in a crappy position
that could happen

348
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:39,849
that could happen
 

349
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:41,879
that could happen
it also has set him up for nicely Chios

350
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:41,889
it also has set him up for nicely Chios
 

351
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:43,560
it also has set him up for nicely Chios
and other other setups for the Hadouken

352
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:43,570
and other other setups for the Hadouken
 

353
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,810
and other other setups for the Hadouken
and it's made this grip just generally

354
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:45,820
and it's made this grip just generally
 

355
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,339
and it's made this grip just generally
really weak so if I pull from here it

356
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:47,349
really weak so if I pull from here it
 

357
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:48,839
really weak so if I pull from here it
might more easily be able to clear my

358
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:48,849
might more easily be able to clear my
 

359
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,790
might more easily be able to clear my
shoulder so I put his hand in a worse

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
shoulder so I put his hand in a worse
 

361
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,189

position while taking care of his desire

362
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
position while taking care of his desire
 

363
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,499
position while taking care of his desire
to improve his position over mine right

364
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:55,509
to improve his position over mine right
 

365
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:58,770
to improve his position over mine right
so these three really nicely con ran

366
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:58,780
so these three really nicely con ran
 

367
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,300
so these three really nicely con ran

Manucci is a Hadopi in and of itself so

392
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,130
Manucci is a Hadopi in and of itself so
 

393
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,100
Manucci is a Hadopi in and of itself so
he's grabbing here to go to the 45 and I

394
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,110
he's grabbing here to go to the 45 and I
 

395
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,900
he's grabbing here to go to the 45 and I
just hit this guy in the face boom he

396
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:34,910
just hit this guy in the face boom he
 

397
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,490
just hit this guy in the face boom he
might pop off of me because I hit him in

398
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:36,500
might pop off of me because I hit him in
 

399
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,650
might pop off of me because I hit him in
the face right so that is a Hideki in

400
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:38,660
the face right so that is a Hideki in
 

401
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,330
the face right so that is a Hideki in
and of itself and then of course as we

402
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:40,340
and of itself and then of course as we
 

403
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,760
and of itself and then of course as we
saw in the techniques video that if that

404
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:42,770
saw in the techniques video that if that
 

405
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,960
saw in the techniques video that if that
doesn't work out for me then the

406
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:43,970
doesn't work out for me then the
 

407
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,550
doesn't work out for me then the
techniques will be born of the new
