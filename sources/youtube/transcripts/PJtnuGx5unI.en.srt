1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:28,830

so

2
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840

 

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:37,590

so

4
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600

 

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,430

okay so my my center

6
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
okay so my my center
 

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,549
okay so my my center
is dependent upon the periphery

8
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
is dependent upon the periphery
 

9
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,430
is dependent upon the periphery
right and in this case what makes up the

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
right and in this case what makes up the
 

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,750
right and in this case what makes up the
periphery

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
periphery
 

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,029
periphery
my head and my feet hence our rule

14
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
my head and my feet hence our rule
 

15
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,869
my head and my feet hence our rule
if my head goes down at least one foot

16
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
if my head goes down at least one foot
 

17
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,029
if my head goes down at least one foot
has to come up this is a breaking

18
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
has to come up this is a breaking
 

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,229
has to come up this is a breaking
a center okay yes i still have a center

20
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
a center okay yes i still have a center
 

21
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:02,950
a center okay yes i still have a center
of gravity

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
of gravity
 

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,030
of gravity
but in terms of the spiraling rotating

24
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
but in terms of the spiraling rotating
 

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,070
but in terms of the spiraling rotating
cross

i'm not doing it in my body anymore okay

28
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
i'm not doing it in my body anymore okay
 

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,710
i'm not doing it in my body anymore okay
so my body stays locked

30
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
so my body stays locked
 

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,910
so my body stays locked
and i do that same thing this whole

32
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
and i do that same thing this whole
 

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,469
and i do that same thing this whole
thing is going to rotate

34
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
thing is going to rotate
 

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,630

not on a circle has to go on a spiral

36
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
not on a circle has to go on a spiral
 

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,230
not on a circle has to go on a spiral
okay which means it must seek

38
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
okay which means it must seek
 

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,350
okay which means it must seek
some sort of traversing vector

40
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
some sort of traversing vector
 

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,429
some sort of traversing vector
it must have some sort of depth okay so

42
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
it must have some sort of depth okay so
 

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,030
it must have some sort of depth okay so
my body's going to go this way my body's

44
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
my body's going to go this way my body's
 

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,990
my body's going to go this way my body's
going to go that way

46
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
going to go that way
 

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,390
going to go that way
my body's not going to go this way okay

48
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
my body's not going to go this way okay
 

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,030
my body's not going to go this way okay
i think that's part of the problem

50
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
i think that's part of the problem
 

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,389
i think that's part of the problem
um is is why you have to disengage that

52
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
um is is why you have to disengage that
 

53
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,990
um is is why you have to disengage that
tail bone at the end

54
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
tail bone at the end
 

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,910
tail bone at the end
because there's no room for it you have

56
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
because there's no room for it you have
 

57
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,749
because there's no room for it you have
to get your legs back under you

58
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
to get your legs back under you
 

59
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,710
to get your legs back under you
you understand so you start you roll in

60
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
you understand so you start you roll in
 

61
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,910
you understand so you start you roll in
this way

62
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
this way
 

63
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,789
this way
and there's no there's no room for your

64
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
and there's no there's no room for your
 

65

legs
 

67
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,870
legs
so you're going to bend your knees a lot

68
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
so you're going to bend your knees a lot
 

69
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,630
so you're going to bend your knees a lot
and disengage the tailbone

70
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
and disengage the tailbone
 

71
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,270
and disengage the tailbone
this kind of thing but i don't do that

72
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
this kind of thing but i don't do that
 

73
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,389
this kind of thing but i don't do that
because

74
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
because
 

75
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,750
because
i have depth my legs are out my legs are

76
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
i have depth my legs are out my legs are
 

77
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,150
i have depth my legs are out my legs are
at home

78
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
at home
 

79
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,550
at home
you see how my legs are out watch my

80
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
you see how my legs are out watch my
 

81
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,510
you see how my legs are out watch my
legs again

82
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520

then his forward roll any forward roll
 

93
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,670
then his forward roll any forward roll
kind of works

143
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,270

and you felt my elbow too so we'll go

144
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
and you felt my elbow too so we'll go
 

145
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,030
and you felt my elbow too so we'll go
so you can see it slow so you can feel

me go around this cross
 

153
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,430
me go around this cross
this cross right here watch watch it go

154
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
this cross right here watch watch it go
 

155
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,030
this cross right here watch watch it go
slower so you can feel it you feel that

156
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
slower so you can feel it you feel that
 

157
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,189
slower so you can feel it you feel that
there is there's a clash

158
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
there is there's a clash
 

159
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,390
there is there's a clash
i'm gonna go

160
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400

 

161
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,749

you feel that yes

162
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759

 

163
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,469

and as a result he can't he won't

165
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,590
and as a result he can't he won't
project me

166
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
project me
 

167
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,670
project me
it just gets reconciled but i do lose my

yes my my leg is checking that leg out

214
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
yes my my leg is checking that leg out
 

215
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,029
yes my my leg is checking that leg out
you see

216
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
you see
 

217
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,350
you see
so we're gonna come over here like this

218
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
so we're gonna come over here like this
 

219
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,590
so we're gonna come over here like this
this leg is going that way

this leg is going that way
 

221
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,790
this leg is going that way
okay um

222
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
okay um
 

223
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,710
okay um
so that would not be it okay

uh when i get something else i pick
 

227
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,629
uh when i get something else i pick
andrew because he's

228
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
andrew because he's
 

229
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,830
andrew because he's
he's bigger he's stronger than me okay

230
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
he's bigger he's stronger than me okay
 

231
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,150
he's bigger he's stronger than me okay
um if i establish a relationship to my

232
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
um if i establish a relationship to my
 

233
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,469
um if i establish a relationship to my
head

head
 

235
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,830
head
feet then i establish a center you see

236
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
feet then i establish a center you see
 

237
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,710
feet then i establish a center you see
the periphery is related to each other

238
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
the periphery is related to each other
 

239
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,029
the periphery is related to each other
then the center is established that

240
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
then the center is established that
 

241
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,070
then the center is established that
means

242
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
means
 

243
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,590
means
that's as heavy as i'm going to get okay

244
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
that's as heavy as i'm going to get okay
 

245
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,749
that's as heavy as i'm going to get okay
when i walk around or i break center

246
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
when i walk around or i break center
 

247
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,350
when i walk around or i break center
i'm very light is it okay okay

248
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
i'm very light is it okay okay
 

249
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,710
i'm very light is it okay okay
so uh we'll have you

250
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
so uh we'll have you
 

251
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,950
so uh we'll have you
try it and you'll feel what i'm talking

252
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
try it and you'll feel what i'm talking
 

253
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,990
try it and you'll feel what i'm talking
about is that she has my whole magazine

254
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
about is that she has my whole magazine
 

255
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,710
about is that she has my whole magazine
as my whole mass jacked her up okay

256
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
as my whole mass jacked her up okay
 

257
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,629
as my whole mass jacked her up okay
whereas if i would lose

258
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
whereas if i would lose
 

259
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,230
whereas if i would lose
and lose she can do it incrementally

260
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
and lose she can do it incrementally
 

261
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,870
and lose she can do it incrementally
but if i have my periphery related

262
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
but if i have my periphery related
 

263
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,510
but if i have my periphery related
and center this is very

264
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
and center this is very
 

265
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,629
and center this is very
and it starts to expose things in her

266
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
and it starts to expose things in her
 

267
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,670
and it starts to expose things in her
technique

268
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
technique
 

269
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,070
technique
now all i do is maintain center

270
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080

 

271
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,710

let me see like that beat there it's not

272
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
let me see like that beat there it's not
 

273
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,510
let me see like that beat there it's not

00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
that's where they do counters here and
 

277
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,510
that's where they do counters here and
stuff like that do you guys got that

278
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
stuff like that do you guys got that
 

279
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,990
stuff like that do you guys got that
okay so uh don't try to step around it

280
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
okay so uh don't try to step around it
 

281
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,110
okay so uh don't try to step around it
um

okay um let's try it again

296
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
okay um let's try it again
 

297
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,390
okay um let's try it again
okay so the question is what is the

298
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
okay so the question is what is the
 

299
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,990
okay so the question is what is the
growth stimulus training your uk

300
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
growth stimulus training your uk
 

301
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,230
growth stimulus training your uk
or you came at mine and you guys nailed

302
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
or you came at mine and you guys nailed
 

303
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,909
or you came at mine and you guys nailed
it it's way faster

304
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
it it's way faster
 

305
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,430
it it's way faster
and now the question is why is it faster

306
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
and now the question is why is it faster
 

307
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,949
and now the question is why is it faster
and you said we usually are having

308
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
and you said we usually are having
 

309
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,949
and you said we usually are having
energy right okay you're adding energy

310
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
energy right okay you're adding energy
 

311
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,149
energy right okay you're adding energy
to it so

312
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
to it so
 

313
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,550
to it so
diagnose how is the energy being added

314
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
diagnose how is the energy being added
 

315
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,710
diagnose how is the energy being added
to it

316
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720

 

317
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,790

we're not just taking vagus growth we

318
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
we're not just taking vagus growth we
 

319
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,389
we're not just taking vagus growth we
are putting ourselves towards them

320
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
are putting ourselves towards them
 

321
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,949
are putting ourselves towards them
i would say no you are being accelerated

322
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
i would say no you are being accelerated
 

323
00:08:50,959 --> 00:09:00,949
i would say no you are being accelerated
where is your acceleration point

324
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959

 

325
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,910

set the elbow your elbows being

326
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
set the elbow your elbows being
 

327
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,630
set the elbow your elbows being
accelerated into the technique

328
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
accelerated into the technique
 

329
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,190
accelerated into the technique
how is that doable if you're resisting

330
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
how is that doable if you're resisting
 

331
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,949
how is that doable if you're resisting
with the elbow yeah you have a young
