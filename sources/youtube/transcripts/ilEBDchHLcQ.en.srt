1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,350

um let's just look at what you're doing

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:03,360
um let's just look at what you're doing
 

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,590
um let's just look at what you're doing
with these knife strips okay uh you're

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:06,600
with these knife strips okay uh you're
 

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,509
with these knife strips okay uh you're
basically leveraging it out you see that

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
basically leveraging it out you see that
 

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:24,710
basically leveraging it out you see that
so here you have just a lever so stay

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:24,720

 

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,189

there you didn't have to stay exactly

10
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
there you didn't have to stay exactly
 

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,870
there you didn't have to stay exactly
like that okay all right all right so

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
like that okay all right all right so
 

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,830
like that okay all right all right so
it's just a lever which is like think of

14
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:32,840
it's just a lever which is like think of
 

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,990
it's just a lever which is like think of
it as a as a rigid stick okay a rigid

16
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
it as a as a rigid stick okay a rigid
 

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,229
it as a as a rigid stick okay a rigid
line all right and uh there's weak

18
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:39,239
line all right and uh there's weak
 

19
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,470
line all right and uh there's weak
points in the grip the pinky and the

20
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:41,480
points in the grip the pinky and the
 

21
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,190
points in the grip the pinky and the
thumb okay so every time you can always

22
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
thumb okay so every time you can always
 

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,709
thumb okay so every time you can always
pry these out you see how it's prying on

24
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:47,719
pry these out you see how it's prying on
 

25
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,270
pry these out you see how it's prying on
your pinky so the fulcrum is going to be

26
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,280
your pinky so the fulcrum is going to be
 

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,430
your pinky so the fulcrum is going to be
on the other side of your hand that's

28
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
on the other side of your hand that's
 

29
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,590
on the other side of your hand that's
and that lever is pressing on that part

30
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
and that lever is pressing on that part
 

31
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,389
and that lever is pressing on that part
there where I'm touching okay and then

32
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
there where I'm touching okay and then
 

33
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,110
there where I'm touching okay and then
I'm using the length of the lever to pry

34
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,120
I'm using the length of the lever to pry
 

35
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,830
I'm using the length of the lever to pry
out the pinky so as you close your

36
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
out the pinky so as you close your
 

37
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,190
out the pinky so as you close your
fingers I just pry that out you see that

38
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
fingers I just pry that out you see that
 

39
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,550
fingers I just pry that out you see that
and you can go either way so I'll use

40
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:09,560
and you can go either way so I'll use
 

41
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,390
and you can go either way so I'll use
this side now of your hand this part

42
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
this side now of your hand this part
 

43
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,230
this side now of your hand this part
where the stick is touching your hand

44
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:15,240
where the stick is touching your hand
 

45
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,830
where the stick is touching your hand
and I can now pry out that lever out the

46
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:18,840
and I can now pry out that lever out the
 

47
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,109
and I can now pry out that lever out the
thumb do you got it okay so if your

48
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:22,119
thumb do you got it okay so if your
 

49
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:26,590
thumb do you got it okay so if your
fulcra moves you will have less Force as

50
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:26,600
fulcra moves you will have less Force as
 

51
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,550
fulcra moves you will have less Force as
you're using the same lever so see how

52
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:29,560
you're using the same lever so see how
 

53
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,190
you're using the same lever so see how
keep it your hand still okay if you turn

54
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
keep it your hand still okay if you turn
 

55
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,590
keep it your hand still okay if you turn
your hand you'll see that it's not going

56
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
your hand you'll see that it's not going
 

57
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,749
your hand you'll see that it's not going
to work until now your joints have taken

58
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:38,759
to work until now your joints have taken
 

59
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,310
to work until now your joints have taken
out the ability for your hand to rotate

60
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
out the ability for your hand to rotate
 

61
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,830
out the ability for your hand to rotate
and now I get that fulum again and now

62
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:44,840
and now I get that fulum again and now
 

63
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,190
and now I get that fulum again and now
it'll come out okay and following the

64
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,200
it'll come out okay and following the
 

65
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,270
it'll come out okay and following the
lever

66
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
lever
 

67
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,149
lever
laws if you have a shorter lever there's

68
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:53,159
laws if you have a shorter lever there's
 

69
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,109
laws if you have a shorter lever there's
going to be less Force I can generate in

70
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:56,119
going to be less Force I can generate in
 

71
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:58,550
going to be less Force I can generate in
the prime it's not that it can't be done

72
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
the prime it's not that it can't be done
 

73
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,670
the prime it's not that it can't be done
but it's nowhere near

74
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:00,680
but it's nowhere near
 

75
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,950
but it's nowhere near
having a longer lever okay you do you

76
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:03,960
having a longer lever okay you do you
 

77
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,069
having a longer lever okay you do you
guys see that okay so a lot you have to

78
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:07,079
guys see that okay so a lot you have to
 

79
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,990
guys see that okay so a lot you have to
understand these these principles try to

80
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
understand these these principles try to
 

81
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,470
understand these these principles try to
keep the fulcrum still don't let it move

82
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:13,480
keep the fulcrum still don't let it move
 

83
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,430
keep the fulcrum still don't let it move
and try to use the length of the lever

84
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
and try to use the length of the lever
 

85
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,229
and try to use the length of the lever
as much as possible okay now to show how

86
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
as much as possible okay now to show how
 

87
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,830
as much as possible okay now to show how
important

88
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
important
 

89
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,750
important
the uh stabilization of the fulcrum is

90
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
the uh stabilization of the fulcrum is
 

91
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,150
the uh stabilization of the fulcrum is
you can see that as I lock your as you

92
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
you can see that as I lock your as you
 

93
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,550
you can see that as I lock your as you
turn your hand and it's not till the

94
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
turn your hand and it's not till the
 

95
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,949
turn your hand and it's not till the
joints no longer articulate that the

96
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
joints no longer articulate that the
 

97
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,509
joints no longer articulate that the
fulcrum activates right okay but if you

98
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
fulcrum activates right okay but if you
 

99
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,949
fulcrum activates right okay but if you
move your body around you can see I

100
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
move your body around you can see I
 

101
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,509
move your body around you can see I
would follow the path yeah follow the

102
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
would follow the path yeah follow the
 

103
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,509
would follow the path yeah follow the
path you see and then it might not ever

104
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:44,519
path you see and then it might not ever
 

105
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,750
path you see and then it might not ever
come out do you see so if you bent

106
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
come out do you see so if you bent
 

107
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,869
come out do you see so if you bent
backwards you keep your grip on there

108
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:49,879
backwards you keep your grip on there
 

109
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,030
backwards you keep your grip on there
and keep the fulcrum the entire time you

110
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,040
and keep the fulcrum the entire time you
 

111
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,149
and keep the fulcrum the entire time you
see that so so you feel that will do it

112
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:54,159
see that so so you feel that will do it
 

113
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,509
see that so so you feel that will do it
again so I'm coming around and you keep

114
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:56,519
again so I'm coming around and you keep
 

115
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,390
again so I'm coming around and you keep
your grip you see I won't be able to get

116
00:02:59,390 --> 00:02:59,400
your grip you see I won't be able to get
 

117
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,790
your grip you see I won't be able to get
it out till again I reached the limit of

118
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
it out till again I reached the limit of
 

119
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,789
it out till again I reached the limit of
those joints which is here and now it

120
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:04,799
those joints which is here and now it
 

121
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,070
those joints which is here and now it
could come out okay all right so we'll

122
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
could come out okay all right so we'll
 

123
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,910
could come out okay all right so we'll
have you guys just play with the stick

124
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
have you guys just play with the stick
 

125
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,589
have you guys just play with the stick
right now with those principles okay TR

126
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:14,599
right now with those principles okay TR
 

127
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,110
right now with those principles okay TR
all right so something to uh notice on

128
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,120
all right so something to uh notice on
 

129
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,990
all right so something to uh notice on
the stick to get those fulcrums to

130
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,000
the stick to get those fulcrums to
 

131
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,869
the stick to get those fulcrums to
work as uh as taking advantage of the

132
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
work as uh as taking advantage of the
 

133
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,030
work as uh as taking advantage of the
weak points of the grip you're always at

134
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
weak points of the grip you're always at
 

135
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,270
weak points of the grip you're always at
a right angle to the grip so if I take

136
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:30,280
a right angle to the grip so if I take
 

137
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,589
a right angle to the grip so if I take
this like this and I try to go this way

138
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:32,599
this like this and I try to go this way
 

139
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,949
this like this and I try to go this way
hold your grip ah it's going to take

140
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
hold your grip ah it's going to take
 

141
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,190
hold your grip ah it's going to take
longer before I pry that out okay same

142
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,200
longer before I pry that out okay same
 

143
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,550
longer before I pry that out okay same
thing here takes longer but so you're

144
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
thing here takes longer but so you're
 

145
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,630
thing here takes longer but so you're
always going to the right angle always

146
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
always going to the right angle always
 

147
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,949
always going to the right angle always
to the right angle always to the right

148
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
to the right angle always to the right
 

149
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,309
to the right angle always to the right
angle that's important so you get these

150
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:47,319
angle that's important so you get these
 

151
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,309
angle that's important so you get these
angles takes a lot longer you see how

152
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:49,319
angles takes a lot longer you see how
 

153
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,390
angles takes a lot longer you see how
much the lever is moving before I can

154
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:51,400
much the lever is moving before I can
 

155
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,470
much the lever is moving before I can
pry out even with the stabilized fulcrum

156
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
pry out even with the stabilized fulcrum
 

157
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,309
pry out even with the stabilized fulcrum
by holding her wrist you go here it

158
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
by holding her wrist you go here it
 

159
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,190
by holding her wrist you go here it
takes a lot longer takes a lot longer

160
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,200
takes a lot longer takes a lot longer
 

161
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,670
takes a lot longer takes a lot longer
before I can pry out okay so that's

162
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:00,680
before I can pry out okay so that's
 

163
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,710
before I can pry out okay so that's
important all right so when we go to the

164
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
important all right so when we go to the
 

165
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,309
important all right so when we go to the
knife and this thing's coming in uh

166
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
knife and this thing's coming in uh
 

167
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,270
knife and this thing's coming in uh
you're you're over here

168
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,280
you're you're over here
 

169
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,429
you're you're over here
right you're going to yield and as

170
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
right you're going to yield and as
 

171
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,509
right you're going to yield and as
you're going to field as this is going

172
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
you're going to field as this is going
 

173
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,030
you're going to field as this is going
around look how I got the right angle

174
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
around look how I got the right angle
 

175
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,789
around look how I got the right angle
here okay and so camera move around so

176
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:21,799
here okay and so camera move around so
 

177
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,270
here okay and so camera move around so
you can see that okay so we were

178
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
you can see that okay so we were
 

179
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,590
you can see that okay so we were
here and as I start to turn I rotate

180
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600
here and as I start to turn I rotate
 

181
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,150
here and as I start to turn I rotate
around this cross

182
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
around this cross
 

183
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,749
around this cross
I now establish the cross on the knife

184
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
I now establish the cross on the knife
 

185
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,909
I now establish the cross on the knife
and I'm at that right angle okay and

186
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:36,919
and I'm at that right angle okay and
 

187
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:38,830
and I'm at that right angle okay and
then you use your deviation and

188
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:38,840
then you use your deviation and
 

189
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,670
then you use your deviation and
everything to obey the yinong rules and

190
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:42,680
everything to obey the yinong rules and
 

191
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,150
everything to obey the yinong rules and
eventually you'll slide down to here

192
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
eventually you'll slide down to here
 

193
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,710
eventually you'll slide down to here
okay and you keep that right angle on

194
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:49,720
okay and you keep that right angle on
 

195
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,950
okay and you keep that right angle on
there and as you move this around into

196
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
there and as you move this around into
 

197
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,390
there and as you move this around into
sh you're going to see that there's that

198
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
sh you're going to see that there's that
 

199
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,350
sh you're going to see that there's that
Prim angle you see it I don't have to do

200
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
Prim angle you see it I don't have to do
 

201
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,749
Prim angle you see it I don't have to do
anything anything I'm at the right angle

202
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
anything anything I'm at the right angle
 

203
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,870
anything anything I'm at the right angle
so camera moves around

204
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:03,880
so camera moves around
 

205
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,909
so camera moves around
wherever and in the movement alone of sh

206
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:06,919
wherever and in the movement alone of sh
 

207
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,870
wherever and in the movement alone of sh
Naga cuz I'm going to I'm going to turn

208
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
Naga cuz I'm going to I'm going to turn
 

209
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,870
Naga cuz I'm going to I'm going to turn
the wrist my hand is basically pushing

210
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
the wrist my hand is basically pushing
 

211
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,749
the wrist my hand is basically pushing
it out the same

212
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
it out the same
 

213
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,670
it out the same
way so move wherever you need to so you

214
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:18,680
way so move wherever you need to so you
 

215
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,390
way so move wherever you need to so you
can see this and we'll go slow so I'm

216
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
can see this and we'll go slow so I'm
 

217
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,309
can see this and we'll go slow so I'm
here I start to move and I'm going to

218
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:23,319
here I start to move and I'm going to
 

219
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,670
here I start to move and I'm going to
come around and get that right angle on

220
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:26,680
come around and get that right angle on
 

221
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,430
come around and get that right angle on
the forearm and you're going to feel it

222
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:28,440
the forearm and you're going to feel it
 

223
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,870

with the stick cuz everyone's fine
 

229
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,670
with the stick cuz everyone's fine
feeling the stick but you feel the knife

230
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
feeling the stick but you feel the knife
 

231
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,270
feeling the stick but you feel the knife
and you

232
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
and you
 

233
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,990
and you
go but the cutting portion is all your

concern and more importantly the drawing
 

237
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,469
concern and more importantly the drawing
of the cutting portion okay so even the

238
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
of the cutting portion okay so even the
 

239
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,909
of the cutting portion okay so even the
cutting portion not dry is not going to

240
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
cutting portion not dry is not going to
 

241
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,909

around in the technique you'll work your
 

253
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,589
around in the technique you'll work your
way down to the wrist and now in the

way down to the wrist and now in the
 

255
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:11,550
way down to the wrist and now in the
movement alone of shon nag you're going

256
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:11,560
movement alone of shon nag you're going
 

257
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,790
movement alone of shon nag you're going
to use that right angle to pry that

258
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
to use that right angle to pry that
 

259
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,710
to use that right angle to pry that
thing out so that knife should pry out

260
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:17,720
thing out so that knife should pry out
 

261
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,510
