42
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
to use the centrifugal energy
 

43
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,069
to use the centrifugal energy
energy was going that way and when i

44
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
energy was going that way and when i
 

45
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,590
energy was going that way and when i
turn it that energy creates a friction

46
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
turn it that energy creates a friction
 

47
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,230
turn it that energy creates a friction
as i'm bringing it back towards me okay

51
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,870
it's not that i'm going here
and i'm fighting it the energy is going

52
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
and i'm fighting it the energy is going
 

53
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,149
and i'm fighting it the energy is going
that way and i'm keeping it going
