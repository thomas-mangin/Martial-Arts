innocently I can on certain ukas I can
 

35
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,470
innocently I can on certain ukas I can
feel the resistance and then on other

36
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:51,480
feel the resistance and then on other
 

37
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,709
feel the resistance and then on other
ukas I can feel them relaxing it seems

38
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
ukas I can feel them relaxing it seems
 

39
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,110
ukas I can feel them relaxing it seems
like a very innocent statement and you

40
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
like a very innocent statement and you
 

41
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,189
like a very innocent statement and you
go that's true okay and I think I think

42
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:00,199
go that's true okay and I think I think
 

43
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,509
go that's true okay and I think I think
we have as we demonstrated uh with v the

44
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:04,519
we have as we demonstrated uh with v the
 

45
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,109
we have as we demonstrated uh with v the
resistance is coming from what and you

46
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:08,119
resistance is coming from what and you
 

47
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:10,550
resistance is coming from what and you
can answer cuz you already have it right

48
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
can answer cuz you already have it right
 

49
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,230
can answer cuz you already have it right
now what is the resistance coming from

50
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
now what is the resistance coming from
 

51
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,030
now what is the resistance coming from
fear fear of what fear of the pain fear

52
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
fear fear of what fear of the pain fear
 

53
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,469
fear fear of what fear of the pain fear
of the pain do you see that okay uh and

54
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
of the pain do you see that okay uh and
 

55
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,950
of the pain do you see that okay uh and
then though how how do I feel it was the

56
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:23,960
then though how how do I feel it was the
 

57
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,109
then though how how do I feel it was the
question like how do you know they're

58
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:26,119
question like how do you know they're
 

59
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,630
question like how do you know they're
tents and I said use the yinong equation

60
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:29,640
tents and I said use the yinong equation
 

61
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,749
tents and I said use the yinong equation
right right so you could see here

62
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:34,759
right right so you could see here
 

63
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,550
right right so you could see here
I'm resisting his resistance that's how

64
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
I'm resisting his resistance that's how
 

65
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,630
I'm resisting his resistance that's how
I would be able to subjectively sense

66
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,640
I would be able to subjectively sense
 

67
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,069
I would be able to subjectively sense
that he's resisting because T up and uh

68
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
that he's resisting because T up and uh
 

69
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,510
that he's resisting because T up and uh
lay it there tens I don't feel his

70
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:48,520
lay it there tens I don't feel his
 

71
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,670
lay it there tens I don't feel his
resistance but for him pushing down on

72
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:50,680
resistance but for him pushing down on
 

73
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,709
resistance but for him pushing down on
my leg so I move away I don't feel his

74
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:53,719
my leg so I move away I don't feel his
 

75
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,990
my leg so I move away I don't feel his
resistance okay so my sensation of his

76
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,000
resistance okay so my sensation of his
 

77
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,990
resistance okay so my sensation of his
resistance is only possible by my

78
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
resistance is only possible by my
 

79
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,789
resistance is only possible by my
resistance to his resistance do you get

80
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
resistance to his resistance do you get
 

81
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,749
resistance to his resistance do you get
that okay and if you don't buy that then

82
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
that okay and if you don't buy that then
 

83
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,109
that okay and if you don't buy that then
you should stop your iido training

84
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:08,119
you should stop your iido training
 

85
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,990
you should stop your iido training
because that's yinyang Theory okay and

86
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,000
because that's yinyang Theory okay and
 

87
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,510
because that's yinyang Theory okay and
that is also our path to Salvation

88
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
that is also our path to Salvation
 

89
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,630
that is also our path to Salvation
meaning I'm in control of my suffering

90
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:17,640
meaning I'm in control of my suffering
 

91
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,710
meaning I'm in control of my suffering
do you see because it's what I bring to

92
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:19,720
do you see because it's what I bring to
 

93
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,190
do you see because it's what I bring to
the equation that makes up the suffering

94
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
the equation that makes up the suffering
 

95
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,350
the equation that makes up the suffering
okay so therefore if I don't bring the

96
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
okay so therefore if I don't bring the
 

97
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,910
okay so therefore if I don't bring the
missing element to the equation I do not

98
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
missing element to the equation I do not
 

99
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,869
missing element to the equation I do not
not suffer I do not cause suffering okay

100
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
not suffer I do not cause suffering okay
 

101
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,350
not suffer I do not cause suffering okay
all right

102
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:34,360
all right
 

103
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,790
all right
so where did I do I feel his resistance

104
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
so where did I do I feel his resistance
 

105
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,910
so where did I do I feel his resistance
I feel it here at his wrist got it well

106
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
I feel it here at his wrist got it well
 

107
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,309
I feel it here at his wrist got it well
that's why you don't do it you're not

108
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
that's why you don't do it you're not
 

109
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,670
that's why you don't do it you're not
doing it by trying to turn his wrist

110
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:46,680
doing it by trying to turn his wrist
 

111
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,070
doing it by trying to turn his wrist
around okay uh remember on you rain when

112
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,080
around okay uh remember on you rain when
 

113

around okay uh remember on you rain when
I if you try to turn my wrist around his

114
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:54,599
I if you try to turn my wrist around his
 

115
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,190
I if you try to turn my wrist around his
resistance is too strong for me I can't

116
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
resistance is too strong for me I can't
 

117
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,430
resistance is too strong for me I can't
do it I could not do it on you maybe

118
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:00,440
do it I could not do it on you maybe
 

119
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,710
do it I could not do it on you maybe
someone much much bigger than me can go

120
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:03,720
someone much much bigger than me can go
 

121
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,910
someone much much bigger than me can go
ahead and overpower that resistance do

122
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:06,920
ahead and overpower that resistance do
 

123
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,190
ahead and overpower that resistance do
you see that

124
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
you see that
 

125
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,949
you see that
but that is not the art okay so what

126
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:13,959
but that is not the art okay so what
 

127
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,030
but that is not the art okay so what
we're going to do is actually not deal

we're going to do is actually not deal
 

129
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,710
we're going to do is actually not deal
with his wrist at all we're going to

130
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:19,720
with his wrist at all we're going to
 

131
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,110
with his wrist at all we're going to
deal with this part over

hold it you know this from other
 

163
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,390
hold it you know this from other
techniques you have so I'm going to do

164
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:15,400
techniques you have so I'm going to do
 

165
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,349
techniques you have so I'm going to do

okay come over here
 

197
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,790
okay come over here
where it fits where you don't need

198
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:01,800
where it fits where you don't need
 

199
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,710

anything and now as you've done that
 

201
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,350
anything and now as you've done that
you've given yourself a larger Force

202
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
you've given yourself a larger Force
 

203
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,070
you've given yourself a larger Force
engine than this here because here I'm

204
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
engine than this here because here I'm
 

205
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,150
engine than this here because here I'm
using my

206
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
using my
 

207
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,670
using my
body you see my whole body can go in you

208
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
body you see my whole body can go in you
 

209
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,350
body you see my whole body can go in you
well good

210
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
well good
 

211
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,189
well good
up okay and so he's pushing I'm not

212
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
up okay and so he's pushing I'm not
 

213
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,150
up okay and so he's pushing I'm not
trying to go with this small engine I

214
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
trying to go with this small engine I
 

215
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,189
trying to go with this small engine I
have my whole body you see that you so

216
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
have my whole body you see that you so
 

217
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,189
have my whole body you see that you so
you bring it to a larger Force engine

218
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:32,199
you bring it to a larger Force engine
 

219
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,830
you bring it to a larger Force engine
right at the same

220
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:34,840
right at the same
 

221
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,070
right at the same
time that you're going around where his

222
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
time that you're going around where his
 

223
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,870
time that you're going around where his
actual he wants this down and off do you

224
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
actual he wants this down and off do you
 

225
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,510
actual he wants this down and off do you
see he he wants it down off he puts it

226
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:44,520
see he he wants it down off he puts it
 

227
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,550
see he he wants it down off he puts it
back on the mat so he can get back up

228
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:47,560
back on the mat so he can get back up
 

229
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,309
back on the mat so he can get back up
you get it so you go you you can do

230
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:50,319
you get it so you go you you can do
 

231
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,510
you get it so you go you you can do
whatever you want buddy with that part

232
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:52,520
whatever you want buddy with that part
 

233
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,189
whatever you want buddy with that part
okay and you're over here like this okay

234
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
okay and you're over here like this okay
 

235
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,150
okay and you're over here like this okay
so I'm here like this let's demonstrate

236
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
so I'm here like this let's demonstrate
 

237
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,870
so I'm here like this let's demonstrate
that it's in place without any grips and

238
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
that it's in place without any grips and
 

239
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,870
that it's in place without any grips and
I have a very slippery shirt right now

240
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
I have a very slippery shirt right now
 

241
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,150
I have a very slippery shirt right now
if you pay attention and so does he but

242
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,160
if you pay attention and so does he but
 

243
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,430
if you pay attention and so does he but
still anatomically it'll lock in place

244
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:08,440
still anatomically it'll lock in place
 

245
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,029
still anatomically it'll lock in place
and we'll just go to here to here okay

246
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
and we'll just go to here to here okay
 

247
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,870
and we'll just go to here to here okay
let's try that part and you'll see I

248
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:13,880
let's try that part and you'll see I
 

249
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,830
let's try that part and you'll see I
don't need to contend with that wrist at

250
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
don't need to contend with that wrist at
 

251
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,070
don't need to contend with that wrist at
all okay

252
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080

 

253
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,430

go already slight deviation okay already

254
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
go already slight deviation okay already
 

255
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,150
go already slight deviation okay already
slight deviation and there the more you

256
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
slight deviation and there the more you
 

257
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,670
slight deviation and there the more you
deviate from the form it takes away from

258
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:28,680
deviate from the form it takes away from
 

259
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,350
deviate from the form it takes away from
your mechanical Advantage okay so for

260
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
your mechanical Advantage okay so for
 

261
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,430
your mechanical Advantage okay so for
example this is a huge deviation from

262
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
example this is a huge deviation from
 

263
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,990
example this is a huge deviation from
the form uh where this elbow is on the

264
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
the form uh where this elbow is on the
 

265
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,749
the form uh where this elbow is on the
back side of my uh Center Line okay but

266
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
back side of my uh Center Line okay but
 

267
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,670
back side of my uh Center Line okay but
when you put it on the center line and

268
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
when you put it on the center line and
 

269
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,029
when you put it on the center line and
but you're like I just I'm I'm over a

270
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:44,039
but you're like I just I'm I'm over a
 

271
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,710
but you're like I just I'm I'm over a
little do you see I'm I'm P zbow past my

272
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:47,720
little do you see I'm I'm P zbow past my
 

273
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,990
little do you see I'm I'm P zbow past my
Center Line just a little I did it

274
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
Center Line just a little I did it
 

275
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,189
Center Line just a little I did it

angle to his elbow and you want this
 

285
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,430
angle to his elbow and you want this
angle to be ever so slightly ahead you

286
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:10,440
angle to be ever so slightly ahead you
 

287
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,309
angle to be ever so slightly ahead you
get it so you can you mark the knee yeah

288
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:13,319
get it so you can you mark the knee yeah
 

289
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,710
get it so you can you mark the knee yeah
Sensei said that knee goes there and

290
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:15,720
Sensei said that knee goes there and
 

291
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,189
Sensei said that knee goes there and
it's supposed to be on the other side of

292
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
it's supposed to be on the other side of
 

293
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,629
it's supposed to be on the other side of
my center line but there it wouldn't

294
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:19,639
my center line but there it wouldn't
 

295
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,670
my center line but there it wouldn't
stay so I'm going to move it ahead you

296
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:22,680
stay so I'm going to move it ahead you
 

297
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,550
stay so I'm going to move it ahead you
see it's ever so slightly ahead you guys

298
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:25,560
see it's ever so slightly ahead you guys
 

299
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,029
see it's ever so slightly ahead you guys
see that and then now it's in place so

300
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:28,039
see that and then now it's in place so
 

301
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,070
see that and then now it's in place so
there's where you are

302
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
there's where you are
 

303
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,150
there's where you are
he and here's where I am

304
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:33,160
he and here's where I am
 

305
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,309
he and here's where I am
okay you do you see that okay so let us

306
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:37,319
okay you do you see that okay so let us
 

307
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,550
okay you do you see that okay so let us
look so here he's he's uh got all the

308
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:41,560
look so here he's he's uh got all the
 

309
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,430
look so here he's he's uh got all the
mechanical advantage on me and I cannot

310
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:44,440
mechanical advantage on me and I cannot
 

311
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,029
mechanical advantage on me and I cannot
get this technique to go okay I couldn't

312
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
get this technique to go okay I couldn't
 

313
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,390
get this technique to go okay I couldn't
do it on rain either all right here when

314
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
do it on rain either all right here when
 

315
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,110
do it on rain either all right here when
we're here you all right okay so when

316
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
we're here you all right okay so when
 

317
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,110
we're here you all right okay so when
I'm here he's very so straight up and

318
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,120
I'm here he's very so straight up and
 

319
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,149
I'm here he's very so straight up and
down he's very close to it so and uh go

320
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:00,159
down he's very close to it so and uh go
 

321
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:02,589
down he's very close to it so and uh go
ahead don't let me do it and he can

322
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:02,599
ahead don't let me do it and he can
 

323
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,029
ahead don't let me do it and he can
eventually straighten his arm and now

324
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
eventually straighten his arm and now
 

325
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,029
eventually straighten his arm and now
I'm back in the worst so you see but

326
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
I'm back in the worst so you see but
 

327
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,430
I'm back in the worst so you see but
when you put his arm at

328
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:10,440
when you put his arm at
 

329
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,149
when you put his arm at
this let me get a more uh

330
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:16,159

 

331
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:22,189

Flex so when you take take

332
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:22,199

 

333
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,110

away take when you take away that angle

334
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,120
away take when you take away that angle
 

335
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,909
away take when you take away that angle
and make his arm go diagonally here do

336
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:28,919
and make his arm go diagonally here do
 

337
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:32,149
and make his arm go diagonally here do
you see it can you see it yes s okay

338
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
you see it can you see it yes s okay
 

339
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,550
you see it can you see it yes s okay
then so feel your strength capacity here

340
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
then so feel your strength capacity here
 

341
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,589
then so feel your strength capacity here
yeah and then you make this go

342
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
yeah and then you make this go
 

343
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,029
yeah and then you make this go
diagonally there's he he loses the the

344
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
diagonally there's he he loses the the
 

345
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,150
diagonally there's he he loses the the
strength and in fact his

346
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,160
strength and in fact his
 

347
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,230
strength and in fact his
resistance now pushes into mine and the

348
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
resistance now pushes into mine and the
 

349
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,030
resistance now pushes into mine and the
yin yangong equation works against him

350
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
yin yangong equation works against him
 

351
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,949
yin yangong equation works against him
you see so he pushes and it he's putting

352
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:53,959
you see so he pushes and it he's putting
 

353
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,550
you see so he pushes and it he's putting
the lock on himself now do you guys see

354
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
the lock on himself now do you guys see
 

355
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,630
the lock on himself now do you guys see
that so you don't you you will have

356
00:08:59,630 --> 00:08:59,640
that so you don't you you will have
 

357
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,310
that so you don't you you will have
those super flexible ukes you might have

358
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
those super flexible ukes you might have
 

359
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,710
those super flexible ukes you might have
to go here but you just can't be here

360
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
to go here but you just can't be here
 

361
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,910
to go here but you just can't be here
the elbow has to give some sort of

362
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:08,920
the elbow has to give some sort of
 

363
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,630
the elbow has to give some sort of
forward diagonal to it okay all right

364
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:11,640
forward diagonal to it okay all right
 

365
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,829
forward diagonal to it okay all right
let's add that

366
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:14,839

 

367
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:17,190

to uh you're going to switch rolls first

368
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
to uh you're going to switch rolls first
 

369
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,670
to uh you're going to switch rolls first
stand up by each

370
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:18,680
stand up by each
 

371
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,030
stand up by each
other okay so we can see this okay all

372
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
other okay so we can see this okay all
 

373
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,870
other okay so we can see this okay all
right

374
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
right
 

375
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,389
right
um there's two things you're trying to

376
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:27,399
um there's two things you're trying to
 

377
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,470
um there's two things you're trying to
do when you're meeting Force equations

378
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:29,480
do when you're meeting Force equations
 

379
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,590
do when you're meeting Force equations
one we discussed in the first uh demo is

380
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:32,600
one we discussed in the first uh demo is
 

381
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,190
one we discussed in the first uh demo is
you're trying to use larger Force

382
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,200
you're trying to use larger Force
 

383
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,949
you're trying to use larger Force
engines but two in the second demo which

384
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
engines but two in the second demo which
 

385
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,990
engines but two in the second demo which
we're going to emphasize here is I'm

386
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,000
we're going to emphasize here is I'm
 

387
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,310
we're going to emphasize here is I'm
trying to take away their larger Force

388
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:41,320
trying to take away their larger Force
 

389
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,670
trying to take away their larger Force
engines okay and of the two the second

390
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:44,680
engines okay and of the two the second
 

391
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,829
engines okay and of the two the second
one is the most important one okay so

392
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
one is the most important one okay so
 

393
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,710
one is the most important one okay so
you're going to go

394
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720

 

395
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,030

down good and you want to make you want

396
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
down good and you want to make you want
 

397
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,670
down good and you want to make you want
to P don't do the technique in your mind

398
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
to P don't do the technique in your mind
 

399
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,190
to P don't do the technique in your mind
you're going to make sure that you have

400
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
you're going to make sure that you have
 

401
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,670
you're going to make sure that you have
a forward can to his elbow so you don't

402
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:02,680
a forward can to his elbow so you don't
 

403
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,269
a forward can to his elbow so you don't
have enough yet do you understand there

404
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
have enough yet do you understand there
 

405
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,710
have enough yet do you understand there
you go okay all right and secure your

406
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
you go okay all right and secure your
 

407
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,790
you go okay all right and secure your
grip on the Trap and the lat all right

Chris uh you're going to uh resist her

410
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
Chris uh you're going to uh resist her
 

411
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,590
Chris uh you're going to uh resist her
technique go Chris go okay you got

412
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
technique go Chris go okay you got
 

413
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,030
technique go Chris go okay you got
really come nope go back in all right go

414
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,040
really come nope go back in all right go
 

415
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,750
really come nope go back in all right go
go Chris your hardest your hardest your

416

hardest your
hardest good okay so you see what

420
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
hardest good okay so you see what
 

421
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,069
hardest good okay so you see what
happened is she took away his larger

422
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
happened is she took away his larger
 

423
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,350
happened is she took away his larger
Force engines by getting that forward

424
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:32,360
Force engines by getting that forward
 

425
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,350

can keep that guy's uh 200 lb man's arm

430
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:44,440
can keep that guy's uh 200 lb man's arm
 

431
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,230
can keep that guy's uh 200 lb man's arm
in that hold if done this way okay all

432
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
in that hold if done this way okay all
 

433
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,069
in that hold if done this way okay all
right let's go okay so just to why I

434
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:51,079
right let's go okay so just to why I
 

435
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:53,269
right let's go okay so just to why I
have you guys in in without your geese

436
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
have you guys in in without your geese
 

437
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,829
have you guys in in without your geese
so that you could see more uh where

438
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
so that you could see more uh where
 

439
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,190
so that you could see more uh where
things go okay um

440
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:00,200
things go okay um
 

441
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,509
things go okay um
the taller UK is going to have a arm

442
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:04,519
the taller UK is going to have a arm
 

443
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,870
the taller UK is going to have a arm
that's going to lend itself more to

444
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:07,880
that's going to lend itself more to
 

445
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,509
that's going to lend itself more to
positioning the elbow as we just said

446
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:10,519
positioning the elbow as we just said
 

447
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,230
positioning the elbow as we just said
than the shorter UK so often times

448
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:13,240
than the shorter UK so often times
 

449
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,150
than the shorter UK so often times
because of our fear pride in

450
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
because of our fear pride in
 

451
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,710
because of our fear pride in
ignorance we believe the technique's

452
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
ignorance we believe the technique's
 

453
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,990
ignorance we believe the technique's
going to fail more from the bigger guy

454
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,000
going to fail more from the bigger guy
 

455
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,670
going to fail more from the bigger guy
or in the face of the bigger guy and

456
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:24,680
or in the face of the bigger guy and
 

457
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,230
or in the face of the bigger guy and
uh when instead often it's the smaller

00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
uh when instead often it's the smaller
 

459
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,870

UK who may not overpower

460
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:31,880
UK who may not overpower
 

461
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,990
UK who may not overpower
me but I'm not supposed to overpower

462
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,000
me but I'm not supposed to overpower
 

463
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,829
me but I'm not supposed to overpower
that UK do you see so that's an

464
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
that UK do you see so that's an
 

465
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,550
that UK do you see so that's an
irrelevant

466
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:39,560
irrelevant
 

467
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,269
irrelevant
May uh but they may provide additional

468
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:44,279
May uh but they may provide additional
 

469
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,710
May uh but they may provide additional
difficulties to gaining the mechanics

470
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:47,720
difficulties to gaining the mechanics
 

471
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,269
difficulties to gaining the mechanics
that we're trying to use okay why

472
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
that we're trying to use okay why
 

473
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,509
that we're trying to use okay why
because they uh uh elbow is can't get

474
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:56,519
because they uh uh elbow is can't get
 

475
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,790
because they uh uh elbow is can't get
where it needs to be do you see that

476
00:11:59,790 --> 00:11:59,800
where it needs to be do you see that
 

477
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,110
where it needs to be do you see that
okay uh so there's there's very little

this technique at the end of katama you
take her to this point she should not

644
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
take her to this point she should not
 

645
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,790
take her to this point she should not
land here she should not land here she

646
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
land here she should not land here she
 

647
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,430
land here she should not land here she
should land over here do you

648
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
should land over here do you
 

649
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,509
should land over here do you
see do you understand okay um so just to

650
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
see do you understand okay um so just to
 

651
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,230
see do you understand okay um so just to
make that point it was made in the first

652
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:31,240
make that point it was made in the first
 

653
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,110
make that point it was made in the first
video this is the ending of

654
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,120
video this is the ending of
 

655
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,949
video this is the ending of
katame and they should be brought to

656
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
katame and they should be brought to
 

657
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,910
katame and they should be brought to
this ending with the pin already in

658
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920
this ending with the pin already in
 

659
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,309
this ending with the pin already in
place we should not bring them to this

660
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:45,319
place we should not bring them to this
 

661
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:47,629
place we should not bring them to this
ending and now

662
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:47,639
ending and now
 

663
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:53,470
ending and now
do a pin okay and even if I landed here

664
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:53,480
do a pin okay and even if I landed here
 

665
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,150
do a pin okay and even if I landed here
this is not her hold do you get it so we

666
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,160
this is not her hold do you get it so we
 

667
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,829
this is not her hold do you get it so we
should not see all this mve movement in

668
00:16:58,829 --> 00:16:58,839
should not see all this mve movement in
 

669
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,269
should not see all this mve movement in
our technique okay she she should land

670
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:02,279
our technique okay she she should land
 

671
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,590
our technique okay she she should land
here she should land there you see and

672
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
here she should land there you see and
 

673
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,029
here she should land there you see and
then you're doing the technique so that

674
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039
then you're doing the technique so that
 

675
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,230
then you're doing the technique so that
was me applying the pin at that point

676
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,240
was me applying the pin at that point
 

677
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,669
was me applying the pin at that point
and to you it's

678
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:10,679
and to you it's
 

679
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:16,150
and to you it's
imperceptible that uh I moved at all but

680
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
imperceptible that uh I moved at all but
 

681
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,789
imperceptible that uh I moved at all but
she she feels it obviously and what is

682
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:19,799
she she feels it obviously and what is
 

683
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,549
she she feels it obviously and what is
she feeling then if it's not me

684
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:21,559
she feeling then if it's not me
 

685
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:24,270
she feeling then if it's not me
traversing the map she's feeling the

686
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:24,280
traversing the map she's feeling the
 

687
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,590
traversing the map she's feeling the
internal

688
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
internal
 

689
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,789
internal
pressurization and the uh C dropping do

690
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:29,799
pressurization and the uh C dropping do
 

691
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,669
pressurization and the uh C dropping do
you see just like on your compound lifts

692
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:32,679
you see just like on your compound lifts
 

693
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,110
you see just like on your compound lifts
that you're doing that's what she's

694
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,120
that you're doing that's what she's
 

695
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,549
that you're doing that's what she's
feeling okay and it starts to just

696
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,559
feeling okay and it starts to just
 

697
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,590
feeling okay and it starts to just
tighten everything

698
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:38,600
tighten everything
 

699
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,789
tighten everything
okay all right so let's work with

700
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
okay all right so let's work with
 

701
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,909
okay all right so let's work with
different size UK and some will be

702
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:42,919
different size UK and some will be
 

703
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,230
different size UK and some will be
taller some will be shorter it doesn't

704
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,240
taller some will be shorter it doesn't
 

705
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,190
taller some will be shorter it doesn't
really matter some will be stronger it

706
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
really matter some will be stronger it
 

707
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,110
really matter some will be stronger it
doesn't really matter okay let's

708
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120

 

709
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,710

go a long time you see did you see

710
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:55,720
go a long time you see did you see
 

711
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,669
go a long time you see did you see
yes okay uh let's do the other other

712
00:17:58,669 --> 00:17:58,679
yes okay uh let's do the other other
 

713
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,669
yes okay uh let's do the other other
side you were doing before

714
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
side you were doing before
 

715
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,590
side you were doing before
okay so you got everything in place go

716
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:04,600
okay so you got everything in place go
 

717
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,710
okay so you got everything in place go
ahead like we got there okay now

718
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:07,720
ahead like we got there okay now
 

719
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,750
ahead like we got there okay now
sometimes it's confusing on the what

720
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:10,760
sometimes it's confusing on the what
 

721
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,110
sometimes it's confusing on the what
angle to take okay and the Ang the

722
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
angle to take okay and the Ang the
 

723
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,029
angle to take okay and the Ang the
angle becomes confusing because your

724
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:19,039
angle becomes confusing because your
 

725
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,630
angle becomes confusing because your
fear starts to set in so you're looking

726
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:22,640
fear starts to set in so you're looking
 

727
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,230
fear starts to set in so you're looking
for ways of overpowering her you don't

728
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:25,240
for ways of overpowering her you don't
 

729
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,110
for ways of overpowering her you don't
realize it but you are so you will feel

730
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,120
realize it but you are so you will feel
 

731
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,669
realize it but you are so you will feel
what whatever resistance is in the

732
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:30,679
what whatever resistance is in the
 

733
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,710
what whatever resistance is in the
natural uh flexibility or lack thereof

734
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
natural uh flexibility or lack thereof
 

735
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,190
natural uh flexibility or lack thereof
and then you want to push it and so

736
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
and then you want to push it and so
 

737
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,510
and then you want to push it and so
you're going to take the wrong angle or

738
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520
you're going to take the wrong angle or
 

739
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,470
you're going to take the wrong angle or
you're

740
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
you're
 

741
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,909
you're
like f her I'm going to crush her you

742
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
like f her I'm going to crush her you
 

743
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,029
like f her I'm going to crush her you
see and then you try to crush her and

744
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:46,039
see and then you try to crush her and
 

745
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,270
see and then you try to crush her and
you're pressing down now and what

746
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:48,280
you're pressing down now and what
 

747
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,190
you're pressing down now and what
happens is that you don't you wasted

748
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
happens is that you don't you wasted
 

749
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,110
happens is that you don't you wasted
this is all useless because you're

750
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,120
this is all useless because you're
 

751
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,070
this is all useless because you're
taking the elbow to the wrong angle okay

752
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
taking the elbow to the wrong angle okay
 

753
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,310
taking the elbow to the wrong angle okay
so if we look at your Technique it's

754
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
so if we look at your Technique it's
 

755
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,510
so if we look at your Technique it's
it's not diagonally forward enough so

756
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520
it's not diagonally forward enough so
 

757
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,549
it's not diagonally forward enough so
let me have you first correct

758
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:05,559

 

759
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:08,990

that and she has it on her thigh do you

760
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,000
that and she has it on her thigh do you
 

761
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,190
that and she has it on her thigh do you
see when it so leave leave leave it

762
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:12,200
see when it so leave leave leave it
 

763
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,830
see when it so leave leave leave it
there it's on your thigh and it's

764
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:14,840
there it's on your thigh and it's
 

765
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,110
there it's on your thigh and it's
supposed to be here okay but and so this

766
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,120
supposed to be here okay but and so this
 

767
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,149
supposed to be here okay but and so this
is a deviation so now my work output

768
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:21,159
is a deviation so now my work output
 

769
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,510
is a deviation so now my work output
starts to go down and her work output

770
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:24,520
starts to go down and her work output
 

771
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,750
starts to go down and her work output
starts to reach greater potential so

772
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:26,760
starts to reach greater potential so
 

773
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,750
starts to reach greater potential so
your Force engine gets smaller

774
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:28,760
your Force engine gets smaller
 

775
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,590
your Force engine gets smaller
her Force engine gets stronger okay all

776
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
her Force engine gets stronger okay all
 

777
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,549
her Force engine gets stronger okay all
right so let's see what we're doing now

778
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:33,559
right so let's see what we're doing now
 

779
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,830
right so let's see what we're doing now
with the

780
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:35,840
with the
 

781
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,789
with the
path okay so if you pay attention this

782
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
path okay so if you pay attention this
 

783
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,310
path okay so if you pay attention this
you keep doing what you're doing this

784
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
you keep doing what you're doing this
 

785
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,789
you keep doing what you're doing this
elbow's going this way it's going this

786
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
elbow's going this way it's going this
 

787
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,110
elbow's going this way it's going this
way as she's doing it further into your

788
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
way as she's doing it further into your
 

789
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,590
way as she's doing it further into your
leg that means it's not going anywhere

790
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
leg that means it's not going anywhere
 

791
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,830
leg that means it's not going anywhere
cuz your leg is stopping it okay so try

792
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
cuz your leg is stopping it okay so try
 

793
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,789
cuz your leg is stopping it okay so try
a different angle you don't have to

794
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:51,799
a different angle you don't have to
 

795
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,070
a different angle you don't have to
reset every go ahead okay I don't want

796
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,080
reset every go ahead okay I don't want
 

797
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,310
reset every go ahead okay I don't want
you to think I'm cheating you okay you

798
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
you to think I'm cheating you okay you
 

799
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,990
you to think I'm cheating you okay you
go ahead and she's starting to go around

800
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000
go ahead and she's starting to go around
 

801
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,190
go ahead and she's starting to go around
the elbow now she changed it when my

802
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,200
the elbow now she changed it when my
 

803
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,350
the elbow now she changed it when my

00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:29,159
okay and then this elbow goes this way
 

821
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:32,590
okay and then this elbow goes this way
this way you see so there here's my

822

over the top of it okay so slack on and
 

829
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,669
over the top of it okay so slack on and
then this elbow goes this way so

830
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:46,679
then this elbow goes this way so
 

831
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,230
then this elbow goes this way so
demonstrate

832
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
demonstrate
 

833
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,230
demonstrate
it the two things okay so I get it all

834
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
it the two things okay so I get it all
 

835
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,149
it the two things okay so I get it all
in

836
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:53,159
in
 

837
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:55,430
in
place well there's where the slack is

838
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
place well there's where the slack is
 

839
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,029
place well there's where the slack is
gone so that's where I would have ended

840
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:57,039
gone so that's where I would have ended
 

841
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,990
gone so that's where I would have ended
up in the technique

842
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,000
up in the technique
 

843
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,549
up in the technique
then you're starting to go this way but
