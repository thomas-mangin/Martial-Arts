1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,590

okay so i you can do this

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:03,600
okay so i you can do this
 

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,749
okay so i you can do this
externally so you're going to start a

4
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:05,759
externally so you're going to start a
 

5
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,349
externally so you're going to start a
tilting his body

6
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:07,359
tilting his body
 

7
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,549
tilting his body
and you take his balance uh by

8
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
and you take his balance uh by
 

9
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,549
and you take his balance uh by
using the young hand and moving his

10
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:14,559
using the young hand and moving his
 

11
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,390
using the young hand and moving his
line of gravity outside these faces

12
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,400
line of gravity outside these faces
 

13
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,750
line of gravity outside these faces
before

14
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:17,760
before
 

15
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,590
before
you're doing that i can do a projection

16
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
you're doing that i can do a projection
 

17
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,189
you're doing that i can do a projection
style

18
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
style
 

19
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,990
style
and do the same thing okay so i what i'm

20
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
and do the same thing okay so i what i'm
 

21
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,550
and do the same thing okay so i what i'm
going to do

22
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
going to do
 

23
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,230
going to do
here is externally yield so his momentum

24
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
here is externally yield so his momentum
 

25
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,630
here is externally yield so his momentum
comes

26
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
comes
 

27
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,510
comes
pop onto the other hand and do a

28
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
pop onto the other hand and do a
 

29
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,790
pop onto the other hand and do a
projection cooking projection

30
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
projection cooking projection
 

31
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,630
projection cooking projection
so you can do that i would say that's a

32
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
so you can do that i would say that's a
 

33
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,150
so you can do that i would say that's a
little more advanced than

34
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
little more advanced than
 

35
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,869
little more advanced than
uh you know just working on a line of

36
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:42,879
uh you know just working on a line of
 

37
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,950
uh you know just working on a line of
gravity and basic support

38
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
gravity and basic support
 

39
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,950
gravity and basic support
all right uh then uh you can

40
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
all right uh then uh you can
 

41
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,630
all right uh then uh you can
um more have him so on on this one

42
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
um more have him so on on this one
 

43
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,670
um more have him so on on this one
there's more of a

44
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
there's more of a
 

45
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,470
there's more of a
of an adhesion so open open your grip so

46
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
of an adhesion so open open your grip so
 

47
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,110
of an adhesion so open open your grip so
as i do my grip i'm

48
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
as i do my grip i'm
 

49
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,910
as i do my grip i'm
having adhesion there as opposed to a

50
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
having adhesion there as opposed to a
 

51
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,910
having adhesion there as opposed to a
get out of his way and let him

52
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
get out of his way and let him
 

53
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,510
get out of his way and let him
fall into it okay so i use the adhesion

54
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
fall into it okay so i use the adhesion
 

55
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,550
fall into it okay so i use the adhesion
with the pokey projection so i can tease

56
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
with the pokey projection so i can tease
 

57
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,030
with the pokey projection so i can tease
that might be a little higher uh and

58
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
that might be a little higher uh and
 

59
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,190
that might be a little higher uh and
then with all those all of these skills

60
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
then with all those all of these skills
 

61
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,830
then with all those all of these skills
i could start i could start relaxing

62
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840
i could start i could start relaxing
 

63
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,190
i could start i could start relaxing
relaxing uh and then what you can do is

64
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
relaxing uh and then what you can do is
 

65
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,469
relaxing uh and then what you can do is
you can get you don't need the geometry

66
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
you can get you don't need the geometry
 

67
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,830
you can get you don't need the geometry
you you already have um his center

68
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
you you already have um his center
 

69
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:40,710
you you already have um his center
all right just relax

70
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
all right just relax
 

71
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,870
all right just relax
so if and then once you can do that you

72
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
so if and then once you can do that you
 

73
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,550
so if and then once you can do that you
can go back to

74
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
can go back to
 

75
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,310
can go back to
the um the disequilibrium geometry but

76
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
the um the disequilibrium geometry but
 

77
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,469
the um the disequilibrium geometry but
it's done by the same

78
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
it's done by the same
 

79
00:01:50,479 --> 00:02:02,380
it's done by the same
it's done by the same mechanism

80
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:02,390

so as you're working focus you're trying

84
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
so as you're working focus you're trying
 

85
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,309
so as you're working focus you're trying
to get

86
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
to get
 

87
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,350
to get
better at your art not just

88
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
better at your art not just
 

89
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,190
better at your art not just
trying to do coq okay

90
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
trying to do coq okay
 

91
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,990
trying to do coq okay
so at the lower levels you're using this

92
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
so at the lower levels you're using this
 

93
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,550
so at the lower levels you're using this
kind of

94
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
kind of
 

95
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,990
kind of
uh you know disequilibrium engine

96
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
uh you know disequilibrium engine
 

97
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,030
uh you know disequilibrium engine
but at the midpoint you

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,150
but at the midpoint you
you'll have like you see at the moment

i already have the center at the lower

104
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
i already have the center at the lower
 

105
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,350
i already have the center at the lower
levels

106
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
levels
 

107
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,430

you don't have a center now you're doing

108
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
you don't have a center now you're doing
 

109
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,190
you don't have a center now you're doing
this kind of you know

110
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
this kind of you know
 

111
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,030
this kind of you know
topsy-turvy and then you catch the

112
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
topsy-turvy and then you catch the
 

113
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,550
topsy-turvy and then you catch the
center at the end

114
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
center at the end
 

115
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,390
center at the end
but at the beginning levels you already

116
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
but at the beginning levels you already
 

117
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,750
but at the beginning levels you already
have the center which is

118
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
have the center which is
 

119
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,869
have the center which is
why you don't need those uh this this

120
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
why you don't need those uh this this
 

121
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,309
why you don't need those uh this this
balance breaking thing

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,390
balance breaking thing
so right when it grabs you already have

124
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
so right when it grabs you already have
 

125
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,910
so right when it grabs you already have
the center you can do

126
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
the center you can do
 

127
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,309
the center you can do
you get it you can do it so here i don't

128
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
you get it you can do it so here i don't
 

129
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,430
you get it you can do it so here i don't
have a center

130
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
have a center
 

131
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,270
have a center
and then now i have but here i don't

132
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
and then now i have but here i don't
 

133
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,309
and then now i have but here i don't
have the center

134
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
have the center
 

135
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,309
have the center
and now but on the other one you already

136
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
and now but on the other one you already
 

137
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,350
and now but on the other one you already
have this thing

138
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
have this thing
 

139
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,949
have this thing
that's why you don't need those you

140
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
that's why you don't need those you
 

141
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,470
that's why you don't need those you
don't need those okay

142
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
don't need those okay
 

143
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,110
don't need those okay
but does that mean i can't do the other

144
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
but does that mean i can't do the other
 

145
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,149
but does that mean i can't do the other
one

146

one
 

147
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,030

and still have a set i can't do i can do

148
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
and still have a set i can't do i can do
 

149
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,990

this yield
 

151
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,550
this yield
and this projection but have this center

152
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
and this projection but have this center
 

153
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,309
and this projection but have this center
from the beginning

154
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
from the beginning
 

155
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,830
from the beginning
do you see so but i can't

156
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
do you see so but i can't
 

157
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,070
do you see so but i can't
get to that level if all i'm doing is

158
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
get to that level if all i'm doing is
 

159
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,869
get to that level if all i'm doing is
this external stop

160
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
this external stop
 

161
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,830
this external stop
where you're just using joint

162
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
where you're just using joint
 

163
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,110
where you're just using joint
manipulation you don't have this center

164
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
manipulation you don't have this center
 

165
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,190
manipulation you don't have this center
yet so already you'll have the center

166
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
yet so already you'll have the center
 

167
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,630
yet so already you'll have the center
and the way you can show that you have

168
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
and the way you can show that you have
 

169
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,470
and the way you can show that you have
