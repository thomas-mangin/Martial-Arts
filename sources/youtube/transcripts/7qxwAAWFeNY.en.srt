136
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
But they're not going to put it into
 

137
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,149
But they're not going to put it into
violence.

138
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
violence.

00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
We're going to see. Let's, as I said,
 

143
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,509
We're going to see. Let's, as I said,
this is just moving Zen. You see that?

144
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
this is just moving Zen. You see that?
 

145
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,990
this is just moving Zen. You see that?
So, if we weren't freaking out on the

146
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
So, if we weren't freaking out on the
 

147
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,550
So, if we weren't freaking out on the
cushion this morning, sometimes we do,

148
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
cushion this morning, sometimes we do,
 

149
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,309
cushion this morning, sometimes we do,
but I don't think anyone did this

150
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
but I don't think anyone did this
 

151
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,589
but I don't think anyone did this
morning. That's exactly how much

152
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
morning. That's exactly how much
 

153
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,550
morning. That's exactly how much
emotional upheaval we should have felt

154
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
emotional upheaval we should have felt
 

155
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,070
emotional upheaval we should have felt
in that technique. Okay? Because as we

156
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
in that technique. Okay? Because as we
 

157
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,470
in that technique. Okay? Because as we
said yesterday,

158
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
said yesterday,
 

159
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,949
said yesterday,
with that emotional upheaval comes that

160
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
with that emotional upheaval comes that
 

161
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,149
with that emotional upheaval comes that
unconscious tension.

162
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
unconscious tension.
 

163
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,110
unconscious tension.
With that tension comes the contestation

164
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
With that tension comes the contestation
 

165
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,430
With that tension comes the contestation
and there's an overexertion and I can't

166
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
and there's an overexertion and I can't
 

167
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,910
and there's an overexertion and I can't
rest. Okay?

168
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
rest. Okay?
 

169
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,670
rest. Okay?
I have to be able to rest. So, we've

170
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
I have to be able to rest. So, we've
 

171
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,830
I have to be able to rest. So, we've
been working out

172
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
been working out
 

173
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,750
been working out
and the the reason we have to do the

174
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
and the the reason we have to do the
 

175
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,710
and the the reason we have to do the
body conditioning is because

176
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
body conditioning is because
 

177
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,830
body conditioning is because
I'm never going to get a workout in the

178
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
I'm never going to get a workout in the
 

179
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,550
I'm never going to get a workout in the
jiu-jitsu because I'm never pushing on

180
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
jiu-jitsu because I'm never pushing on
 

181
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,990
jiu-jitsu because I'm never pushing on
anything and I'm never flexing anything.

182
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
anything and I'm never flexing anything.
 

183
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,990
anything and I'm never flexing anything.
You get it? So, that's why on the

184
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
You get it? So, that's why on the
 

185
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,990
You get it? So, that's why on the
exercising I was all faster, faster,

186
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
exercising I was all faster, faster,
 

187
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,870
exercising I was all faster, faster,
faster, faster because we should be able

188
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
faster, faster because we should be able
 

189
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,870
faster, faster because we should be able
to rest in anytime you're doing the

190
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
to rest in anytime you're doing the
 

191

moving zen the martial arts. Okay? So
 

193
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,830
moving zen the martial arts. Okay? So
maybe we're a little tired right now,

194
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
maybe we're a little tired right now,
 

195
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,990
maybe we're a little tired right now,
but you should be able to rest in what

196
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
but you should be able to rest in what
 

197
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,390
but you should be able to rest in what
we're doing. Okay. It's just my own body

198
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
we're doing. Okay. It's just my own body
 

199
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,430

200
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
weight and I don't contest on any angle.
 

201
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,550

217
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,110
here. Okay? That's going to be our
ideal. So we have to train them to learn

218
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
ideal. So we have to train them to learn
 

219
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,110
ideal. So we have to train them to learn
to identify first their emotional

220
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
to identify first their emotional
 

221
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,310
to identify first their emotional
upheaval and then gain control over over

relax and the more I relax the more y
 

313
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,070
relax and the more I relax the more y
aspect will drop the heavier the

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
aspect will drop the heavier the
 

315
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,070
aspect will drop the heavier the
technique will get and I'm not getting

316

Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. He is contesting the
 

507
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,029
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. He is contesting the
touch. It should be the touch but not

508
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
touch. It should be the touch but not
 

509
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,549
touch. It should be the touch but not
manipulate the touch. Okay. I however

510
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
manipulate the touch. Okay. I however
 

511
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,430
manipulate the touch. Okay. I however
would not contest the

512
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
would not contest the
 

513
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,909
would not contest the
just going to make your hands

514
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919
just going to make your hands
 

515
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,070
just going to make your hands
more vulnerable.

516
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
more vulnerable.
 

517
00:19:52,080 --> 00:20:05,510
more vulnerable.
You guys understand what I'm saying?

518
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520

 

519
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,830

So

520
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:07,840
So
 

521
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,350
So
the

522
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
the
 

523
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,470
the
the more I push down, let's say there is

524
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:14,480
the more I push down, let's say there is
 

525
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,590
the more I push down, let's say there is
weight of his on his feet of X, a value

526
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
weight of his on his feet of X, a value
 

527
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,270
weight of his on his feet of X, a value
of X. You got it? When he tries to lift

528
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
of X. You got it? When he tries to lift
 

529
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,110
of X. You got it? When he tries to lift
up, it's now X + Y because he's opposing

530
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,120
up, it's now X + Y because he's opposing
 

531
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,149
up, it's now X + Y because he's opposing
the energy. So it will increase as an

532
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:28,159
the energy. So it will increase as an
 

533
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,470
the energy. So it will increase as an
opposing energy it'll increase the

534
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
opposing energy it'll increase the
 

535
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,430
opposing energy it'll increase the
pressure the value at contact. You get

536
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,440
pressure the value at contact. You get
 

537
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,230
pressure the value at contact. You get
that? This is why

538
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
that? This is why
 

539
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,190
that? This is why
as I've said many times in the energy

540
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
as I've said many times in the energy
 

541
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,070
as I've said many times in the energy
when you're doing the energetics

542
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
when you're doing the energetics
 

543
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,630
when you're doing the energetics
when they resist the technique should

544
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:44,640
when they resist the technique should
 

545
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,590
when they resist the technique should
get easier because the adhesion value

546
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600
get easier because the adhesion value
 

547
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,830
get easier because the adhesion value
went up the co value went up. Okay. If

548
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
went up the co value went up. Okay. If
 

549
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,830
went up the co value went up. Okay. If
you don't have the energetics, then the

550
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:55,840
you don't have the energetics, then the
 

551
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,669
you don't have the energetics, then the
weapon, he'll be able to overpower the

552
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:57,679
weapon, he'll be able to overpower the
 

553
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,830
weapon, he'll be able to overpower the
weapon. You see that? So, for example,

554
00:20:59,830 --> 00:20:59,840
weapon. You see that? So, for example,
 

555
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,549
weapon. You see that? So, for example,
in the seated kidosa,

556
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:02,559
in the seated kidosa,
 

557
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,070
in the seated kidosa,
somebody who does not understand how to

558
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
somebody who does not understand how to
 

559
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,830
somebody who does not understand how to
use the qua, right, will get overridden.

560
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
use the qua, right, will get overridden.
 

561
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,830
use the qua, right, will get overridden.
Do it to your friends back home. Okay?

562
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
Do it to your friends back home. Okay?
 

563
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,510
Do it to your friends back home. Okay?
Do the spinal displacement and you'll

564
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,520
Do the spinal displacement and you'll
 

565
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,590
Do the spinal displacement and you'll
see what will happen. Okay? But somebody

566
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
see what will happen. Okay? But somebody
 

567
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,669
see what will happen. Okay? But somebody
who does understand it, you just made

568
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:17,679
who does understand it, you just made
 

569
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,909
who does understand it, you just made
yourself more projectable because the

570
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
yourself more projectable because the
 

571
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,590
yourself more projectable because the
energy value that they're working with

572
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
energy value that they're working with
 

573
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,870
energy value that they're working with
is now higher. Inversely,

574
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:24,880
is now higher. Inversely,
 

575
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,430
is now higher. Inversely,
on the first day, before you were used

576
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,440
on the first day, before you were used
 

577
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,669
on the first day, before you were used
to getting projected, we had to reel in

578
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:29,679
to getting projected, we had to reel in
 

579
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,510
to getting projected, we had to reel in
the yin the yin yield, remember? And

580
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
the yin the yin yield, remember? And
 

581
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,669
the yin the yin yield, remember? And
what was happening was the energy value

582
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
what was happening was the energy value
 

583
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,990
what was happening was the energy value
was dropping, which is why you did it.

584
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,000
was dropping, which is why you did it.
 

585
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,549
was dropping, which is why you did it.
You made yourself less. Okay? So here

586
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559

 

587
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,310

you don't want your hands

588
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
you don't want your hands
 

589
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,190
you don't want your hands
because your hands your like

590
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,200
because your hands your like
 

591
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,789
because your hands your like
mathematically yes X goes up but this

592
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
mathematically yes X goes up but this
 

593
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,630
mathematically yes X goes up but this
isn't this isn't math this is

594
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,640
isn't this isn't math this is
 

595
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,830
isn't this isn't math this is
metacarpals to get it on wood do do you

596
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
metacarpals to get it on wood do do you
 

597
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,350
metacarpals to get it on wood do do you
understand so whatever I I hit that with

598
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360
understand so whatever I I hit that with
 

599
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,390
understand so whatever I I hit that with
boom I I hit it now harder because he's

600
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,400
boom I I hit it now harder because he's
 

601
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,549
boom I I hit it now harder because he's
going up

602
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:08,559
going up
 

603
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,950
going up
so marshally

604
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:10,960
so marshally
 

605
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,270
so marshally
I would pin him more. I'd break his

606
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:13,280
I would pin him more. I'd break his
 

607
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,070
I would pin him more. I'd break his
hands more and I guaranteed more of the

608
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
hands more and I guaranteed more of the
 

609
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,070
hands more and I guaranteed more of the
ski because he got pinned more. Okay.

610
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,080
ski because he got pinned more. Okay.
 

611
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,549
ski because he got pinned more. Okay.
What you'll see what he's doing is

612
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,559
What you'll see what he's doing is
 

613
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,270
What you'll see what he's doing is
there's ever so slightly a yielding to

614
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,280
there's ever so slightly a yielding to
 

615
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,350
there's ever so slightly a yielding to
the pressure.

616
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
the pressure.
 

617
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,310
the pressure.
You see, he is trying to absorb the

618
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,320
You see, he is trying to absorb the
 

619
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,230
You see, he is trying to absorb the
energy, not fight the energy. Okay? So

620
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,240
energy, not fight the energy. Okay? So
 

621
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,870
energy, not fight the energy. Okay? So
when I'm coming in,

622
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:36,880
when I'm coming in,
 

623
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,870
when I'm coming in,
I can I feel the impact and I feel it go

624
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:40,880
I can I feel the impact and I feel it go
 

625
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,070
I can I feel the impact and I feel it go
because he's decreasing the value at

626
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,080
because he's decreasing the value at
 

627
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,470
because he's decreasing the value at
contact. Do you understand that? I won't

628
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
contact. Do you understand that? I won't
 

629
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,909
contact. Do you understand that? I won't
do it hard, but hold it up and you

630
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
do it hard, but hold it up and you
 

631
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,830
do it hard, but hold it up and you
you'll see tension go into the shoulders

632
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
you'll see tension go into the shoulders
 

633
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,470
you'll see tension go into the shoulders
and it pulls and it hurt it hurts the

634
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
and it pulls and it hurt it hurts the
 

635
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,990
and it pulls and it hurt it hurts the
hand.

636
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
hand.
 

637
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,870
hand.
Okay? But it doesn't make my weapon go

638
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
Okay? But it doesn't make my weapon go
 

639
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,230
Okay? But it doesn't make my weapon go
up. Make sense? Okay. So, two things.

640
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,240
up. Make sense? Okay. So, two things.
 

641
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,750
up. Make sense? Okay. So, two things.
You

642
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,760
You
 

643
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,110
You
don't let his resistance stop you. You

644
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
don't let his resistance stop you. You
 

645
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,909
don't let his resistance stop you. You
let it feed you. That was yang. It gets

646
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:11,919
let it feed you. That was yang. It gets
 

647
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,990
let it feed you. That was yang. It gets
internalized.

648
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,000
internalized.
 

649
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,029
internalized.
And then, u absorb the energy.

650
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
And then, u absorb the energy.
 

651
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,789
And then, u absorb the energy.
Okay? So, that we're not breaking hands

652
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:20,799
Okay? So, that we're not breaking hands
 

653
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,750
Okay? So, that we're not breaking hands
here. Make sense? Okay. Try it again.

654
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,760
here. Make sense? Okay. Try it again.
 

655
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:32,470
here. Make sense? Okay. Try it again.
You have to beat in the middle.

656
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:32,480

 

657
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,149

Watch how much you're you're doing

658
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
Watch how much you're you're doing
 

659
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:56,710
Watch how much you're you're doing
externally.

660
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:56,720

 

661
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:07,750

Is that heavy?

662
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760

 

663
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,669

Hip heavy.

664
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679

 

665
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:19,190

Down. Down. Down.

666
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200

 

667
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,560

down.

668

675
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,710

All right.

676
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:36,720
All right.
 

677
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,830
All right.
Now, we'll give you the counter

678
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
Now, we'll give you the counter
 

679
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,310
Now, we'll give you the counter
which starts from that initial yield.

680
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,320
which starts from that initial yield.
 

681
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,590
which starts from that initial yield.
Okay. So again, if you look, I came up,

682
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,600
Okay. So again, if you look, I came up,
 

683
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,390
Okay. So again, if you look, I came up,
rotated the cross. He's going to rotate

684
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
rotated the cross. He's going to rotate
 

685
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,430
rotated the cross. He's going to rotate
the cross here. Oh my gosh.

686
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:53,440
the cross here. Oh my gosh.
 

687
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,230
the cross here. Oh my gosh.
Make sense?

688
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
Make sense?
 

689
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,549
Make sense?
If he doesn't lower his height and he

690
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
If he doesn't lower his height and he
 

691
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,909
If he doesn't lower his height and he
just tries to step out, you got it's

692
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
just tries to step out, you got it's
 

693
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,070
just tries to step out, you got it's
you're going to feel the weight. So he

694
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,080
you're going to feel the weight. So he
 

695
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,950
you're going to feel the weight. So he
has to have that yield initially. He

696
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
has to have that yield initially. He
 

697
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,909
has to have that yield initially. He
drops, it falls into a hole there. Does

698
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:09,919
drops, it falls into a hole there. Does
 

699
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,909
drops, it falls into a hole there. Does
that make sense?

700
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:11,919
that make sense?
 

701
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,029
that make sense?
Are you sure? Okay. So, I'm doing my

702
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
Are you sure? Okay. So, I'm doing my
 

703
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,710
Are you sure? Okay. So, I'm doing my
maneuver.

704
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720

 

705
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,430

We'll go to the head on this.

707
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:43,269

Okay. Try it.

709
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,909

If it gets swung to the left, what was

710
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919
If it gets swung to the left, what was
 

711
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,870
If it gets swung to the left, what was
happening? I'm contesting.

712
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:48,880
happening? I'm contesting.
 

713
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,980

I'm trying to lift on it.

I'm trying to lift on it.

Adjust your mind. Either

718
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:07,279

 

719
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:20,100

You're neither lifting

You're neither lifting
nor coming down.

What is my target?

734
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,520
What is my target?
 

735
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,310
What is my target?
The head. Okay. What is the part on my

The head. Okay. What is the part on my

bulk I touch the head with?

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
bulk I touch the head with?
 

739
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,350
bulk I touch the head with?
Okay. Right here. Right.

Okay. Right here. Right.

Got it.

Got it.

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:47,840

755
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,110

penetrates, what his style is, I I have

756
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,120
penetrates, what his style is, I I have
 

757
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,789
penetrates, what his style is, I I have
no idea. I have my mission. I can't pick

00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:54,799
no idea. I have my mission. I can't pick
 

759
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,190
no idea. I have my mission. I can't pick
a place to go. Okay. So, for example,

760
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,200
a place to go. Okay. So, for example,
 

761
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,310
a place to go. Okay. So, for example,
let's say I'll figure it out. Okay. See

762
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:02,320
let's say I'll figure it out. Okay. See
 

763
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,909
let's say I'll figure it out. Okay. See
how he took a little step and then the

764
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:05,919
how he took a little step and then the
 

765
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,750
how he took a little step and then the
full step. It was ever so slow. You

766
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:07,760
full step. It was ever so slow. You
 

767
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,269
full step. It was ever so slow. You
could have heard it cuz his foot made

768
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:09,279
could have heard it cuz his foot made
 

769
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,789
could have heard it cuz his foot made
the sticky sound. Okay. So, I'm watching

770
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:12,799
the sticky sound. Okay. So, I'm watching
 

771
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,950
the sticky sound. Okay. So, I'm watching
the chest pressure.

772
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:14,960
the chest pressure.
 

773
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,590
the chest pressure.
I'm not going to wait here. Let him way.

774
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,600
I'm not going to wait here. Let him way.
 

775
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,830
I'm not going to wait here. Let him way.
I'm never going to get there. That would

776
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
I'm never going to get there. That would
 

777
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,110
I'm never going to get there. That would
be no different from all those

778
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
be no different from all those
 

779
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,430
be no different from all those
self-defense techniques. You see I keto

780
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,440
self-defense techniques. You see I keto
 

781
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,070
self-defense techniques. You see I keto
where the perfectly straight guy and he

782
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
where the perfectly straight guy and he
 

783
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,230
where the perfectly straight guy and he
acts like he knows how to box and then

784
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
acts like he knows how to box and then
 

785
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,549
acts like he knows how to box and then
they go like that, right? That that's

786
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:32,559
they go like that, right? That that's
 

787
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,470
they go like that, right? That that's
not going to happen. The boxer is going

788
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:34,480
not going to happen. The boxer is going
 

789
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,630
not going to happen. The boxer is going
to angle on you. You're too late. You

790
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
to angle on you. You're too late. You
 

791
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,470
to angle on you. You're too late. You
had to move way before that. Okay? So,

792
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:40,480
had to move way before that. Okay? So,
 

793
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,510
had to move way before that. Okay? So,
I'm very dynamic. I'm off the chest

794
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:43,520
I'm very dynamic. I'm off the chest
 

795
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,350
I'm very dynamic. I'm off the chest
pressure. You see how I adjust where I

796
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,360
pressure. You see how I adjust where I
 

797
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,830
pressure. You see how I adjust where I
need to be and I have my hands at

798
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:49,840
need to be and I have my hands at
 

799
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,830
need to be and I have my hands at
shoulder height. And there's the cutting

800
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:51,840
shoulder height. And there's the cutting
 

801
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,990
shoulder height. And there's the cutting
portion right on the head.

802
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,000

 

803
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,750

This is not the right angle for cutting

804
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:57,760
This is not the right angle for cutting
 

805
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,470
This is not the right angle for cutting
someone in half. Okay, you can chop him,

806
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:00,480
someone in half. Okay, you can chop him,
 

807
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,430
someone in half. Okay, you can chop him,
but who knows?

808
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,440
but who knows?
 

809
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,669
but who knows?
Be more dynamic.

810
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:05,679
Be more dynamic.
 

811
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,110
Be more dynamic.
Feel what he's doing.

812
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
Feel what he's doing.
 

813
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,389
Feel what he's doing.
Okay, I might have to pull back. I might

814
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
Okay, I might have to pull back. I might
 

815
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,430
Okay, I might have to pull back. I might
have to go back with that foot. Do

816
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:15,440
have to go back with that foot. Do
 

817
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,990
have to go back with that foot. Do
whatever you need to do to hit that

818
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
whatever you need to do to hit that
 

819
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:31,430
whatever you need to do to hit that
target with that weapon. Okay, go.

820
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440

 

821
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,990

pressure on the if it gets hooked on

822
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,000

Don't look at the target.

Don't look at the target.

Too close. Too close.

831
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,029

I will shuffle back with my left foot

832
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:07,039
I will shuffle back with my left foot

So when my hands drop below shoulder

852
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,080
So when my hands drop below shoulder
 

853
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,470
So when my hands drop below shoulder
height and I make contact, you get a

854
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,480
height and I make contact, you get a
 

855
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,190

choppy move.

856
00:30:59,190 --> 00:30:59,200
choppy move.
 

857
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,549

861
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,549
hands so that it hits at shoulder level,
that is a slicing move. Okay? So, I

level and you're at cutting portion of
 

873
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,870
level and you're at cutting portion of
the target. Okay? So, if you were like

fab.

1318
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,440
fab.
 

1319
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,109
fab.
Right when you felt the void, you knew

1320
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:51,119
Right when you felt the void, you knew
 

1321
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,270
Right when you felt the void, you knew
you didn't hit the sheet. There's no

1322
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:53,280
you didn't hit the sheet. There's no
 

1323
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,990
you didn't hit the sheet. There's no
point continuing going forward. Do you

1324
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,000
point continuing going forward. Do you
 

1325
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,990
point continuing going forward. Do you
understand? What is he doing?

1326
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,000
understand? What is he doing?
 

1327
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,950
understand? What is he doing?
You hit the boy and he's going to flank

1328
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:02,960
You hit the boy and he's going to flank
 

1329
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,910
You hit the boy and he's going to flank
you. So, he's at an angle to me. Do you

1330
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:05,920
you. So, he's at an angle to me. Do you
 

1331
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,950
you. So, he's at an angle to me. Do you
see that? And what I want to do is go

1332
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:08,960
see that? And what I want to do is go
 

1333
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,670
see that? And what I want to do is go
back and reestablish

1334
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:11,680
back and reestablish
 

1335
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,550
back and reestablish
the neutrality again. Oh, I'm on the

1336
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:14,560
the neutrality again. Oh, I'm on the
 

1337
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,950
the neutrality again. Oh, I'm on the
line and I'm at Joe range, out of bulk

1338
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:16,960
line and I'm at Joe range, out of bulk
 

1339
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,950
line and I'm at Joe range, out of bulk
range. You got it? When do I do that?

1340
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:20,960
range. You got it? When do I do that?
 

1341
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,510
range. You got it? When do I do that?
When I see him

1342
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:23,520
When I see him
 

1343
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,990
When I see him
starting to flank me. Don't get flanked.

1344
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:26,000
starting to flank me. Don't get flanked.
 

1345
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,069
starting to flank me. Don't get flanked.
Stay dynamic. Just like if we're

1346
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:28,079
Stay dynamic. Just like if we're
 

1347
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,190
Stay dynamic. Just like if we're
fighting and he starts to circle, I I

1348
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:31,200
fighting and he starts to circle, I I
 

1349
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,990
fighting and he starts to circle, I I
keep myself oriented towards him. I

1350
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,000
keep myself oriented towards him. I
 

1351
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,630
keep myself oriented towards him. I
don't let him get an angle and then

1352
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:36,640
don't let him get an angle and then
 

1353
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,309
don't let him get an angle and then
expect that I'm going to do something.

1354
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:38,319
expect that I'm going to do something.
 

1355
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,230
expect that I'm going to do something.
Okay. So, it's very slow. We can do it

1356
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:42,240
Okay. So, it's very slow. We can do it
 

1357
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,230
Okay. So, it's very slow. We can do it
slow, but it's going to be dynamic and

1358
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:44,240
slow, but it's going to be dynamic and
 

1359
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,030
slow, but it's going to be dynamic and
fluid. So, I go in, I see him flank, and

1360
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:47,040
fluid. So, I go in, I see him flank, and
 

1361
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,750
fluid. So, I go in, I see him flank, and
I come back out to Joe range, and I'm

1362
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760
I come back out to Joe range, and I'm
 

1363
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,069
I come back out to Joe range, and I'm
now still on his center line. On me,

1364
00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:52,079
now still on his center line. On me,
 

1365
00:46:52,079 --> 00:47:04,069
now still on his center line. On me,
he's on his center line. Okay.

1366
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:04,079

 

1367
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,910

Just try.

1368
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:05,920
Just try.
 

1369
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:33,270
Just try.
Thank you.

1370
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:33,280

 

1371
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,990

You can still work on not getting

1372
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:36,000
You can still work on not getting
 

1373
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,950
You can still work on not getting
pressure.

1374
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:38,960
pressure.
 

1375
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,710
pressure.
It shouldn't come and get stuck on the

1376
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:40,720
It shouldn't come and get stuck on the
 

1377
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,550
It shouldn't come and get stuck on the
side of your body. You're lifting up

1378
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:42,560
side of your body. You're lifting up
 

1379
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:54,309
side of your body. You're lifting up
against your toe. Lower your center.

1380
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:54,319

 

1381
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,150

Keep your sword there as you do all

1382
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:56,160
Keep your sword there as you do all
 

1383
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,910
Keep your sword there as you do all
that.

1384
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:57,920
that.
 

1385
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,670
that.
No, we're not getting out of the way.

1386
00:47:59,670 --> 00:47:59,680
No, we're not getting out of the way.
 

1387
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,030
No, we're not getting out of the way.
We're just reestablishing neutrality in

1388
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:03,040
We're just reestablishing neutrality in
 

1389
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,190
We're just reestablishing neutrality in
terms of initiative.

1390
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:05,200
terms of initiative.
 

1391
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,349
terms of initiative.
No, no, no.

1392
00:48:07,349 --> 00:48:07,359
No, no, no.
 

1393
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:11,990
No, no, no.
We'll do it again.

1394
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,000

 

1395
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,990

I'm in and under. Pardon me.

1396
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:16,000
I'm in and under. Pardon me.
 

1397
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,069
I'm in and under. Pardon me.
If we go fast and you're going to finish

1398
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:18,079
If we go fast and you're going to finish
 

1399
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,829
If we go fast and you're going to finish
your cut. Okay. All right. Let me see

1400
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:19,839
your cut. Okay. All right. Let me see
 

1401
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,750
your cut. Okay. All right. Let me see
you do it.

1402
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:21,760
you do it.
 

1403
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,430
you do it.
Got the idea over here.

1404
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:25,440
Got the idea over here.
 

1405
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,750
Got the idea over here.
This is where I'm at. Now, I'm out of

1406
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:27,760
This is where I'm at. Now, I'm out of
 

1407
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,829
This is where I'm at. Now, I'm out of
bulk range, but I'm in Joe range. Okay.

1408
00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:31,839
bulk range, but I'm in Joe range. Okay.
 

1409
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,829
bulk range, but I'm in Joe range. Okay.
Try it again.

1410
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:33,839
Try it again.
 

1411
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,630
Try it again.
Keep your left foot forward. It's all

1412
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:36,640
Keep your left foot forward. It's all
 

1413
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,309
Keep your left foot forward. It's all
you have time for.

1414
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:40,319

 

1415
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:47,910

Left foot forward.

1416
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:47,920

 

1417
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,309

You move to

1418
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:50,319
You move to
 

1419
00:48:50,319 --> 00:49:08,549
You move to
the corners of the square.

1420
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:08,559

 

1421
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,470

You're picking up. Picking it up. Travis

1422
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:10,480
You're picking up. Picking it up. Travis

better. That's it.

1426
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,200
better. That's it.
 

1427
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,589
better. That's it.
Drop with your push. No. Come through

1428
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:19,599
Drop with your push. No. Come through
 

1429
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:27,510
Drop with your push. No. Come through
the back of your head.

1430
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:27,520

 

1431
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,670

You feel that pressure on the left. It's

1432
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:29,680
You feel that pressure on the left. It's
 

1433
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,349
You feel that pressure on the left. It's
because you're trying to pick it up. You

1434
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:31,359
because you're trying to pick it up. You
 

1435
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:35,030
because you're trying to pick it up. You
got to yield all the way up in the to.

1436
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:35,040
got to yield all the way up in the to.
 

1437
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:49,109
got to yield all the way up in the to.
So, let me see if I can show this.

1438
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:49,119

 

1439
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:54,630

So when his atoshi energy is coming and

1440
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:54,640
So when his atoshi energy is coming and
 

1441
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,990
So when his atoshi energy is coming and
I try to pick it up and he's driving

1442
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:58,000
I try to pick it up and he's driving
 

1443
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,910
I try to pick it up and he's driving
down, he gets stuck over here. You see?

1444
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:01,920
down, he gets stuck over here. You see?
 

1445
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,670
down, he gets stuck over here. You see?
And you can see my shoulders start to

1446
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:03,680
And you can see my shoulders start to
 

1447
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,670
And you can see my shoulders start to
turn. And it's all cuz I'm trying to

1448
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:05,680
turn. And it's all cuz I'm trying to
 

1449
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,950
turn. And it's all cuz I'm trying to
pick this up. If I didn't try to pick it

1450
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:08,960
pick this up. If I didn't try to pick it
 

1451
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,230
pick this up. If I didn't try to pick it
up and I let his weapon drop down,

1452
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:12,240
up and I let his weapon drop down,
 

1453
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,309
up and I let his weapon drop down,
my shoulders come right back to me. You

1454
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:14,319
my shoulders come right back to me. You
 

1455
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:18,870
my shoulders come right back to me. You
see that? So, I don't ever do this.

1456
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:18,880
see that? So, I don't ever do this.
 

1457
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,790
see that? So, I don't ever do this.
Got it? If you're feeling this thing

1458
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:22,800
Got it? If you're feeling this thing
 

1459
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,349
Got it? If you're feeling this thing
here, it's cuz you were lifting up

1460
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:25,359
here, it's cuz you were lifting up
 

1461
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,349
here, it's cuz you were lifting up
there. It's lifting up against their

1462
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:27,359
there. It's lifting up against their
 

1463
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,670
there. It's lifting up against their
tush. And in real life, you're not going

1464
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:29,680
tush. And in real life, you're not going
 

1465
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,589
tush. And in real life, you're not going
to be able to lift up. He's going to

1466
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:31,599
to be able to lift up. He's going to
 

1467
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,750
to be able to lift up. He's going to
check your feet and he's going to skewer

1468
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:33,760
check your feet and he's going to skewer
 

1469
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,470
check your feet and he's going to skewer
you. Okay? You have to be total void in

1470
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:36,480
you. Okay? You have to be total void in
 

1471
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,950
you. Okay? You have to be total void in
that part. So, as we're going slow now,

1472
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:38,960
that part. So, as we're going slow now,
 

1473
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,309
that part. So, as we're going slow now,
again, I want you to not lift

1474
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:44,319
again, I want you to not lift
 

1475
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,390
again, I want you to not lift
up on him,

1476
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:46,400
up on him,
 

1477
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,309
up on him,
not get

1478
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:48,319
not get
 

1479
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,230
not get
turned

1480
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:50,240
turned
 

1481
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,870
turned
like this. You can go as slow as you

1482
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:52,880
like this. You can go as slow as you
 

1483
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,950
like this. You can go as slow as you
want. This will be smooth.

1484
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:56,960
want. This will be smooth.
 

1485
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:03,750
want. This will be smooth.
Okay, got the idea?

1486
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:03,760

 

1487
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:10,309

Okay, try it. And then he does his move.

1488
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:10,319

 

1489
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:15,750

You might have to drop.

1490
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:15,760

 

1491
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,750

Don't move your sword when you move back

1492
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:17,760
Don't move your sword when you move back
 

1493
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:24,069
Don't move your sword when you move back
cuz that's not neutral.

1494
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:24,079

 

1495
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:43,829

Move to the corners of the square.

1496
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:43,839

 

1497
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:52,470

Drop drop. He's pushing down.

1498
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:52,480

 

1499
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,630

That's it, Chris.

1500
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640
That's it, Chris.
 

1501
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,190
That's it, Chris.
That's it.

1502
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:57,200
That's it.
 

1503
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,750
That's it.
That's it.

1504
00:51:59,750 --> 00:51:59,760
That's it.
 

1505
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:16,230
That's it.
One more

1506
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:16,240

 

1507
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:54,950

to your

1508
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:54,960

 

1509
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,630

Okay, that is the basic foot maneuver.

1510
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:00,640

 

1511
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,470

Slow it down. And now we're doing

1512
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:02,480
Slow it down. And now we're doing
 

1513
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,270
Slow it down. And now we're doing
embryionic technical training. Okay, so

1514
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:05,280
embryionic technical training. Okay, so
 

1515
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,150
embryionic technical training. Okay, so
I go one, I move here and I'm going to

1516
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:08,160
I go one, I move here and I'm going to
 

1517
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,470
I go one, I move here and I'm going to
come up. He's going to finish his cut.

1518
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:10,480
come up. He's going to finish his cut.
 

1519
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,870
come up. He's going to finish his cut.
He is now not cutting. You understand?

1520
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:12,880
He is now not cutting. You understand?
 

1521
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,829
He is now not cutting. You understand?
understand that he is giving me an angle

1522
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:15,839
understand that he is giving me an angle
 

1523
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:19,670
understand that he is giving me an angle
that I can use to train with. So

1524
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:19,680
that I can use to train with. So
 

1525
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,510
that I can use to train with. So
yeah, let's say my he could even put his

1526
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:23,520
yeah, let's say my he could even put his
 

1527
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,829
yeah, let's say my he could even put his
weapon up. It doesn't matter. But he

1528
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:25,839
weapon up. It doesn't matter. But he
 

1529
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,950
weapon up. It doesn't matter. But he
does not move his weapon. Okay,

1530
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:30,960

 

1531
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,270

I go one,

1532
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:33,280
I go one,
 

1533
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,109
I go one,
two, we make contact. You see how we did

1534
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:37,119
two, we make contact. You see how we did
 

1535
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:41,190
two, we make contact. You see how we did
that? Okay, now he stays there. He's not

1536
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:41,200
that? Okay, now he stays there. He's not
 

1537
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,589
that? Okay, now he stays there. He's not
letting it drop. He is a line for me to

1538
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:43,599
letting it drop. He is a line for me to
 

1539
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,750
letting it drop. He is a line for me to
train with.

1540
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:47,760

 

1541
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,870

I am going to rotate the cross. Come

1542
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:50,880
I am going to rotate the cross. Come
 

1543
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,390
I am going to rotate the cross. Come
down.

1544
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,400
down.
 

1545
00:53:52,400 --> 00:54:04,549
down.

1565
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:25,190

Don't step in.

1566
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:25,200

 

1567
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:40,069

Relax,

1568

relax.

1572
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:54,079

 

1573
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,630

Okay. Uh, some of you have done mitosis,

1574
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:56,640
Okay. Uh, some of you have done mitosis,
 

1575
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:02,549
Okay. Uh, some of you have done mitosis,
right? Yes. Right. Okay. Um, I call this

1576
00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:02,559
right? Yes. Right. Okay. Um, I call this
 

1577
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,190
right? Yes. Right. Okay. Um, I call this
an embionic and I told you his weapon is

1578
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:05,200
an embionic and I told you his weapon is
 

1579
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,270
an embionic and I told you his weapon is
not a cut at that portion. It's just a

1580
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:07,280
not a cut at that portion. It's just a
 

1581
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,829
not a cut at that portion. It's just a
line that I can use to train. Do you

1582
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:09,839
line that I can use to train. Do you
 

1583
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:13,030
line that I can use to train. Do you
guys understand that? Um,

1584
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:13,040
guys understand that? Um,
 

1585
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,549
guys understand that? Um,
where I used to train in the Federation,

1586
00:56:16,549 --> 00:56:16,559
where I used to train in the Federation,
 

1587
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,670
where I used to train in the Federation,
that was the only timing that they had.

1588
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:19,680
that was the only timing that they had.
 

1589
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,069
that was the only timing that they had.
And if you look at it, it's a block. Do

1590
00:56:24,069 --> 00:56:24,079
And if you look at it, it's a block. Do
 

1591
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,270
And if you look at it, it's a block. Do
you guys see that? And I will not be

1592
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:27,280
you guys see that? And I will not be
 

1593
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,030
you guys see that? And I will not be
able to block that weapon because he has

1594
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:31,040
able to block that weapon because he has
 

1595
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,750
able to block that weapon because he has
the leverage at the distal end of my

1596
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:33,760
the leverage at the distal end of my
 

1597
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,829
the leverage at the distal end of my
weapon. You guys all understand that.

1598
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:35,839
weapon. You guys all understand that.
 

1599
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,190
weapon. You guys all understand that.
Okay. Moreover, that's a contestation.

1600
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:39,200
Okay. Moreover, that's a contestation.
 

1601
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,670
Okay. Moreover, that's a contestation.
That's a young class. So that's not even

1602
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:41,680
That's a young class. So that's not even
 

1603
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,069
That's a young class. So that's not even
the art. Okay.

1604
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,079
the art. Okay.
 

1605
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,870
the art. Okay.
The So when we do this embryionic, I

1606
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:46,880
The So when we do this embryionic, I
 

1607
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,910
The So when we do this embryionic, I
want you to lose all of Marshall.

1608
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:49,920
want you to lose all of Marshall.
 

1609
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,109
want you to lose all of Marshall.
We're not doing that anymore. That's

1610
00:56:51,109 --> 00:56:51,119
We're not doing that anymore. That's
 

1611
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,710
We're not doing that anymore. That's
what I said when I what I meant when I

1612
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:52,720
what I said when I what I meant when I
 

1613
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,990
what I said when I what I meant when I
said we're going to do technical

1614
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,000
said we're going to do technical
 

1615
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,069
said we're going to do technical
training right now. Means we're not

1616
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:56,079
training right now. Means we're not
 

1617
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,470
training right now. Means we're not
doing dynamic high or anything. Okay. Um

1618
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:00,480
doing dynamic high or anything. Okay. Um
 

1619
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,630
doing dynamic high or anything. Okay. Um
so I'll show you what the what the

1620
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:02,640
so I'll show you what the what the
 

1621
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,430
so I'll show you what the what the
application timing is for mchiotoshi.

1622
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:05,440
application timing is for mchiotoshi.
 

1623
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,549
application timing is for mchiotoshi.
You'll see it doesn't look at all like

1624
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:08,559
You'll see it doesn't look at all like
 

1625
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,710
You'll see it doesn't look at all like
the other one. Okay. But conceptually it

1626
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:12,720
the other one. Okay. But conceptually it
 

1627
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,870
the other one. Okay. But conceptually it
is. The only thing that changes is the

1628
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:14,880
is. The only thing that changes is the
 

1629
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:19,990
is. The only thing that changes is the
timing. Okay. So, we're going in.

1630
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:20,000
timing. Okay. So, we're going in.
 

1631
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,829
timing. Okay. So, we're going in.
This is Makosh. So, at no point did I

1632
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:23,839
This is Makosh. So, at no point did I
 

1633
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:27,510
This is Makosh. So, at no point did I
block that weapon. I went around the

1634
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:27,520
block that weapon. I went around the
 

1635
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,990
block that weapon. I went around the
cross and attack the hands. You see

1636
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:30,000
cross and attack the hands. You see
 

1637
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,150
cross and attack the hands. You see
that?

1638
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:32,160
that?
 

1639
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,309
that?
So, in order to do that, his cut is

1640
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:36,319
So, in order to do that, his cut is
 

1641
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:41,670
So, in order to do that, his cut is
coming around and I have to already

1642
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:41,680
coming around and I have to already
 

1643
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,150
coming around and I have to already
be there,

1644
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:44,160
be there,
 

1645
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,710
be there,
maybe even here.

1646
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:46,720
maybe even here.
 

1647
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,510
maybe even here.
You see it comes in. Boom. And I'm

1648
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:49,520
You see it comes in. Boom. And I'm
 

1649
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,430
You see it comes in. Boom. And I'm
smashing it down. I'm smothering.

1650
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:51,440
smashing it down. I'm smothering.
 

1651
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,349
smashing it down. I'm smothering.
Killing that strike before it ever gets

1652
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:53,359
Killing that strike before it ever gets
 

1653
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,589
Killing that strike before it ever gets
out. Okay.

1654
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:55,599
out. Okay.
 

1655
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,390
out. Okay.
In order to do that, I need a

1656
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:58,400
In order to do that, I need a
 

1657
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,150
In order to do that, I need a
downwardness

1658
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:00,160
downwardness
 

1659
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,950
downwardness
on the smothering. Did you see that? I I

1660
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:02,960
on the smothering. Did you see that? I I
 

1661
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,789
on the smothering. Did you see that? I I
can't do a lateral movement. So, when

1662
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:06,799
can't do a lateral movement. So, when
 

1663
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,589
can't do a lateral movement. So, when
we're doing it embriionic

1664
00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:09,599
we're doing it embriionic
 

1665
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,150
we're doing it embriionic
and we're out here,

1666
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:12,160
and we're out here,
 

1667
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,430
and we're out here,
it's not that I'm fighting his weapon,

1668
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:15,440
it's not that I'm fighting his weapon,
 

1669
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,270
it's not that I'm fighting his weapon,
but I'm learning how to rotate the cross

1670
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:19,280
but I'm learning how to rotate the cross
 

1671
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,549
but I'm learning how to rotate the cross
against the showman angle of attack.

1672
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:22,559
against the showman angle of attack.
 

1673
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,069
against the showman angle of attack.
Okay? And the way that you do that

1674
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:26,079
Okay? And the way that you do that
 

1675
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,910
Okay? And the way that you do that
is I make contact here

1676
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:29,920
is I make contact here
 

1677
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:36,230
is I make contact here
and I go around it.

1678
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:36,240

 

1679
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,190

That's the angle that I want. You see

1680
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:39,200
That's the angle that I want. You see
 

1681
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:45,109
That's the angle that I want. You see
that? What would be different?

1682
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:45,119

 

1683
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,549

Imagine this thing is flying at me and

1684
00:58:48,549 --> 00:58:48,559
Imagine this thing is flying at me and
 

1685
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:53,030
Imagine this thing is flying at me and
you're trying to go like that.

1686
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:53,040

 

1687
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,030

Your window

1688
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:55,040
Your window
 

1689
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,510
Your window
for your angle of incidence is probably

1690
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:57,520
for your angle of incidence is probably
 

1691
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,270
for your angle of incidence is probably
this the diameter of the Joe. Okay. But

1692
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:01,280
this the diameter of the Joe. Okay. But
 

1693
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,349
this the diameter of the Joe. Okay. But
if you pay attention,

1694
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:03,359
if you pay attention,
 

1695
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:06,230
if you pay attention,
I'm shielding, right? My whole body's

1696
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:06,240
I'm shielding, right? My whole body's
 

1697
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,950
I'm shielding, right? My whole body's
shielding. I'm not going like this. No

1698
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:08,960
shielding. I'm not going like this. No
 

1699
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,990
shielding. I'm not going like this. No
shielding. See that?

1700
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,000
shielding. See that?
 

1701
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,430
shielding. See that?
And coming up and whipping.

1702
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:15,440
And coming up and whipping.
 

1703
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,190
And coming up and whipping.
You see that difference? So that's what

1704
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:17,200
You see that difference? So that's what
 

1705
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,750
You see that difference? So that's what
I'm doing here. Just embionically,

1706
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:19,760
I'm doing here. Just embionically,
 

1707
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,750
I'm doing here. Just embionically,
we're here.

1708
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:21,760
we're here.
 

1709
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,470
we're here.
That's the shielding angle. Then the

1710
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:24,480
That's the shielding angle. Then the
 

1711
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,990
That's the shielding angle. Then the
rotating of the cross and the smothering

1712
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:28,000
rotating of the cross and the smothering
 

1713
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,630
rotating of the cross and the smothering
part of the technique. Okay. So lose all

1714
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:32,640
part of the technique. Okay. So lose all
 

1715
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,630
part of the technique. Okay. So lose all
just make it a game. The game is

1716
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:36,640
just make it a game. The game is
 

1717
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,630
just make it a game. The game is
from here rotate around and come

1718
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:40,640
from here rotate around and come
 

1719
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,549
from here rotate around and come
straight down.

1720
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:42,559
straight down.
 

1721
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,470
straight down.
That's the game. Okay, let's try it

1722
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:44,480
That's the game. Okay, let's try it
 

1723
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,069
That's the game. Okay, let's try it
there.

1724
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:46,079
there.
 

1725
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,789
there.
Slow it way back down.

1726
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:48,799
Slow it way back down.
 

1727
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:59,030
Slow it way back down.
Not

1728
00:59:59,030 --> 00:59:59,040

 

1729
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:03,030

all the way down.

1730
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:03,040

 

1731
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:41,670

Don't step in.

1732
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:41,680

 

1733
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,270

Moving it to your right.

1734
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:45,280

 

1735
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:53,510

moved it to your right.

1736
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:53,520

 

1737
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,190

So, it's cuz you're not dropping under

1738
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:55,200
So, it's cuz you're not dropping under
 

1739
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,670
So, it's cuz you're not dropping under
it.

1740
01:00:59,670 --> 01:00:59,680

 

1741
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,069

So, Angelo, you're not a sore cut.

1742
01:01:02,069 --> 01:01:02,079
So, Angelo, you're not a sore cut.
 

1743
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,910
So, Angelo, you're not a sore cut.
You're going to hold your weapon there.

1744
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:03,920
You're going to hold your weapon there.
 

1745
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,430
You're going to hold your weapon there.
You're not going to let it fall when she

1746
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:05,440
You're not going to let it fall when she
 

1747
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,150
You're not going to let it fall when she
comes off of it. Okay. She will move it

1748
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:08,160
comes off of it. Okay. She will move it
 

1749
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,510
comes off of it. Okay. She will move it
down

1750
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:11,520

 

1751
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,670

and head. So, shoulder level on your

1752
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:13,680
and head. So, shoulder level on your
 

1753
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,870
and head. So, shoulder level on your
hands. Shoulder level. And then just

1754
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:16,880
hands. Shoulder level. And then just
 

1755
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:48,309
hands. Shoulder level. And then just
point your wrist to make contact.

1756
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:48,319

 

1757
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:55,910

Don't move in.

1758
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:55,920

 

1759
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,589

Okay. So, this is a common mistake,

1760
01:01:59,589 --> 01:01:59,599
Okay. So, this is a common mistake,
 

1761
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,870
Okay. So, this is a common mistake,
but it's a stress response.

1762
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:02,880
but it's a stress response.
 

1763
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,470
but it's a stress response.
Go back and think about what we're

1764
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:04,480
Go back and think about what we're
 

1765
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,870
Go back and think about what we're
doing. I came in void. He's trying to

1766
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:06,880
doing. I came in void. He's trying to
 

1767
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,789
doing. I came in void. He's trying to
flank and I move over here. And in the

1768
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:08,799
flank and I move over here. And in the
 

1769
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:13,430
flank and I move over here. And in the
application timing, what range was I in?

1770
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440
application timing, what range was I in?
 

1771
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,230
application timing, what range was I in?
Joe range. What range did I move out of?

1772
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:16,240
Joe range. What range did I move out of?
 

1773
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,109
Joe range. What range did I move out of?
Bulken range. Do you see that? That

1774
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:19,119
Bulken range. Do you see that? That
 

1775
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:24,150
Bulken range. Do you see that? That
thing is flying at me. And if I mess up,

1776
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:24,160
thing is flying at me. And if I mess up,
 

1777
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,190
thing is flying at me. And if I mess up,
I don't want it to hit me. Okay. So,

1778
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:27,200
I don't want it to hit me. Okay. So,
 

1779
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,710
I don't want it to hit me. Okay. So,
very common thing is you're doing the

1780
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:30,720
very common thing is you're doing the
 

1781
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,349
very common thing is you're doing the
embryionic and you move forward in

1782
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:33,359
embryionic and you move forward in
 

1783
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:37,910
embryionic and you move forward in
healing. You see that? Well, application

1784
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:37,920
healing. You see that? Well, application
 

1785
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,190
healing. You see that? Well, application
phase. You did a voc. I hope you got it

1786
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:41,200
phase. You did a voc. I hope you got it
 

1787
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,430
phase. You did a voc. I hope you got it
cuz if you didn't get it, it's going to

1788
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:43,440
cuz if you didn't get it, it's going to
 

1789
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,069
cuz if you didn't get it, it's going to
hit you. Okay. Like any fighting thing,

1790
01:02:48,069 --> 01:02:48,079
hit you. Okay. Like any fighting thing,
 

1791
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,470
hit you. Okay. Like any fighting thing,
you don't ever get to close the gap for

1792
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:50,480
you don't ever get to close the gap for
 

1793
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,150
you don't ever get to close the gap for
free.

1794
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:52,160
free.
 

1795
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,030
free.
You have to earn the gap. So, in the

1796
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:55,040
You have to earn the gap. So, in the
 

1797
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:01,750
You have to earn the gap. So, in the
first move, we earned the gap with the

1798
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:01,760
first move, we earned the gap with the
 

1799
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,510
first move, we earned the gap with the
came in after it. Remember Okay.

1800
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:05,520
came in after it. Remember Okay.
 

1801
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,710
came in after it. Remember Okay.
So, same thing here as we go to this

1802
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:08,720
So, same thing here as we go to this
 

1803
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,230
So, same thing here as we go to this
move. Here's my boom. Now, I can come in

1804
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:12,240
move. Here's my boom. Now, I can come in
 

1805
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,309
move. Here's my boom. Now, I can come in
because his weapon is off the block. You

1806
01:03:14,309 --> 01:03:14,319
because his weapon is off the block. You
 

1807
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:17,670
because his weapon is off the block. You
understand? You cannot come in on the

1808
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:17,680
understand? You cannot come in on the
 

1809
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,589
understand? You cannot come in on the
atus. You haven't earned it yet. He's

1810
01:03:19,589 --> 01:03:19,599
atus. You haven't earned it yet. He's
 

1811
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,589
atus. You haven't earned it yet. He's
not checked out at all yet. Okay? So,

1812
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:23,599
not checked out at all yet. Okay? So,
 

1813
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,910
not checked out at all yet. Okay? So,
it's a stress response.

1814
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:25,920
it's a stress response.
 

1815
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:32,150
it's a stress response.
Just do the movement.

1816
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:32,160

 

1817
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,670

That's it. Okay, try it again.

1818
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:35,680
That's it. Okay, try it again.
 

1819
01:03:35,680 --> 01:04:15,990
That's it. Okay, try it again.
Keep your feet still.

1820
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,000

 

1821
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:47,589

Don't Step forward.

1822
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:47,599

 

1823
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,069

Get your hand level. Get the hand level.

1824
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:52,079
Get your hand level. Get the hand level.
 

1825
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,390
Get your hand level. Get the hand level.
Get the hand level. So why hand level?

1826
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:56,400
Get the hand level. So why hand level?
 

1827
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,029
Get the hand level. So why hand level?
Why hand level? Because that's the my of

1828
01:04:59,029 --> 01:04:59,039
Why hand level? Because that's the my of
 

1829
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,670
Why hand level? Because that's the my of
his cut when he's trying to cut me. Do

1830
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:01,680
his cut when he's trying to cut me. Do
 

1831
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,990
his cut when he's trying to cut me. Do
you understand? It's out here. It's not

1832
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:04,000
you understand? It's out here. It's not
 

1833
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,190
you understand? It's out here. It's not
It's not over here like that. Okay.

1834
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:07,200
It's not over here like that. Okay.
 

1835
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,150
It's not over here like that. Okay.
Um,

1836
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:10,160
Um,
 

1837
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,150
Um,
so we're trying when we do an embryionic

1838
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:12,160
so we're trying when we do an embryionic
 

1839
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,789
so we're trying when we do an embryionic
train, we're trying to take as much as

1840
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:14,799
train, we're trying to take as much as
 

1841
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:19,829
train, we're trying to take as much as
we can of the actual application

1842
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:19,839

 

1843
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:23,029

and we can take the range. We just can't

1844
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:23,039
and we can take the range. We just can't
 

1845
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:25,910
and we can take the range. We just can't
take the timing. Do you understand? So,

1846
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:25,920
take the timing. Do you understand? So,
 

1847
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,990
take the timing. Do you understand? So,
you have to you cut out here and then

1848
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:30,000
you have to you cut out here and then
 

1849
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,190
you have to you cut out here and then
for the drill, I'll make contact.

1850
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:33,200
for the drill, I'll make contact.
 

1851
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,190
for the drill, I'll make contact.
When I go to make contact, I don't want

1852
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:35,200
When I go to make contact, I don't want
 

1853
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,950
When I go to make contact, I don't want
to make contact like that. That's the

1854
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:36,960
to make contact like that. That's the
 

1855
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,829
to make contact like that. That's the
wrong That's the wrong mind. Okay. So,

1856
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:39,839
wrong That's the wrong mind. Okay. So,
 

1857
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,950
wrong That's the wrong mind. Okay. So,
yes, you did your cut and Bionic, you're

1858
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:42,960
yes, you did your cut and Bionic, you're
 

1859
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,029
yes, you did your cut and Bionic, you're
going to make contact. Just angle your

1860
01:05:45,029 --> 01:05:45,039
going to make contact. Just angle your
 

1861
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:46,549
going to make contact. Just angle your
wrist a little more because it's not a

1862
01:05:46,549 --> 01:05:46,559
wrist a little more because it's not a
 

1863
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,789
wrist a little more because it's not a
shortcut and it's a line for them to

1864
01:05:48,789 --> 01:05:48,799
shortcut and it's a line for them to
 

1865
01:05:48,799 --> 01:06:01,109
shortcut and it's a line for them to
work with. Okay. Try it again.

1866
01:06:01,109 --> 01:06:01,119

 

1867
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:03,029

No, no, don't let him follow you like

1868
01:06:03,029 --> 01:06:03,039
No, no, don't let him follow you like
 

1869
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:10,710
No, no, don't let him follow you like
that. It goes to the other side.

1870
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:10,720

 

1871
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:36,710

 don't trap me.

1872
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:36,720

 

1873
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:48,390

Don't step forward.

1874
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:48,400

 

1875
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,190

Okay. So since I'm not doing the

1876
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:51,200
Okay. So since I'm not doing the
 

1877
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,430
Okay. So since I'm not doing the
technique, I'm doing a training. I'm

1878
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:53,440
technique, I'm doing a training. I'm
 

1879
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,750
technique, I'm doing a training. I'm
trying to train myself. Often times in

1880
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:55,760
trying to train myself. Often times in
 

1881
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,309
trying to train myself. Often times in
training, we exaggerate motion so that

1882
01:06:58,309 --> 01:06:58,319
training, we exaggerate motion so that
 

1883
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:01,510
training, we exaggerate motion so that
we get a better insight into it. Okay.

1884
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:01,520
we get a better insight into it. Okay.
 

1885
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,069
we get a better insight into it. Okay.
Um

1886
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:04,079
Um
 

1887
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:08,470
Um
you saw the dynamic variant and how much

1888
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:08,480
you saw the dynamic variant and how much
 

1889
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,510
you saw the dynamic variant and how much
dropping was there of my body? Do you

1890
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:11,520
dropping was there of my body? Do you
 

1891
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,270
dropping was there of my body? Do you
know what I mean? Did I did you see did

1892
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:13,280
know what I mean? Did I did you see did
 

1893
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,349
know what I mean? Did I did you see did
it look it didn't look like that? Do you

1894
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:15,359
it look it didn't look like that? Do you
 

1895
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,349
it look it didn't look like that? Do you
guys understand? Okay. But in the

1896
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:17,359
guys understand? Okay. But in the
 

1897
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:21,109
guys understand? Okay. But in the
embryionic level, I want you to send all

1898
01:07:21,109 --> 01:07:21,119
embryionic level, I want you to send all
 

1899
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:24,789
embryionic level, I want you to send all
the yawn aspect down all the way to it's

1900
01:07:24,789 --> 01:07:24,799
the yawn aspect down all the way to it's
 

1901
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,270
the yawn aspect down all the way to it's
completely underneath you. Okay? So,

1902
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:27,280
completely underneath you. Okay? So,
 

1903
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,870
completely underneath you. Okay? So,
we'll do this drill.

1904
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:30,880
we'll do this drill.
 

1905
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,029
we'll do this drill.
And if you pay attention, I'll I'll show

1906
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:33,039
And if you pay attention, I'll I'll show
 

1907
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:34,630
And if you pay attention, I'll I'll show
several variants. Again, you got to

1908
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:34,640
several variants. Again, you got to
 

1909
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,789
several variants. Again, you got to
watch what I'm doing.

1910
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:38,799

 

1911
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:42,950

If I have the power hand out here

1912
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:42,960
If I have the power hand out here
 

1913
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,029
If I have the power hand out here
away from my center,

1914
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:47,039
away from my center,
 

1915
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:49,750
away from my center,
It's going to be require much more

1916
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:49,760
It's going to be require much more
 

1917
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,589
It's going to be require much more
internal skill to get that to drop

1918
01:07:53,589 --> 01:07:53,599
internal skill to get that to drop
 

1919
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:57,270
internal skill to get that to drop
and to make that heavy. Okay. The more

1920
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:57,280
and to make that heavy. Okay. The more
 

1921
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,510
and to make that heavy. Okay. The more
my power hand, which is the rear hand,

1922
01:07:59,510 --> 01:07:59,520
my power hand, which is the rear hand,
 

1923
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,750
my power hand, which is the rear hand,
why is it the power hand? Because it's

1924
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:01,760
why is it the power hand? Because it's
 

1925
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,390
why is it the power hand? Because it's
the most distal from the end, this means

1926
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:04,400
the most distal from the end, this means
 

1927
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,109
the most distal from the end, this means
that I increase the acceleration at the

1928
01:08:07,109 --> 01:08:07,119
that I increase the acceleration at the
 

1929
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,109
that I increase the acceleration at the
distal end. And mass times acceleration

1930
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:09,119
distal end. And mass times acceleration
 

1931
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,990
distal end. And mass times acceleration
equals force. Okay? But if I have it out

1932
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:12,000
equals force. Okay? But if I have it out
 

1933
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,510
equals force. Okay? But if I have it out
there,

1934
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:13,520
there,
 

1935
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:18,550
there,
my weight isn't really physically in and

1936
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:18,560
my weight isn't really physically in and
 

1937
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,110
my weight isn't really physically in and
over it. But if I keep the power hand

1938
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,120
over it. But if I keep the power hand
 

1939
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,950
over it. But if I keep the power hand
here underneath me, when I drop, it

1940
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:24,960
here underneath me, when I drop, it
 

1941
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,269
here underneath me, when I drop, it
drops too. Okay. So, we'll watch the

1942
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:27,279
drops too. Okay. So, we'll watch the
 

1943
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,910
drops too. Okay. So, we'll watch the
first move and pay attention where that

1944
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:29,920
first move and pay attention where that
 

1945
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,870
first move and pay attention where that
hand goes. That hand goes here. Okay.

1946
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:32,880
hand goes. That hand goes here. Okay.
 

1947
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,789
hand goes. That hand goes here. Okay.
First move

1948
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:34,799
First move
 

1949
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,030
First move
here.

on the very last exercise the power hand
 

2113
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,830
on the very last exercise the power hand
felt like it was right. I don't think my

2114
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:29,840
felt like it was right. I don't think my
 

2115
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,669
felt like it was right. I don't think my
left hand was right on a couple of them

2116
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:31,679
left hand was right on a couple of them
 

2117
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,510
left hand was right on a couple of them
and so it created a little bit of an

2118
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:33,520
and so it created a little bit of an
 

2119
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,310
and so it created a little bit of an
angle that made me tip backwards and

2120
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:36,320
angle that made me tip backwards and
 

2121
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,630
angle that made me tip backwards and
then when I brought it in I wasn't in

2122
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:38,640
then when I brought it in I wasn't in
 

2123
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,110
then when I brought it in I wasn't in
the right mind.

2124
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:41,120
the right mind.
 

2125
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,790
the right mind.
Um

2126
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:42,800
Um
 

2127
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,390
Um
third the concept of third gem.

2128
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:46,400
third the concept of third gem.
 

2129
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,070
third the concept of third gem.
So

2130
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:48,080
So
 

2131
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,750
So
um

2132
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:49,760
um
 

2133
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:54,070
um
your where your hands hang naturally

2134
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:54,080
your where your hands hang naturally
 

2135
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,510
your where your hands hang naturally
here this is and your joe should be

2136
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:57,520
here this is and your joe should be
 

2137
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,070
here this is and your joe should be
measured for this. Okay. Meaning you'll

2138
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:00,080
measured for this. Okay. Meaning you'll
 

2139
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,790
measured for this. Okay. Meaning you'll
cut it or you'll get it longer. Okay. So

2140
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:02,800
cut it or you'll get it longer. Okay. So
 

2141
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,790
cut it or you'll get it longer. Okay. So
that is third Joe and that is where I

2142
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:06,800
that is third Joe and that is where I
 

2143
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,070
that is third Joe and that is where I
always come in and out of. I never want

2144
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:10,080
always come in and out of. I never want
 

2145
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,590
always come in and out of. I never want
to go to half joe. Okay, half joe means

2146
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:13,600
to go to half joe. Okay, half joe means
 

2147
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,149
to go to half joe. Okay, half joe means
your hand is in the middle of the fight.

2148
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:16,159
your hand is in the middle of the fight.
 

2149
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:19,030
your hand is in the middle of the fight.
In this case, bulk range. Okay, so

2150
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:19,040
In this case, bulk range. Okay, so
 

2151
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,750
In this case, bulk range. Okay, so
you're always at third. So when you're

2152
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:21,760
you're always at third. So when you're
 

2153
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:26,149
you're always at third. So when you're
when you do the the maneuver,

2154
01:14:26,149 --> 01:14:26,159
when you do the the maneuver,
 

2155
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:28,630
when you do the the maneuver,
where does your hand go?

2156
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:28,640
where does your hand go?
 

2157
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,830
where does your hand go?
Your hand goes at third. Okay, so you

2158
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:31,840
Your hand goes at third. Okay, so you
 

2159
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,390
Your hand goes at third. Okay, so you
come in, it stays at third Joe. You go

2160
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:34,400
come in, it stays at third Joe. You go
 

2161
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,750
come in, it stays at third Joe. You go
to mafia stays at third Joe stays at

2162
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:37,760
to mafia stays at third Joe stays at
 

2163
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,030
to mafia stays at third Joe stays at
third Joe. Okay, you it does happen a

2164
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,040
third Joe. Okay, you it does happen a
 

2165
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,750
third Joe. Okay, you it does happen a
lot and if you watch old we have a

2185
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,470
towards it. Um it's no different than um
uh where we put our holsters nowadays.

2186
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:14,480
uh where we put our holsters nowadays.
 

2187
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:18,709
uh where we put our holsters nowadays.
So, you might have seen some cops and

2188
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:18,719
So, you might have seen some cops and
 

2189
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,149
So, you might have seen some cops and
cops have the 3:00, right? And it's very

2190

cops have the 3:00, right? And it's very
 

2191
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:24,870
cops have the 3:00, right? And it's very
department oriented. Put it on 3:00 and

2192
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:24,880
department oriented. Put it on 3:00 and
 

2193
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,229
department oriented. Put it on 3:00 and
somebody's a long time ago was like

2194
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:26,239
somebody's a long time ago was like
 

2195
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:30,310
somebody's a long time ago was like
3:00. at 3:00. Um, but the world's way

2196
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:30,320
3:00. at 3:00. Um, but the world's way
 

2197
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,950
3:00. at 3:00. Um, but the world's way
more violent and how fast you get your

2198
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:32,960

01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,390
gun out often decides the difference.
And so people uh started looking what

2202
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:38,400
And so people uh started looking what
 

2203
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,110
And so people uh started looking what

2206
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:43,040
these guns and they didn't carry them at
 

2207
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,030
these guns and they didn't carry them at

2224
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:08,320
right here. So, it's more at 2:30 2:00
 

2225
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,510
right here. So, it's more at 2:30 2:00
max in that area. So, keep an eye out

2226
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:11,520
max in that area. So, keep an eye out
 

2227
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,229
max in that area. So, keep an eye out
cuz uh I train all a lot of these cops

2228
01:16:14,229 --> 01:16:14,239
cuz uh I train all a lot of these cops
 

2229
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,070
cuz uh I train all a lot of these cops
around and start looking. You see a cop,

2230
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
around and start looking. You see a cop,
 

2231
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,149
around and start looking. You see a cop,
go see where their holster is and you'll

2232
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:18,159
go see where their holster is and you'll
 

2233
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:21,350
go see where their holster is and you'll
see is that 2:30 or straight 3:00. Okay.

2234
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:21,360
see is that 2:30 or straight 3:00. Okay.
 

2235
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,669
see is that 2:30 or straight 3:00. Okay.
Um, if you see one at 3:30, I'm going to

2236
01:16:23,669 --> 01:16:23,679
Um, if you see one at 3:30, I'm going to
 

2237
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,870
Um, if you see one at 3:30, I'm going to
risk it and go, "Where did they tell you

2238
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:24,880
risk it and go, "Where did they tell you
 

2239
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,149
risk it and go, "Where did they tell you
to put that gun?"

2240
01:16:28,149 --> 01:16:28,159
to put that gun?"
 

2241
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:29,910
to put that gun?"
Because they always have to tell someone

2242
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:29,920
Because they always have to tell someone
 

2243
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,830
Because they always have to tell someone
in the academy like, "Dude, your gun is

2244
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:31,840
in the academy like, "Dude, your gun is
 

2245
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,669
in the academy like, "Dude, your gun is
too far back. You want to live or not?"

2246
01:16:33,669 --> 01:16:33,679
too far back. You want to live or not?"
 

2247
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:35,830
too far back. You want to live or not?"
Okay. But you're starting to see it a

2248
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:35,840
Okay. But you're starting to see it a
 

2249
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,550
Okay. But you're starting to see it a
lot more that that gun's moving towards

2250
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:38,560
lot more that that gun's moving towards
 

2251
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,510
lot more that that gun's moving towards
where the old west had their guns uh

2252
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:41,520
where the old west had their guns uh
 

2253
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,550
where the old west had their guns uh
over here 2:30 2:00 kind of stuff. Okay?

2254
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:44,560
over here 2:30 2:00 kind of stuff. Okay?
 

2255
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,189
over here 2:30 2:00 kind of stuff. Okay?
And it just has to do where does my body

2256
01:16:47,189 --> 01:16:47,199
And it just has to do where does my body
 

2257
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:50,630
And it just has to do where does my body
naturally want to be. So, my body does

2258
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:50,640
naturally want to be. So, my body does
 

2259
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,310
naturally want to be. So, my body does
does not want to do that. That feels

2260
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:52,320
does not want to do that. That feels
 

2261
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,310
does not want to do that. That feels
