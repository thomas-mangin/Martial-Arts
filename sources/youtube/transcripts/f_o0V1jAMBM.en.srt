00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,029
so this comes here this one goes behind
their buttock

354
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
their buttock
 

355
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,270
their buttock
this one comes up their body

356
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
this one comes up their body
 

357
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,670
this one comes up their body
up their center line

358
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
up their center line
 

359
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,790
up their center line
and it's going to go over here

360
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
and it's going to go over here
 

361
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,869
and it's going to go over here
it's going to come up and

362
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
it's going to come up and
 

363
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,469
it's going to come up and
make a track over as close as you can to

364
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
make a track over as close as you can to
 

365
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,710
make a track over as close as you can to
their side of their neck because that's

366
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
their side of their neck because that's
 

367
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,110
their side of their neck because that's
the quickest point of entry for you

368
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120

 

369
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,550

so

370
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560

 

371
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,309

here

372
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319

 

373
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,990

here

374
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
here
 

375
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,070
here
and again you'll see the arm doesn't

376
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
and again you'll see the arm doesn't
 

377
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,830
and again you'll see the arm doesn't
wave around a lot

378
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840
wave around a lot
 

379
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,510
wave around a lot
it comes here

380
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520

 

381
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,749

there's a very faster rim and aggie from

382
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
there's a very faster rim and aggie from
 

383
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,070
there's a very faster rim and aggie from
sherman ooch where you knock their

384
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
sherman ooch where you knock their
 

385
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,469
sherman ooch where you knock their
showmans slightly offline you go past

386
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
showmans slightly offline you go past
 

387
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,550
showmans slightly offline you go past
their neck

388
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,560
their neck
 

389
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,909
their neck
and you

390
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
and you
 

391
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,270
and you
aim like this and you do a lemonade

392
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
aim like this and you do a lemonade
 

393
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,589
aim like this and you do a lemonade
so it's got very similar characteristic

394
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
so it's got very similar characteristic
 

395
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,509
so it's got very similar characteristic
to that

396
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
to that
 

397
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,029
to that

398
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
tension aggie
 

399
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,350
tension aggie
as i've said kind of the gallery

400
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
as i've said kind of the gallery
 

401
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,389
as i've said kind of the gallery

it
 

449
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,430
it
it's a very difficult technique but if

450
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
it's a very difficult technique but if
 

451
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,590
it's a very difficult technique but if
you find the heaven and earth concept

452
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
you find the heaven and earth concept
 

453
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,509
you find the heaven and earth concept
you don't need strength you need

454
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
you don't need strength you need
 

455
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,150
you don't need strength you need
fluidity

456
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
fluidity
 

457
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,710
fluidity
and then mass

458
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
and then mass
 

459
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,949
and then mass
fluidity and then math so you're

460
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
fluidity and then math so you're
 

461
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,110

it's difficult to say you shouldn't be

462
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
it's difficult to say you shouldn't be
 

463
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,030
it's difficult to say you shouldn't be

00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
deterred
 

465
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,790
deterred
but that could mean

466
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
but that could mean
 

467
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,870
but that could mean
you have to be stubborn

468
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
you have to be stubborn
 

469
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,470
you have to be stubborn
so in a way you might have to be

470
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
so in a way you might have to be
 

471
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,190
so in a way you might have to be

mind
 

475
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,910
mind
on the price

476
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
on the price
 

477
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,990
on the price
so

478
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
so
 

479
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,110
so
okay link the two together the two

480
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
okay link the two together the two
 

481
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,590
okay link the two together the two
together

482
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
together
 

483
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,310
together
what that does

484
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
what that does
 

485
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,550
what that does
when correct

486
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560

 

487
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,910

you can't really see this

488
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
you can't really see this
 

489
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,470
you can't really see this
very well

490
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
very well
 

491
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,389
very well
but on this one this is

492
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
but on this one this is
 

493
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,389
