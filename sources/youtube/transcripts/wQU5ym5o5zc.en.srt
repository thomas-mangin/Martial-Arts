so we're letting do not do that and we

36
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:42,590
so we're letting do not do that and we
 

37
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,410
so we're letting do not do that and we
can do some training and the reason we

38
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:44,420
can do some training and the reason we
 

39
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,300
can do some training and the reason we
picked that one is this that these stops

40
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,310
picked that one is this that these stops
 

41
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,210

you from breaking your down okay and
then everything else is fake so we want

44
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:53,420
then everything else is fake so we want
 

45
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,260
then everything else is fake so we want

which might start over and do the same

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,010
which might start over and do the same
 

57

this is the next slide right it is a
 

59
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:40,130
this is the next slide right it is a
little different I can see that maybe my

60
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,140
little different I can see that maybe my
 

61
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,899
little different I can see that maybe my
breath okay and what I want to do in

62
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:47,909
breath okay and what I want to do in
 

63

the butt from going backwards okay
 

67
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,430
the butt from going backwards okay
because the next one we're not going to

68
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
because the next one we're not going to
 

69
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,460
because the next one we're not going to
so let's try this again

70
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:00,470
so let's try this again
 

71
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,129
so let's try this again
rather than me that when we do cami you

only go to this level don't pull back to
that other level okay and you always are

00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:10,019
that other level okay and you always are
 

77
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,300
that other level okay and you always are
trying at least this note so on this one

78
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:13,310
trying at least this note so on this one
 

79
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,259
trying at least this note so on this one
I'm not going to walk back because when

80
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:18,269
I'm not going to walk back because when
 

81
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,860
I'm not going to walk back because when
I walk backwards my Center still going

82
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:21,870
I walk backwards my Center still going
 

83
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,610
I walk backwards my Center still going
that way

84
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:22,620
that way
 

85
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:31,069
that way
even though it's not pulling out so I'm

86
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:31,079
even though it's not pulling out so I'm
 

87
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,689
even though it's not pulling out so I'm
gonna just have my feet still and I'm

88
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:35,699
gonna just have my feet still and I'm
 

89
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,050
gonna just have my feet still and I'm
going to push my Center so far forward

90
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,060
going to push my Center so far forward
 

91
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,659
going to push my Center so far forward
and then a certain point I'm going to

92
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:41,669
and then a certain point I'm going to
 

93
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,059
and then a certain point I'm going to
contract it just like when I do any

94
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:46,069
contract it just like when I do any
 

95
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:48,559
contract it just like when I do any
projection so we were doing this

96
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:48,569
projection so we were doing this
 

97
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:54,930
projection so we were doing this
technique and when I go to throw

98
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:54,940

 

99
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,690

it looks like this if you come on this

100
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:57,700
it looks like this if you come on this
 

101
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,289
it looks like this if you come on this
plane I'm here like this I squeeze my

102
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:01,299
plane I'm here like this I squeeze my
 

103
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,789
plane I'm here like this I squeeze my
Center and it brings my extremities out

104
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:05,799
Center and it brings my extremities out
 

105
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,699
Center and it brings my extremities out
so I'm not going like this you see the

106
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:08,709
so I'm not going like this you see the
 

107
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:09,300
so I'm not going like this you see the
difference

108
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,310
difference
 

109
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,550
difference
I just flexed my cetera and you see what

110
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
I just flexed my cetera and you see what
 

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,670
I just flexed my cetera and you see what
happens when I release it boom bleep it

112
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
happens when I release it boom bleep it
 

113
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,729
happens when I release it boom bleep it
just drops okay so I'm gonna do that

114
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:20,739
just drops okay so I'm gonna do that
 

115
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:24,900
just drops okay so I'm gonna do that
question but the most extreme forward

116
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:24,910
question but the most extreme forward
 

117
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,140
question but the most extreme forward
progression of my hips that I can get so

118
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,150
progression of my hips that I can get so
 

119
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,689
progression of my hips that I can get so
it will help if I come off my heels

120
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:30,699
it will help if I come off my heels
 

121
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:33,629
it will help if I come off my heels
because that allows me to get going so I

122
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:33,639
because that allows me to get going so I
 

123
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:43,760
because that allows me to get going so I
keep going and I land on the same way

124
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:43,770

 

125
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,210

not enough I don't know I'm gonna keep

going
 

129
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:57,440
going
send them forward land the same way okay

that's where we want everyone began okay

356
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:54,779
that's where we want everyone began okay
 

357
00:14:54,779 --> 00:15:02,129
that's where we want everyone began okay
all right let's go

358
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:02,139

 

359
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:06,129

okay so this half this side everything's

360
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:06,139
okay so this half this side everything's
 

361
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:13,059
okay so this half this side everything's
going this way he goes turning already

our head goes around the line of attack
 

367
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:21,879
our head goes around the line of attack
so it doesn't remain on it so that our

368
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:21,889
so it doesn't remain on it so that our
 

369
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:25,269
so it doesn't remain on it so that our
lower body is not not pushing our head

370
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
lower body is not not pushing our head
 

371
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,119

to the target more into the ground
okay try it again remember that there's

374
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:31,100
okay try it again remember that there's
 

375
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,900
okay try it again remember that there's
a relationship between target was of

00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,259
that have to go together
so our architectures are a little

00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:44,269
so our architectures are a little
 

385
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:51,189
so our architectures are a little
different in this case other

it's another one of those
counterintuitive things where if I could

guys here and they would not throw me

564
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,390
guys here and they would not throw me
 

565
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,029
guys here and they would not throw me
hardly anywhere and then I wouldn't have

566
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:06,039
hardly anywhere and then I wouldn't have
 

567
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:14,399
hardly anywhere and then I wouldn't have
to freak about do coming yeah and it

568
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:14,409
to freak about do coming yeah and it
 

569
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:16,409
to freak about do coming yeah and it
would go away though for anyone even

570
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:16,419
would go away though for anyone even
 

571
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:19,289
would go away though for anyone even
smaller so I'm far from one of the

572
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:19,299
smaller so I'm far from one of the
 

573
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:22,260
smaller so I'm far from one of the
largest people here but I still not

574
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,270
largest people here but I still not

so even though I may exhaust you and you

580
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,010
so even though I may exhaust you and you
 

581
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,880
so even though I may exhaust you and you
become more accepting in your kidney and
