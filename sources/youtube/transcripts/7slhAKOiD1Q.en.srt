okay this
 

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,990
okay this
variant is not uh EO so you can see the

10
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
variant is not uh EO so you can see the
 

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,030
variant is not uh EO so you can see the
Y hand is on the

12
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,040
Y hand is on the
 

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,030
Y hand is on the
forearm not on the

14
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
forearm not on the
 

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,109
forearm not on the
elbow and this variant is different from

16
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
elbow and this variant is different from
 

17
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,429
elbow and this variant is different from
the Niko

18

okay so as I come

22
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
okay so as I come
 

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,510
okay so as I come
around you're seeking contact point in

24
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
around you're seeking contact point in
 

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,510
around you're seeking contact point in
his Center this this hand has to control

26
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
his Center this this hand has to control
 

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,149
his Center this this hand has to control
his Center you have to seize his Center

28
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:47,159
his Center you have to seize his Center
 

29
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,230
his Center you have to seize his Center
so I'm reconciling the grip I get to the

30
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
so I'm reconciling the grip I get to the
 

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,030
so I'm reconciling the grip I get to the
outside and then we we we're connected

32
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,040
outside and then we we we're connected
 

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,270
outside and then we we we're connected
right now so he can't push at

34
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280
right now so he can't push at
 

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,630
right now so he can't push at
me you can stand up

36
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:01,640
me you can stand up
 

37
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,109
me you can stand up
we I'm in that Co you thing okay he's

38
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:04,119
we I'm in that Co you thing okay he's
 

39
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:07,510
we I'm in that Co you thing okay he's
down and and of course you can project

40
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,520
down and and of course you can project
 

41
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,510
down and and of course you can project
but here I'm equating the the uh y value

42
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
but here I'm equating the the uh y value
 

43
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,630
but here I'm equating the the uh y value
of his body and taking him into the

44
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
of his body and taking him into the
 

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,509
of his body and taking him into the
spiral okay this is assisted by the

46
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:17,519
spiral okay this is assisted by the
 

47
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,070
spiral okay this is assisted by the
other hand so as the two hands are doing

48
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,080
other hand so as the two hands are doing
 

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,589
other hand so as the two hands are doing
this I'm not trying to slam them right

50
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
this I'm not trying to slam them right
 

51
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,350
this I'm not trying to slam them right
here because I'm standing right in front

52
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
here because I'm standing right in front
 

53
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,830
here because I'm standing right in front
of him and I always want this fight to

54
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
of him and I always want this fight to
 

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,710
of him and I always want this fight to
spiral rotate so he has to go past

56
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
spiral rotate so he has to go past
 

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,790
spiral rotate so he has to go past
okay and that gives me the opening for

58
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
okay and that gives me the opening for
 

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,750
okay and that gives me the opening for
the E

60
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:40,760

 

61
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,910

Eng so if you don't if you don't have

62
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
Eng so if you don't if you don't have
 

63
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,110
Eng so if you don't if you don't have
your ability to touch something and

64
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,120
your ability to touch something and
 

65
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,309
your ability to touch something and
touches Center this technique you're

66
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
touches Center this technique you're
 

67
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,750
touches Center this technique you're
going to have a hard time with it that's

68
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
going to have a hard time with it that's
 

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,470
going to have a hard time with it that's
why we're doing it okay so I come around

70
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:53,480
why we're doing it okay so I come around
 

71
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,270
why we're doing it okay so I come around
and you're in Center I'm not slamming

72
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
and you're in Center I'm not slamming
 

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,509
and you're in Center I'm not slamming
them down here I personally don't have

74
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
them down here I personally don't have
 

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,630
them down here I personally don't have
thumbs my thumbs were br broken in the

76
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
thumbs my thumbs were br broken in the
 

77
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,509
thumbs my thumbs were br broken in the
'90s they don't

78
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
'90s they don't
 

79
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,589
'90s they don't
work and if I try to torque his body

80
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
work and if I try to torque his body
 

81
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,430
work and if I try to torque his body
here uh it hurts my thumbs and he just

82
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
here uh it hurts my thumbs and he just
 

83
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,390
here uh it hurts my thumbs and he just
slowly he can overpower me he's going to

84
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:15,400
slowly he can overpower me he's going to
 

85
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,949
slowly he can overpower me he's going to
get out of it cuz I don't have it so

86
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:17,959
get out of it cuz I don't have it so
 

87
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,910
get out of it cuz I don't have it so
you're not you don't want to use your

88
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
you're not you don't want to use your
 

89
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,149
you're not you don't want to use your
strength because even if you did not

90
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
strength because even if you did not
 

91
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,710
strength because even if you did not
have broken thumbs like

92
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
have broken thumbs like
 

93
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,750
have broken thumbs like
me uh somebody could always outow that

94
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:28,760
me uh somebody could always outow that
 

95
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,509
me uh somebody could always outow that
joint it's just a very very inferior

96
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:30,519
joint it's just a very very inferior
 

97
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,910
joint it's just a very very inferior
joint so you don't crank here you you

98
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:34,920
joint so you don't crank here you you
 

99
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,070
joint so you don't crank here you you
move that you move his body okay you

100
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
move that you move his body okay you
 

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,470
move that you move his body okay you
move his body and then we take him into

102
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:41,480
move his body and then we take him into
 

103
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,670
move his body and then we take him into
the E ending which we're ending this way

104
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
the E ending which we're ending this way
 

105
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,990
the E ending which we're ending this way
and I want to get there but right now

106
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
and I want to get there but right now
 

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,949
and I want to get there but right now
pay attention to this beginning

108
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
pay attention to this beginning
 

109
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,229
pay attention to this beginning
around in moving him enter slide up to

hold slides it's like in knife training

118
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:07,560
hold slides it's like in knife training
 

119
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,670

don't come off and on just slide

120
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:10,680
don't come off and on just slide
 

121
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,190
don't come off and on just slide
up and we'll stop

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:27,670
there boom right into the
body in techniqu

126
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680

 

127
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,790

St okay make that distinction

128
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
St okay make that distinction
 

129
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,830
St okay make that distinction
go okay so as I'm working these these

130
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:36,840
go okay so as I'm working these these
 

131
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,670
go okay so as I'm working these these
forces here it's it's these it's the

132
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
forces here it's it's these it's the
 

133
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,749
forces here it's it's these it's the
forces uh on his body the internal

134
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
forces uh on his body the internal
 

135
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,950
forces uh on his body the internal
forces on his body it's not the uh

136
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
forces on his body it's not the uh
 

137
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,070
forces on his body it's not the uh
skeletal muscular uh working of his

138
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
skeletal muscular uh working of his
 

139
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,070
skeletal muscular uh working of his
joint CU I I'm not strong enough you see

140
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,080
joint CU I I'm not strong enough you see
 

141
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,909
joint CU I I'm not strong enough you see
but when we're in this process do you

142
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
but when we're in this process do you
 

143
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,950
but when we're in this process do you
see um and I'm not trying to just use my

144
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:01,960
see um and I'm not trying to just use my
 

145
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,430
see um and I'm not trying to just use my
thumb to hold here or I'm not trying to

146
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:04,440
thumb to hold here or I'm not trying to
 

147
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,870
thumb to hold here or I'm not trying to
crank down here he's he's just with you

148
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:07,880
crank down here he's he's just with you
 

149
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,629
crank down here he's he's just with you
can see how open my grip is so I am

150
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
can see how open my grip is so I am
 

151
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,670
can see how open my grip is so I am
cutting vectors through his body and so

152
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
cutting vectors through his body and so
 

153
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,550
cutting vectors through his body and so
maybe get closer on this hand too so you

154
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
maybe get closer on this hand too so you
 

155
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,350
maybe get closer on this hand too so you
can see where's where's his thumb

156
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:18,360
can see where's where's his thumb
 

157
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,350
can see where's where's his thumb
where's his thumb okay that's what you

158
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,360
where's his thumb okay that's what you
 

159
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,270
where's his thumb okay that's what you
want to know okay and so those forces

160
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
want to know okay and so those forces
 

161
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,990
want to know okay and so those forces
are working in him and if we were moving

162
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
are working in him and if we were moving
 

163
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,029
are working in him and if we were moving
those forces are greater so he still

164
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
those forces are greater so he still
 

165
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,990
those forces are greater so he still
can't stand up

166
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
can't stand up
 

167
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,110
can't stand up
try but it's not the same thing as he

168
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
try but it's not the same thing as he
 

169
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,870
try but it's not the same thing as he
better go down cuz I'm going to break

170
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
better go down cuz I'm going to break
 

171
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,950
better go down cuz I'm going to break
his wrist do do you get that if if he

172
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:39,960
his wrist do do you get that if if he
 

173
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,550
his wrist do do you get that if if he
stands up like I want you to slowly uh

174
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:43,560
stands up like I want you to slowly uh
 

175
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,150
stands up like I want you to slowly uh
TR try to do it and and then tap when

176
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,160
TR try to do it and and then tap when
 

177
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,710
TR try to do it and and then tap when
you don't like it on your body you see

178
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:49,720
you don't like it on your body you see
 

179
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,909
you don't like it on your body you see
it's still on but it's not on by the

180
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
it's still on but it's not on by the
 

181
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,710
it's still on but it's not on by the
same mechanisms okay uh and that's

182
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
same mechanisms okay uh and that's
 

183
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,430
same mechanisms okay uh and that's
important because people are strong and

184
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:56,440
important because people are strong and
 

185
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,309
important because people are strong and
this is a very weak engine a skeletal

186
00:05:59,309 --> 00:05:59,319
this is a very weak engine a skeletal
 

187
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,590
this is a very weak engine a skeletal
engine so make sure you're doing that

188
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
engine so make sure you're doing that
 

189
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,590
engine so make sure you're doing that
correctly cuz even even in Kempo when he

190
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:04,600
correctly cuz even even in Kempo when he
 

191
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,070
correctly cuz even even in Kempo when he
used to you do n or me in Kempo we had

192
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
used to you do n or me in Kempo we had
 

193
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,830
used to you do n or me in Kempo we had
one technique where you just here you

194
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
one technique where you just here you
 

195
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,350
one technique where you just here you
just and you just rip it out and you're

196
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:12,360
just and you just rip it out and you're
 

197
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,390
just and you just rip it out and you're
you're now free to hit that guy okay um

198
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:15,400
you're now free to hit that guy okay um
 

199
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,029
you're now free to hit that guy okay um
and where did I come out of the thumb

200
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:18,039
and where did I come out of the thumb
 

201
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,589
and where did I come out of the thumb
the thumb is a weak point that you

202
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:19,599
the thumb is a weak point that you
 

203
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,990
the thumb is a weak point that you
always come out of when grip escapes

204
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
always come out of when grip escapes
 

205
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,029
always come out of when grip escapes
okay so make sure you're not here trying

206
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:24,039
okay so make sure you're not here trying
 

207
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:25,469
okay so make sure you're not here trying
to crank on this that's not the

208
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:25,479
to crank on this that's not the
 

209
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:28,670
to crank on this that's not the
technique but this is the technique okay

210
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:28,680
technique but this is the technique okay
 

211
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,110
technique but this is the technique okay
you can still make him top with it you

212
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
you can still make him top with it you
 

213
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,909
you can still make him top with it you
see he's still doing

214
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:32,919
see he's still doing
 

215
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,309
see he's still doing
it but we're not cuz we're doing

216
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:35,319
it but we're not cuz we're doing
 

217
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,189
it but we're not cuz we're doing
something else here all right so we get

218
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:38,199
something else here all right so we get
 

219
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,550
something else here all right so we get
here and I want to work

220
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560

 

221
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,629

on the

222
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
on the
 

223
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,950
on the
um

224
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
um
 

225
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,390
um
transitions I don't want to see this I

226
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
transitions I don't want to see this I
 

227
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,150
transitions I don't want to see this I
go here he lays down lays himself down

228
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
go here he lays down lays himself down
 

229
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,070
go here he lays down lays himself down
and then you're doing this you see that

230
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,080
and then you're doing this you see that
 

231
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,950
and then you're doing this you see that
to me la la

232
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:01,960
to me la la
 

233
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,110
to me la la
because he is the one who lay

234
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,120

 

235
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,070

down I'm actually picking him up if you

236
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,080
down I'm actually picking him up if you
 

237
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,670
down I'm actually picking him up if you
watch your shoulder you see that now

238
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:14,680
watch your shoulder you see that now
 

239
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,029
watch your shoulder you see that now
that's not the

240
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:18,039

00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
boom as we come around
 

245
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,350
boom as we come around
okay if you I I exaggerate how much

246
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:28,360
okay if you I I exaggerate how much
 

247
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,029
okay if you I I exaggerate how much
control I actually have

248
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:30,039
control I actually have
 

249
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:32,869
control I actually have
so if he tries to stand

250
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:32,879
so if he tries to stand
 

251
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,589
so if he tries to stand
up he's he's not going to you see as we

252
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:36,599
up he's he's not going to you see as we
 

253
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,270
up he's he's not going to you see as we
go into the technique we're here stand

254
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:40,280
go into the technique we're here stand
 

255
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,189
go into the technique we're here stand
up same thing you see stand up same

256
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
up same thing you see stand up same
 

257
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,070
up same thing you see stand up same
thing try to stand up it's not going to

258
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
thing try to stand up it's not going to
 

259
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,550
thing try to stand up it's not going to
stand up do you see try to stand up try

260
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:51,560
stand up do you see try to stand up try
 

261
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,550
stand up do you see try to stand up try
to stand up it's not going to stand up

262
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:55,560
to stand up it's not going to stand up
 

263
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,710
to stand up it's not going to stand up
try to stand up it's not going to stand

264
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:57,720
try to stand up it's not going to stand
 

265
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,909
try to stand up it's not going to stand
up you understand so it looks like it's

266
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:00,919
up you understand so it looks like it's
 

267
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:03,510
up you understand so it looks like it's
loose but it's not loose because of the

268
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
loose but it's not loose because of the
 

269
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,950
loose but it's not loose because of the
same control mechanisms I'm using on the

270
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:05,960
same control mechanisms I'm using on the
 

271
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,149
same control mechanisms I'm using on the
first technique so we go here boom and

272
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:11,159
first technique so we go here boom and
 

273
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:15,350
first technique so we go here boom and
it looks like it's loose you see and

274
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
it looks like it's loose you see and
 

275
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,510
it looks like it's loose you see and
he's laying down do that side

276
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:20,520

 

277
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,149

again as we go you try I'll do it a

278
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:24,159
again as we go you try I'll do it a
 

279
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:25,589
again as we go you try I'll do it a
little more movement and you try to

280
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
little more movement and you try to
 

281
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,629
little more movement and you try to
stand the whole time

282
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639

 

283
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,589

do you understand okay so that theory

284
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:34,599
do you understand okay so that theory
 

285
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,709
do you understand okay so that theory
that's called control maintenance and I

286
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
that's called control maintenance and I
 

287
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,070
that's called control maintenance and I
maintain control my intention here is to

288
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,080
maintain control my intention here is to
 

289
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,630
maintain control my intention here is to
pin him not lift him back up so no

290
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
pin him not lift him back up so no
 

291
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,509
pin him not lift him back up so no
energy should be coming back up all

292
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:44,519
energy should be coming back up all
 

293
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,230
energy should be coming back up all
energy is going down and which way

294
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
energy is going down and which way
 

295
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,750
energy is going down and which way
forward forward down and forward because

296
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:50,760
forward forward down and forward because
 

297
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,670
forward forward down and forward because
of the non-c contestation 90°

298
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:53,680
of the non-c contestation 90°
 

299
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,230
of the non-c contestation 90°
fluctuation that I always have to do so

300
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
fluctuation that I always have to do so
 

301
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,910
fluctuation that I always have to do so
it's not straight down but it is always

302
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:58,920
it's not straight down but it is always
 

303
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,630
it's not straight down but it is always
going down down and also going forward

304
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
going down down and also going forward
 

305
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,509
going down down and also going forward
okay try again okay in this training uh

306
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
okay try again okay in this training uh
 

307
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,509
okay try again okay in this training uh
I'll ask UK to fill any Yin space

308
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:10,519
I'll ask UK to fill any Yin space
 

309
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,150
I'll ask UK to fill any Yin space
because if you're going down and forward

310
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
because if you're going down and forward
 

311
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,310
because if you're going down and forward
there's no Yin space for UK to get up do

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:15,320
there's no Yin space for UK to get up do
 

313
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,949
there's no Yin space for UK to get up do
you guys understand that okay so uh this

314
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
you guys understand that okay so uh this
 

315
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,949
you guys understand that okay so uh this
will help train you for your uh

00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
will help train you for your uh
 

317
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,110
will help train you for your uh

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:11,399
here so I have EO EO wrist and elbow
 

369
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,949
here so I have EO EO wrist and elbow
control but I have it with one arm see

370
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
control but I have it with one arm see
 

371
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,190
control but I have it with one arm see
this is why I do this throw

372
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
this is why I do this throw
 

373
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,949
this is why I do this throw
along okay the same thing here when I

374
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
along okay the same thing here when I
 

375
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,550
along okay the same thing here when I
come around boom

376
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:23,560
come around boom
 

377
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,509
come around boom
around you're going to give up that you

378
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
around you're going to give up that you
 

379
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,629

see so this don't give up the elbow the
 

381
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,069
see so this don't give up the elbow the
hand that's on the elbow is simply going

wrist and elbow control do you guys see

392
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,200
wrist and elbow control do you guys see
 

393
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,509
wrist and elbow control do you guys see
that and when I put it here it's still

394
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
that and when I put it here it's still
 

395
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,030
that and when I put it here it's still
wrist and elbow control it's just right

396
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,040
wrist and elbow control it's just right
 

397
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,990
wrist and elbow control it's just right
there do you guys got it so you lose the

398
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
there do you guys got it so you lose the
 

399
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,629
there do you guys got it so you lose the
elbow when you lose the eeko go back

400
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:00,639
elbow when you lose the eeko go back
 

401
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,269
elbow when you lose the eeko go back
with few seconds you come here and you

402
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
with few seconds you come here and you
 

403
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,110
with few seconds you come here and you
go like that it came off you'll never

404
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
go like that it came off you'll never
 

405
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,910
go like that it came off you'll never
get back on in real life okay so you

406
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
get back on in real life okay so you
 

407
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,710
get back on in real life okay so you
keep the elbow Bo I stay on that elbow

408
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
keep the elbow Bo I stay on that elbow
 

409
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,550
keep the elbow Bo I stay on that elbow
and there's never time when you can lift

410
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
and there's never time when you can lift
 

411
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,030
and there's never time when you can lift
the shoulder because there's always a

412
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,040
the shoulder because there's always a
 

413
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:26,069
the shoulder because there's always a
downward pressure on the elbow okay try

414
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079

 

415
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,870

it but like EO it's balanced with the

close but it gets close by going forward
 

449
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,710
close but it gets close by going forward
into the circle not backwards into the

relax I'm going backwards do you see as
 

503
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,710
relax I'm going backwards do you see as
I pass it around and where is the

504
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
I pass it around and where is the
 

505
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,110
I pass it around and where is the
elbow it's on the back side it's on the

506
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
elbow it's on the back side it's on the
 

507
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,030
elbow it's on the back side it's on the
back side of my spine and for katama it

508
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,040
back side of my spine and for katama it
 

509
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,590
back side of my spine and for katama it
has to be on the front side of my spine

510
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:20,600
has to be on the front side of my spine
 

511
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,389
has to be on the front side of my spine
this has to be over here and there's

512
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:23,399
this has to be over here and there's
 

513
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,269
this has to be over here and there's
absolutely no way I can go backwards and

514
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:26,279
absolutely no way I can go backwards and
 

515
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,030
absolutely no way I can go backwards and
put it over there I have to go forward

516
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,040
put it over there I have to go forward
 

517
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,350
put it over there I have to go forward
again that stuff do doesn't work so

518
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,360
again that stuff do doesn't work so
 

519
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,110
again that stuff do doesn't work so
we'll rewind the film a

520
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,120
we'll rewind the film a
 

521
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,110
we'll rewind the film a
little and if I go forward you can see

522
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
little and if I go forward you can see
 

523
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,990
little and if I go forward you can see
that it's in the right

524
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,000
that it's in the right
 

525
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,430
that it's in the right
place

526
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
place
 

527
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,550
place
okay so all I'm doing is continuing to

528
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
okay so all I'm doing is continuing to
 

529
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,230
okay so all I'm doing is continuing to
forward forward into here not backwards

530
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:51,240
forward forward into here not backwards
 

531
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,550
forward forward into here not backwards
into here okay try

532
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:54,560
into here okay try
 

533
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,710
into here okay try
it all right so we had a question on

534
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:57,720
it all right so we had a question on
 

535
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,949
it all right so we had a question on
where does the initial Tachi fit within

536
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
where does the initial Tachi fit within
 

537
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,829
where does the initial Tachi fit within
the yinyang uh torso grid that we use

538
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:03,839
the yinyang uh torso grid that we use
 

539
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,189
the yinyang uh torso grid that we use
okay so my arm starts at yangong at the

540
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
okay so my arm starts at yangong at the
 

541
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,110
okay so my arm starts at yangong at the
shoulder okay uh you can move off the

542
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,120
shoulder okay uh you can move off the
 

543
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,230
shoulder okay uh you can move off the
line if you want to doesn't matter

544
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
line if you want to doesn't matter
 

545
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,269
line if you want to doesn't matter
usually I just do it very subtly inside

546
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
usually I just do it very subtly inside
 

547
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,910
usually I just do it very subtly inside
okay and so the rules are I started

548
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:18,920
okay and so the rules are I started
 

549
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,749
okay and so the rules are I started
there I know this hand wants to touch it

550
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
there I know this hand wants to touch it
 

551
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,910
there I know this hand wants to touch it
which means where what does this hand

552
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
which means where what does this hand
 

553
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,269
which means where what does this hand
have to do it has to bring it to the

554
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:26,279
have to do it has to bring it to the
 

555
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,189
have to do it has to bring it to the
center line so it brings it to the

556
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:28,199
center line so it brings it to the
 

557
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,949
center line so it brings it to the
center line and now I can do it okay

558
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
center line and now I can do it okay
 

559
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,829
center line and now I can do it okay

thats it's outside the Y Line so it's

566
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
thats it's outside the Y Line so it's
 

567
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,670
thats it's outside the Y Line so it's
outside the outer rim that is incorrect

568
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:42,680
outside the outer rim that is incorrect
 

569
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,150
outside the outer rim that is incorrect
uh what's wrong with

570

thing again I take small angles this is

594
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
thing again I take small angles this is
 

595
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,470
thing again I take small angles this is
sh 10 Con on that one same thing right I

596
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:21,480
sh 10 Con on that one same thing right I
 

597
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,669
sh 10 Con on that one same thing right I
could go out here but I'm touching it

but I'm not using
it till it gets to the center line then

602
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:28,160
it till it gets to the center line then
 

603
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,669
it till it gets to the center line then
I can start using

604
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:30,679
I can start using
 

605
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,590
I can start using
the ten con gave me the angle deviation

606
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
the ten con gave me the angle deviation
 

607
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,430
the ten con gave me the angle deviation
you can't go out but it's always going

608
