1
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:52,999
What kind of person was Kobayashi Hirokazu Sensei?

2
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:56,999
As a human being, he was very intimidating.

3
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:00,542
He was like one of those Budoka from the past.

4
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:03,999
He was a very strict person.

5
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:06,999
How can I say this...

6
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:09,999
Whenever he entered a room, the mood would change completely.

7
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:12,999
I can't claim to have that effect.

8
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:18,875
A lot of the old Sensei had that sort of aura.

9
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:22,999
Their bodies emitted that sort of energy, that dignity.

10
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:29,999
For me, that's what true Budoka felt like.

11
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:34,999
Their bodies looked like they radiated energy and power.

12
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:43,999
On a technical standpoint, event though what he did was not showy like what you see in Hong Kong movies,

13
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:47,709
when he threw you, you could well end up 2 meters away.

14
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:57,999
His technique had strong absorption followed by throws.

15
00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:02,999
His techniques were like strong waves crashing on a harbor.

16
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:07,667
He meant that he put most of his power when absorbing.

17
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:11,999
So it went like "BAM!" and you were thrown 2 meters backwards.

18
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:19,999
One day, Yabuuchi told me: "His technique must be terribly efficient".

19
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:23,999
He used to do Karate so he went and threw a punch at Kobayashi Sensei.

20
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:28,999
We had no idea what happened, but he got thrown straight up in the air and then crashed right there.

21
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:31,999
We thought: "Wow, he's really strong".

22
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:35,999
He knew a lot and had a lot of experience.

23
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:41,999
He spent about 9 years in Tokyo. Was he an uchi deshi at any point?

24
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:50,999
I don't know whether he was an uchi deshi or not.

25
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:59,333
Kobayashi Sensei was a lacquer craftsman.

26
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,999
This is a side note but,

27
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:10,250
I once spoke in private to Tada Sensei at the Nippon Budokan for 20 minutes or so and he said:

28
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,999
"Kobayashi-kun used urushi, right?"

29
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:16,999
"When we trained together, he must have had rashes!"

30
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:18,999
Sensei was OK so he said:

31
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,999
"I was alright!"

32
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:25,417
He practiced [in Tokyo] while also working at same time.

33
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:33,999
It seems that he often went with the founder, almost every day,

34
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:39,999
but I don't know what exact status he had as an apprentice.

35
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:46,250
I believe Kobayashi Sensei met AndrÃ© Nocquet while he was an uchi deshi at Hombu. They maintained contact until the end. Were they close friends?

36
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,999
Yeah, I guess they were close at Hombu.

37
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:55,999
I think that they separated a bit when he returned to France.

38
00:03:55,999 --> 00:04:00,458
Initially, I think they trained quite a lot together.

39
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:08,999
I visited several times Nocquet Sensei's group in Europe after Kobayashi passed away,

40
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:16,999
but I heard that there are several organizations in France.

41
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:25,250
Therefore, Yokota Sensei of the Tokyo headquarters is now doing the Nocquet group in the UK.

42
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,709
Because the Nocquet group is a fairly large organization.

43
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:37,999
That's why I thought that Kobayashi was getting along with Nocquet in the beginning, but I don't know about it in details.

44
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:45,999
Did Kobayashi Sensei talk about how he perceived O Sensei?

45
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:51,999
O Sensei seems to have had something about him that greatly attracted people.

46
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:58,834
It seems je was the sort of person that you would follow for the rest of your life.

47
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:06,999
Many people were dedicating their lives to following him and calling him O Sensei.

48
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,999
I think that Kobayashi was one of those.

49
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:13,999
It seems that there was something that strongly attracted people.

50
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:21,999
And in turn, Kobayashi was really attracted to the founder, from the heart.

51
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:28,792
Did Kobayashi Sensei practice in Iwama?

52
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:33,999
This is often said, but I don't think there was any exchange at all.

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Every year Kobayashi went to Iwama for the Aiki Taisai

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,999
and even after  passed away, we continue to attend the event.

55
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:48,999
However, I don't know whether there was any cooperation.

56
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:52,999
Saito Sensei had his own unique form of weapons.

57
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:57,999
Kobayashi's weapons form was a bit different.

58
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:03,999
I am not quite sure what form it was,

59
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:06,999
but it was a bit different.

60
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:12,999
Kobayashi was certainly also high-ranking in kendo,

61
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:16,999
so his sword movements were extremely sharp and fast.

62
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,999
Once, when I practiced with Saito Sensei,

63
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:23,999
I was really surprised by the pressure he applied.

64
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,999
I was subdued, but without any clashing of the blades.

65
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:30,999
There was a truly amazing pressure,

66
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,999
but it was different from what I felt with Kobayashi.

67
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:37,999
I don't understand it that well myself.

68
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:44,999
Was the Ken very important to Kobayashi Sensei?

69
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:49,999
In Europe, he made his students practice a lot the Ken and the Jo,

70
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:57,999
so I think that compared to his Japanese disciples, they practiced it more.

71
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:05,999
His kiri kaeshi had amazing speed.

72
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:13,999
He did a lot of left and right cutting practice by himself in front of the mirror.

73
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,999
That made him really fast.

74
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:24,999
I suspect he was trying to take the centerline with his sword.

75
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:33,999
But I was too young to understand it at that time because he was so much more advanced than me.

76
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:38,792
I don't know where his attention on the center was when he was doing this,

77
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,999
but it is certain that he was doing it.

78
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,999
He was emphasizing this.

79
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:49,999
We know that Kobayashi Sensei was acquainted to Hisa Takuma. How did they meet?

80
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:54,999
He didn't talk about it often.

81
00:07:54,999 --> 00:08:00,999
The story goes that Hisa Sensei was quite elderly and that Kobayashi was still young

82
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:03,999
Hisa liked him.

83
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:10,999
There was a big university in Osaka called Momoyama Gakuin Daigaku.

84
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:14,999
Hisa Sensei had established an Aikido club there. [Note: The club was actually started by Kobayashi Kiyohiro, a student of Hisa]

85
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:19,291
The first captain was Kobayashi [Kiyohiro] Sensei.

86
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:23,999
It was the Kobayashi Sensei who is now the General Secretary of the Daito-ryu Takumakai.

87
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:34,999
At that time, Hisa Sensei said: "Kobayashi [Hirokazu]-kun, since I'm old, please take care of Momoyama."

88
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:41,999
That's why Kobayashi [Kiyohiro] Sensei and Kawabe Sensei, from the Takumakai

89
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:50,667
also learned Aikido at Momoyama Univesrity from Kobayashi [Hirokazu], in addition to learning Daito-ryu [with Hisa].

90
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:56,999
Did Kobayashi Sensei learn Daito-ryu form Hisa Sensei?

91
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:01,458
Rather than learning from him,

92
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:12,999
he must have seen some techniques and used them as reference.

93
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:18,999
For example, on Nikyo, he took like this, not like that.

94
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:29,583
I think that these are hints that he got things from him, like how to connect your opponent.

95
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:38,999
I myself also shared a lot with Kawabe Sensei from Daito-ryu when we did demonstrations together.

96
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:43,999
The wonderful hand movements are a great inspiration.

97
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:52,999
That's why though I do not know about a formal connection, I got some hints about it.

98
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:59,999
Was Kobayashi Sensei ever involved with the Kansai Aikido Club?

99
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:00,999
The Daito-ryu club?

100
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:01,999
G. E.: Yes, the Daito-ryu club.

101
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:04,999
Kobayashi often used to go to the demonstrations,

102
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:11,041
as a representative of the Buikukai organization,

103
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:18,999
so I think there was a connection.

104
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:24,999
Some people say that Kobayashi Sensei was a Daito-ryu Shihan, is this true then?

105
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:32,959
My impression is...

106
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,999
though I haven't heard anything formally,

107
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:46,458
there seemed to be some form remaining in the teachnique that I saw.

108
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:50,999
I think that Kobayashi's form was his own though.

109
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:55,999
Although I think that it was picked up rather than learned formally,

110
00:10:55,999 --> 00:11:05,834
I don't know whether Hisa Sensei taught him separately.

111
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:14,999
I made this assumption myself, judging on what I saw, but I don't know if it's true.

112
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:20,999
There is no evidence to support that claim, right?

113
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,999
No, there is none.

114
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:35,999
Regarding the fact that he might have been invited by Hisa Sensei as a guest teacher,

115
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:41,999
I never heard anything about this from Hisa Sensei's old students.

116
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:45,999
So I don't think it's true.

117
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:51,999
What is your relationship with the Takumakai these days?

118
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:58,999
The Takumakai is a big Daito-ryu group.

119
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:09,959
I think that Mori Sensei is building a strong organization and I think it has now been recognized as a non-profit foundation.

120
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:15,999
There are a lot of students in the Kansai area.

121
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:25,999
Kobayashi [Kiyohiro] Sensei and Kawabe Sensei learned from my master Kobayashi,

122
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:33,999
so I could see many things at various Daito-ryu demonstrations.

123
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:45,999
I was able to see meaningful things immediately and add them as a plus in my Aikido.

124
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,417
I'm happy about that.

125
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:57,999
Altough I have little experience with Kobayashi [Kiyohiro] Sensei,

126
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,999
there are similarities between his and Kawabe Sensei's techniques,

127
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:05,999
and Kawabe Sensei's technique is the one I know better.

128
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:17,834
Outside Aikido, the technique of those teachers if what I like best.

129
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,999
They are wonderful people.

130
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:26,999
What are the specificities of Kobayashi Sensei's Aikido?

131
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:33,999
Since you have spent two days doing Aikido with us, I think that you already understand this quite a bit,

132
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:39,333
that in aikido, there are vertical and horizontal kuzushi.

133
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:51,999
In vertical kuzushi, you should strike the opponent inside yourself or and enter from yourself.

134
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,999
How do you drop your opponent's power down or drop the center?

135
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:05,999
Kobayashi's technique resided in a kot of horizontal kuzushi.

136
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:10,999
I think that power was very strong, so how to make use of it?

137
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:16,667
The other thing is the tsugi ashi.

138
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:19,999
This is the fact of the back legs chasing the body after moving.

139
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:21,999
J. D.: The movement of Kendo...

140
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:26,959
Yes, that's right, the forward walk.

141
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:34,999
He did that, and I do it too, but the hakama was hiding it.

142
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He used to have a wide stance when he was young, but later, it became quite narrow.

143
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,999
Should you enter and chase with the back leg, or retract the front leg?

144
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Kobayashi was very strong on the techniques of absorption.

145
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:57,000
As for the hands, from the second [nikyo] you turn on the right like kote [gaeshi],

146
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,999
the the kote turns back to nikyo,

147
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,583
the sankyo turns like this back to kote,

148
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,999
Those are the principles.

149
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:09,999
then yonkyo is taken like this and returned to kote like this.

150
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Those changes in positions are very characteristic.

151
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:25,920
Just via this training, you can probably get quite soft and strong.

152
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:28,542
It is difficult if done with just the soft one,

153
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:34,999
and people with strong arms are more difficult to move.

154
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,740
This is an exercise to build up strength.

155
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,000
As I mentioned earlier, there are grabs like this in Daito-ryu.

156
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,460
I wonder if such things were included though.

157
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,999
I too also use a lot of solicitations like this, that will attract you and turn on this side,

158
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:57,999
there are a lot of feeling like these in the techniques.

159
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:04,417
It is not a technique to cut as such, but you must twist it with your body.

160
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:08,000
In my case, I twist like this from my knee,

161
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,999
but Kobayashi was really soft and it felt like this.

162
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,480
I think this was a characteristic feature.

163
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:24,080
It should not be done as a simple gestures, but the essence of it is oi ashi and tsugi ashi.

164
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,820
J.D. What about the kaeshi waza?

165
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,720
He liked the kaeshi waza.

166
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,999
As you know, the kaeshi waza are really difficult if someone really grabs.

167
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:38,999
It hard to counter a technique that is applied efficiently.

168
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:47,875
It seems that he liked such things as stopping the opponent's power, returning it softly.

169
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,291
He was extremely good at kaeshi waza.

170
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:55,875
Some students of Kobayashi Sensei teach suwari waza in seiza position. Do you do it? Where does it come from?

171
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,080
Do I keep my toes up or down?

172
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,160
Personally, I keep my toes up.

173
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,690
It comes naturally to me.

174
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,670
Kobayashi often kept his down.

175
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:12,400
Maybe he did it because he felt stronger like that.

176
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,320
If done improperly, it tends to pull.

177
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,420
But that's not what it's about.

178
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,510
Doing that will rotate your elbow from the shoulder.

179
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,620
He must have been doing it from his center.

180
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,300
Not like this

181
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,440
but like this from the center. Not your hands.

182
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,140
That way he could pin before the feet and the whole toe issue became irrelevant.

183
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,850
That's a good question.

184
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:52,520
As you know, with Aikido

185
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,550
We go [on torifune] from right to left, no, left to right.

186
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,110
Kobayashi was doing it there as well.

187
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,600
He spoke about loosening up the body

188
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,660
and generally doing things in the set order.

189
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,000
I've never really asked about it myself.

190
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,620
The traditional way of doing it is

191
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,150
a lot of tapping, knocking

192
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:26,100
and bending over and stretching completely.

193
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,100
Honestly, I'm not sure if it has any real meaning.

194
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:36,150
Done completely, the entire process takes about 30 minutes.

195
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,880
It takes a pretty long time.

196
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,230
We don't dedicate as much time here currently

197
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:49,130
but I'd love to see how it's thought of and done in Europe.

198
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:55,500
Yes, in europe, those taiso can take up to 30 minutes.

199
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,780
That makes sense.

200
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:04,010
Training is done in one-hour sessions nowadays in Japan.

201
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,960
And I think it's best to do these warmups

202
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,790
even if its just for health reasons for ten to thirty minutes.

203
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,740
Assuming that we're training

204
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,510
at an Aikido classroom - excuse me - dojo

205
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,240
I believe these warmups are like misogi.

206
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,960
Every practitioner should do it regularly and often.

207
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,990
And it should be maintained.

208
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,820
I agree with that statement.

209
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,560
Before you even began training

210
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,460
you would need to walk into the dojo, bow, and clean.

211
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,270
After finishing all that,

212
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,600
that's when you'd consider warming up or doing our modern stretches.

213
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,380
Then, when the teacher would arrive, you'd greet them sitting properly.

214
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,180
These are our martial arts traditions. The proper way of doing things.

215
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,280
Now we don't have enough time for anything.
Things just aren't like they used to be.

216
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,990
I'm really happy that you're interested in my techniques.

217
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,560
But my basic techniques are... how do I put it?

218
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,440
Well, put simply, they're crude.

219
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,380
Crude meaning that they are not very graceful.

220
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,960
These are forms, techniques that I've worked on all throughout my training

221
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,770
There is no way to improve your kata other than repitition.

222
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,120
Taking any breaks will affect your technique.

223
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,870
Your kata won't be good anymore after a year-long break, for example.

224
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,960
The real difficulty is in the practice.

225
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,710
I really think it's curious that people are interested in my techniques.
