1
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,867
Here, give an atemi.

2
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:50,067
Here, too, so we have 2 atemi on 2 levels.

3
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,095
At this point,

4
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:14,267
while you do this,

5
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:19,167
like this,

6
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:26,500
place his arm here; the technique is Hiji-Kujiki

7
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:45,100
In this case we do Han-tsuki [half tsuki used for training].

8
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:59,500
In reality, it is like this. Why is that? Because it hurts!

9
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:26,866
Then I went to Hokkaido,

10
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:31,666
but all these scrolls were written here in Shikoku.

11
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:38,366
They did not have them anywhere else, not even at Soke's [Takeda Tokimune] dojo.

12
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:44,833
Who had these scrolls originally?

13
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:51,466
[Takuma] Hisa Sensei had them,

14
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:56,133
Makita [Kan'ichi] had them too.

15
00:03:56,133 --> 00:04:01,833
He showed them to Hisa Sensei who said:

16
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:08,200
"There are no mistakes so you can use them for the Takumakai"

17
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:20,066
Regarding the originals, there isn't much to say except that they are hard to understand.

18
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:27,999
The origin of the Aizu clan is written here.

19
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,066
This is the historic origin of the scrolls from Emperor Seiwa.

20
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:32,400
This is Shinra Saburo.

21
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,433
This is where it starts.

22
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:50,100
In Daito-ryu, we often relate the beginings to Shinra Saburo but things actually start earlier.

23
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,100
The history?

24
00:04:52,100 --> 00:05:03,367
Yes, we start from Shinra Saburo, however, we can see here that it actually starts before him.

25
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:14,933
Nobody speaks about that usually.

26
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:18,133
Where is Takeda Sokaku?

27
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,000
There, "Takeda Sokaku",

28
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,833
and "Uemon",

29
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,900
this is Takeda Sokaku's father.

30
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,133
Here it is written "Sokaku",

31
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,833
"Daito-ryu".

32
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,400
Is this Takeda Sokaku here?

33
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,766
No, this is Takeda Kuninyoshi,

34
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:49,833
and so on...

35
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,933
When does it actually start then?

36
00:05:54,933 --> 00:06:00,233
It is difficult to know precisely.

37
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:07,466
We should start looking around the Emperor Seiwa and go back through the generations

38
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:10,533
These are the 36 kajo.

39
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,366
Here I don't understand [old writing].

40
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:17,399
Here are some of the techniques.

41
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,366
But I can't even read these old characters.

42
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:30,233
This is the Aizu language.

43
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:34,266
You don't understand it?

44
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:43,499
It is like a local style of speech, like the one in Kansai, Kanto, Tohoku, etc.

45
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:46,566
What if we went to Aizu?

46
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:50,866
Yes, Aizu in the Fukushima prefecture.

47
00:06:50,866 --> 00:07:07,366
There is a group there, but there is also the sanctuary of Shinra Saburo!

48
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:22,666
Before, we never showed these scrolls to anybody.

49
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:33,333
We unrolled them during practice and put them away straight after.

50
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:41,033
Nowadays in Wakimachi, the scrolls are carved in wood, So anyone who enters the dojo can see them.

51
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:52,533
I gave three atemi, did you see?

52
00:07:56,733 --> 00:08:02,100
From there, you can enter like this.

53
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,366
And that [hand] is well secured.

54
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:08,800
Therefore you can go there.

55
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,866
Don't collapse like that!

56
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:18,900
And then, same [as before].

57
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,733
Lock it using your small finger.

58
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:40,466
If you lock with your small finger, the base of the thumb becomes weak, so it is easier.

59
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:04,033
On this kind of grab,

60
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,266
strike with atemi from the bottom to the top, up to the chin.

61
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:15,533
And a 2nd one on the side,

62
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,566
No! Not on the keikogi!

63
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:24,500
On the right elbow! On the joint.

64
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:31,000
With the leg too, all at the same time.

65
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:45,433
Then you grab here and you turn your shoulders

66
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:52,100
Then, with your fist [not grabbing], lift my elbow up

67
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,366
Now grab!

68
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:08,566
How long ago [did you go to Hokkaido] Sensei?

69
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,666
I forgot!

70
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,666
How old were you?

71
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,400
About 20 years old.

72
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,666
So it was about 60 years ago.

73
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:30,899
It is Makita Sensei who took me there.

74
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:44,667
There was me, Makita, and 2 or 3 other students.

75
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:52,833
We were 4 or 5 altogether.

76
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,366
Did Chiba Sensei ever meet Takeda Sokaku Sensei?

77
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:02,600
No, the generations were different.

78
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:12,733
The one who taught me was Takeda Tokimune Sensei.

79
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:20,533
At the time he was the director of the Yamada Suisan company.

80
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:29,400
He taught in the city of Abashiri [in Hokkaido].

81
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:37,133
Takeda Sensei's way of teaching was: "Do shikko" [movements on the knees]

82
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:42,733
There were about 30 or 50 tatami in the Daito-kan  [Tokimune's dojo].

83
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:46,400
So I did shikko.

84
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:51,199
He was watching carefully.

85
00:11:53,866 --> 00:12:01,600
You had better not get it wrong otherwise...

86
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:06,900
But in fact, he was nice.

87
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:14,533
Before, he had been a policeman

88
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:21,599
and one day he broke the hand of a thief.

89
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:28,999
He felt responsible and left the police.

90
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:39,667
He then went to the Yamada Suisan where he had family.

91
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:46,267
There was no Takumakai at the time right?

92
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:49,567
No, not yet.

93
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:55,333
It was the time of the Kansai Aikido Club.

94
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:58,200
In Shikoku too, was it the same?

95
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,167
In Shikoku, I was the teacher.

96
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:07,200
It was called Daito-ryu Aiki-budo wasn't it?

97
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,900
Yes, that's right, Daito-ryu Aiki-budo.

98
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:22,800
Takeda Tokimune was also doing Aiki-budo.

99
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,767
There was no Takumakai.

100
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:30,867
Over there, at the Daito-kan,

101
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:37,434
we had to sign an admission form to be allowed to learn.

102
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:42,133
It was the first time that we learned techniques up to 5th kajo.

103
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:47,800
Before that, we only got to 2nd kajo.

104
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:58,634
What kind of keiko were we doing at Tokimune's dojo?

105
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:03,301
We used to do shikko

106
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:08,601
and work on katatedori, ryotedori

107
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:13,101
and also some katame waza.

108
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:19,567
This is what we used to do, what we call warm-up these days.

109
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:25,568
Over there, they used to grab like that, it was very different from the way we used to do it.

110
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:31,535
Exercises on joints by controlling the wrists.

111
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:42,168
We used to grab directly, flat like that.

112
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:54,335
But over there, they first took hold from the small finger.

113
00:14:54,335 --> 00:15:04,668
So the hand that was being grabbed could not open up.

114
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:10,268
It could not use any strength.

115
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:15,968
We used to work like that, on controlling the wrists, we got control of the elbow.

116
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:21,301
From which finger do you start to grab?

117
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:28,235
From the small finger or from the thumb,

118
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:32,235
which one is the quickest?

119
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,535
From the small finger?

120
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:40,501
Yes, from the small finger, because it is the dumbest [less functional], and therefore the quickest.

121
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:46,001
Then there is the thumb, the thickest and most powerful.

122
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:50,301
It is with these two that you can have the best grab.

123
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:58,335
The other fingers don't matter.

124
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:07,101
This is important because if you do this...

125
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:11,301
look, with the thumb and the small finger together,

126
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:24,501
the thumb and the small finger close the grab.

127
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,001
Got it?

128
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:31,735
That is in Kote-jime, as well as other tecniques...

129
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:35,268
You can grab like this too

130
00:16:35,268 --> 00:16:48,701
That is the way to do for women.

131
00:17:21,535 --> 00:17:31,868
You must understand well the way to lock the hand.

132
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:50,268
This is already Gyaku-kote,

133
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:57,235
the Gyaku-kote of 2nd kajo, but it is exactly like the Kote-zume that we saw earlier on.

134
00:17:57,235 --> 00:18:06,701
They are related techniques, Gyaku-kote here, and Kote-zume here.

135
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:11,134
We just finished the Saturday class.

136
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:13,934
We did 3 hours of Daito-ryu so we are quite tired.

137
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:16,868
We are going to have dinner now.

138
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:20,034
Before that we went to the public bath in the mountain near Wakimachi

139
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:23,701
After dinner we will go back to the dojo and take some photographs from Chiba Sensei's archives.

140
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:28,134
And tomorrow morning we are going to be back on the tatami

141
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:33,101
See you later and "bon appetit"!

142
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:40,668
Good job everybody!

143
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:55,568
I'll show you something that we never eat at home.

144
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,701
It is fresh bamboo, it is delicious.

145
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:03,934
It tastes a bit like heart of palm.

146
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:21,934
How come this Nihonshu has bubbles?

147
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:28,001
This is like Japanese Champagne.

148
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:44,568
Big bubbles!

149
00:19:44,568 --> 00:19:50,034
It is not too sweet, it is perfectly balanced.

150
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,401
Very good isn't it?

151
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,601
That is what they made me do

152
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:07,601
as well as some grabs such as ryotedori.

153
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:10,201
They told me: "Come over here!"

154
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:12,968
I asked why and the answered:

155
00:20:12,968 --> 00:20:16,101
"Because you don't do Ken [sword]".

156
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:17,901
Not like Kendo,

157
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:22,401
so that is when I started to work with a big log of wood,

158
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:29,768
as thick as a leg!

159
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:34,134
Big like this.

160
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:52,134
We also used metal bars or wood logs,

161
00:20:52,134 --> 00:21:00,368
training in rhythm.

162
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:06,835
We used to strike like this to build up our muscle frame.

163
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:12,634
This is also what Tokimune Sensei used to do in the morning right?

164
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:15,801
Yes, all of it.

165
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:24,468
Chiba Sensei learned from watching Tokimune Sensei's morning classes.

166
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:29,802
This work is important isn't it?

167
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:39,502
Yes, especially this way of twisting.

168
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:44,902
It is not just about swinging like that.

169
00:21:46,534 --> 00:21:52,002
You have to pinch like this and because the handle is so big, there is some remaining space that you cannot hold.

170
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:56,268
Like if you were waving a big pole.

171
00:21:56,602 --> 00:22:11,034
So you have to synchronize the pinching of each hand to have them together.

172
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:21,034
You have to raise straight up.

173
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:26,335
Everybody ended up as massive as Suzuki Sensei.

174
00:22:26,335 --> 00:22:30,768
Suzuki Sensei never lost, not even against Sumo or Judoka.

175
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:35,268
When he grabbed you, you couldn't move.

176
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:42,168
He would grab and the other guy went flying.

177
00:22:49,868 --> 00:23:24,934
Soke Takeda started at 5 a.m. because he had to go to work at 6 a.m.

178
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:41,534
at the company Yamada Suisan.

179
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:46,067
Did you continue at the dojo after 6 a.m.?

180
00:23:46,434 --> 00:24:03,901
He would stop a bit before 6 a.m. and we would go back to the nearby hotel.

181
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:18,768
We quickly took our breakfast over there

182
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:38,634
And then, Suzuki Sensei would teach us while doing some calligraphy on his own.

183
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:43,134
It lasted until lunchtime.

184
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,000
So about 6 h of training

185
00:24:47,768 --> 00:24:50,901
until 12 a.m.

186
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:56,434
That is why we could learn all that, it never stopped!

187
00:24:56,434 --> 00:24:57,901
All the classes, without a break.

188
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:05,334
The Sensei did not want to give us a break.

189
00:25:05,334 --> 00:25:15,634
That is why the techniques got into our heads.

190
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:23,934
We couldn't even drink tea

191
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:35,868
even though we really felt like having some.

192
00:25:39,667 --> 00:26:00,934
we had all our meals at the hotel, in the morning, lunch, and dinner.

193
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:07,834
In the evenings, Suzuki Sensei was teaching.

194
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:15,800
With Soke we only learnt until 2nd kajo

195
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,300
and when we finally managed to do 1st and 2nd kajo,

196
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:27,967
we asked Suzuki Sensei, showing him the board:

197
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:39,068
"We would like to also learn 3rd and 4th kajo, would it be possible?"

198
00:26:41,134 --> 00:26:52,734
But he said that it was not possible because we weren't deshi.

199
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:57,667
However, he spoke to Tokimune and one day,

200
00:26:57,667 --> 00:27:08,234
our names got written on the board as "Shikoku students"

201
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:21,300
Then he asked some deshi to start training with us too.

202
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,267
We started to train with the others on that night.

203
00:27:25,534 --> 00:27:26,668
What is the purpose of atemi?

204
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:31,934
When he comes to grab, what is he going to do?

205
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:36,167
You can do this of course.

206
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:39,734
But there is also Yokomen

207
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:42,867
So if we do that, what is happening?

208
00:27:43,434 --> 00:27:46,067
You can chose this hand, or that one.

209
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:50,001
You have to sort it out in your heads!

210
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,967
You must think of that one [the one delivering the atemi].

211
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:58,501
It leads us to the typical entry of Kurumadaoshi

212
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:02,734
This is a fundamental point of the [118 techniques] list.

213
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:08,267
It is that sort of reasoning that informed the making of that list.

214
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:15,667
This hand at the collar allows a hand strike but also a kick.

215
00:28:16,134 --> 00:28:26,967
So on this side you do like this, and on that side, you do this.

216
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:30,667
On the joint!

217
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:36,234
By pushing on the joint, it straightens the arm.

218
00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:40,201
Give it a good strike!

219
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:48,967
That makes 2 atemi, plus another one below in the legs.

220
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:56,234
This is how you teach these important points.

221
00:28:56,234 --> 00:29:02,901
Now, how do you give this kick?

222
00:29:04,634 --> 00:29:15,167
You kick with what is in front, the forward leg

223
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:20,334
And after that,

224
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:36,101
you see, while he kicks, he straightens his arm, so I am stronger than him now and he can no longer do it.

225
00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:45,134
But if you go forward, the effect is greater.

226
00:29:45,134 --> 00:29:49,834
This is 2nd kajo right?

227
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:55,534
Get a good hold, surround the wrist with your small finger,

228
00:29:55,534 --> 00:30:00,001
and raise the elbow.

229
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:06,468
Lock it well, close the space.

230
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:30,934
We are done for the day,

231
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:34,934
we are dead tired so I wish you a good night.
