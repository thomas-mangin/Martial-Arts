doing the first as young hands on both
 

169
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:56,400
doing the first as young hands on both
you see and there is

170
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:56,410

 

171
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,319

the other thing you might do if you're

172
00:08:59,319 --> 00:08:59,329
the other thing you might do if you're
 

173
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:03,400
the other thing you might do if you're
not doing this stuff is you shortchange

174
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,410
not doing this stuff is you shortchange
 

175
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,639
not doing this stuff is you shortchange
it you see and then you just find the

176
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:09,649
it you see and then you just find the
 

177
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:24,970
it you see and then you just find the
space in between so always when we learn

178
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:24,980
space in between so always when we learn
 

179
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,009

the ritual we focus in on this part okay

180
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:29,019
the ritual we focus in on this part okay
 

181
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:34,090
the ritual we focus in on this part okay
so that's already wrong see where I go

182
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,100
so that's already wrong see where I go
 

183
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,579
so that's already wrong see where I go
ahead and grab so I can't get on the

184
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:39,589
ahead and grab so I can't get on the
 

185
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:40,389
ahead and grab so I can't get on the
outside

186
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399

do you see where my knife edge is okay

188
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:43,100
do you see where my knife edge is okay
 

189
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,970
do you see where my knife edge is okay
and so now I'm gonna have to cut that on

202
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:20,910
inside his script so my elbows stay
 

203
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,690
inside his script so my elbows stay
inside my outer rim not like that so he

204
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:26,700
inside my outer rim not like that so he
 

205
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,900

00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,960
force okay so I am on this side of the
force and I'm going to get to the other

328
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:57,970
force and I'm going to get to the other
 

329
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,600
force and I'm going to get to the other
side of the force so that I now

330
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,610
side of the force so that I now
 

331
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,360
side of the force so that I now
harmonized that energy Hey

332
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:03,370
harmonized that energy Hey
 

333
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,290
harmonized that energy Hey
so the first move is the first movement

334
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:07,300
so the first move is the first movement
 

335
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,550
so the first move is the first movement
of this okay first move whoa

336
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:11,560
of this okay first move whoa
 

337
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,930
of this okay first move whoa
and now look as you see how I'm

338
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:12,940
and now look as you see how I'm
 

339
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,520
and now look as you see how I'm
traveling on the other side of the force

340
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:14,530
traveling on the other side of the force
 

341
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,950
traveling on the other side of the force
do you see that and then I can now make

342
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:16,960
do you see that and then I can now make
 

343
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,320
do you see that and then I can now make
her longer force so it is a

344
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,330
her longer force so it is a
 

345
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,770
her longer force so it is a
reconciliation alright and he does yin

346
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:22,780
reconciliation alright and he does yin
 

347
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,020
reconciliation alright and he does yin
in the sense that she's allowed to keep

348
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,030
in the sense that she's allowed to keep
 

349
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,690
in the sense that she's allowed to keep
her young but it becomes young because

350
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:27,700
her young but it becomes young because
 

351
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,810
her young but it becomes young because
I've been accelerated and my last point

352
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:30,820
I've been accelerated and my last point
 

353
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,710
I've been accelerated and my last point
is that as I do this the reason I can

354
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
is that as I do this the reason I can
 

355
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,610
is that as I do this the reason I can
accelerate her is manifested in my

356
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:38,620
accelerate her is manifested in my
 

357
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,120
accelerate her is manifested in my
ability to stop her so if I just get out

358
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,130
ability to stop her so if I just get out
 

359
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,030
ability to stop her so if I just get out
of the way then it's only whatever

360
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
of the way then it's only whatever
 

361
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,350
of the way then it's only whatever
velocity she had so as she as she goes

362
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
velocity she had so as she as she goes
 

363
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,440
velocity she had so as she as she goes
and she tries to stop me she can't stop

364
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:52,450
and she tries to stop me she can't stop
 

365
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,820
and she tries to stop me she can't stop
me because I'm moving her understand but

366
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:56,830
me because I'm moving her understand but
 

367
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,850
me because I'm moving her understand but
I'm not moving her in this outer deltoid

368
00:16:59,850 --> 00:16:59,860
I'm not moving her in this outer deltoid
 

369
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,960
I'm not moving her in this outer deltoid
way she can't come in when you go out

370
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:03,970
way she can't come in when you go out
 

371
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,430
way she can't come in when you go out
her deltoid she can come in

372
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:07,440
her deltoid she can come in
 

373
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,560
her deltoid she can come in
when I go here she can't come in and

374
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:09,570
when I go here she can't come in and
 

375
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,400
when I go here she can't come in and
come in but I can start moving this do

376
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:13,410
come in but I can start moving this do
 

377
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,440
come in but I can start moving this do
you see but she still can't come in

378
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:15,450
you see but she still can't come in
 

379
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,430
you see but she still can't come in
right and then I'm going round it and I

380
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:18,440
right and then I'm going round it and I
 

381
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,150
right and then I'm going round it and I
accelerated so home here we let her pull

382
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:23,160
accelerated so home here we let her pull
 

383
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,210
accelerated so home here we let her pull
pull against it if I try to pull that I

384
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:26,220
pull against it if I try to pull that I
 

385
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:40,870
pull against it if I try to pull that I
can't do that but look what I'm doing

386
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880

 

387
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,880

so what you're what you what feels

388

gentle to you and why do you think I'm
 

391
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,670
gentle to you and why do you think I'm
just getting out of the way is that I'm

392
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:49,680
just getting out of the way is that I'm
 

393
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,290
just getting out of the way is that I'm
not pulling on you you see that when I

394
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:54,300
not pulling on you you see that when I
