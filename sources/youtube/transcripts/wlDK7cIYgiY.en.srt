hi i'm christopher hein and today we're

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:02,480
hi i'm christopher hein and today we're
 

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,669
hi i'm christopher hein and today we're
talking about

4
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:03,679
talking about
 

5
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,950
talking about
the edemi position and the sacrifice of

6
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:06,960
the edemi position and the sacrifice of
 

7
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,430
the edemi position and the sacrifice of
sultan muwari when we're making idimi

8
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
sultan muwari when we're making idimi
 

9
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,390
sultan muwari when we're making idimi
so ideally in aikido if we can't make

10
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,400
so ideally in aikido if we can't make
 

11
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,070
so ideally in aikido if we can't make
distance and they're coming in towards

12
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
distance and they're coming in towards
 

13
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,789
distance and they're coming in towards
us

14
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,799
us
 

15
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,950
us
as we make a wasa we want to achieve

16
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:16,960
as we make a wasa we want to achieve
 

17
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,830
as we make a wasa we want to achieve
edemi

18
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:17,840
edemi
 

19
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,310
edemi
however eating is really really hard to

20
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
however eating is really really hard to
 

21
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,189
however eating is really really hard to
achieve

22
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:21,199
achieve
 

23
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,870
achieve
the reason for this is because every

24
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:22,880
the reason for this is because every
 

25
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,790
the reason for this is because every
time we try to get behind someone

26
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800
time we try to get behind someone
 

27
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,230
time we try to get behind someone
then someone's going to be stopping that

28
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
then someone's going to be stopping that
 

29
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,589
then someone's going to be stopping that
eating meat basically just means to get

30
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
eating meat basically just means to get
 

31
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,509
eating meat basically just means to get
behind someone to enter in behind them

32
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:29,519
behind someone to enter in behind them
 

33
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,269
behind someone to enter in behind them
so every time we try to achieve that

34
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
so every time we try to achieve that
 

35
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,069
so every time we try to achieve that
eating they're going to try to stop us

36
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
eating they're going to try to stop us
 

37
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,190
eating they're going to try to stop us
so if we always just fight for the edemi

38
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
so if we always just fight for the edemi
 

39
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,389
so if we always just fight for the edemi
and they're faster than us of course

40
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
and they're faster than us of course
 

41
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,430
and they're faster than us of course
we're going to lose

42
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
we're going to lose
 

43
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,310
we're going to lose
so we can use a trick with sotomowari

44
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
so we can use a trick with sotomowari
 

45
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,389
so we can use a trick with sotomowari
that kind of gives us the trade-off and

46
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
that kind of gives us the trade-off and
 

47
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,310
that kind of gives us the trade-off and
if you look at aikido forms you'll see

48
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
if you look at aikido forms you'll see
 

49
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,229
if you look at aikido forms you'll see
that a lot of the forms talk about

50
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
that a lot of the forms talk about
 

51
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,670
that a lot of the forms talk about
the side-by-side position which is

52
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
the side-by-side position which is
 

53
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,869
the side-by-side position which is
basically the position you get from a

54
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
basically the position you get from a
 

55
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,910
basically the position you get from a
sultan moare

56
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
sultan moare
 

57
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,670
sultan moare
so i think a lot of times what it's

58
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
so i think a lot of times what it's
 

59
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,350
so i think a lot of times what it's
saying is if you couldn't achieve the

60
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360
saying is if you couldn't achieve the
 

61
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,709
saying is if you couldn't achieve the
perfect edemi here

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,910
perfect edemi here

151
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,630
he's kind of right and we're going slow
right now but if we were real fast that

152
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,640
right now but if we were real fast that
 

153
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,070
right now but if we were real fast that
same thing would happen

154
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
same thing would happen
 

155
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,150
same thing would happen
also if josh was faster than me and i'm

156
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
also if josh was faster than me and i'm
 

157
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,110
also if josh was faster than me and i'm

hito means not nearly as good as the

190
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
hito means not nearly as good as the
 

191
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,670
hito means not nearly as good as the
eating me position

192
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
eating me position
 

193
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,670
eating me position
however when he's trying to counter what

194
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
however when he's trying to counter what
 

195
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,830
however when he's trying to counter what
i'm doing i can a lot of times work in a

196
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:49,840
i'm doing i can a lot of times work in a
 

197
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,430
i'm doing i can a lot of times work in a
quicker position to get heat on me

198
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
quicker position to get heat on me
 

199
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,550
quicker position to get heat on me
instead of eating me

200
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
instead of eating me
 

201
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,910
instead of eating me
right so and the reason this is is

202
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
right so and the reason this is is
 

203
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,430
right so and the reason this is is
because i'm turning around a smaller

204
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
because i'm turning around a smaller
 

205
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,229
because i'm turning around a smaller
axis right

206
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
axis right
 

207
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,390
axis right
so look if i'm trying to shoot in here

208
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
so look if i'm trying to shoot in here
 

209
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,309
so look if i'm trying to shoot in here
to him and he's trying to shoot opposite

210
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
to him and he's trying to shoot opposite
 

211
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,750
to him and he's trying to shoot opposite
and he's faster than me he's going to

212
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
and he's faster than me he's going to
 

213
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,670
and he's faster than me he's going to
beat me every time to that so what i do

214
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
beat me every time to that so what i do
 

215
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,750
beat me every time to that so what i do
is i turn it around a really tight axis

216
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
is i turn it around a really tight axis
 

217
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,390
is i turn it around a really tight axis
here and so by doing that let's see if i

218
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
here and so by doing that let's see if i
 

219
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,949
here and so by doing that let's see if i
can get it

220
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
can get it
 

221
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,869
can get it
come right here for me all right so what
