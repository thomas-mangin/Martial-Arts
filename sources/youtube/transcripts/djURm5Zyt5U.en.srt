so that's one rule and then the other

50
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:21,640
so that's one rule and then the other

okay so your elbow your uh hand passes
the midline you're go

504
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:45,079
the midline you're go
 

505
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:48,790
the midline you're go
slower stay there this hand doesn't keep

506
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
slower stay there this hand doesn't keep
 

507
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,269
slower stay there this hand doesn't keep
going like that cuz now it passed okay

508
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:52,279
going like that cuz now it passed okay
 

509
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,189
going like that cuz now it passed okay
this hand's going to take over so go

510
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:54,199
this hand's going to take over so go
 

511
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,990
this hand's going to take over so go
back where you

512
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,000

 

513
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,910

were okay stay there see how you keep

514
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
were okay stay there see how you keep
 

515
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,230
were okay stay there see how you keep
wanting to pass it okay let's keep our

516
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
wanting to pass it okay let's keep our
 

517
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,030
wanting to pass it okay let's keep our
grip as we're training okay so watch

518
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,040
grip as we're training okay so watch
 

519
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,910
grip as we're training okay so watch
what happens to this

520
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
what happens to this
 

521
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,749
what happens to this
space right

522
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:09,759
space right
 

523
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,829
space right
here go back move her arm you see it

524
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:14,839
here go back move her arm you see it
 

525
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:17,310
here go back move her arm you see it
gets smaller okay and you can't get it

526
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:17,320
gets smaller okay and you can't get it
 

527
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,110
gets smaller okay and you can't get it
in there so but and then you also have

528
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
in there so but and then you also have
 

529
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,189
in there so but and then you also have
because we cross that midline this is

530
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:24,199
because we cross that midline this is
 

531
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:27,430
because we cross that midline this is
now only going to be reinforc per the

532
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
now only going to be reinforc per the
 

533
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,389
now only going to be reinforc per the
outer deltoid so as starts pushing in

534
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
outer deltoid so as starts pushing in
 

535
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,230
outer deltoid so as starts pushing in
you're going to you're outer deltoid so

536
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
you're going to you're outer deltoid so
 

537
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,309
you're going to you're outer deltoid so
you don't cross your midline it should

538
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:34,319
you don't cross your midline it should
 

539
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:37,110
you don't cross your midline it should
be off on that

540
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
be off on that
 

541
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,670
be off on that
hand get it in there there you

542
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
hand get it in there there you
 

543
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,749
hand get it in there there you
go just a a side note I again remember I

544
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:45,759
go just a a side note I again remember I
 

545
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,870
go just a a side note I again remember I
only have this these movements this is

546
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:47,880
only have this these movements this is
 

547
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,150
only have this these movements this is
all I have that's it your inward spiral

548
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,160
all I have that's it your inward spiral
 

549
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,309
all I have that's it your inward spiral
and your outward spiral or for our

550
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:54,319
and your outward spiral or for our
 

551
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:56,670
and your outward spiral or for our
pattern you only have the heart shape

552
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:56,680
pattern you only have the heart shape
 

553
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,430
pattern you only have the heart shape
that's that's all you do okay

554
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
that's that's all you do okay
 

555
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,150
that's that's all you do okay
so as I go here and I'm doing

556
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,160
so as I go here and I'm doing
 

557
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,990
so as I go here and I'm doing
uh get on you can see that that's the

558
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,000
uh get on you can see that that's the
 

559
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,309
uh get on you can see that that's the
beginning of your hour

560
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:12,319

 

561
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:16,870

spiral what's maybe is not so clear is

562
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
spiral what's maybe is not so clear is
 

563
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,590
spiral what's maybe is not so clear is
that this hand is going to do your

564
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
that this hand is going to do your
 

565
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,150
that this hand is going to do your
inward spiral but in Reverse so it's

566
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
inward spiral but in Reverse so it's
 

567
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,629
inward spiral but in Reverse so it's
going this way but because of the

568
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:27,639
going this way but because of the
 

569
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:30,790
going this way but because of the
rotation it comes around to the outside

570
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
rotation it comes around to the outside
 

571
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,230
rotation it comes around to the outside
as opposed to it okay but it's still the

572
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:33,240
as opposed to it okay but it's still the
 

573
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,269
as opposed to it okay but it's still the
same shape so I go in here and I'm going

574
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:37,279
same shape so I go in here and I'm going
 

575
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,150
same shape so I go in here and I'm going
to do the same

576
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,160
to do the same
 

577
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,309
to do the same
shape with working towards the

578
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:44,319
shape with working towards the
 

579
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:46,550
shape with working towards the
outside I'm

580
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
outside I'm
 

581
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,470
outside I'm
not going to go here and I pull this

582
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
not going to go here and I pull this
 

583
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,470
not going to go here and I pull this
that's not the shape okay I keep the

584
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
that's not the shape okay I keep the
 

585
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,430
that's not the shape okay I keep the
same movement

586
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
same movement
 

587
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,669
same movement
here as if you're going to come back for

588
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:03,679

 

589
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,390

a same thing goes on Che on so as you're

590
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
a same thing goes on Che on so as you're
 

591
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,189
a same thing goes on Che on so as you're
here like this it goes this way doing

592
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:12,199
here like this it goes this way doing
 

593
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,150
here like this it goes this way doing
the inward

594
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
the inward
 

595
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,429
the inward
spiral it doesn't go this way doing this

596
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
spiral it doesn't go this way doing this
 

597
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,309
spiral it doesn't go this way doing this
chop which we don't have okay this hand

598
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:21,319
chop which we don't have okay this hand
 

599
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,590
chop which we don't have okay this hand
again

600
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:22,600
again
 

601
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,390
again
continues with the award spiral to get

602
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:27,400

 

603
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,590

out hand go

604
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600
out hand go
 

605
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,549
out hand go
go here this way to get

606
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:33,559
go here this way to get
 

607
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:37,350
go here this way to get
out but this hand does the same in

608
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
out but this hand does the same in
 

609
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,669
out but this hand does the same in
spiral in the same reverse way so I go

610
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
spiral in the same reverse way so I go
 

611
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,150
spiral in the same reverse way so I go
rotating

612
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:45,160
rotating
 

613
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,590
rotating
in keeps it going and keeps this shape

614
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
in keeps it going and keeps this shape
 

615
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,630
in keeps it going and keeps this shape
as it goes

616
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:51,640
as it goes
 

617
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,950
as it goes

[Music]
 

619
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,630
[Music]
around here this way

620
00:17:59,630 --> 00:17:59,640

 

621
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,950

this is

622
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960

 

623
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,190

incorrect you are making shapes with

624
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,200
incorrect you are making shapes with
 

625
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,590
incorrect you are making shapes with
your uh body with your arms using your

626
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:10,600
your uh body with your arms using your
 

627
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,230
your uh body with your arms using your
elbows to govern what you're doing okay

628
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
elbows to govern what you're doing okay
 

629
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,350
elbows to govern what you're doing okay
so you shouldn't be here straight here

630
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:18,360
so you shouldn't be here straight here
 

631
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,590
so you shouldn't be here straight here
no this is where I was I have that shape

632
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
no this is where I was I have that shape
 

633
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,630
no this is where I was I have that shape
so I'm going to ask tayor do something

634
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:23,640
so I'm going to ask tayor do something
 

635
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,789
so I'm going to ask tayor do something
weird so you guys can understand what's

636
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:25,799
weird so you guys can understand what's
 

637
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:29,350
weird so you guys can understand what's
going on my my hand is in the naget

638
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,360
going on my my hand is in the naget
 

639
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,950
going on my my hand is in the naget
shape so if he stuck his head under

640
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:31,960
shape so if he stuck his head under
 

641
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,710
shape so if he stuck his head under
there get under there you see that's the

642
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:35,720
there get under there you see that's the
 

643
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,070
there get under there you see that's the
shape that I have okay all right all

644
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
shape that I have okay all right all
 

645
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,990
shape that I have okay all right all
right another note on uh Chon on The

646
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,000
right another note on uh Chon on The
 

647
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,470

Cutting hand so this hand right here all

648
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
Cutting hand so this hand right here all
 

649
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,870
Cutting hand so this hand right here all
right so uh you have to have the ike

650
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:49,880
right so uh you have to have the ike
 

651
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,029
right so uh you have to have the ike
adhesion skill to get that thing to

652
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
adhesion skill to get that thing to
 

653
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,110
adhesion skill to get that thing to
move otherwise you're going to want to

654
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
move otherwise you're going to want to
 

655
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,350
move otherwise you're going to want to
grab it otherwise you have no effect on

656
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,360
grab it otherwise you have no effect on
 

657
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,950
grab it otherwise you have no effect on
them they won't keep coming forward

658
00:18:59,950 --> 00:18:59,960
them they won't keep coming forward
 

659
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,470
them they won't keep coming forward
you'll have to over prioritize his hand

660
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
you'll have to over prioritize his hand
 

661
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,390
you'll have to over prioritize his hand
so there's just there's just no way

662
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,400
so there's just there's just no way
 

663
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,270
so there's just there's just no way
around that that you wherever you're

664
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
around that that you wherever you're
 

665
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,510
around that that you wherever you're
touching so here I got some here here

going okay got it all right so uh those

800
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
going okay got it all right so uh those
 

801
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,630
going okay got it all right so uh those
that those Hand Works is what you're

802
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:11,640
that those Hand Works is what you're
 

803
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,830
that those Hand Works is what you're
doing um energetically of course those

804
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:14,840
doing um energetically of course those
 

805
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,269
doing um energetically of course those
are the movement of L gong is moving in

806
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:18,279
are the movement of L gong is moving in
 

807
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:21,510
are the movement of L gong is moving in
that spiral rotation that starts the

808
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:21,520
that spiral rotation that starts the
 

809
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,870
that spiral rotation that starts the
lower Tom field uh spiral rotating that

810
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
lower Tom field uh spiral rotating that
 

811
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,310
lower Tom field uh spiral rotating that
this these movements don't do anything

812
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:27,320
this these movements don't do anything
 

813
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,310
this these movements don't do anything
these movements do not rotate anything

814
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,320
these movements do not rotate anything
 

815
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,630
these movements do not rotate anything
okay um so you're moving loud long and

816
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,640
okay um so you're moving loud long and
 

817
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,909
okay um so you're moving loud long and
and using that kind of mudra like aspect

818
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:37,919
and using that kind of mudra like aspect
 

819
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,070
and using that kind of mudra like aspect
uh to spiral rotate martially what

820
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,080
uh to spiral rotate martially what
 

821
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,950
uh to spiral rotate martially what
you're doing is you're learning how to

822
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:43,960
you're doing is you're learning how to
 

823
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,310
you're doing is you're learning how to
fight with your elbows inside your outer

824
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:47,320
fight with your elbows inside your outer
 

825
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,630
fight with your elbows inside your outer

828
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:52,200
rim and they're very pretty pretty tight
 

829
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,110
rim and they're very pretty pretty tight
to my body the entire time okay um as

830
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,120
to my body the entire time okay um as
 

831
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,549
to my body the entire time okay um as
you're moving

832
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:58,559
you're moving
 

833
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,190
you're moving
these movements together you don't want

834
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
these movements together you don't want
 

835
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,549
these movements together you don't want
to think of them only for katatori um

836
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
to think of them only for katatori um
 

837
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,510
to think of them only for katatori um
nor do you want to think about them only

838
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:06,520
nor do you want to think about them only
 

839
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,669
nor do you want to think about them only
in hand transitions so for example uh

840
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:09,679
in hand transitions so for example uh
 

841
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,029
in hand transitions so for example uh
we've done uh uh Shaga right well as I

842
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
we've done uh uh Shaga right well as I
 

843
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,430
we've done uh uh Shaga right well as I
take part of one hand transition and

844
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,440
take part of one hand transition and
 

845
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,470
take part of one hand transition and
come around this way uh I just did the

846
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:21,480
come around this way uh I just did the
 

847
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,590
come around this way uh I just did the
gon on the same hand so in other words

848
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
gon on the same hand so in other words
 

849
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,070
gon on the same hand so in other words
here we got that and here's this do you

850
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,080
here we got that and here's this do you
 

851
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,870
here we got that and here's this do you
see

852
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:28,880
see
 

853
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,470
see
and I'm doing gon on the same hand on

854
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:31,480
and I'm doing gon on the same hand on
 

855
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,830
and I'm doing gon on the same hand on
that one we did that for example in the

856
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:34,840
that one we did that for example in the
 

857
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,750
that one we did that for example in the
sh it's right there

858
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:39,760

 

859
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,630

okay however that said we do have a

860
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:44,640
okay however that said we do have a
 

861
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,310
okay however that said we do have a
particular uh tactic that we did at the

862
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,320
particular uh tactic that we did at the
 

863
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,830
particular uh tactic that we did at the
end so we entered and we got to the back

864
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:49,840
end so we entered and we got to the back
 

865
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,990
end so we entered and we got to the back
and controlled the neck okay and what we

866
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,000
and controlled the neck okay and what we
 

867
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,470
and controlled the neck okay and what we
want to understand there is that it's

868
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:55,480
want to understand there is that it's
 

869
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,909
want to understand there is that it's
not so Universal I I understand it is

870
00:24:58,909 --> 00:24:58,919
not so Universal I I understand it is
 

871
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,029
not so Universal I I understand it is
ultimately Universal and I have to

872
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
ultimately Universal and I have to
 

873
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,470
ultimately Universal and I have to
figure out how to use all these

874
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,480
figure out how to use all these
 

875
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,029
figure out how to use all these
different hand and elbow and forearm

876
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:05,039
different hand and elbow and forearm
 

877
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,070
different hand and elbow and forearm
shapes to do all of my pairing and all

878
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
shapes to do all of my pairing and all
 

879
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,190
shapes to do all of my pairing and all
my trapping and like you see in the C

880
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:10,200
my trapping and like you see in the C
 

881
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,510
my trapping and like you see in the C
you game okay but here I'm in the back

882
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:14,520
you game okay but here I'm in the back
 

883
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,510
you game okay but here I'm in the back
I'm controlling the arm and I'm

884
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:16,520
I'm controlling the arm and I'm
 

885
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,950
I'm controlling the arm and I'm
controlling the neck it's kind of

886
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
controlling the neck it's kind of
 

887
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,190
controlling the neck it's kind of
tactically specific so certain rules

888
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,200
tactically specific so certain rules
 

889
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,590
tactically specific so certain rules
come in um whenever you're on the

890
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:24,600
come in um whenever you're on the
 

891
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,190
come in um whenever you're on the
outside of the arm you have to be

892
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200
outside of the arm you have to be
 

893
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,350
outside of the arm you have to be
above the

894
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:30,360
above the
 

895
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,510
above the
elbow you can't be below the elbow

896
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:34,520
elbow you can't be below the elbow
 

897
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,070
elbow you can't be below the elbow
because you're not controlling the hinge

898
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,080
because you're not controlling the hinge
 

899
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,870
because you're not controlling the hinge
and this thing can attack to the outside

900
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:39,880
and this thing can attack to the outside
 

901
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,230
and this thing can attack to the outside
that's kind of a general rule so if I'm

902
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,240
that's kind of a general rule so if I'm
 

903
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,630
that's kind of a general rule so if I'm
on the outside you're always above the

904
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:44,640
on the outside you're always above the
 

905
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,110
on the outside you're always above the
elbow never below the elbow if you're on

906
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,120
elbow never below the elbow if you're on
 

907
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,149
elbow never below the elbow if you're on
the inside it's the exact opposite you

908
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:51,159
the inside it's the exact opposite you
 

909
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:54,269
the inside it's the exact opposite you
want to be below the elbow not above the

910
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:54,279
want to be below the elbow not above the
 

911
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:57,029
want to be below the elbow not above the
elbow because you can't check the arm

912
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:57,039
elbow because you can't check the arm
 

913
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,190
elbow because you can't check the arm
weapon okay

914
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,200
weapon okay
 

915
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,029
weapon okay
so focusing in on that you're going to

916
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,039
so focusing in on that you're going to
 

917
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,950
so focusing in on that you're going to
see that it's solved in gon by I'm

918
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:06,960
see that it's solved in gon by I'm
 

919
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,149
see that it's solved in gon by I'm
holding it if you're holding it it's not

920
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:09,159
holding it if you're holding it it's not
 

921
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:11,750
holding it if you're holding it it's not
an issue you are controlling the elbow

922
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
an issue you are controlling the elbow
 

923
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,470
an issue you are controlling the elbow
in this case

924
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:13,480
in this case
 

925
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,590
in this case
okay it starts to become relevant in

926
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:16,600
okay it starts to become relevant in
 

927
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,990
okay it starts to become relevant in
Chon so as I go in here you're going to

928
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000
Chon so as I go in here you're going to
 

929
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,590
Chon so as I go in here you're going to
see that I'm below the elbow no matter

930
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600
see that I'm below the elbow no matter
 

931
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,430
see that I'm below the elbow no matter
how close I get I'm going to be below

932
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,440
how close I get I'm going to be below
 

933
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,750
how close I get I'm going to be below
the elbow if I obey all these rules but

934
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
the elbow if I obey all these rules but
 

935
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,549
the elbow if I obey all these rules but
once I start entering you'll see that on

936
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:30,559
once I start entering you'll see that on
 

937
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,750
once I start entering you'll see that on
the Emi and I turn I'm now above the

938
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:33,760
the Emi and I turn I'm now above the
 

939
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,789
the Emi and I turn I'm now above the
elbow okay don't be out here below the

940
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:36,799
elbow okay don't be out here below the
 

941
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,669
elbow okay don't be out here below the
elbow because you can't protect the

942
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:38,679
elbow because you can't protect the
 

943
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:40,750
elbow because you can't protect the
groin stripes and things like that

944
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:40,760
groin stripes and things like that
 

945
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,870
groin stripes and things like that
you're above the elbow so I'm doing uh

946
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:44,880
you're above the elbow so I'm doing uh
 

947
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,990
you're above the elbow so I'm doing uh
true do and you'll see that eventually I

948
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,000
true do and you'll see that eventually I
 

949
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,750
true do and you'll see that eventually I
get myself above the elbow as I'm just

950
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:51,760
get myself above the elbow as I'm just
 

951
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,990
get myself above the elbow as I'm just
going

952
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,000
going
 

953
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,110
going
sorry no this is incorrect I got to move

954
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,120
sorry no this is incorrect I got to move
 

955
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,789
sorry no this is incorrect I got to move
above the elbow

956
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:02,799

 

957
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,470

above the elbow okay where you check and

958
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:05,480
above the elbow okay where you check and
 

959
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,909
above the elbow okay where you check and
the same thing happens on jodon and

960
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:07,919
the same thing happens on jodon and
 

961
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,669
the same thing happens on jodon and
you're going to Jon you might start out

962
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:11,679
you're going to Jon you might start out
 

963
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,470
you're going to Jon you might start out
of

964
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:12,480
of
 

965
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,389
of
below generally tend to start out above

966
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:15,399
below generally tend to start out above
 

967
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:18,149
below generally tend to start out above
because it's it's much closer technique

968
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:18,159
because it's it's much closer technique
 

969
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,870
because it's it's much closer technique
and you just want to make sure that you

970
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:19,880
and you just want to make sure that you
 

971
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,909
and you just want to make sure that you
stay above and you don't go over here

972
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:22,919
stay above and you don't go over here
 

973
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,190
stay above and you don't go over here
and unanchor your elbow cuz you got the

974
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
and unanchor your elbow cuz you got the
 

975
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,310
and unanchor your elbow cuz you got the
same non check going on there so as I'm

976
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:29,320
same non check going on there so as I'm
 

977
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,950
same non check going on there so as I'm
going you'll see I move from here to

978
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:33,960
going you'll see I move from here to
 

979
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,630
going you'll see I move from here to
here which will happen

980
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:36,640
here which will happen
 

981
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,630
here which will happen
naturally if you

982
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
naturally if you
 

983
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,549
naturally if you
follow the elbow returns to the yog line

984
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559
follow the elbow returns to the yog line
 

985
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,990
follow the elbow returns to the yog line
the only way you can not follow this

986
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,000
the only way you can not follow this
 

987
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,870
the only way you can not follow this
rule is you brought your elbow outside

988
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:47,880
