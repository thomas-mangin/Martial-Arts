00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239

 

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,470

you're you just don't do that okay it's

18

you're you just don't do that okay it's
 

19
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,069

very modern you know we talk about the

20
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
very modern you know we talk about the
 

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,950
very modern you know we talk about the
individual and you do you and you do

22
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:45,960
individual and you do you and you do
 

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,029
individual and you do you and you do
what's good for you and then we have all

24
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:48,039
what's good for you and then we have all
 

25
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:51,830
what's good for you and then we have all
these cautionary tals right don't commit

00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
these cautionary tals right don't commit
 

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,510
these cautionary tals right don't commit
to that like that level but that's just

28
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:54,520
to that like that level but that's just
 

29
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,590
to that like that level but that's just
that's just weak sauce that's all that

30
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:56,600
that's just weak sauce that's all that
 

31
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,990
that's just weak sauce that's all that
is

32
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
is
 

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,430
is
okay um you're never going going to get

34
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:00,440
okay um you're never going going to get
 

35
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,830
okay um you're never going going to get
it that way there's no way okay if you

36
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
it that way there's no way okay if you
 

37
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,350
it that way there's no way okay if you
if you

38
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
if you
 

39
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,030
if you
have a belief in cautionary

40
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
have a belief in cautionary
 

41
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,510
have a belief in cautionary
tals and you're trying to protect

42
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
tals and you're trying to protect
 

43
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,950
tals and you're trying to protect
yourself just you could do the math

44
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:15,960
yourself just you could do the math
 

45
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,070
yourself just you could do the math
you're not going to get it this is not

46
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
you're not going to get it this is not
 

47
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,950
you're not going to get it this is not
for people that are trying to protect

48
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960

 

49
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,270

themselves so you just can't do the

50
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,280
themselves so you just can't do the
 

51
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,390
themselves so you just can't do the
salad bar stuff you have to

52
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
salad bar stuff you have to
 

53
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,630
salad bar stuff you have to
you you know that that would be from a

54
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
you you know that that would be from a
 

55
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,830
you you know that that would be from a
psycho even just from a an ontological

56
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
psycho even just from a an ontological
 

57
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,870
psycho even just from a an ontological
or psychological

58
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:37,880
or psychological
 

59
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,069
or psychological
level okay but when you add to that the

60
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:41,079
level okay but when you add to that the
 

61
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,749
level okay but when you add to that the
fact that everything

62
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:42,759
fact that everything
 

63
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,590
fact that everything
is

64
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
is
 

65
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,069
is
systematic anytime you don't pick

66
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:49,079
systematic anytime you don't pick
 

67
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,670
systematic anytime you don't pick
what's there for you to adopt you just

68
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:52,680
what's there for you to adopt you just
 

69
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,109
what's there for you to adopt you just
broke the

70
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:54,119
broke the
 

71
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,389
broke the
system okay

72
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
system okay
 

73
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,550
system okay
so you might you might the reason I

74
00:01:59,550 --> 00:01:59,560
so you might you might the reason I
 

75
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,109
so you might you might the reason I
mention in these two things because you

76
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:02,119
mention in these two things because you
 

77
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,469
mention in these two things because you
you might not uh you might not believe

78
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
you might not uh you might not believe
 

79
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,150
you might not uh you might not believe
in the system you see you might

80
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
in the system you see you might
 

81
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,990
in the system you see you might
believe that there's no ho to

82
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
believe that there's no ho to
 

83
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,470
believe that there's no ho to
it but even if that was the case the

84
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:17,480
it but even if that was the case the
 

85
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,390
it but even if that was the case the
first problem is big enough that you

86
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:19,400
first problem is big enough that you
 

87
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,390
first problem is big enough that you
shouldn't do it okay but here in this

88
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
shouldn't do it okay but here in this
 

89
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,790
shouldn't do it okay but here in this
case it is

90
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:23,800
case it is
 

91
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,229
case it is
systematic and everything fits together

92
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:27,239
systematic and everything fits together
 

93
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,350
systematic and everything fits together
so when you take something out

94
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
so when you take something out
 

95
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,430
so when you take something out
you you broke everything it just doesn't

96
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,440
you you broke everything it just doesn't
 

97
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,190
you you broke everything it just doesn't
work

98
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,200
work
 

99
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,390
work
okay so um some of the reasons why we

100
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
okay so um some of the reasons why we
 

101
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,550
okay so um some of the reasons why we
break

102
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:41,560
break
 

103
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,710

something is ultimately of course

104
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
something is ultimately of course
 

105
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,070
something is ultimately of course
because their ego reifying but one of

106
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,080
because their ego reifying but one of
 

107
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,670
because their ego reifying but one of
the ways that that ego reification takes

108
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
the ways that that ego reification takes
 

109
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,670
the ways that that ego reification takes
shape is you won't let go of old

110
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:52,680
shape is you won't let go of old
 

111
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,350
shape is you won't let go of old
knowledge okay you're comfortable with

112
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
knowledge okay you're comfortable with
 

113
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,149
knowledge okay you're comfortable with
old knowledge uh and you just won't let

114
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159
old knowledge uh and you just won't let
 

115
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,990
old knowledge uh and you just won't let
go of it um um again I don't know if

116
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,000
go of it um um again I don't know if
 

117
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,190
go of it um um again I don't know if
anyone ever told you but that's just

118
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
anyone ever told you but that's just
 

119
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,550
anyone ever told you but that's just
 I don't understand why you hold

120
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:07,560
I don't understand why you hold
 

121
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,110
I don't understand why you hold
on to

122
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
on to
 

123
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,789
on to
 once you know something you

124
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:11,799
once you know something you
 

125
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,430
once you know something you
let go of it you you let go of all of it

126
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
let go of it you you let go of all of it
 

127
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,190
let go of it you you let go of all of it
you don't you don't

128
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
you don't you don't
 

129
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,630
you don't you don't
slowly open your grip and and then

130
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
slowly open your grip and and then
 

131
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,949
slowly open your grip and and then
tomorrow I'll try to tilt the out

132
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
tomorrow I'll try to tilt the out
 

133
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,670
tomorrow I'll try to tilt the out
of my hand you just let go of

134
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
of my hand you just let go of
 

135
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,910
of my hand you just let go of
it so you have a lot of versions of

136
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:28,920
it so you have a lot of versions of
 

137
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,070
it so you have a lot of versions of
techniques they just goofy they don't

138
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,080
techniques they just goofy they don't
 

139
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,030
techniques they just goofy they don't
work you should not you shouldn't do

140
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,040
work you should not you shouldn't do
 

141
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,830
work you should not you shouldn't do
them you should come with pure eyes to

142
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:36,840
them you should come with pure eyes to
 

143
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,270
them you should come with pure eyes to
see what is the system and then you

144
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
see what is the system and then you
 

145
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,030
see what is the system and then you
duplicate the system but if you hold on

146
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,040
duplicate the system but if you hold on
 

147
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,470
duplicate the system but if you hold on
to old knowledge it filters what I'm

148
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
to old knowledge it filters what I'm
 

149
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,270
to old knowledge it filters what I'm
showing you and you don't see what I'm

150
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:46,280
showing you and you don't see what I'm
 

151
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,949
showing you and you don't see what I'm
showing you you you only see what you

152
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
showing you you you only see what you
 

153
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,149
showing you you you only see what you
already know which you should not know

154
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
already know which you should not know
 

155
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,910
already know which you should not know
you should have never known in the first

156
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
you should have never known in the first
 

157
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,069
you should have never known in the first
place

158
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,079
place
 

159
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:59,149

okay um and because this is the ultimate

160
00:03:59,149 --> 00:03:59,159
okay um and because this is the ultimate
 

161
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,509
okay um and because this is the ultimate
source if you if I'm making video and

00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
source if you if I'm making video and
 

163
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,350
source if you if I'm making video and
you can't see what I'm doing cuz you saw

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:04,360
you can't see what I'm doing cuz you saw
 

165
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,190
you can't see what I'm doing cuz you saw
something else there's no point there's

no
 

169
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,869
no
point so take more seriously whether you

170
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
point so take more seriously whether you
 

171
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,349
point so take more seriously whether you
can actually see what I'm

172
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:15,359
can actually see what I'm
 

173
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,990
can actually see what I'm
doing or whether you

174
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
doing or whether you
 

175
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,749
doing or whether you
can't and I would start from the very

176
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:20,759
can't and I would start from the very
 

177
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,469
can't and I would start from the very
simple point of view is I am not doing

178
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:23,479
simple point of view is I am not doing
 

179
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:24,830
simple point of view is I am not doing
what you were

180
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:24,840
what you were
 

181
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,749
what you were
doing I am not doing what your teacher

182
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
doing I am not doing what your teacher
 

183
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,469
doing I am not doing what your teacher
does there there's not one technique

184
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
does there there's not one technique
 

185
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,430
does there there's not one technique
that I do that I've ever seen anyone

186
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:34,440
that I do that I've ever seen anyone
 

187
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,350
that I do that I've ever seen anyone
else do ever it is always different and

188
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,360
else do ever it is always different and
 

189
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,430
else do ever it is always different and
when you get down to it it's different

190
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
when you get down to it it's different
 

191
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,150
when you get down to it it's different
at a core level it's not a variation one

192
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,160
at a core level it's not a variation one
 

193
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,469
at a core level it's not a variation one
is TR and one is false one works and one

194
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
is TR and one is false one works and one
 

195
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,110
is TR and one is false one works and one
does not work okay so learn to see what

196
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
does not work okay so learn to see what
 

197
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,749
does not work okay so learn to see what
I'm putting out there problematize

198
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
I'm putting out there problematize
 

199
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,110
I'm putting out there problematize
whether you can see or not that's the

200
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,120
whether you can see or not that's the
 

201
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,670
whether you can see or not that's the
beginning of dashy Hood

202
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:00,680
beginning of dashy Hood
 

203
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,110
beginning of dashy Hood
okay all right so we did a video I'm

204
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
okay all right so we did a video I'm
 

205
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,310
okay all right so we did a video I'm
going to explain this one more to help

206
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,320
going to explain this one more to help
 

207
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,430
going to explain this one more to help
you see the difference in what I was

208
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
you see the difference in what I was
 

209
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,390
you see the difference in what I was
doing okay we did a video the qu the

210
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:11,400
doing okay we did a video the qu the
 

211
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,110
doing okay we did a video the qu the
question that sparked the video is

212
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
question that sparked the video is
 

213
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,469
question that sparked the video is
where's the opening for Shon nag okay so

214
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:17,479
where's the opening for Shon nag okay so
 

215
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,590
where's the opening for Shon nag okay so
that's that's the question

216
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
that's that's the question
 

217
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,469
that's that's the question
again somebody's trying to fight with

218
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
again somebody's trying to fight with
 

219
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,070
again somebody's trying to fight with
the Kon I don't try to fight with the

220
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,080
the Kon I don't try to fight with the
 

221
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,469
the Kon I don't try to fight with the
Keyon but I can entertain this question

222
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:27,479
Keyon but I can entertain this question
 

223
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,790
Keyon but I can entertain this question
from a tactical architectural point of

224
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:29,800
from a tactical architectural point of
 

225
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,430
from a tactical architectural point of
you that's what we're doing okay so what

226
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
you that's what we're doing okay so what
 

227
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,590
you that's what we're doing okay so what
tends to

228
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:34,600
tends to
 

229
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,510
tends to
happen in the opening of shon Naga and

230
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
happen in the opening of shon Naga and
 

231
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,070
happen in the opening of shon Naga and
in the video what I did is if you go

232
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
in the video what I did is if you go
 

233
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,110
in the video what I did is if you go
into the front Inward

234
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
into the front Inward
 

235
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,150
into the front Inward
kazushi and he is able to extend my

236
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
kazushi and he is able to extend my
 

237
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,070
kazushi and he is able to extend my
circle then he will come back on the

238
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,080
circle then he will come back on the
 

239
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,309
circle then he will come back on the
other side of that Circle and that is

240
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
other side of that Circle and that is
 

241
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,790
other side of that Circle and that is
the opening for sh net okay so for

242
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
the opening for sh net okay so for
 

243
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,070
the opening for sh net okay so for
example if I am trying to

244
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
example if I am trying to
 

245
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,189
example if I am trying to
do this C nogget that's the front inward

246
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:10,199
do this C nogget that's the front inward
 

247
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,749
do this C nogget that's the front inward
kazushi is that you guys see that okay

248
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:14,759
kazushi is that you guys see that okay
 

249
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,270
kazushi is that you guys see that okay
that that's what the first thing so I

250
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
that that's what the first thing so I
 

251
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,150
that that's what the first thing so I
tried to do the front inward kazushi

252
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160

 

253
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,270

okay so he tries to do the front Inward

254
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
okay so he tries to do the front Inward
 

255
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,469
okay so he tries to do the front Inward
kazushi and this leg comes around like

256
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
kazushi and this leg comes around like
 

257
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,270
kazushi and this leg comes around like
that do you see he's not going to go

258
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:34,280
that do you see he's not going to go
 

259
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,430
that do you see he's not going to go
into the front inward kazushi he

260
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:36,440
into the front inward kazushi he
 

261
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,710
into the front inward kazushi he
extended my

262
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:37,720
extended my
 

263
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,990
extended my
circle and he is now open for shho nin

264
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,000
circle and he is now open for shho nin
 

265
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,070
circle and he is now open for shho nin
okay it doesn't look like that it it

266
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,080
okay it doesn't look like that it it
 

267
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,110
okay it doesn't look like that it it
it's very gross and ugly and there's a

268
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,120
it's very gross and ugly and there's a
 

269
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,309
it's very gross and ugly and there's a
lot of stumbling because we're going to

270
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
lot of stumbling because we're going to
 

271
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,589
lot of stumbling because we're going to
project that foot do you know what I

272
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:54,599
project that foot do you know what I
 

273
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,350
project that foot do you know what I
mean so like if I'm coming in and he's

274
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
mean so like if I'm coming in and he's
 

275
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,430
mean so like if I'm coming in and he's
going he's he's trying to get me off of

276
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:00,440
going he's he's trying to get me off of
 

277
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,430
going he's he's trying to get me off of
that foot do you see

278
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440

 

279
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,350

that so as we're going and you s it this

280
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
that so as we're going and you s it this
 

281
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,309
that so as we're going and you s it this
might look like that do you see all the

282
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
might look like that do you see all the
 

283
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,589
might look like that do you see all the
same thing happened

284
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599

 

285
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,110

okay so I'm trying to do that he extends

286
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,120
okay so I'm trying to do that he extends
 

287
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,950
okay so I'm trying to do that he extends
around it and there's the opening for sh

288
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
around it and there's the opening for sh
 

289
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,510
around it and there's the opening for sh
it's right there okay so what is

290
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:28,520
it's right there okay so what is
 

291
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,309
it's right there okay so what is
required his

292
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:31,319
required his
 

293
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,189
required his
energy has to be

294
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:34,199
energy has to be
 

295
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,869
energy has to be
going uh in an extension of the front

296
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:37,879
going uh in an extension of the front
 

297
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,270
going uh in an extension of the front
inward kazushi pattern

298
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,280
inward kazushi pattern
 

299
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,990
inward kazushi pattern
okay so he can't be going the other way

300
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
okay so he can't be going the other way
 

301
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,990
okay so he can't be going the other way
it's not going to be there here's where

302
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
it's not going to be there here's where
 

303
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,830
it's not going to be there here's where
it's now

304
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
it's now
 

305
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,149
it's now
artificial that's not going to happen

306
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:52,159
artificial that's not going to happen
 

307
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,350
artificial that's not going to happen
that's that's not the Tactical opening

308
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
that's that's not the Tactical opening
 

309
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,909
that's that's not the Tactical opening
okay or we're here and he changes level

310
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
okay or we're here and he changes level
 

311
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,230
okay or we're here and he changes level
and he comes underneath this isn't where

312
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
and he comes underneath this isn't where
 

313
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,950
and he comes underneath this isn't where
you're going to do sh Naga either that's

314
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960

 

315
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,390

artificial what's going to happen he's

316
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:09,400
artificial what's going to happen he's
 

317
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,110
artificial what's going to happen he's
coming in he extends

318
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,120
coming in he extends
 

319
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,110
coming in he extends
past there inertia is going this way

320
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
past there inertia is going this way
 

321
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,469
past there inertia is going this way
okay and his

322
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:19,479
okay and his
 

323

stance is
 

325
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,589
stance is
offset to my positioning okay so what I

326
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
offset to my positioning okay so what I
 

327
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,790
offset to my positioning okay so what I
mean by that say

328
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800
mean by that say
 

329
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:40,190
mean by that say
is from a certain point of

330
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:40,200

 

331
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,829

view his feet are

332
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:42,839
view his feet are
 

333
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:49,030
view his feet are
square do you see that but from another

334
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040

 

335
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,310

angle they're not

336
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:51,320
angle they're not
 

337
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,110
angle they're not
Square so the angle that I'm in is not

338
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,120
Square so the angle that I'm in is not
 

339
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,310
Square so the angle that I'm in is not
here that would be square feet okay

340
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
here that would be square feet okay
 

341
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,430
here that would be square feet okay
I'm

342
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
I'm
 

343
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,310
I'm
on this this angle more over here and

344
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:05,320
on this this angle more over here and
 

345
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,470
on this this angle more over here and
the way you can tell what's going on is

346
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
the way you can tell what's going on is
 

347
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,389
the way you can tell what's going on is
that the leg is easily

348
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
that the leg is easily
 

349
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:19,110
that the leg is easily
sweepable okay so let's

350
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120

 

351
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,550

say he's coming around and you can find

352
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:23,560
say he's coming around and you can find
 

353
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,030
say he's coming around and you can find
this sweep very easily

354
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,040
this sweep very easily
 

355
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,470
this sweep very easily
okay but that would be close range

356
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
okay but that would be close range
 

357
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,949
okay but that would be close range
grappling I'd have to be close enough to

358
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
grappling I'd have to be close enough to
 

359
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,949
grappling I'd have to be close enough to
do that in other words if if I'm out

360
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:37,959
do that in other words if if I'm out
 

361
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:41,949
do that in other words if if I'm out
here that's I you you seeo people do

362
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:41,959
here that's I you you seeo people do
 

363
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,110
here that's I you you seeo people do
that all the time but that that's

364
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,120
that all the time but that that's
 

365
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,230
that all the time but that that's
 you get a one to one step so if

366
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
you get a one to one step so if
 

367
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,269
you get a one to one step so if
I'm here and I go there

368
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
I'm here and I go there
 

369
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,550
I'm here and I go there
right that would be fine okay and in a

370
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
right that would be fine okay and in a
 

371
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,829
right that would be fine okay and in a
way that's sh n okay

372
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
way that's sh n okay
 

373
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,150
way that's sh n okay
what happens in

374
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,160
what happens in
 

375
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,269
what happens in
Shon is that I'm out at

376
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:04,279
Shon is that I'm out at
 

377
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,269
Shon is that I'm out at
midrange midrange I can't reach the foot

378
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
midrange midrange I can't reach the foot
 

379
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,990
midrange midrange I can't reach the foot
without taking two steps to get there

380
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,000
without taking two steps to get there
 

381
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,790
without taking two steps to get there
okay so at

382
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:13,800
okay so at
 

383
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,069
okay so at
mid-range that's the that's the first

384
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
mid-range that's the that's the first
 

385
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,630
mid-range that's the that's the first
thing okay I'm going to let them play

386
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
thing okay I'm going to let them play
 

387
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,630
thing okay I'm going to let them play
with that and then we'll build up more

388
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:21,640
with that and then we'll build up more
 

389
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,910
with that and then we'll build up more
so careful cuz even here I saw you guys

390
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:24,920
so careful cuz even here I saw you guys
 

391
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,269
so careful cuz even here I saw you guys
doing something different okay so it's

392
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
doing something different okay so it's
 

393
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,030
doing something different okay so it's
the front inward kazushi

394
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,040
the front inward kazushi
 

395
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,990
the front inward kazushi
okay uh and so if he if he was trying to

396
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,000
okay uh and so if he if he was trying to
 

397
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,910
okay uh and so if he if he was trying to
do the front inward kazushi you can see

398
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:36,920
do the front inward kazushi you can see
 

399
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,430
do the front inward kazushi you can see
my hat you see the Tilt in my body you

400
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
my hat you see the Tilt in my body you
 

401
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,509
my hat you see the Tilt in my body you
see and so when this comes around notice

402
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
see and so when this comes around notice
 

403
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,790
see and so when this comes around notice
where my head

404
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:45,800
where my head
 

405
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,790
where my head
is he's not just turning

406
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:51,800

 

407
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,150

me and I'm standing perfectly straight

408
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,160
me and I'm standing perfectly straight
 

409
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,069
me and I'm standing perfectly straight
if that's not the opening

410
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
if that's not the opening
 

411
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,790
if that's not the opening
okay uh

412
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
okay uh
 

413
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,990
okay uh
so usually when it comes out for me is

414
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,000
so usually when it comes out for me is
 

415
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,389
so usually when it comes out for me is
either Ronin or Tristan they're very

416
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:07,399
either Ronin or Tristan they're very
 

417
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,470
either Ronin or Tristan they're very
athletic and we're doing a guaza and

418
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
athletic and we're doing a guaza and
 

419
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,750
athletic and we're doing a guaza and
they're count they countered the caga

420
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:12,760
they're count they countered the caga
 

421
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,350
they're count they countered the caga
you see but they lost enough balance

422
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:16,360
you see but they lost enough balance
 

423
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,990
you see but they lost enough balance
that gives the opening okay for the Shon

424
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,000
that gives the opening okay for the Shon
 

425
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,949
that gives the opening okay for the Shon
nag so it's not that I'm on

426
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:23,959
nag so it's not that I'm on
 

427
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:27,829
nag so it's not that I'm on
balance this this this is not it cuz

428
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
balance this this this is not it cuz
 

429
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,310
balance this this this is not it cuz
we're pretty even do you see

430
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:33,320

 

431
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,310

that this is it do you see that is very

432
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:37,320
that this is it do you see that is very
 

433
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,910
that this is it do you see that is very
different that's the opening okay and it

434
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:40,920
different that's the opening okay and it
 

435
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,590
different that's the opening okay and it
might be depending on their athleticism

436
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:43,600
might be depending on their athleticism
 

437
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,430
might be depending on their athleticism
their head might even be

438
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
their head might even be
 

439
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,590
their head might even be
lower okay because they you're trying to

440
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:48,600
lower okay because they you're trying to
 

441
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,430
lower okay because they you're trying to
throw them harder they have to reconcile

442
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
throw them harder they have to reconcile
 

443
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,670
throw them harder they have to reconcile
more of the angles of cancellation the

444
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
more of the angles of cancellation the
 

445
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,470
more of the angles of cancellation the
head is lower and the body is more

446
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:55,480
head is lower and the body is more
 

447
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,269
head is lower and the body is more
tilted make sense okay so if you're

448
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
tilted make sense okay so if you're
 

449
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,069
tilted make sense okay so if you're
you're training this and you're trying

450
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:01,079
you're training this and you're trying
 

451
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,710
you're training this and you're trying
to go slow to get yourself familiar with

452
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
to go slow to get yourself familiar with
 

453
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,190
to go slow to get yourself familiar with
the

454
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:06,200
the
 

455
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,750
the
mechanics I would come around this way

456
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:10,760
mechanics I would come around this way
 

457
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,750
mechanics I would come around this way
and you're you're here like that okay

458
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
and you're you're here like that okay
 

459
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,310
and you're you're here like that okay
down here

460
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:17,320
down here
 

461
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,230
down here
not not

462
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:19,240
not not
 

463
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,750
not not
walking around that's that's not it you

464
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:22,760
walking around that's that's not it you
 

465
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,230
walking around that's that's not it you
should feel that person's not in kazushi

466
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:25,240
should feel that person's not in kazushi
 

467
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,310
should feel that person's not in kazushi
you need to need to let go draw a weapon

468
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
you need to need to let go draw a weapon
 

469
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,550
you need to need to let go draw a weapon
or something else

470
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
or something else
 

471
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,590
or something else
okay all right so um let's look at the

472
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
okay all right so um let's look at the
 

473
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,470
okay all right so um let's look at the
energy so his

474
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
energy so his
 

475
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,030
energy so his
inertia is going that way do you

476
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,040
inertia is going that way do you
 

477
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,430
inertia is going that way do you
see so let me show you how we got how we

478
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:46,440
see so let me show you how we got how we
 

479
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,590
see so let me show you how we got how we
how I did that okay it's on this hand so

480
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
how I did that okay it's on this hand so
 

481
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,550
how I did that okay it's on this hand so
this hand that's going around I feel him

482
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
this hand that's going around I feel him
 

483
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,949
this hand that's going around I feel him
counter it do you see okay and when I I

484
00:12:59,949 --> 00:12:59,959
counter it do you see okay and when I I
 

485
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,790
counter it do you see okay and when I I
bring this to

486
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:01,800
bring this to
 

487
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,829
bring this to
me it will generate the centrifugal

488
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
me it will generate the centrifugal
 

489
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,350
me it will generate the centrifugal
energy more and make him go more into

490
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
energy more and make him go more into
 

491
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,509
energy more and make him go more into
the Tilt okay I do not try to turn his

492
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
the Tilt okay I do not try to turn his
 

493
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,430
the Tilt okay I do not try to turn his
hand he's turning my hand just comes

494
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:16,440
hand he's turning my hand just comes
 

495
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,110
hand he's turning my hand just comes
straight into me okay so I go around War

496
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,120
straight into me okay so I go around War
 

497
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,189
straight into me okay so I go around War
I feel him my hand just goes into me

498
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:25,199
I feel him my hand just goes into me
 

499
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:26,550
I feel him my hand just goes into me
because his

500
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
because his
 

501
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,829
because his
inertia is circular

502
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
inertia is circular
 

503
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,710
inertia is circular
it does what I need it to do

504
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
it does what I need it to do
 

505
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,389
it does what I need it to do
okay on the other

506
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:35,399
okay on the other
 

507
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,990
okay on the other
side and I'm trying for this one that's

508
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,000
side and I'm trying for this one that's
 

509
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,550
side and I'm trying for this one that's
it that's all I'm doing

510
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
it that's all I'm doing
 

511

it that's all I'm doing
okay boom that's

512
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
okay boom that's
 

513
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,230
okay boom that's
it okay and you can see that it lowers

514
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:49,240
it okay and you can see that it lowers
 

515
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,110
it okay and you can see that it lowers
his head it already has the fall and is

516
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,120
his head it already has the fall and is
 

517
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,670
his head it already has the fall and is
continuing the kazushi okay so let's try

518
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
continuing the kazushi okay so let's try
 

519
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,949
continuing the kazushi okay so let's try
that one now detail I'm correcting my

520
00:13:57,949 --> 00:13:57,959
that one now detail I'm correcting my
 

521
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,870
that one now detail I'm correcting my
folks here so as you you come around

around like this okay you
continuing the energy that he's going

528
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:12,440
continuing the energy that he's going
 

529
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,749
continuing the energy that he's going
here do you see

530
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:14,759
here do you see
 

531
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,790
here do you see
that so you're not going to make him do

okay he came here boom he countered take
 

541
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,910
okay he came here boom he countered take
that energy that and that keeps him

542
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
that energy that and that keeps him
 

543
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,629
that energy that and that keeps him
going around me okay got it so if you're

544
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:35,639
going around me okay got it so if you're
 

545
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,470
going around me okay got it so if you're
the

546

UK it's a little scary because you're a
 

549
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,389
UK it's a little scary because you're a
constant kazushi so again don't push so

550
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:43,399
constant kazushi so again don't push so
 

551
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,990
constant kazushi so again don't push so
hard he goes you come around and you

552
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,000
hard he goes you come around and you
 

553
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,670
hard he goes you come around and you
should be going this

554
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:48,680
should be going this
 

555
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,230
should be going this
way

556
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240

 

557
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,470

okay so the guy came in I attempted to

558
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:56,480
okay so the guy came in I attempted to
 

559
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,110
okay so the guy came in I attempted to
tilt him he came around I even going

560
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,120
tilt him he came around I even going
 

561
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,509
tilt him he came around I even going
around makees sense we'll do it one more

562
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:02,519
around makees sense we'll do it one more
 

563
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,710
around makees sense we'll do it one more
time the guy came in I tilted him he

564
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:05,720
time the guy came in I tilted him he
 

565
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,150
time the guy came in I tilted him he
extended the circle I keep him going on

566
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
extended the circle I keep him going on
 

567
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,670
extended the circle I keep him going on
that New Path okay so if you look at

568
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
that New Path okay so if you look at
 

569
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,189
that New Path okay so if you look at
him just look down he got tilted and his

570
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
him just look down he got tilted and his
 

571
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,269
him just look down he got tilted and his
Energy's coming around

572
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:20,279
Energy's coming around
 

573
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,829
Energy's coming around
okay I don't want to

574
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:22,839
okay I don't want to
 

575
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,310
okay I don't want to
be where he's going to hit me okay I

576
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:27,320
be where he's going to hit me okay I
 

577
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,790
be where he's going to hit me okay I
don't want to move him behind

578
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:29,800
don't want to move him behind
 

579
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,629
don't want to move him behind
me and now he is behind me this does not

580
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:33,639
me and now he is behind me this does not
 

581
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,389
me and now he is behind me this does not
make sense okay

582
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
make sense okay
 

583
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,189
make sense okay
so like all

584
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
so like all
 

585
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,030
so like all
likeo as he's making a circle this way I

586
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
likeo as he's making a circle this way I
 

587
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,030
likeo as he's making a circle this way I
make a circle this way you see that okay

588
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,040
make a circle this way you see that okay
 

589
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,230
make a circle this way you see that okay
so he's going

590
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:51,240
so he's going
 

591
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:59,269
so he's going
around I go here okay

592
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279

 

593
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,829

I go okay and as he came around I'm not

594
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:02,839
I go okay and as he came around I'm not
 

595
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:06,670
I go okay and as he came around I'm not
facing him does that make sense so again

596
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:06,680
facing him does that make sense so again
 

597
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,389
facing him does that make sense so again
it's not that I'm here I do all that he

it's not that I'm here I do all that he
stops and then I go we're in motion

600
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
stops and then I go we're in motion
 

601
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,710
stops and then I go we're in motion
okay so he's going around

00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:17,720
okay so he's going around
 

603
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,870
okay so he's going around
I okay let's try started with

604
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880
I okay let's try started with
 

605
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,509
I okay let's try started with
problematize whether you can see what

606
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:22,519
problematize whether you can see what
 

607
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:26,350
problematize whether you can see what
I'm doing or not okay and

608

here I'm here and I go like that I don't
 

625
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,550
here I'm here and I go like that I don't
enter and turn he's over there and I

626
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
enter and turn he's over there and I
 

627
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,230
enter and turn he's over there and I
don't want that okay

628
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,240

 

629
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,150

that's the first thing he's turning I

630
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:01,160
that's the first thing he's turning I
 

631
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,710
that's the first thing he's turning I
don't need to turn he's turning around

632
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
don't need to turn he's turning around
 

633
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,390
don't need to turn he's turning around
me I don't need to turn if I

634
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:05,400
me I don't need to turn if I
 

635
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,630

turn and he's turning around me I'm
 

637
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,669
turn and he's turning around me I'm
going to overturn okay and that means

638
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:10,679
going to overturn okay and that means
 

639
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,350

okay where we end up is a little

710
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,000
okay where we end up is a little
 

711
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,350
okay where we end up is a little
different I'll explain that in the next

712
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360
different I'll explain that in the next
 

713
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,870
different I'll explain that in the next
break but let's work on this do not

714
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
break but let's work on this do not
 

715
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,510
break but let's work on this do not
turn let him put his arm into

716
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
turn let him put his arm into
 

717
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,310

shag okay do your best let's try it okay

718
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
shag okay do your best let's try it okay
 

719
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,990
shag okay do your best let's try it okay
so he's going

720
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,000
so he's going
 

721
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,909
so he's going
around and let's do this

722
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:22,919
around and let's do this
 

723
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:28,110
around and let's do this
side when I bring my hand in it makes

724
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,120
side when I bring my hand in it makes
 

725
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,590
side when I bring my hand in it makes
him keep going going around you

726
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:30,600
him keep going going around you
 

727
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,669
him keep going going around you
see so his inertia is going that way

728
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:34,679
see so his inertia is going that way
 

729
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,950
see so his inertia is going that way
right we know that okay now as he go as

730
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:37,960
right we know that okay now as he go as
 

731
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,830
right we know that okay now as he go as
he's going around and I bring his hand

732
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:40,840
he's going around and I bring his hand
 

733
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,110
he's going around and I bring his hand
up it is actually keeping him going that

734
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,120
up it is actually keeping him going that
 

735
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,110
up it is actually keeping him going that
way you get that okay so now I if you

736
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,120
way you get that okay so now I if you
 

737
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,110
way you get that okay so now I if you
watch that with that in mind we're going

738
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,120
watch that with that in mind we're going
 

739
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,430
watch that with that in mind we're going
to go really slow okay I'm timing as

740
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:54,440
to go really slow okay I'm timing as
 

741
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,549
to go really slow okay I'm timing as
he's going around I have to follow the

is going like
 

761
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:33,789
is going like
that and I'm keeping the energy with his

762
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:33,799
that and I'm keeping the energy with his
 

763
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,830
that and I'm keeping the energy with his
arm

764
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:36,840

 

765
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,750

everything we're doing to show these

804
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:57,640
everything we're doing to show these
 

805
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,750
everything we're doing to show these
principles is is allowing his head to

806
00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
principles is is allowing his head to
 

807
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,310
principles is is allowing his head to
gain height but that's not the technique

808
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,320
gain height but that's not the technique

okay so if you if we look at his

810
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
okay so if you if we look at his
 

811
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,510
okay so if you if we look at his
head you plot it how far is it from the

812
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:10,520
head you plot it how far is it from the
 

813
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,950
head you plot it how far is it from the
mat okay his head is down here it stays

814
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:13,960
mat okay his head is down here it stays
 

815
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,549
