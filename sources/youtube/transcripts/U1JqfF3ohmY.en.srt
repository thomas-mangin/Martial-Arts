thing to do at the right time it just
means we're ideally not going to

42
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040

and that's what i key actually is it's
 

49
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,150
and that's what i key actually is it's
about an energetic exchange

all right so today we're going to be
 

63
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,869
all right so today we're going to be
talking about how to do a live training

64
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
talking about how to do a live training
 

65
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,590
talking about how to do a live training
practice

66
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
practice
 

67
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,630
practice
with the ikey stuff so

68
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
with the ikey stuff so
 

69
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,310
with the ikey stuff so
what is that stuff and how does it work

70
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
what is that stuff and how does it work
 

71
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,870
what is that stuff and how does it work
so uh we can't really use the word

72
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
so uh we can't really use the word
 

73
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,789
so uh we can't really use the word
sparring when we're talking about aikido

74
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
sparring when we're talking about aikido
 

75
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,310
sparring when we're talking about aikido
and because the idea is really we don't

76
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
and because the idea is really we don't
 

77
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,310
and because the idea is really we don't
want to struggle at least not physically

78
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
want to struggle at least not physically
 

79
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,990
want to struggle at least not physically
and so and that's another thing we can

80
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
and so and that's another thing we can
 

81
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,590
and so and that's another thing we can
kind of argue about whether

82
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
kind of argue about whether
 

83
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,270
kind of argue about whether
mental struggle is really struggle and

84
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
mental struggle is really struggle and
 

85
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,950
mental struggle is really struggle and
of course it is on some level but

86
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
of course it is on some level but
 

87
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,710
of course it is on some level but
in aikido we want to keep everything

88
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
in aikido we want to keep everything
 

89
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,030
in aikido we want to keep everything
energetic and ideally we want to have it

90
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
energetic and ideally we want to have it
 

91
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,149
energetic and ideally we want to have it
energetically

92
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
energetically
 

93
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,469
energetically
work together and not oppose each other

94
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
work together and not oppose each other
 

95
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,910
work together and not oppose each other
so struggle's the antithesis of what

96
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
so struggle's the antithesis of what
 

97
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,789
so struggle's the antithesis of what
we're trying to do

98
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
we're trying to do
 

99
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,950
we're trying to do
so we're trying to ideally if we're

100
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
so we're trying to ideally if we're
 

101
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,710
so we're trying to ideally if we're
really skilled we'd be able to to figure

102
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
really skilled we'd be able to to figure
 

103
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,230
really skilled we'd be able to to figure
out a way to always make the energies

104
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
out a way to always make the energies
 

105
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,710
out a way to always make the energies
match

106
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:38,720
match
 

107
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,830
match
that wouldn't be a struggle and

108
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
that wouldn't be a struggle and
 

109
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,749
that wouldn't be a struggle and
everything would come off really well so

110
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
everything would come off really well so
 

111
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,789
everything would come off really well so
when we're talking about that we can't

112
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
when we're talking about that we can't
 

113
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,389
when we're talking about that we can't
really use the word sparring anymore

114
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
really use the word sparring anymore
 

115
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,710
really use the word sparring anymore
we now have to use the word uh live

116
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
we now have to use the word uh live
 

117
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,990
we now have to use the word uh live
training and live training just means a

118
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
training and live training just means a
 

119
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,670
training and live training just means a
situation that's live you know so all

120
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
situation that's live you know so all
 

121
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,950
situation that's live you know so all
kinds of different variables could

122
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
kinds of different variables could
 

123
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,429
kinds of different variables could
happen

124
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
happen
 

125
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,950
happen
and you have to be able to act in the

126
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
and you have to be able to act in the
 

127
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,870
and you have to be able to act in the
moment and deal with those variables as

128
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
moment and deal with those variables as
 

129
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,510
moment and deal with those variables as
we go

130
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
we go
 

131
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,389
we go

167
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,910
to ikey so that's the idea we
only use kumiuch in a very limited way

168
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
only use kumiuch in a very limited way
 

169
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,830
only use kumiuch in a very limited way
so we can get back to setting up ikey

170
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
so we can get back to setting up ikey
 

171
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,869
so we can get back to setting up ikey
and that's what we're always working

172
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
and that's what we're always working
 

173
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,350
and that's what we're always working
towards

174
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
towards
 

175
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,430
towards
all right so today maya's going to

176
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
all right so today maya's going to
 

177
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,949
all right so today maya's going to
represent ikey for us so we're going to

178
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
represent ikey for us so we're going to
 

179
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,670
represent ikey for us so we're going to
have her doing all the ikey stuff

180
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
have her doing all the ikey stuff
 

181
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,110
have her doing all the ikey stuff
and then we're going to go through the

182
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
and then we're going to go through the
 

183
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,630
and then we're going to go through the
basic live drills all right so i think

184
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
basic live drills all right so i think
 

185
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,550
basic live drills all right so i think
the first thing to understand and one of

186
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
the first thing to understand and one of
 

187
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,470
the first thing to understand and one of
the most important lessons for an aikido

188
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
the most important lessons for an aikido
 

189
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,589
the most important lessons for an aikido
student is

190
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,599
student is
 

191
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,350
student is
what range does making ikey become

192
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
what range does making ikey become
 

193
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,350
what range does making ikey become
very very difficult right so

194
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
very very difficult right so
 

195
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,110
very very difficult right so
understanding that range is super super

196
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
understanding that range is super super
 

197
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,589
understanding that range is super super
important

198
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
important
 

199
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,949
important
so we're going to show a really simple

200
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
so we're going to show a really simple
 

201
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,390
so we're going to show a really simple
drill that i use all the time i use it

202
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
drill that i use all the time i use it
 

203
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,830
drill that i use all the time i use it
in my self-defense classes when i'm

204
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
in my self-defense classes when i'm
 

205
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,550
in my self-defense classes when i'm
talking about

206
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
talking about
 

207
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,309
talking about
just in general to people you know what

208
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
just in general to people you know what
 

209
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,229
just in general to people you know what
is a dangerous self-defense range and

210
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
is a dangerous self-defense range and
 

211
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,229
is a dangerous self-defense range and
what is an acceptable self-defense range

212
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
what is an acceptable self-defense range
 

213
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,390
what is an acceptable self-defense range
um and also in aikido and aikido is

214
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
um and also in aikido and aikido is

um and also in aikido and aikido is
where i actually got all these ideas

216
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
where i actually got all these ideas
 

217
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,390
where i actually got all these ideas
from so

218
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
from so
 

219
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,630
from so
these are the lessons of aikido um so

220
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
these are the lessons of aikido um so
 

221
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,670
these are the lessons of aikido um so
we're gonna talk about that first we're

222
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
we're gonna talk about that first we're
 

223
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,350
we're gonna talk about that first we're
gonna set up josh and maya at a really

224
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
gonna set up josh and maya at a really
 

225
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,229
gonna set up josh and maya at a really
simple distance

226
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
simple distance
 

227
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,990
simple distance
they're going to be at a shoulder touch

228
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
they're going to be at a shoulder touch
 

229
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,509
they're going to be at a shoulder touch
okay so now i see if josh sticks out his

all right now from this it's going to be
 

239
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,830
all right now from this it's going to be
real simple all josh is going to try to

240
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840

that's it try and touch her shoulder now
understand if he could touch her

246
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
understand if he could touch her
 

247
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,110
understand if he could touch her
shoulder like that

248
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
shoulder like that
 

249
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,710
shoulder like that
that means he could hit her in the face

250
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
that means he could hit her in the face
 

251
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,070
that means he could hit her in the face
he could cut her with a knife he could

252
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
he could cut her with a knife he could
 

253
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,509
he could cut her with a knife he could
anything all you got to do is move his

254
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
anything all you got to do is move his
 

255
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,030
anything all you got to do is move his
arm then he could do all those actions

256
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
arm then he could do all those actions
 

257
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,229
arm then he could do all those actions

wrestle with her
 

261
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,430
wrestle with her
whatever stuff so that's the range at

262
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
whatever stuff so that's the range at
 

263
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,390
whatever stuff so that's the range at
which he could do that

264
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
which he could do that
 

265
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,830
which he could do that
okay so he's only going to touch your

266
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
okay so he's only going to touch your
 

267
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,430
okay so he's only going to touch your
shoulder and what maya is going to try

268
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
shoulder and what maya is going to try
 

269
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:49,990
shoulder and what maya is going to try
to do

270
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
to do
 

271
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,949
to do
is always get out of the way so every

272
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
is always get out of the way so every
 

273
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,630
is always get out of the way so every
time josh tries to touch her shoulder

274
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
time josh tries to touch her shoulder
 

275
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,990
time josh tries to touch her shoulder
maya is going to just do a slow one so

276
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
maya is going to just do a slow one so
 

277
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,670
maya is going to just do a slow one so
we can see josh going to be right there

278
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
we can see josh going to be right there
 

279
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,589
we can see josh going to be right there
we go so every time he moves his hand

280
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
we go so every time he moves his hand
 

281
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,710
we go so every time he moves his hand
maya's going to try to move out of the

282
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
maya's going to try to move out of the
 

283
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,309
maya's going to try to move out of the
way so we can see that okay now josh is

284
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
way so we can see that okay now josh is
 

285
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:02,789
way so we can see that okay now josh is
going to go

286
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
going to go
 

287
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,630
going to go
freely of his own accord whenever he

288
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
freely of his own accord whenever he
 

289
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,390
freely of his own accord whenever he
wants to do it so if he can detect some

290
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
wants to do it so if he can detect some
 

291
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,470
wants to do it so if he can detect some
kind of rhythms or patterns maya is in

292
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
kind of rhythms or patterns maya is in
 

293
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,830
kind of rhythms or patterns maya is in
or get her at a moment she's not

294
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
or get her at a moment she's not
 

295
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,110
or get her at a moment she's not
expecting it if he sees she kind of

296
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
expecting it if he sees she kind of
 

297
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,789
expecting it if he sees she kind of
dozes off then he's going to use that

298
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
dozes off then he's going to use that
 

299
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,990
dozes off then he's going to use that
time to get her right so

300
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
time to get her right so
 

301
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,429
time to get her right so
he's whenever he wants to come in and

302
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
he's whenever he wants to come in and
 

303
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:23,590
he's whenever he wants to come in and
try and touch her

304
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600

 

305
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,710

all right good enough okay now we could

306
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
all right good enough okay now we could
 

307
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,510
all right good enough okay now we could
make lots of

308
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
make lots of
 

309
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,030
make lots of
inferences from that right so we could

310
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
inferences from that right so we could
 

311
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,749
inferences from that right so we could
say well maya sucks at martial arts so

312
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
say well maya sucks at martial arts so
 

313
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,590
say well maya sucks at martial arts so
because she sucks at martial arts

314
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
because she sucks at martial arts
 

315
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,870
because she sucks at martial arts
then she needs to do more training

316
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
then she needs to do more training
 

317
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,909
then she needs to do more training
because josh got her every single time

318
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
because josh got her every single time
 

319
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,830
because josh got her every single time
if we took a large group of people and

320
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
if we took a large group of people and
 

321
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,430
if we took a large group of people and
looked at him doing this we would see

322
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
looked at him doing this we would see
 

323
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,670
looked at him doing this we would see
that most people get hit at that range

324
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
that most people get hit at that range
 

325
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,030
that most people get hit at that range
now the reason is because

326
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
now the reason is because
 

327
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,070
now the reason is because
this range is inherently dangerous there

328
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
this range is inherently dangerous there
 

329
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,310
this range is inherently dangerous there
is not a skill set you can train

now that's not to say you can't

336
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
now that's not to say you can't
 

337
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,870
now that's not to say you can't
sometimes get out of the way but again

338
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
sometimes get out of the way but again
 

339
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,310
sometimes get out of the way but again
that's a roll of the dice and remember

340
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
that's a roll of the dice and remember
 

341
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,909
that's a roll of the dice and remember
we're trying to look at trained skills

342
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
we're trying to look at trained skills

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,110
we're trying to look at trained skills
things we can get better at

344
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
things we can get better at
 

345
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,710
things we can get better at
now the reason that it's so hard for

346
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
now the reason that it's so hard for
 

347
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,469
now the reason that it's so hard for
maya to get out of the range here

348
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
maya to get out of the range here
 

349
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,909
maya to get out of the range here
is because two reasons one josh's hand

350
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
is because two reasons one josh's hand
 

351
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,230
is because two reasons one josh's hand
is significantly faster than maya's foot

352
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
is significantly faster than maya's foot
 

353
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,909
is significantly faster than maya's foot
so when she's trying to take an action

354
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
so when she's trying to take an action
 

355
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,150
so when she's trying to take an action
with her foot to counter josh's action

356
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
with her foot to counter josh's action
 

357
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,189
with her foot to counter josh's action
with his hands

358
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
with his hands
 

359
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,350

then it's going to be inherently slow so

you can't move your feet as fast as

we could of course add to this that maya

372
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
we could of course add to this that maya
 

373
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,110
we could of course add to this that maya
could block so let's say josh comes in

374
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
could block so let's say josh comes in
 

375
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,790
could block so let's say josh comes in
to hit her and maya blocks okay now

376
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
to hit her and maya blocks okay now
 

377
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,710
to hit her and maya blocks okay now
that's very reasonable maya can use

378
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
that's very reasonable maya can use
 

379
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,029
that's very reasonable maya can use
her hand speed to match josh's hand

380
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
her hand speed to match josh's hand

maya just doesn't have much reaction

384
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
maya just doesn't have much reaction

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
now if she trained a whole lot and maybe
 

389
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,430
now if she trained a whole lot and maybe
had a better reaction time than josh has

390
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
had a better reaction time than josh has

she might be able to kind of get closer

394
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
she might be able to kind of get closer
 

395
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,550
she might be able to kind of get closer
to 50 50 or so

to 50 50 or so
 

397
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,950
to 50 50 or so
but in truth if this guy is at all close

398
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
but in truth if this guy is at all close
 

399
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,150
but in truth if this guy is at all close
to her ability level

400
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160

00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,830
he'll always win because he is acting

first person to act is generally going

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,390
to win the situation
so we're teaching them something else

410
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
so we're teaching them something else
 

411
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,629
so we're teaching them something else
really important that reacting is

412
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
really important that reacting is
 

413
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,710
really important that reacting is
slower than acting right and that's an

414
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
slower than acting right and that's an
 

415
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,990
slower than acting right and that's an
important thing to understand

416
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
important thing to understand
 

417
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,590
important thing to understand
so two good things come out of this

418
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
so two good things come out of this
 

419
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,110
so two good things come out of this
drill and it's a very live drill

420
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
drill and it's a very live drill
 

421
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,909
drill and it's a very live drill
one is that your hand moves way faster

422
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
one is that your hand moves way faster
 

423
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,350
one is that your hand moves way faster
than the foot

424
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
than the foot
 

425
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,309
than the foot
and two is that reaction time is slower

426
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
and two is that reaction time is slower
 

427
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:18,629
and two is that reaction time is slower
than

428
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
than
 

429
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,950
than
action time right so so we learned that

430
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
action time right so so we learned that
 

431
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,830
action time right so so we learned that
all right now

432
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
all right now
 

433
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,870
all right now
that being said as iq students we're not

434
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
that being said as iq students we're not
 

435
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,710
that being said as iq students we're not
going to spend much time working at this

436
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
going to spend much time working at this
 

437
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,150
going to spend much time working at this
range and in fact we're going to learn

438
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
range and in fact we're going to learn
 

439
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,870
range and in fact we're going to learn
that we

440
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
that we
 

441
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,430
that we
hate this range the reason we hate this

442
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
hate this range the reason we hate this
 

443
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,550
hate this range the reason we hate this
range is because

444
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
range is because
 

445
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,070
range is because
it's unlikely that we're going to be

446
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
it's unlikely that we're going to be
 

447
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,670
it's unlikely that we're going to be
successful at this range

448
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
successful at this range
 

449
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,150
successful at this range
this range is for different kinds of

450
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
this range is for different kinds of
 

451
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,749
this range is for different kinds of
martial arts right so

452
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
martial arts right so
 

453
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,749
martial arts right so
studying boxing for this kind of range

454
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
studying boxing for this kind of range
 

455
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,270
studying boxing for this kind of range
and arguably those guys are always

456
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
and arguably those guys are always
 

457
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,629
and arguably those guys are always
trying to stay out of that range except

458
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
trying to stay out of that range except
 

459
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,390
trying to stay out of that range except
for when they want to be in that range

460
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
for when they want to be in that range
 

461
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,230
for when they want to be in that range
studying grappling is good for this kind

462
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
studying grappling is good for this kind
 

463
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,990
studying grappling is good for this kind
of range right so other martial arts

464
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
of range right so other martial arts
 

465
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,309
of range right so other martial arts
which

466
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
which
 

467
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,150
which
are very valid and good to study there's

468
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
are very valid and good to study there's
 

469
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,430
are very valid and good to study there's
nothing wrong with selling other martial

470
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
nothing wrong with selling other martial
 

471
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,749
nothing wrong with selling other martial
arts

472
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
arts
 

473
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,909
arts
are better for this range than aikido is

474
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
are better for this range than aikido is
 

475
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,430
are better for this range than aikido is
so now we got to figure out what an

476
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
so now we got to figure out what an
 

477
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,670
so now we got to figure out what an
aikido acceptable range is all right now

478
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
aikido acceptable range is all right now
 

479
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,430
aikido acceptable range is all right now
we have the aikido ma eye and this is

480
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
we have the aikido ma eye and this is
 

481
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,150
we have the aikido ma eye and this is
the classic

482
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
the classic
 

483
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,909
the classic
eye that everyone learns first day of

484
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
eye that everyone learns first day of
 

485
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,430
eye that everyone learns first day of
aikido class you go into an aikido

486
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
aikido class you go into an aikido
 

487
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,749
aikido class you go into an aikido
school

488

school
 

489
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,950
school
and this is probably one of the very

490
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
and this is probably one of the very
 

491
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,629

first lessons you learned and again
 

493
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,070
first lessons you learned and again
we're going to have a game they play at

494
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
we're going to have a game they play at
 

495
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,350
we're going to have a game they play at
this range right which is

496
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
this range right which is
 

497
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,629
this range right which is
they're both going to measure out this

498
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
they're both going to measure out this
 

499
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,710
they're both going to measure out this
distance now we're going to play the

500
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:14,720
distance now we're going to play the
 

501
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,469
distance now we're going to play the
exact same game we did a second ago josh

502
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
exact same game we did a second ago josh
 

503
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,830
exact same game we did a second ago josh
is gonna try to hit my shoulder and

504
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
is gonna try to hit my shoulder and
 

505
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,950
is gonna try to hit my shoulder and
maya's gonna try to get out of the way

506
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960

 

507
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,029

as fast and as erratic as he wants to be

508
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
as fast and as erratic as he wants to be
 

509
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,270
as fast and as erratic as he wants to be
he can go

510
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
he can go
 

511
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,150
he can go
okay now we're already seeing something

512
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
okay now we're already seeing something
 

513
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,510
okay now we're already seeing something
very different

514
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
very different
 

515
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,070
very different
now we could infer from that josh sucks

516
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
now we could infer from that josh sucks
 

517
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,350
now we could infer from that josh sucks
he needs to learn to hit

518
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
he needs to learn to hit
 

519
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,029
he needs to learn to hit
faster and move faster and all that

520
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
faster and move faster and all that
 

521
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,629
faster and move faster and all that
stuff and of course he could always get

522
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
stuff and of course he could always get
 

523
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,830
stuff and of course he could always get
better at that we could all get better

524
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
better at that we could all get better
 

525
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,309
better at that we could all get better
at things

526
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
at things
 

527
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,390
at things
but something else if we looked at a big

528
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
but something else if we looked at a big
 

529
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,749
but something else if we looked at a big
group of people doing this

530
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
group of people doing this
 

531
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,990
group of people doing this
we would learn that generally as long as

532
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
we would learn that generally as long as
 

533
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,029
we would learn that generally as long as
the person receiving

534
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
the person receiving
 

535
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,430
the person receiving
is attentive they can get out of the way

536
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
is attentive they can get out of the way
 

537
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,950
is attentive they can get out of the way
now the reason they can get out of the

538
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
now the reason they can get out of the
 

539
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,710
now the reason they can get out of the
way again is twofold

540
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
way again is twofold
 

541
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,670
way again is twofold
because josh can't just use his hand he

542
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
because josh can't just use his hand he
 

543
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,270
because josh can't just use his hand he
has to move his foot

544
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
has to move his foot
 

545
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,430
has to move his foot
maya can move her foot as well and that

546
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
maya can move her foot as well and that
 

547
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,189
maya can move her foot as well and that
means they're going to be in equal time

548
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
means they're going to be in equal time
 

549
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:03,589
means they're going to be in equal time
so

550
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
so
 

551
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,270
so
if josh moves his foot and maya moves

552
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
if josh moves his foot and maya moves
 

553
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,029
if josh moves his foot and maya moves
her foot they're in equal time

554
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
her foot they're in equal time
 

555
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,869
her foot they're in equal time
the second thing and arguably more

556
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
the second thing and arguably more
 

557
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,230
the second thing and arguably more
important is that

558
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,240
important is that
 

559
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,270
important is that
maya has enough reaction time to deal

560
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
maya has enough reaction time to deal
 

561
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,029
maya has enough reaction time to deal
with this situation right so

562
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
with this situation right so
 

563
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,790
with this situation right so
she actually can cognitively figure out

564
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
she actually can cognitively figure out
 

565
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,950
she actually can cognitively figure out
what's going on and deal with that

566
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
what's going on and deal with that
 

567
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,270
what's going on and deal with that
before he can get to her this gives you

568
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
before he can get to her this gives you
 

569
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,230
before he can get to her this gives you
a fighting

570
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
a fighting
 

571
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,950
a fighting
chance now if we go beyond this range we

572
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
chance now if we go beyond this range we
 

573
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,070
chance now if we go beyond this range we
will just skew

574
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
will just skew
 

575
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,469
will just skew
maya's advantages more and more and more

576
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
maya's advantages more and more and more
 

577
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,830
maya's advantages more and more and more
and so it gets to where you know if

578
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
and so it gets to where you know if
 

579
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,189
and so it gets to where you know if
they're really far apart she can

those are
 

637
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,230
those are
outside moving right so what we mean by

638
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
outside moving right so what we mean by
 

639
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,990
outside moving right so what we mean by
that is here's a if we drew a line

640
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
that is here's a if we drew a line
 

641
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,870
that is here's a if we drew a line
between them

642
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
between them
 

643
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,790

five of those uh tai no hinko are going

644
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
five of those uh tai no hinko are going
 

645
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,030
five of those uh tai no hinko are going
to move outside the line and only one of

646
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
to move outside the line and only one of
 

647
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,310
to move outside the line and only one of
those is going to move inside the line

648
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
those is going to move inside the line
 

649
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,670
those is going to move inside the line
so that one's special so first we're

650
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
so that one's special so first we're
 

651

just going to hit the five basic outside
 

653
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,070
just going to hit the five basic outside
okay so as josh comes in towards maya

654
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
okay so as josh comes in towards maya
 

655

and he moves from a narrow attack to a

722
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
and he moves from a narrow attack to a
 

723
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,590
and he moves from a narrow attack to a
wide attack as she does that it would

724
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
wide attack as she does that it would
 

725
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,230
wide attack as she does that it would
look like this

726
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240

 

727
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,389

right okay so what happened was maya's

728
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
right okay so what happened was maya's
 

729
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,670
right okay so what happened was maya's
trying to suppress and get to the

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
trying to suppress and get to the
 

731
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,509
trying to suppress and get to the
outside of the line and josh went around

732
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
outside of the line and josh went around
 

733
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,470
outside of the line and josh went around
her suppression

734
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
her suppression
 

735
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,389
her suppression
and made a wide attack like this so he

736
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
and made a wide attack like this so he
 

737
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,069
and made a wide attack like this so he
could grithe her up right so he can kind

738
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
could grithe her up right so he can kind
 

739
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:00,710
could grithe her up right so he can kind
of get her

740
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
of get her
 

741
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,710
of get her
get all around her like this now maya

742
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
get all around her like this now maya
 

743
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,069
get all around her like this now maya
can turn that into an

744
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
can turn that into an
 

745
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,470
can turn that into an
inside turn so watch now she'll turn the

746
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
inside turn so watch now she'll turn the
 

747
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,550
inside turn so watch now she'll turn the
outside turn into an inside turn watch

748
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
outside turn into an inside turn watch
 

749
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,750
outside turn into an inside turn watch
how this happens

750
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760

 

751
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,389

so as josh is going around maya scoots

752
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
so as josh is going around maya scoots
 

753
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,350
so as josh is going around maya scoots
underneath his arm

754
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
underneath his arm
 

755
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,870
underneath his arm
right now we can do that from an outside

756
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:16,880
right now we can do that from an outside
 

757
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,069
right now we can do that from an outside
turn we can also do that from edemi

758
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,079

 

759
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,509

we could also do that from a triangle

760
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519

 

761
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,790

we could also do that from a 90.

762
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800

 

763
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,750

and we can also do that from a 45.

764
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760

 

765
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,269

all right so this leads us to another

766
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
all right so this leads us to another
 

767
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,870
all right so this leads us to another
drill that i like to run with people

768
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
drill that i like to run with people
 

769
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,150
drill that i like to run with people
when we start learning how to make

770
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
when we start learning how to make
 

771
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,470
when we start learning how to make
good eye key and and this is you know

772
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
good eye key and and this is you know
 

773
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,389
good eye key and and this is you know
not great ikea because in fact he's

774
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
not great ikea because in fact he's
 

775
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,190
not great ikea because in fact he's
already crouched

776
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
already crouched
 

777
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,710
already crouched
in the distance he's gotten too close to

778
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
in the distance he's gotten too close to
 

779
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,230
in the distance he's gotten too close to
her so it's not great but how can she

780
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
her so it's not great but how can she
 

781
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,910
her so it's not great but how can she
make energetic actions that fit with

782
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
make energetic actions that fit with

what josh is doing

784
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
what josh is doing
 

785
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,829
what josh is doing
and this is an adaptation drill so as

786
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
and this is an adaptation drill so as
 

787
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,110
and this is an adaptation drill so as
we're doing this what we'll have them do

788
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
we're doing this what we'll have them do
 

789
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,430
we're doing this what we'll have them do
is

790
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
is
 

791
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,069
is
josh will come at maya sometimes only

792
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
josh will come at maya sometimes only
 

793
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,790
josh will come at maya sometimes only
staying narrow

794
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
staying narrow
 

795
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,069
staying narrow
and she should just use outside

796
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
and she should just use outside
 

797
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,350
and she should just use outside
movements for that we got five outside

798
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
movements for that we got five outside
 

799
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,710
movements for that we got five outside
movements that should work for that so

800
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
movements that should work for that so
 

801
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,910
movements that should work for that so
every time he comes narrow that's what

802
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
every time he comes narrow that's what
 

803
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,470
every time he comes narrow that's what
she should do

804
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
she should do
 

805
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,190
she should do
he's gonna randomly put in adaptations

806
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
he's gonna randomly put in adaptations
 

807
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,030
he's gonna randomly put in adaptations
so to go from narrow to wide

808
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
so to go from narrow to wide
 

809
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,550
so to go from narrow to wide
and when he does that mine needs to

810
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
and when he does that mine needs to
 

811
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,710
and when he does that mine needs to
train herself to skate right around that

812
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
train herself to skate right around that
 

813
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,310
train herself to skate right around that
action

814
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320

 

815
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,269

now what you want to do with your

816
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
now what you want to do with your
 

817
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,590
now what you want to do with your
students is have them do this randomly

818
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
students is have them do this randomly
 

819
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,230
students is have them do this randomly
right so

820
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
right so
 

821
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,509
right so
after they can do both of those

822
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
after they can do both of those
 

823
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,790
after they can do both of those
variations they need to do it randomly

824
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
variations they need to do it randomly
 

825
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,389
variations they need to do it randomly
so this person gets used to

826
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
so this person gets used to
 

827
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,230
so this person gets used to
if they make successful outside movement

828
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
if they make successful outside movement
 

829
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,670
if they make successful outside movement
then it's just successful

830
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
then it's just successful
 

831
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,350
then it's just successful
but if there's adaptation they start

832
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
but if there's adaptation they start
 

833
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,829
but if there's adaptation they start
learning how to adapt to that adaptation

834
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
learning how to adapt to that adaptation
 

835
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:50,870
learning how to adapt to that adaptation
let's run a little bit more

836
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880

 

837
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,870

all right good so understand we still

838
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
all right good so understand we still
 

839
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,150
all right good so understand we still
have the training wheels on at this

840
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
have the training wheels on at this
 

841
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,110
have the training wheels on at this
point this is still

842
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
point this is still
 

843
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,870
point this is still
super mellow practice but we're getting

844
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
super mellow practice but we're getting
 

845
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,629
super mellow practice but we're getting
our students used to moving in away with

846
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
our students used to moving in away with
 

847
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,910
our students used to moving in away with
each other that will train them for

848
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
each other that will train them for
 

849
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,990
each other that will train them for
later faster action will help them move

850
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
later faster action will help them move
 

851
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,230
later faster action will help them move
in

852
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
in
 

853
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,389
in
in those kinds of ways all right now in

854
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
in those kinds of ways all right now in
 

855
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,990
in those kinds of ways all right now in
this josh is doing a really

856
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
this josh is doing a really
 

857
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,069
this josh is doing a really
simple practice to get around maya

858
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
simple practice to get around maya
 

859
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,190
simple practice to get around maya
suppression so

860
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
suppression so
 

861
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,790
suppression so
um let's just kind of fake it so as josh

862
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
um let's just kind of fake it so as josh
 

863
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,550
um let's just kind of fake it so as josh
comes in and might get suppression

864
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
comes in and might get suppression
 

865
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,310
comes in and might get suppression
there josh all josh has to do right now

ways in which he could try and grab maya
 

881
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,150
ways in which he could try and grab maya
so the next drill house let's have you

to get free okay
 

923
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,030
to get free okay
now hidoki will be in our kumiuchi

924
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
now hidoki will be in our kumiuchi
 

925
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,790
now hidoki will be in our kumiuchi
series we put some videos out on hidoki

926
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
series we put some videos out on hidoki
 

927
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,750
series we put some videos out on hidoki
so we can look that up

928
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
so we can look that up
 

929
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,509
so we can look that up
but i would recommend stacking those

930
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
but i would recommend stacking those
 

931
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,870
but i would recommend stacking those
together so when your students get

932
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:14,880
together so when your students get
 

933
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,310
together so when your students get
grabbed and they didn't expect

934
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
grabbed and they didn't expect
 

935
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,910
grabbed and they didn't expect
someone to get around their suppression

936
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
someone to get around their suppression
 

937
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,350
someone to get around their suppression
they quickly made hidoki and you can see

938
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
they quickly made hidoki and you can see
 

939
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,030
they quickly made hidoki and you can see
maya just instantly went into hidoki and

940
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
maya just instantly went into hidoki and
 

941
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,150
maya just instantly went into hidoki and
she got free and that's what we should

942
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160
she got free and that's what we should
 

943
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,350
she got free and that's what we should
be training in aikido

944
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
be training in aikido
 

945
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,430
be training in aikido
okay so that drill what it's designed to

946
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
okay so that drill what it's designed to
 

947
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,750
okay so that drill what it's designed to
do is to teach the aikido student how to

948
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:27,760
do is to teach the aikido student how to
 

949
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,230
do is to teach the aikido student how to
have an

950
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
have an
 

951
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,790
have an
active and live suppression so when maya

952
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
active and live suppression so when maya
 

953
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,150
active and live suppression so when maya
and let's just kind of fake it here so

954
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
and let's just kind of fake it here so
 

955
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,910
and let's just kind of fake it here so
when maya gets our hand on josh's arm

956
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:33,920
when maya gets our hand on josh's arm
 

957
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,110
when maya gets our hand on josh's arm
let's have you go to the other side

958
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
let's have you go to the other side
 

959
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,550
let's have you go to the other side
actually there we go so when maya gets

960
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
actually there we go so when maya gets
 

961
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,590
actually there we go so when maya gets
her hand on josh's arm

962
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
her hand on josh's arm
 

963
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,949
her hand on josh's arm
understand josh could do lots of stuff

964
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
understand josh could do lots of stuff
 

965
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,710
understand josh could do lots of stuff
with his hand he could go back he could

966
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
with his hand he could go back he could
 

967
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,150
with his hand he could go back he could
go up he could go down and do all kinds

968
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
go up he could go down and do all kinds
 

969
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,790
go up he could go down and do all kinds
of stuff

970
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
of stuff
 

971
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,310
of stuff
and mine needs to learn to have active

972
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
and mine needs to learn to have active
 

973
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,150
and mine needs to learn to have active
suppression with that right okay now the

974
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
suppression with that right okay now the
 

975
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,509
suppression with that right okay now the
second part what josh was just showing

976
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
second part what josh was just showing
 

977
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:47,990
second part what josh was just showing
right now

978
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
right now
 

979
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,590
right now
is josh could reach from the other side

980
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
is josh could reach from the other side
 

981
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,110
is josh could reach from the other side
and so that's why maya always has to be

982
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120
and so that's why maya always has to be
 

983
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,710
and so that's why maya always has to be
trying to move to the outside of this

984
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
trying to move to the outside of this
 

985
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,030
trying to move to the outside of this
right

986
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
right
 

987
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,629
right
and that deals with that now we see

988
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
and that deals with that now we see
 

989
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,110
and that deals with that now we see
there classic ikkyo from aikido so why

990
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
there classic ikkyo from aikido so why
 

991
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,870
there classic ikkyo from aikido so why

right very good

1000
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
right very good
 

1001
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,829
right very good
so first we're going to go through the

1002
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839
so first we're going to go through the
 

1003
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,509
so first we're going to go through the
basic taino hinko after they understand

1004
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
basic taino hinko after they understand
 

1005
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,550
basic taino hinko after they understand
my eye we're going through the basic

1006
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
my eye we're going through the basic
 

1007
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,990
my eye we're going through the basic
taino hinko and then we're going to go

1008
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
taino hinko and then we're going to go
 

1009
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,509
taino hinko and then we're going to go
to an active suppression drill

1010
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
to an active suppression drill
 

1011
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,949
to an active suppression drill
now one thing we're going to try not to

1012
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
now one thing we're going to try not to
 

1013
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,949
now one thing we're going to try not to
have josh do there is stop

1014
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
have josh do there is stop
 

1015
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,310
have josh do there is stop
and the reason is because anytime

1016
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
and the reason is because anytime
 

1017
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,990
and the reason is because anytime
someone stops in aikido an attacker

1018
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
someone stops in aikido an attacker
 

1019
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,550
someone stops in aikido an attacker
stops

1020
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
stops
 

1021
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,629
stops
you should just make distance right so

1022
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
you should just make distance right so
 

1023
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,069
you should just make distance right so
maya doesn't want to play a game so

1024
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
maya doesn't want to play a game so
 

1025
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:22,550
maya doesn't want to play a game so
let's

1026
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
let's
 

1027
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,990
let's
show this kind of game so let's say josh

1028
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
show this kind of game so let's say josh
 

1029
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,430
show this kind of game so let's say josh
comes in for that wait hang on one

1030
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
comes in for that wait hang on one
 

1031
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,030
comes in for that wait hang on one
second let's say josh comes in for the

1032
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
second let's say josh comes in for the
 

1033
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,710
second let's say josh comes in for the
active suppression drill

1034
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
active suppression drill
 

1035
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,030
active suppression drill
and he stops to catch maya and plays the

1036
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
and he stops to catch maya and plays the
 

1037
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,430
and he stops to catch maya and plays the
game maya could dance with him like this

1038
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440

 

1039
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,430

okay that's stupid it's bad it's

1040
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
okay that's stupid it's bad it's
 

1041
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,949
okay that's stupid it's bad it's
horrible aikido because

1042
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
horrible aikido because
 

1043
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,710
horrible aikido because
if you notice they were in the range

1044
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
if you notice they were in the range
 

1045
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,629
if you notice they were in the range
that we talked about earlier was bad for

1046
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
that we talked about earlier was bad for
 

1047
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,509
that we talked about earlier was bad for
aikido

1048
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
aikido
 

1049
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,430
aikido
so maya knowing that that range is bad

1050
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
so maya knowing that that range is bad
 

1051
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,430
so maya knowing that that range is bad
for aikido should tell maya that every

1052
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
for aikido should tell maya that every
 

1053
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,110
for aikido should tell maya that every
time they do that she should do this in

1054
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120
time they do that she should do this in
 

1055
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,150
time they do that she should do this in
fact

1056
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160

 

1057
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,150

all right so now you see that end up

1058
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
all right so now you see that end up
 

1059
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,269
all right so now you see that end up
we're going to have the same thing we

1060
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
we're going to have the same thing we
 

1061
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,949
we're going to have the same thing we
just had a second ago before josh stop

1062
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
just had a second ago before josh stop
 

1063
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,550
just had a second ago before josh stop
is josh going to have to run to get maya

1064
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
is josh going to have to run to get maya
 

1065
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,990
is josh going to have to run to get maya
because maya's making distance

1066
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
because maya's making distance
 

1067
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,829
because maya's making distance
so that's the way that's dealt with in

1068
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
so that's the way that's dealt with in
 

1069
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,749
so that's the way that's dealt with in
this practice if the attacker

1070
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759
this practice if the attacker
 

1071
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,310
this practice if the attacker
wants to stop and play this game then

1072
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
wants to stop and play this game then
 

1073
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,990
wants to stop and play this game then
the defender should just walk away from

1074
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
the defender should just walk away from
 

1075
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,310
the defender should just walk away from
them

1076
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
them
 

1077
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,069
them
and then that will force the attacker to

1078
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
and then that will force the attacker to
 

1079
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,829
and then that will force the attacker to
chase them and again we'll have up the

1080
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:11,839
chase them and again we'll have up the
 

1081
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,430
chase them and again we'll have up the
exact situation that we just set up

1082
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
exact situation that we just set up
 

1083
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:13,990
exact situation that we just set up
right now

1084
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000
right now
 

1085
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,350
right now
so with your guys when you see that

1086
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
so with your guys when you see that
 

1087
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,949
so with your guys when you see that
going on too much you can explain that

1088
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
going on too much you can explain that
 

1089
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,550
going on too much you can explain that
to them and you can say hey guys

1090
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
to them and you can say hey guys
 

1091
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,749
to them and you can say hey guys
we're not running all around the mat

1092
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
we're not running all around the mat
 

1093
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,710
we're not running all around the mat
right now we're practicing it in a

1094
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
right now we're practicing it in a
 

1095
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,910
right now we're practicing it in a
straight line because we still have the

1096
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
straight line because we still have the
 

1097
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,269
straight line because we still have the
training wheels on right so this is

1098
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
training wheels on right so this is
 

1099
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:23,749
training wheels on right so this is
still

1100
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
still
 

1101
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,310
still
we're still baby stepping it here okay

1102
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
we're still baby stepping it here okay
 

1103
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,670
we're still baby stepping it here okay
so that's how you deal with those

1104
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
so that's how you deal with those
 

1105
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,790
so that's how you deal with those
problems that are going to come up in

1106
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
problems that are going to come up in
 

1107
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,150
problems that are going to come up in
your life practice i will warn you now

1108
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
your life practice i will warn you now
 

1109
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,509
your life practice i will warn you now
they will come up quite often

1110
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
they will come up quite often
 

1111
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,430
they will come up quite often
all right so the next drill we're going

1112
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
all right so the next drill we're going
 

1113
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,030
all right so the next drill we're going
to work from this is going to require a

1114
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
to work from this is going to require a
 

1115
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,949
to work from this is going to require a
weapon

1116
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
weapon
 

1117
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,749
weapon
all right so now we got a pool noodle of

1118
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
all right so now we got a pool noodle of
 

1119
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,389
all right so now we got a pool noodle of
doom

1120
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
doom
 

1121
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,910
doom
all right so actually because we're

1122
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920
all right so actually because we're
 

1123
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,350
all right so actually because we're
having maya do the i key we're gonna go

1124
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
having maya do the i key we're gonna go
 

1125
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,110
having maya do the i key we're gonna go
ahead and switch this

1126
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
ahead and switch this
 

1127
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,590
ahead and switch this
all right so one of the other lessons in

1128
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600
all right so one of the other lessons in
 

1129
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,590
all right so one of the other lessons in
aikido is a certain point so much force

1130
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600
aikido is a certain point so much force
 

1131
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,430
aikido is a certain point so much force
has been brought that there's no way you

1132
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
has been brought that there's no way you
 

1133
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,110
has been brought that there's no way you
can escape not using a weapon because

1134
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
can escape not using a weapon because
 

1135
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,030
can escape not using a weapon because
you have to have some force of your own

1136
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
you have to have some force of your own
 

1137
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,710
you have to have some force of your own
to counter the amazing force that this

1138
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
to counter the amazing force that this
 

1139
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,310
to counter the amazing force that this
person's being bringing and that could

1140
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
person's being bringing and that could
 

1141
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,590
person's being bringing and that could
be just because they're physically so

1142
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
be just because they're physically so
 

1143
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,550
be just because they're physically so
much greater than you

1144
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560
much greater than you
 

1145
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,550
much greater than you
right so if you're fighting a pro mma

1146
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,560
right so if you're fighting a pro mma
 

1147
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,910
right so if you're fighting a pro mma

1148
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:03,920
fighter you're going to need a weapon in
 

1149
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,949
fighter you're going to need a weapon in
your hand

1150
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
your hand
 

1151
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,029

guy
without a weapon in your hand so let's

1158
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
without a weapon in your hand so let's
 

1159
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,029
without a weapon in your hand so let's
just pretend josh is a pro mma fighter

1160
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:13,039
just pretend josh is a pro mma fighter
 

1161
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,710
just pretend josh is a pro mma fighter
the only way he might is possibly going

1162
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
the only way he might is possibly going
 

1163
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,710
the only way he might is possibly going
to deal with josh is to have a weapon

1164
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
to deal with josh is to have a weapon
 

1165
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,189
to deal with josh is to have a weapon
right so

1166
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:17,199
right so
 

1167
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,189
right so
we need to train those skills now a

1168
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
we need to train those skills now a
 

1169
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,669
we need to train those skills now a
really unobviously difficult thing

1170
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
really unobviously difficult thing
 

1171
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,990
really unobviously difficult thing
is moving and using a weapon at the same

1172
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,000
is moving and using a weapon at the same
 

1173
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,789
is moving and using a weapon at the same
time right so

1174
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799
time right so
 

1175
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,470
time right so
you might think oh of course i'll just

1176
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
you might think oh of course i'll just
 

1177
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,069
you might think oh of course i'll just
zig and zag and hit people with weapons

1178
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,079
zig and zag and hit people with weapons
 

1179
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,110
zig and zag and hit people with weapons
it'll be so sweet

1180
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120
it'll be so sweet
 

1181
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,950
it'll be so sweet
you won't do that until you train it a

1182
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
you won't do that until you train it a
 

1183
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,110
you won't do that until you train it a
lot you will suck at it we all have many

1184
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
lot you will suck at it we all have many
 

1185
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,669
lot you will suck at it we all have many
times

1186
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
times
 

1187
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,430
times
because it's difficult to think of how

1188
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
because it's difficult to think of how
 

1189
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,350
because it's difficult to think of how
to get away and how to hit someone at

1190
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
to get away and how to hit someone at
 

1191
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,110
to get away and how to hit someone at
the same time it's a real skill that has

1192
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,120
the same time it's a real skill that has
 

1193
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,990
the same time it's a real skill that has
to be trained

1194
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,000
to be trained
 

1195
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,990
to be trained
maya is going to do the basic drill we

1196
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
maya is going to do the basic drill we
 

1197
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,350
maya is going to do the basic drill we
did before but she's going to use the

1198
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
did before but she's going to use the
 

1199
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,270
did before but she's going to use the
weapon as she does that so as josh comes

1200
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
weapon as she does that so as josh comes
 

1201
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,549
weapon as she does that so as josh comes
in she's going to get suppression tai no

1202
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:46,559
in she's going to get suppression tai no
 

1203
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,470
in she's going to get suppression tai no
hinko and use the weapon

1204
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
hinko and use the weapon
 

1205
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,909
hinko and use the weapon
okay now notice there she used the

1206
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
okay now notice there she used the
 

1207
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,710
okay now notice there she used the
weapon for the suppression acceptable

1208
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:54,720

 

1209
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,310

there she used her hand for suppression

1210
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
there she used her hand for suppression
 

1211
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,630
there she used her hand for suppression
and attacked with the weapon acceptable

1212

and attacked with the weapon acceptable
 

1213
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,950
and attacked with the weapon acceptable
so this is just the same drill except

1214
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
so this is just the same drill except
 

1215
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,750
so this is just the same drill except
we're

1216
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
we're
 

1217
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,190
we're
forcing maya to start to learn how to

1218
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
forcing maya to start to learn how to
 

1219
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,270
forcing maya to start to learn how to
use a weapon while she's making

1220
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
use a weapon while she's making
 

1221
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,270
use a weapon while she's making
suppression and tai no hinko so this is

1222
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
suppression and tai no hinko so this is
 

1223
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,950
suppression and tai no hinko so this is
another skill she's going to use

1224
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
another skill she's going to use
 

1225
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,710
another skill she's going to use
okay now then again of course we can add

1226
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
okay now then again of course we can add
 

1227
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,470
okay now then again of course we can add
to this josh trying to get around her

1228
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480

good okay so with that we can see that

1232
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
good okay so with that we can see that
 

1233
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,830
good okay so with that we can see that
uh josh is trying to come in he's trying

aikido right so maya should already know
 

1261
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,710
aikido right so maya should already know
that that range is bad for her because

1262
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:56,720
that that range is bad for her because
 

1263
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,789
that that range is bad for her because
we learned that in those early ma eye

1264
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
we learned that in those early ma eye
 

1265
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,150
we learned that in those early ma eye
drills so maya doesn't want to be at

1266
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,160
drills so maya doesn't want to be at
 

1267
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,789
drills so maya doesn't want to be at
that range

1268
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:00,799
that range
 

1269
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,710
that range
she wants the most range because she has

1270
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
she wants the most range because she has
 

1271
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,470
she wants the most range because she has
the most i keep potential with that so

1272
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
the most i keep potential with that so
 

1273
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,750
the most i keep potential with that so
if josh plays the dance game

1274
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
if josh plays the dance game
 

1275
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,950
if josh plays the dance game
then that's what maya should do she

then that's what maya should do she
 

1277
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,390
then that's what maya should do she
should go away now of course the second

1278
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
should go away now of course the second
 

1279
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,350
should go away now of course the second
maya walks away

1280
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
maya walks away
 

1281
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,950
maya walks away
if josh wants to get her he'll have to

1282
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
if josh wants to get her he'll have to
 

1283
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,110
if josh wants to get her he'll have to
chase her and again we're at this basic

1284
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,120
chase her and again we're at this basic
 

1285
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,230
chase her and again we're at this basic
setup for this drill

1286
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,240
setup for this drill
 

1287
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,070

1288
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
so doing that little dance game is just
 

1289
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,590
so doing that little dance game is just
a way not to practice the thing that

1290
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
a way not to practice the thing that
 

1291
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,549
a way not to practice the thing that
we're practicing

1292
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559
we're practicing
 

1293
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,950
we're practicing
right now now later we can open it up

1294
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
right now now later we can open it up
 

1295
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,390
right now now later we can open it up
and we will in just a second here with

1296
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
and we will in just a second here with
 

1297
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,230
and we will in just a second here with
rondori and we can let them do whatever

1298
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240
rondori and we can let them do whatever
 

1299
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,270
rondori and we can let them do whatever
they want and then it will be a

1300
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280
they want and then it will be a
 

1301
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,630
they want and then it will be a
completely free practice and we'll see

1302
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
completely free practice and we'll see
 

1303
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,390
completely free practice and we'll see
how the dance game plays out for josh

1304
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,400
how the dance game plays out for josh
 

1305

but in this drill you need to keep your
students really really honest with this

1308
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
students really really honest with this
 

1309
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,510
students really really honest with this
right so now from this we should be able

1310
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
right so now from this we should be able
 

1311
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,110
right so now from this we should be able
to judge good distance for our students

1312
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
to judge good distance for our students
 

1313
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,390
to judge good distance for our students
we should be able to make suppression

1314
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
we should be able to make suppression
 

1315
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,909
we should be able to make suppression
and tai no hinko for our students we

1316
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:39,919
and tai no hinko for our students we
 

1317
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,430
and tai no hinko for our students we
should be able to use a weapon making

1318
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
should be able to use a weapon making
 

1319
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,630
should be able to use a weapon making
taino hinko and suppression for our

1320
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640
taino hinko and suppression for our
 

1321
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,830
taino hinko and suppression for our
students and so now that's going to

1322
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
students and so now that's going to
 

1323
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,110
students and so now that's going to
bring us to rondori

1324
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
bring us to rondori
 

1325
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,150
bring us to rondori
okay so i'm going to get out of here in

1326
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
okay so i'm going to get out of here in
 

1327
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,110
okay so i'm going to get out of here in
a second we're going to let these guys

1328
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,120
a second we're going to let these guys
 

1329
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,350
a second we're going to let these guys
go but we'll set up a box and the box is

1330
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,360
go but we'll set up a box and the box is
 

1331
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,029
go but we'll set up a box and the box is
the parameters maya has to be in right

1332
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
the parameters maya has to be in right
 

1333
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:51,830
the parameters maya has to be in right
so that's cor

1334
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:51,840
so that's cor
 

1335
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,190
so that's cor
it's totally artificial but it

1336
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
it's totally artificial but it
 

1337
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,190
it's totally artificial but it
represents her being in a room or in a

1338
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
represents her being in a room or in a
 

1339
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,710
represents her being in a room or in a
situation where there's dangerous

1340
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:56,720
situation where there's dangerous
 

1341
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,070
situation where there's dangerous
things on the edges right so maybe

1342
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,080
things on the edges right so maybe
 

1343
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,390
things on the edges right so maybe
there's a cliff or a road or a pool or

1344
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
there's a cliff or a road or a pool or
 

1345
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,830
there's a cliff or a road or a pool or
whatever stuff she doesn't want to get

1346
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:01,840
whatever stuff she doesn't want to get
 

1347
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,750
whatever stuff she doesn't want to get
in so mine's got to manage the distance

1348
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
in so mine's got to manage the distance
 

1349
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,909
in so mine's got to manage the distance
so she doesn't get knocked out of bounds

1350
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:05,919
so she doesn't get knocked out of bounds
 

1351
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,149
so she doesn't get knocked out of bounds
and she has to keep her stick while

1352
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
and she has to keep her stick while
 

1353
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,070
and she has to keep her stick while
she's doing that to use it on josh

1354
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080
she's doing that to use it on josh
 

1355
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,270
she's doing that to use it on josh
josh isn't going to feign that he's

1356
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
josh isn't going to feign that he's
 

1357
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,470
josh isn't going to feign that he's
getting hurt because that's not the

1358
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,480
getting hurt because that's not the
 

1359
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,190
getting hurt because that's not the
objective of this

1360
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
objective of this
 

1361
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,789

aikido doesn't train that stuff right so

1386
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
aikido doesn't train that stuff right so
 

1387
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,870
aikido doesn't train that stuff right so
we should get up from there right so

1388
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
we should get up from there right so
 

1389
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,950
we should get up from there right so

time okay
we're going to run these in 10 second

1396
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
we're going to run these in 10 second
 

1397
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,909
we're going to run these in 10 second
intervals right now and 10 seconds is

1398
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
intervals right now and 10 seconds is
 

1399
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,430
intervals right now and 10 seconds is
i wouldn't go any longer for your

1400
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
i wouldn't go any longer for your
 

1401
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,630
i wouldn't go any longer for your
students than 10 seconds in the

1402
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:46,640
students than 10 seconds in the
 

1403
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,270
students than 10 seconds in the
beginning

1404
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
beginning
 

1405
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,350
beginning
10 seconds is a lot and the amount of

1406
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,360
10 seconds is a lot and the amount of
 

1407
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,190
10 seconds is a lot and the amount of
damage this guy would usually acquire in

1408
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,200
damage this guy would usually acquire in
 

1409
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,950
damage this guy would usually acquire in
10 seconds will be significant because

1410
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
10 seconds will be significant because
 

1411
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,470
10 seconds will be significant because
remember she's using a weapon the whole

1412
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
remember she's using a weapon the whole
 

1413
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,390
remember she's using a weapon the whole
time so it was a pistol she'd be putting

1414
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400
time so it was a pistol she'd be putting
 

1415
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,430
time so it was a pistol she'd be putting
rounds on target

1416
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
rounds on target
 

1417
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,029
rounds on target
if it's a stick she's whacking him it's

1418
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
if it's a stick she's whacking him it's
 

1419
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,870
if it's a stick she's whacking him it's
a knife she's cutting him so that's 10

1420
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:00,880
a knife she's cutting him so that's 10
 

1421
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,230
a knife she's cutting him so that's 10
seconds is a lot of time for him to

1422
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,240
seconds is a lot of time for him to
 

1423
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:16,750
seconds is a lot of time for him to
sustain continuous injury

1424
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:16,760
sustain continuous injury
 

1425
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:37,190

1427
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,750

all right guys so that was uh the drills

1428
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:39,760
all right guys so that was uh the drills
 

1429
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,350
all right guys so that was uh the drills
i would recommend beginning your

1430
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,360
i would recommend beginning your
 

1431
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,789
i would recommend beginning your
students off working with

1432
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:42,799
students off working with
 

1433
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,990
students off working with
ikea live training so um

1434
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,000
ikea live training so um
 

1435
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,110
ikea live training so um
most of those practices or a lot of

1436
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
most of those practices or a lot of
 

1437
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,549
most of those practices or a lot of
those practices aren't actually live

1438
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
those practices aren't actually live
 

1439
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,830
those practices aren't actually live
practices but you're going to need to do

1440
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:49,840
practices but you're going to need to do
 

1441
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,430
practices but you're going to need to do
them to build up to the wrong dory we

1442
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440
them to build up to the wrong dory we
 

1443
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,070
them to build up to the wrong dory we
had at the end

1444
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
had at the end
 

1445
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,990
had at the end
so that's the way we do rondori we would

1446
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
so that's the way we do rondori we would
 

1447
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,350
so that's the way we do rondori we would
generally do it with two attackers

1448
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:55,360
generally do it with two attackers
 

1449
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,830
generally do it with two attackers
although

1450
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:55,840
although
 

1451
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,070
although
just to make things easy and uh we did

1452
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,080
just to make things easy and uh we did
 

1453
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,990
just to make things easy and uh we did
it with just the two today

1454
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,000
it with just the two today
 

1455
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,470
it with just the two today
two people total instead of having three

1456
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
two people total instead of having three
 

1457
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,470
two people total instead of having three
total which two attackers and one nugget

1458
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
total which two attackers and one nugget
 

1459
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,909
total which two attackers and one nugget
so um we did it that way just so it was

1460
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:05,919
so um we did it that way just so it was
 

1461
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,350
so um we did it that way just so it was
easier to see and consistent with what

1462
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,360
easier to see and consistent with what
 

1463
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,990
easier to see and consistent with what
we did but

1464
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,000
we did but
 

1465
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,190
we did but
generally when you get into wrongdoing

1466
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200
generally when you get into wrongdoing
 

1467
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,070
generally when you get into wrongdoing
you need to start doing multiple

1468
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
you need to start doing multiple
 

1469
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,110
you need to start doing multiple

about multiple attacker rondori and how
 

1483
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,390
about multiple attacker rondori and how
you start to work that

1484
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,400
you start to work that
 

1485
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,390
you start to work that
but you can see in there what's trying

1486
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,400
but you can see in there what's trying
 

1487
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,909
but you can see in there what's trying
to happen now understand that when

is not
ideal aikido that's right before failing

1494
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
ideal aikido that's right before failing
 

1495
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,630
ideal aikido that's right before failing
aikido so

1496
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
aikido so
 

1497
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,990
aikido so
she doesn't want to be there she doesn't

1498
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
she doesn't want to be there she doesn't
 

1499

1501
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,710
have to use a weapon she doesn't want to
be having to move around real fast with

1502
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,720
be having to move around real fast with
 

1503
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,070
be having to move around real fast with
a guy like that it's dangerous and the

1504
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
a guy like that it's dangerous and the
 

1505
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,270
a guy like that it's dangerous and the
more skilled josh is

1506
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,280
more skilled josh is
 

1507
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,630
more skilled josh is
the less likely she is going to be able

1508
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:38,640
the less likely she is going to be able
 

1509
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,870
the less likely she is going to be able
to deal with that so honestly good iq

1510
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:40,880
to deal with that so honestly good iq
 

1511
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,470
to deal with that so honestly good iq
would be never being in that situation

1512
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
would be never being in that situation
 

1513
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,990
would be never being in that situation
but that's right before it's going to

1514
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
but that's right before it's going to
 

1515
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,149
but that's right before it's going to
turn into serious kumiuchi so

1516
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:46,159
turn into serious kumiuchi so
 

1517
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,510
turn into serious kumiuchi so
once josh gets ahold of her then we're

1518
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
once josh gets ahold of her then we're
 

1519
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,270
once josh gets ahold of her then we're
already into kumuchi range and

1520
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280
already into kumuchi range and
 

1521
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,350
already into kumuchi range and
and this is about ikey so that

1522
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,360
and this is about ikey so that
 

1523
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,950
and this is about ikey so that
progression will build your students up

1524
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960
progression will build your students up
 

1525
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,549
progression will build your students up
so remember first work on

1526
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:54,559
so remember first work on

my eye they have to understand my eye

1528
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
my eye they have to understand my eye
 

1529
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,750
my eye they have to understand my eye
and what's a good distance for ikea and

1530
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:57,760
and what's a good distance for ikea and
 

1531
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,110
and what's a good distance for ikea and
what's a bad distance for aikido

1532
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120
what's a bad distance for aikido
 

1533
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,390
what's a bad distance for aikido
if you understand what a good distance

1534
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
if you understand what a good distance
 

1535
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,149
if you understand what a good distance
for aikido is that will fix a lot of the

1536
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
for aikido is that will fix a lot of the
 

1537
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,270
for aikido is that will fix a lot of the
problems your students are going to have

1538
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
problems your students are going to have
 

1539
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,549
problems your students are going to have
because they'll automatically always be

1540
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
because they'll automatically always be
 

1541
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,470
because they'll automatically always be
resetting to the good distance right

1542
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
resetting to the good distance right
 

1543
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,149
resetting to the good distance right
the good distance is just really far

1544
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
the good distance is just really far
 

1545
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,510
the good distance is just really far
away that's the best distance you can

1546
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
away that's the best distance you can
 

1547
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,070
away that's the best distance you can
have

1548
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
have
 

1549
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,830
have
but that minimum fingertip distance

1550
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
but that minimum fingertip distance
 

1551
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,029
but that minimum fingertip distance
that's the last distance you can

1552
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:13,039
that's the last distance you can
 

1553
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,950
that's the last distance you can
possibly do reasonable eye key

1554
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:14,960
possibly do reasonable eye key
 

1555
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,549
possibly do reasonable eye key
then after they can judge that distance

1556
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
then after they can judge that distance
 

1557
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,149
then after they can judge that distance
really well you'd have them work with

1558
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
really well you'd have them work with
 

1559
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,830
really well you'd have them work with
tyno hinko and suppression so

1560
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:19,840
tyno hinko and suppression so
 

1561
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,350
tyno hinko and suppression so
how do you suppress the arm and get off

1562
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,360
how do you suppress the arm and get off
 

1563
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,870
how do you suppress the arm and get off
the line that's going to be really key

1564
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:22,880
the line that's going to be really key
 

1565
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,230
the line that's going to be really key
then how do you adapt to what they're

1566
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,240
then how do you adapt to what they're
 

1567
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,590
then how do you adapt to what they're
going to do so when you suppress their

1568
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:25,600
going to do so when you suppress their
 

1569
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,950
going to do so when you suppress their
arm they're not just going to

1570
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960
arm they're not just going to
 

1571
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,470
arm they're not just going to
be like a zombie or a frankenstein and

1572
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
be like a zombie or a frankenstein and
 

1573

keep their arms out they're going to
 

1575
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,950
keep their arms out they're going to
move their arms around to try and get

1576
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
move their arms around to try and get
 

1577
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,310
move their arms around to try and get
you so you have to have an adaptive

1578
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
you so you have to have an adaptive
 

1579
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,710
you so you have to have an adaptive
drill

1580

drill
 

1581
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,230
drill
and it's a pretty live drill now because

1582
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,240
and it's a pretty live drill now because
 

1583
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,270
and it's a pretty live drill now because
the person's actually trying to come

1584

that are off the table in that and i
explain the reasons why because

1592
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
explain the reasons why because
 

1593
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,390
explain the reasons why because
stopping wouldn't be working on that

1594
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:42,400
stopping wouldn't be working on that
 

1595
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,070
stopping wouldn't be working on that
skill set when we get into wrongdoing

1596
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080
skill set when we get into wrongdoing
 

1597

possible
and that's just like a violent attack

1620

other than what you're going to get in a
 

1629

other than what you're going to get in a
regular dojo this is for

1630
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,120
regular dojo this is for
 

1631
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,470
regular dojo this is for
a situation where someone just got

1632
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,480
a situation where someone just got
 

1633
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,830
a situation where someone just got
violently all of a sudden and they want

1634
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
violently all of a sudden and they want
 

1635
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,029
violently all of a sudden and they want
to attack you and how do you deal with

1636
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039

that so
 

1639
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,029
that so
that's what we envision as a real life

1640
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
that's what we envision as a real life
 

1641
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,390
that's what we envision as a real life
scenario you know you're talking to

1642
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
scenario you know you're talking to
 

1643
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,669
scenario you know you're talking to
someone and everything seemed cool and

1644
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
someone and everything seemed cool and
 

1645
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,870
someone and everything seemed cool and
then all of a sudden they freak out and

1646
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:18,880
then all of a sudden they freak out and
 

1647
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,149
then all of a sudden they freak out and
they attack you how do you deal with

1648
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
they attack you how do you deal with
 

1649
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,110
they attack you how do you deal with
that situation

1650
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,120
that situation
 

1651
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,190
that situation
now that maya was really inhibited i

1652
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,200
now that maya was really inhibited i
 

1653
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,430
now that maya was really inhibited i
wouldn't i wouldn't start off with a box

1654
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,440
wouldn't i wouldn't start off with a box
 

1655
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,630
wouldn't i wouldn't start off with a box
this small for you guys

1656
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
this small for you guys
 

1657
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,390
this small for you guys
right so this is a really advanced box

1658
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400
right so this is a really advanced box
 

1659
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,549
right so this is a really advanced box
this box is about 10 feet by 8 feet so

1660
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559
this box is about 10 feet by 8 feet so
 

1661
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,230
this box is about 10 feet by 8 feet so
that's a tiny room that's like a little

1662
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,240
that's a tiny room that's like a little
 

1663
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,669
that's a tiny room that's like a little
bitty bedroom right so

1664
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
bitty bedroom right so
 

1665
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,750
bitty bedroom right so
so if you're in that kind of room and

1666
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:35,760
so if you're in that kind of room and
 

1667
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,269
so if you're in that kind of room and
someone starts to get hostile you should

1668
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:37,279
someone starts to get hostile you should
 

1669
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,630
someone starts to get hostile you should
just automatically know to get out of

1670
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,640
just automatically know to get out of
 

1671
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,669
just automatically know to get out of
the room because it's gonna be hard to

1672
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:39,679
the room because it's gonna be hard to
 

1673
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:40,710
the room because it's gonna be hard to
keep your distance so

1674
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
keep your distance so
 

1675
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,950
keep your distance so
if you can deal with that for 10 seconds

1676
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:42,960
if you can deal with that for 10 seconds
 

1677
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,549
if you can deal with that for 10 seconds
you're pretty skilled right so

1678
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:44,559
you're pretty skilled right so
 

1679
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,830
you're pretty skilled right so
that's you're buying yourself a lot of

1680
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:45,840
that's you're buying yourself a lot of
 

1681
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,830
that's you're buying yourself a lot of
time in a really uh compromised

1682
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
time in a really uh compromised
 

1683
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,630
time in a really uh compromised
situation

1684
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:48,640
situation
 

1685
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,149
situation
so we usually start off with the box

1686
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
so we usually start off with the box
 

1687
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,070
so we usually start off with the box
being somewhere around 20 by 20

1688
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
being somewhere around 20 by 20
 

1689
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,909
being somewhere around 20 by 20
and that's a good it's still still super

1690
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:53,919
and that's a good it's still still super
 

1691
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,110
and that's a good it's still still super
challenging at that speed

1692
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
challenging at that speed
 

1693
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,789
challenging at that speed
um if i'm working with brand new

1694
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
um if i'm working with brand new
 

1695
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,750
um if i'm working with brand new
students sometimes i'll give them the

1696
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:57,760
students sometimes i'll give them the
 

1697
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,269
students sometimes i'll give them the
whole mat and our mats like

1698
00:24:59,269 --> 00:24:59,279
whole mat and our mats like
 

1699
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,350
whole mat and our mats like
uh 40 something feet by 30 something

1700
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,360
uh 40 something feet by 30 something
 

1701
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,789
uh 40 something feet by 30 something
feet so it's a pretty big match so

1702
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:02,799
feet so it's a pretty big match so
 

1703
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,149
feet so it's a pretty big match so
i'll let them use the whole mat right to

1704
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:04,159
i'll let them use the whole mat right to
 

1705
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,830
i'll let them use the whole mat right to
get used to that but

1706
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840
get used to that but
 

1707
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,190
get used to that but
as the students become more and more

1708
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
as the students become more and more
 

1709
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,470
as the students become more and more
skilled at it you want to give them

1710
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
skilled at it you want to give them
 

1711
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,470
skilled at it you want to give them
tinier and tinier areas so that way they

1712
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:10,480
tinier and tinier areas so that way they
 

1713
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,029
tinier and tinier areas so that way they
have to learn

1714
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:11,039
have to learn
 

1715
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,870
have to learn
good taino hinko good suppression and

1716
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
good taino hinko good suppression and
 

1717
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,230
good taino hinko good suppression and
make all that work for him so

1718
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,240
make all that work for him so
 

1719
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,830
make all that work for him so
that's the progression we use that's

1720
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
that's the progression we use that's
 

1721
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,350
that's the progression we use that's
what we would call raw dory which you

1722
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,360
what we would call raw dory which you
 

1723
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,390
what we would call raw dory which you
just saw there at the end we would

1724
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
just saw there at the end we would
 

1725
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,510
just saw there at the end we would
usually do it with two attackers instead

1726
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,520
usually do it with two attackers instead
 

1727
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,950
usually do it with two attackers instead
of one but that's what we call rondori

1728
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:20,960
of one but that's what we call rondori
 

1729
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,870
of one but that's what we call rondori
and that's our skill set to build up to

1730
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
and that's our skill set to build up to
 

1731
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,070
and that's our skill set to build up to
live training

1732
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,080
live training
 

1733
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,430
live training

1735
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,870
with ikey and in aikido being about ikey
that's the main objective we want to

1736
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
that's the main objective we want to
 

1737
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,350
that's the main objective we want to
practice

1738
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,360
practice
 

1739
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,470
practice
