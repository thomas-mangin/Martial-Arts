him with your
 

65
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,550
him with your
bicep you have to wait for him to go

66
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
bicep you have to wait for him to go
 

67
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,069
bicep you have to wait for him to go
off boom that's when that follow it you

off boom that's when that follow it you
 

69
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,510
off boom that's when that follow it you
start making that more seamless

70
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
start making that more seamless
 

71
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,149
start making that more seamless

boom second thing is the up angle when
 

79
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,710
boom second thing is the up angle when
you first hit CU right now his

80
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
you first hit CU right now his
 

81
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,830
you first hit CU right now his
body his body weight is going to create

82
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:28,840
body his body weight is going to create
 

83
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,270

opposing forces to my thrust it's going

84
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
opposing forces to my thrust it's going
 

85
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,430
opposing forces to my thrust it's going
to make more Y at that CHP don't hit him

86
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,440
to make more Y at that CHP don't hit him
 

87
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,990
to make more Y at that CHP don't hit him
where it's just going to displace him

88
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
where it's just going to displace him
 

89
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,990
where it's just going to displace him
pull against the inertia that he's

90
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
pull against the inertia that he's
 

91
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,149
pull against the inertia that he's
standing on so this hand goes this way

92
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:43,159
standing on so this hand goes this way
 

93
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,110
standing on so this hand goes this way
you

94
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
you
 

95
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,509
you
see so it goes around doesn't go

96
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:48,519
see so it goes around doesn't go
 

97
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:50,949
see so it goes around doesn't go
straight in you don't want it to go

98
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
straight in you don't want it to go
 

99
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,270
straight in you don't want it to go
straight in but make that full

100
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,280
straight in but make that full
 

101
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:04,350
straight in but make that full
circle it's going up boom

102
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:04,360

 

103
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,350

okay try slow

104
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:06,360
okay try slow
 

105
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,350
okay try slow
like hey so I'm going to go up watch his

106
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
like hey so I'm going to go up watch his
 

107
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,789
like hey so I'm going to go up watch his
weight goes up goes past his heels you

108
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:13,799
weight goes up goes past his heels you
 

109
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,949
weight goes up goes past his heels you
see now if you keep going up he's going

110
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:15,959
see now if you keep going up he's going
 

111
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:16,990
see now if you keep going up he's going
off the

112
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,000
off the
 

113
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,589
off the
Joe just like he he'd be going off the

114
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
Joe just like he he'd be going off the
 

115
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,710
Joe just like he he'd be going off the
Joe here once you push laterally it goes

116
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
Joe here once you push laterally it goes
 

117
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,589
Joe here once you push laterally it goes
off the Joe because he's able to do that

118
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
off the Joe because he's able to do that
 

119
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,869
off the Joe because he's able to do that
so when I go like this I start to work

120
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
so when I go like this I start to work
 

121
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,789
so when I go like this I start to work
with his ret in energy so I

122
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
with his ret in energy so I
 

123
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,830
with his ret in energy so I
hit here and then take advantage of

124
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:36,840
hit here and then take advantage of
 

125
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,710
hit here and then take advantage of
those heels when they're when he steps

126
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:39,720
those heels when they're when he steps
 

127
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,670
those heels when they're when he steps
and I try to get back over them again

128
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
and I try to get back over them again
 

129
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,869
and I try to get back over them again
when I get back over them there's more

130
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:43,879
when I get back over them there's more
 

131
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:47,070
when I get back over them there's more
resistance on that's feeding my weapon

132
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,080
resistance on that's feeding my weapon
 

133
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,350
resistance on that's feeding my weapon
so it's

134
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:48,360
so it's
 

135
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,750
so it's
going up

136
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
going up
 

137
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,470
going up
boom you guys see that okay so don't go

138
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
boom you guys see that okay so don't go
 

139
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,429
boom you guys see that okay so don't go
up in that's I lost energy okay and

140
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
up in that's I lost energy okay and
 

141
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,630
up in that's I lost energy okay and
don't stay

142
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:03,640
don't stay
 

143
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,350
don't stay
up it goes

144
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:06,360
up it goes
 

145
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,589
up it goes
up

146
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:10,599

down up down okay all right okay so um
 

149
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,990
down up down okay all right okay so um
what you're trying to do is like yes I

150
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000
what you're trying to do is like yes I
 

151
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,230
what you're trying to do is like yes I
have a lever but I want that lever

152
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,240
have a lever but I want that lever
 

153
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,310
have a lever but I want that lever
connected to my

154
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:25,320
connected to my
 

155
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,590
connected to my
mass the bulk of my mass so if I

156
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:30,600
mass the bulk of my mass so if I
 

157
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,790
mass the bulk of my mass so if I
hit this and I bounce

158
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
hit this and I bounce
 

159
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,830
hit this and I bounce
off or I hit it and I absorb it in the

160
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:36,840
off or I hit it and I absorb it in the
 

161
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,110
off or I hit it and I absorb it in the
elbow there's going to be less energy in

162
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,120
elbow there's going to be less energy in
 

163
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,350
elbow there's going to be less energy in
here you get it I'm say okay and if I

164
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
here you get it I'm say okay and if I
 

165
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,990
here you get it I'm say okay and if I
just use my

166
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,000
just use my
 

167
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,590
just use my
arm there's less energy because there's

168
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
arm there's less energy because there's
 

169
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,230
arm there's less energy because there's
less Mass right okay so all all I'm

170
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,240
less Mass right okay so all all I'm
 

171
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:04,070
less Mass right okay so all all I'm
doing isting with my body

172
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080

 

173
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,990

step don't want to come here cuz that's

174
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
step don't want to come here cuz that's
 

175
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,469
step don't want to come here cuz that's
arms you

176
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
arms you
 

177
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,110
arms you
see I don't want

178
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
see I don't want
 

179
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,430
see I don't want
to do

180
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
to do
 

181
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:25,029
to do
that it stays with my

182
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039

 

183
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,270

M can add claw

184
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,280

 

185
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:38,270

but it's after you initial impact

186
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:38,280

 

187
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:52,350

boom

188
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:52,360

 

189
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,189

no that's idea all right so if I go like

190
00:05:58,189 --> 00:05:58,199

 

191
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,590

this then I got to use my arm my arm

192
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
this then I got to use my arm my arm
 

193
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,629
this then I got to use my arm my arm
strength to get that in

194
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
strength to get that in
 

195
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,749
strength to get that in
place that's a k to

196
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:10,759

 

197
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,309

this there's less power there so push

198
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:15,319
this there's less power there so push
 

199
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,110
this there's less power there so push
push all my Jo you can use your hands I

200
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
push all my Jo you can use your hands I
 

201
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,629
push all my Jo you can use your hands I
don't care where you use your hands and

202
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
don't care where you use your hands and
 

203
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,710
don't care where you use your hands and
your body

204
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:21,720
your body
 

205
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,550
your body
okay this would be like how much

206
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
okay this would be like how much
 

207
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,070
okay this would be like how much
resistance is the target to what I'm

208
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,080
resistance is the target to what I'm
 

209
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,070
resistance is the target to what I'm
doing okay so don't let me move you you

210
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,080
doing okay so don't let me move you you
 

211
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,029
doing okay so don't let me move you you
could get a base get your

212
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
could get a base get your
 

213
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,230
could get a base get your
strongest you

214
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:35,240
strongest you
 

215
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,629
strongest you
see I can't I can't do it well

216
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:39,639
see I can't I can't do it well
 

217
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,670
see I can't I can't do it well
inversely right if you were a big Target

218
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:42,680
inversely right if you were a big Target
 

219
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,070
inversely right if you were a big Target
you waited a lot that energy is not

220
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,080
you waited a lot that energy is not
 

221
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,550
you waited a lot that energy is not
going to go into you it's going to come

222
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
going to go into you it's going to come
 

223
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,749
going to go into you it's going to come
back into me okay got it

224
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:50,759
back into me okay got it
 

225
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,469
back into me okay got it
but you can hold it and instead of using

my little
 

229
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,909
my little
bicep I put it here you see and I'm

230
00:06:58,909 --> 00:06:58,919
bicep I put it here you see and I'm
 

231
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:05,070
bicep I put it here you see and I'm
moving my body you can resist okay

232
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,080

 

233
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,270

resist you can say that the upward

234
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
resist you can say that the upward
 

235
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,070

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,390
angle right is taking
advantage that eventually I'm going to

238
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400

into it okay so I'm just here and I'm
just using my glutes my legs my quad and

250
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
just using my glutes my legs my quad and
 

251
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,749
just using my glutes my legs my quad and
my momentum which we don't even have

doing that don't want my fish loose in

448
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
doing that don't want my fish loose in
 

449
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,430
doing that don't want my fish loose in
this kind of stuff okay when being

450
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
this kind of stuff okay when being
 

451
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,230
this kind of stuff okay when being
separated from my

452
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:51,240
separated from my
 

453
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,310
separated from my
mouth all right so if you follow the

454
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
mouth all right so if you follow the
 

455
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,990
mouth all right so if you follow the
right hand and you're trying to hit him

456
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,000
right hand and you're trying to hit him
 

457
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,590
right hand and you're trying to hit him
with your right hand you're going to

458
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600
with your right hand you're going to
 

459
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,509
with your right hand you're going to
want to bring the right hip in you see

460
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
want to bring the right hip in you see
 

461
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,310
want to bring the right hip in you see
now you brought the qual back and now

462
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
now you brought the qual back and now
 

463
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,910
now you brought the qual back and now
you have that problem again

464
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:08,920
you have that problem again
 

465
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,710
you have that problem again
so again we're inversely looking at the

466
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
so again we're inversely looking at the
 

467
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,990
so again we're inversely looking at the
equal and opposite reaction he pushes on

468
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
equal and opposite reaction he pushes on
 

469
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,710
equal and opposite reaction he pushes on
me he's going to move me

470
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:21,720
me he's going to move me
 

471
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,749
me he's going to move me
okay and that would inversely be well I

472
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:25,759
okay and that would inversely be well I
 

473
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,110
okay and that would inversely be well I
can't put much force into the power

474
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,120
can't put much force into the power
 

475
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,069
can't put much force into the power
hence that's why can't stop in okay I

476
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,079
hence that's why can't stop in okay I
 

477
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,470
hence that's why can't stop in okay I
want to turn it this way I'm in this

478
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
want to turn it this way I'm in this
 

479
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,150
want to turn it this way I'm in this
angle this is where I am

480
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
angle this is where I am
 

481
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,990
angle this is where I am
okay over

482
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
okay over
 

483
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,870
okay over
here not over here look at my shoulders

484
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:45,880
here not over here look at my shoulders
 

485
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,430
here not over here look at my shoulders
look at my hips I mean this angle okay

486
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:50,440
look at my hips I mean this angle okay
 

487
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,389
look at my hips I mean this angle okay
so when he pushes on this

488
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:54,399

 

489
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,749

angle we're not going

490
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:56,759
angle we're not going
 

491
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,550
angle we're not going
anywhere okay got it

492
00:14:59,550 --> 00:14:59,560
anywhere okay got it
 

493
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,110
