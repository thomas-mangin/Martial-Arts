153
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,949

because it doesn't work then

154
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
because it doesn't work then
 

155

because it doesn't work then
then you've got to work out what you're

156
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:44,580
then you've got to work out what you're
 

157
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,270
then you've got to work out what you're
doing wrong in the in the technique

158
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
doing wrong in the in the technique
 

159
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,970
doing wrong in the in the technique
the technique hasn't started from that

160

the technique hasn't started from that
 

161
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,270
the technique hasn't started from that
point that's just the blending so the

162
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
point that's just the blending so the
 

163
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,089
point that's just the blending so the
claiming is that

164
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:56,099
claiming is that
 

165
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,030
claiming is that
so at the blending dry you can perhaps

166
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
so at the blending dry you can perhaps
 

167
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,729
so at the blending dry you can perhaps
get lots of techniques you can make them

168
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:01,739
