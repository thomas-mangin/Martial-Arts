00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,120
so this is where the weapons comes in if
 

103
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,990
so this is where the weapons comes in if
I do this this is an advanced practice

104
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
I do this this is an advanced practice
 

105
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,229
I do this this is an advanced practice
because we're tied together and we're

106
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
because we're tied together and we're
 

107
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,110
because we're tied together and we're
doing it as a muui not as a weapons Bas

108
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,120
doing it as a muui not as a weapons Bas
 

109
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,869
doing it as a muui not as a weapons Bas
it all right so this is where you'll see

110
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:55,879
it all right so this is where you'll see
 

111
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,509
it all right so this is where you'll see
the variations when cyto sensor used to

112
00:02:58,509 --> 00:02:58,519
the variations when cyto sensor used to
 

113
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,790
the variations when cyto sensor used to
do this is because he's tied together

114
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
do this is because he's tied together
 

115
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,470
do this is because he's tied together
with this person's spirit and then you

116
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,480
with this person's spirit and then you
 

117
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,430
with this person's spirit and then you
go into the higher levels of

118
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
go into the higher levels of
 

119
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,070
go into the higher levels of
understanding so for basic you cover the

120
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
understanding so for basic you cover the
 

121
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,270
understanding so for basic you cover the
wrist again about uh 7 to 10

122
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,280
wrist again about uh 7 to 10
 

123
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,309
wrist again about uh 7 to 10
cm you lift it off slightly to his

124
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
cm you lift it off slightly to his
 

125
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,350
cm you lift it off slightly to his
elbow it's it can be like a flick but

126
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
elbow it's it can be like a flick but

from this a lot

150
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440

 

151
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:36,110

of one two like that and they Stu

152
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,120
