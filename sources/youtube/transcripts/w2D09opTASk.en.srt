00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,010
right you see that and it's on one side
 

201
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,840
right you see that and it's on one side
of another axis of my spine then you

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:15,850
of another axis of my spine then you
 

203
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,070
of another axis of my spine then you
lose a lot of power in that okay so I

204
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
lose a lot of power in that okay so I
 

205
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,200
lose a lot of power in that okay so I
got a pretty much one well then where's

264
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,000
feel the pressure here and now I can
 

265
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,750
feel the pressure here and now I can
move without releasing that I take that

266
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:06,760
move without releasing that I take that
 

267
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,430

okay so all right what I doing here are

322
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:07,089
okay so all right what I doing here are

I want you to see that you can hold it
 

341
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,990
I want you to see that you can hold it
because you're holding you're holding

because you're holding you're holding
this thing and then next drill is hey

344
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:40,269
this thing and then next drill is hey
 

345
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:42,059
this thing and then next drill is hey
see if you can move this some of you

346
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:42,069
see if you can move this some of you
 

347
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:44,790
see if you can move this some of you
start moving and you go like this okay

348
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
start moving and you go like this okay
 

349
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,720
start moving and you go like this okay
so I'm here I hold it and just as I can

350
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:48,730
so I'm here I hold it and just as I can
 

351
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,809
so I'm here I hold it and just as I can
hold it when I'm doing this right you

352
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:51,819
hold it when I'm doing this right you
 

353
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,049
hold it when I'm doing this right you
can hold it with your legs doing

354
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:55,059
can hold it with your legs doing
 

355
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:58,530
can hold it with your legs doing
different things okay then then why

356
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:58,540
different things okay then then why
 

357
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,650
different things okay then then why
can't this are be just a street this

358
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:01,660
can't this are be just a street this
 

359
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,950
can't this are be just a street this
arms can be distance free

360
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:03,960
arms can be distance free
 

361
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,640
arms can be distance free
and and yes even up extreme angles it's

362
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:07,650
and and yes even up extreme angles it's
 

363
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:12,980
and and yes even up extreme angles it's
still holding here okay so same thing

364
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:12,990
still holding here okay so same thing
 

365
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,600
still holding here okay so same thing
with movement when I start to move I

366
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:16,610
with movement when I start to move I
 

367
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,870
with movement when I start to move I
don't lose it I don't lose them here I'm

368
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
don't lose it I don't lose them here I'm
 

369
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:34,840
don't lose it I don't lose them here I'm
holding that full is this free holding

370
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:34,850
holding that full is this free holding
 

371
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,360
holding that full is this free holding
hold even when you feel it again that's

372
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,370
hold even when you feel it again that's
 

373
00:11:38,370 --> 00:12:05,760
hold even when you feel it again that's
not for you to take it off hold

374
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:05,770

 

375
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,330

shoulder mechanism becomes separated and
 

381
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,340
shoulder mechanism becomes separated and
then you try to tell yourself to relax

382
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,350
then you try to tell yourself to relax
 

383
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,350
then you try to tell yourself to relax
when you put your mind where it's biting

a beginner trick is work with your

392
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
a beginner trick is work with your
 

393
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,640
a beginner trick is work with your
scapula so when you feel the shoulder

394
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:32,650
scapula so when you feel the shoulder
 

395
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,040
scapula so when you feel the shoulder
mechanism start to separate pull the

396
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,050
mechanism start to separate pull the
 

397
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:41,010
mechanism start to separate pull the
scapula down right imagine that this

398
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,020
scapula down right imagine that this
 

399
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,190
scapula down right imagine that this
triangle bony has right here that

down a weighted ball when you feel it
pull it down and that's what you're
