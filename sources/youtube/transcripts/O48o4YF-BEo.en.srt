up and lose organization
 

81
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,709
up and lose organization
so you keep the same organization so

so you keep the same organization so

boom he's moving up
 

93
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,910
boom he's moving up
and i let mine move

94
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
and i let mine move
 

95
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,790
and i let mine move
he's moving his and i let my move but

96
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
he's moving his and i let my move but
 

97
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,869
he's moving his and i let my move but
we're both keeping them

00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
okay
 

101
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,150
okay
let's try it

102
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
let's try it
 

103
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,070
let's try it
okay so we'll continue on

104
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
okay so we'll continue on

so

110
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080

 

111
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,790

so there's centrifugal energy going

112
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
so there's centrifugal energy going
 

113
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,110

outward you see

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,670
outward you see
so that means i can generate an ik

116
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680

i use it

140
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
i use it
 

141
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,390
i use it
to make a smaller circle inside okay

142
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
to make a smaller circle inside okay
 

143
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,949
to make a smaller circle inside okay
so you still need an x-pattern in order

144
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
so you still need an x-pattern in order
 

145
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,509
so you still need an x-pattern in order
to generate the kazushi okay but this is

146
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
to generate the kazushi okay but this is
 

147
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,670
to generate the kazushi okay but this is
a way of getting the x pattern by using

148
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
a way of getting the x pattern by using
 

149
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,670
a way of getting the x pattern by using
a smaller circle inside the larger

150
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
a smaller circle inside the larger
 

151
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,309
a smaller circle inside the larger
circle okay it does generate these

152
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
circle okay it does generate these
 

153
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,990

154
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000

155
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,110

all right so the larger circle is the

156
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
all right so the larger circle is the
 

157
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,830
all right so the larger circle is the
arm circle the arm circle's keeping you

158
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
arm circle the arm circle's keeping you
 

159
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,790
arm circle the arm circle's keeping you
going

160
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
going
 

161
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,990
going
okay and the arm circle is in his center

162
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
okay and the arm circle is in his center
 

163
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,749
okay and the arm circle is in his center
so the arm circles in the center

164
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
so the arm circles in the center
 

165
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,590
so the arm circles in the center
it's not in his arm as you're moving

166
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
it's not in his arm as you're moving
 

167
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,430
it's not in his arm as you're moving
you're cutting his arm down

168
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
you're cutting his arm down
 

169
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,629
you're cutting his arm down
okay

170
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
okay
 

171
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,469
okay
so you keep you got to keep the arm

172
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
so you keep you got to keep the arm
 

173
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,150
so you keep you got to keep the arm
circle going

174

175
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,870

176
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880

177
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,430
and then as he comes to the other half
this circle is going to be a tiny circle

178
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
this circle is going to be a tiny circle
 

179
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,110
this circle is going to be a tiny circle
okay

180
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
okay
 

181
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,629
okay
because it's not the two of them going

182
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
because it's not the two of them going
 

183
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,150
because it's not the two of them going
together it's not they're not the same

184
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
together it's not they're not the same
 

185
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,430
together it's not they're not the same
size

186
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
size
 

187
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,230
size
and centrifugal energy

188
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
and centrifugal energy
 

189
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,390
and centrifugal energy
does it

190
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
does it
 

191
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,230
does it
he said he was the athletic enough he

192
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
he said he was the athletic enough he
 

193
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,710
he said he was the athletic enough he
could turn he could run out of that okay

194
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
could turn he could run out of that okay
 

195
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,710
could turn he could run out of that okay
so

196
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
so
 

197
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,390
so
whoa

198
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400

 

199
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,950

it's very tight okay

200
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
it's very tight okay
 

201
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,629
it's very tight okay
so i'm trying to break it down so you

202
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
so i'm trying to break it down so you
 

203
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,629
so i'm trying to break it down so you
can see it more so there's the big

204
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
can see it more so there's the big
 

205
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,790
can see it more so there's the big
circle

206
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
circle
 

207
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,629
circle
big circle

208
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
big circle
 

209
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,029
big circle
small

210
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039

 

211
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,749

oh small

212
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759

 

213
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,230

okay so try to have

214
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
okay so try to have
 

215
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,590
okay so try to have
more complementary angles as opposed to

216
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
more complementary angles as opposed to
 

217
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,960
more complementary angles as opposed to
duplicating angles okay
