So try to understand like um you need
 

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,790
So try to understand like um you need
confirmation exercises. Okay.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
confirmation exercises. Okay.
 

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,830
confirmation exercises. Okay.
Um a lot of what we do are confirmation

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
Um a lot of what we do are confirmation
 

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,950
Um a lot of what we do are confirmation
exercises. So this is uh within the cook

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
exercises. So this is uh within the cook
 

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,709
exercises. So this is uh within the cook
cultivation set there each one that

12
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
cultivation set there each one that
 

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,270
cultivation set there each one that
follows is a confirmation exercise for

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
follows is a confirmation exercise for
 

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,549
follows is a confirmation exercise for
the one that preceded it. Okay. And this

16
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:38,559
the one that preceded it. Okay. And this
 

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,950
the one that preceded it. Okay. And this
variation on the set is a confirmation

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
variation on the set is a confirmation
 

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,869
variation on the set is a confirmation
for the that whole set. So um but this

20
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
for the that whole set. So um but this
 

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,869
for the that whole set. So um but this
is going to really help you Sean and

22
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
is going to really help you Sean and
 

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,950
is going to really help you Sean and
Bouching and then fine-tune the other

24
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
Bouching and then fine-tune the other
 

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,069
Bouching and then fine-tune the other
people. Okay. Um, it deals with the

26
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
people. Okay. Um, it deals with the
 

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,229
people. Okay. Um, it deals with the
segmentation that we were having

28
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
segmentation that we were having
 

29
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,029
segmentation that we were having
problems with yesterday on the jok or

30
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,039
problems with yesterday on the jok or
 

31
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,670
problems with yesterday on the jok or
even on the um um the throw that we were

32
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
even on the um um the throw that we were
 

33
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,070
even on the um um the throw that we were
doing. Okay. So, this one is not going

34
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
doing. Okay. So, this one is not going
 

35
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,149
doing. Okay. So, this one is not going
to be in the in the arm. So, I am on the

36
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
to be in the in the arm. So, I am on the
 

37
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:23,590
to be in the in the arm. So, I am on the
back foot and I am doing the same drill.

38
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600

 

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,630

Same thing. Let go really fast and I

40
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
Same thing. Let go really fast and I
 

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,149
Same thing. Let go really fast and I
won't go flying forward. Okay. What we

42
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
won't go flying forward. Okay. What we
 

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,670
won't go flying forward. Okay. What we
might tend to see is this rotation.

44
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
might tend to see is this rotation.
 

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,390
might tend to see is this rotation.
Okay. Or this hinge. So the either I'm

46
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
Okay. Or this hinge. So the either I'm
 

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,230
Okay. Or this hinge. So the either I'm
rotating around the the spine this way

48
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
rotating around the the spine this way
 

49
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,550
rotating around the the spine this way
or the top hinge on the quad is not

50
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
or the top hinge on the quad is not
 

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,510
or the top hinge on the quad is not
being organized. Okay. All right. So

52
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
being organized. Okay. All right. So
 

53
00:01:51,520 --> 00:02:13,270
being organized. Okay. All right. So
let's try it.

54
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280

 

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,949

You're still pushing. You're still

56
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
You're still pushing. You're still
 

57
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,390
You're still pushing. You're still
pushing as hard as you if you if you

58
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
pushing as hard as you if you if you
 

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,630
pushing as hard as you if you if you
push light, you're not going to get the

60
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
push light, you're not going to get the
 

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,949
push light, you're not going to get the
discovery you need. Okay?

62
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959

 

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,790

It's just like the punching yesterday.

64
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
It's just like the punching yesterday.
 

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,030
It's just like the punching yesterday.
It was too light for your guys' level of

66
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
It was too light for your guys' level of
 

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,750
It was too light for your guys' level of
sensitivity.

68
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
sensitivity.
 

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,910
sensitivity.
So, we're seeing the top the top hinge

70
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
So, we're seeing the top the top hinge
 

71
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,630
So, we're seeing the top the top hinge
is weak. But sometimes you come

72
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
is weak. But sometimes you come
 

73
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,710
is weak. But sometimes you come
sometimes you you show up here and

74
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
sometimes you you show up here and
 

75

doing. Okay. You you have to put your
yong aspect has to start on the on the

82
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
yong aspect has to start on the on the
 

83
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,830
yong aspect has to start on the on the
midfoot. It's not that I'm I'm over

84
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
midfoot. It's not that I'm I'm over
 

85

my body has to be on the midfoot. Now
 

93
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,430
my body has to be on the midfoot. Now
that doesn't mean be upright cuz that's

177
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,430

Watch the rotational weakness, James.

178
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
Watch the rotational weakness, James.
 

179
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,950
Watch the rotational weakness, James.
The top hinge is fine, but the

180
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
The top hinge is fine, but the
 

181
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,990
The top hinge is fine, but the
rotational weakness is not there. The

182
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
rotational weakness is not there. The
 

183
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,070
rotational weakness is not there. The
rotational organization is not there.

184
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080

 

185
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,390

you look like you look like you put your

208
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
you look like you look like you put your
 

209
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,230
you look like you look like you put your
cozies on. Do you know what I mean? Like

210
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
cozies on. Do you know what I mean? Like
 

211
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,870
cozies on. Do you know what I mean? Like
little kids. Okay. So, and we started

212
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
little kids. Okay. So, and we started
 

213
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,790
little kids. Okay. So, and we started
using the words release. You're just

214
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
using the words release. You're just
 

215
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,629
using the words release. You're just
releasing inside, which has nothing to

216
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
releasing inside, which has nothing to
 

217
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,950
releasing inside, which has nothing to
do with the outside. Okay. So, the same

218
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
do with the outside. Okay. So, the same
 

219
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,430
do with the outside. Okay. So, the same
thing is happening to you here. You're

220
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
thing is happening to you here. You're
 

221
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,309
thing is happening to you here. You're
trying to relax, but you're letting them

222
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
trying to relax, but you're letting them
 

223
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,710
trying to relax, but you're letting them
push you back. Do do you get that? So

224
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
push you back. Do do you get that? So
 

225
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,749
push you back. Do do you get that? So
you you could be here. I could I could

226
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
you you could be here. I could I could
 

227
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,629
you you could be here. I could I could
position here and do the same releasing

228
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
position here and do the same releasing
 

229
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,790
position here and do the same releasing
because it doesn't matter in into the

230
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
because it doesn't matter in into the
 

231
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,790
because it doesn't matter in into the
form. Do you understand? Do you get

232
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
form. Do you understand? Do you get
 

233
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,230
form. Do you understand? Do you get
that? Okay. So, but I'm trying to set

234
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
that? Okay. So, but I'm trying to set
 

235
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,589
that? Okay. So, but I'm trying to set
you up for success. So, I want you here,

236
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
you up for success. So, I want you here,
 

237
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,870
you up for success. So, I want you here,
but I don't want you push. I don't want

238
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
but I don't want you push. I don't want
 

239
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,110
but I don't want you push. I don't want
you doing that. Do you see that? Okay,

240
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
you doing that. Do you see that? Okay,
 

241
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,270
you doing that. Do you see that? Okay,
that's you're that's not that's the

242
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
that's you're that's not that's the
 

243
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,430
that's you're that's not that's the
difference between

244
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
difference between
 

245
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,670
difference between
being organized. We got to draw these

246
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
being organized. We got to draw these
 

247
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,909
being organized. We got to draw these
distinctions. It's organized. That's

248
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
distinctions. It's organized. That's
 

249
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,909
distinctions. It's organized. That's
what we want. A particular way. Um

250
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
what we want. A particular way. Um
 

251
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,309
what we want. A particular way. Um
we don't want to be relaxed. Do do you

252
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
we don't want to be relaxed. Do do you
 

253
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,110
we don't want to be relaxed. Do do you
see that? Okay. Because releasing is not

254
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
see that? Okay. Because releasing is not
 

255
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,869
see that? Okay. Because releasing is not
about necessarily relaxing.

256
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
about necessarily relaxing.
 

257
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,830
about necessarily relaxing.
Releasing doesn't have a shape to it.

258
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
Releasing doesn't have a shape to it.
 

259
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:24,629
Releasing doesn't have a shape to it.
Okay. All right. Try it again.

260
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639

 

261
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,710

Take dip your chin.

262
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720

 

263
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,750

Top top qua

264
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760

 

265
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,990

watch your eyes

266
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
watch your eyes
 

267
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,790
watch your eyes
your eyes. Don't look down.

268
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800

 

269
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:59,750

Top qua.

270
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760

 

271
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:07,990

Top qua

272
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000

 

273
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,190

chest up.

274
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200

 

275
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,710

Okay.

276
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720

 

277
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,990

So, remember that I said on this drill,

278
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
So, remember that I said on this drill,
 

279
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,870
So, remember that I said on this drill,
the

280
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
the
 

281
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,350
the
the metric you want isn't that you

282
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
the metric you want isn't that you
 

283
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,550
the metric you want isn't that you
didn't move backwards.

284
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
didn't move backwards.
 

285
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,990
didn't move backwards.
The metric that you want is under the

286
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
The metric that you want is under the
 

287
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,190
The metric that you want is under the
pressure you released.

288
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200

 

289
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,110

Do you got it? Okay. Now, the problem is

290
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
Do you got it? Okay. Now, the problem is
 

291
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,470
Do you got it? Okay. Now, the problem is
I don't know what release is. I don't

292
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
I don't know what release is. I don't
 

293
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,750
I don't know what release is. I don't
know what it feels like. So that's

294
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
know what it feels like. So that's
 

295
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,269
know what it feels like. So that's
that's why we're here and that's why you

296
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
that's why we're here and that's why you
 

297
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,590
that's why we're here and that's why you
have to spend so much time all that kind

298
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
have to spend so much time all that kind
 

299
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,750
have to spend so much time all that kind
of stuff. Okay. But for you,

300
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
of stuff. Okay. But for you,
 

301
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,150
of stuff. Okay. But for you,
you know what release feels like and you

302
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
you know what release feels like and you
 

303
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,230
you know what release feels like and you
have just have to make that your goal.

304
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
have just have to make that your goal.
 

305
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,870
have just have to make that your goal.
Okay. So when you're here like that,

306
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
Okay. So when you're here like that,
 

307
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,430
Okay. So when you're here like that,
let's say you're you are going oh okay I

308
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
let's say you're you are going oh okay I
 

309
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,150
let's say you're you are going oh okay I
oh I I tense. Do you understand? So when

310
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
oh I I tense. Do you understand? So when
 

311
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,949
oh I I tense. Do you understand? So when
you get here and you're not moving, you

312
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
you get here and you're not moving, you
 

313
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,269
you get here and you're not moving, you
release. You feel that difference? So

314
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
release. You feel that difference? So
 

315
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,790
release. You feel that difference? So
that when that way I'm not here and then

316
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
that when that way I'm not here and then
 

317
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,790
that when that way I'm not here and then
you let go and I go flying forward.

318
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
you let go and I go flying forward.
 

319
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,790
you let go and I go flying forward.
Maybe I had to uh organize. Do you know

320
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
Maybe I had to uh organize. Do you know
 

321
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,910
Maybe I had to uh organize. Do you know

you get that?
 

489
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,510
you get that?
Um, this is all accurate. When we start

490
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
Um, this is all accurate. When we start
 

491
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,350
Um, this is all accurate. When we start
talking about today, I'm not able to

492
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
talking about today, I'm not able to
 

493
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,669
talking about today, I'm not able to
organize. This is not accurate. I can't

494
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
organize. This is not accurate. I can't
 

495
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,270
organize. This is not accurate. I can't
do anything with that. I can't move

496
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,280
do anything with that. I can't move
 

497
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,909
do anything with that. I can't move
forward from inaccurate information.

498
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
forward from inaccurate information.
 

499
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,669
forward from inaccurate information.
Okay. Um again, if you look at the

500
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
Okay. Um again, if you look at the
 

501
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,510
Okay. Um again, if you look at the
statement when I said before, I go this

502
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
statement when I said before, I go this
 

503
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,590
statement when I said before, I go this
is going to be particularly insightful

504
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
is going to be particularly insightful
 

505
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,069
is going to be particularly insightful
and beneficial for you and for Sean

506
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
and beneficial for you and for Sean
 

507
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,630
and beneficial for you and for Sean
because you guys don't have this yet

508
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
because you guys don't have this yet
 

509
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,390
because you guys don't have this yet
even at the hands. Okay. Um

510
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
even at the hands. Okay. Um
 

511
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,590
even at the hands. Okay. Um
again, how did I know that prior to the

512
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,600
again, how did I know that prior to the
 

513
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,310
again, how did I know that prior to the
drill? because I can see it in the other

514
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,320
drill? because I can see it in the other
 

515
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,029
drill? because I can see it in the other
drill. Okay,

516
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
drill. Okay,
 

517
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,750
drill. Okay,
same thing again. Another example. How

518
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:43,760
same thing again. Another example. How
 

519
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,669
same thing again. Another example. How
did I know if I just lightly press more

520
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
did I know if I just lightly press more
 

521
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,789
did I know if I just lightly press more
than you, the rotational compromisation

522
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
than you, the rotational compromisation
 

523
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,870
than you, the rotational compromisation
would occur? Do you see? I'm not

524
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:52,880
would occur? Do you see? I'm not
 

525
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,990
would occur? Do you see? I'm not
guessing. I can see it. Okay, which

526
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,000
guessing. I can see it. Okay, which
 

527
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,390
guessing. I can see it. Okay, which
means it's there. All right. Um

528
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400

 

529
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,110

and we we're when you have a

530
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
and we we're when you have a
 

531
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,590
and we we're when you have a
confirmation drill,

532
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,600
confirmation drill,
 

533
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,190
confirmation drill,
a confirmation drill

534
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200

 

535
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,430

is of such a nature that cultivation

536
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
is of such a nature that cultivation
 

537
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,110
is of such a nature that cultivation
might not be possible in that drill. Do

538
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
might not be possible in that drill. Do
 

539
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,150
might not be possible in that drill. Do
do you get it? It's just too difficult.

540
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
do you get it? It's just too difficult.
 

541
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,590
do you get it? It's just too difficult.
Um,

542
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600

 

543
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,510

and you have to go back to the other

544
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
and you have to go back to the other
 

545
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,789
and you have to go back to the other
drill with the awareness from the other

546
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
drill with the awareness from the other
 

547
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,029
drill with the awareness from the other
confirmation drill. You can't sit here

548
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
confirmation drill. You can't sit here
 

549
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,150
confirmation drill. You can't sit here
and go, I'm just going to practice this

550
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
and go, I'm just going to practice this
 

551
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,470
and go, I'm just going to practice this
more. You It's too difficult. You're not

552
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
more. You It's too difficult. You're not
 

553
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,110
more. You It's too difficult. You're not
You're not going to get it. Okay. It it

554
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
You're not going to get it. Okay. It it
 

555
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,510
You're not going to get it. Okay. It it
would be it would be like for example

556
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
would be it would be like for example
 

557
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,270
would be it would be like for example
with Tristan

558
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
with Tristan
 

559
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,110
with Tristan
um you know when he f when I was first

560
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120
um you know when he f when I was first
 

561
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,230
um you know when he f when I was first
teaching him to shoot he wanted to learn

562
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
teaching him to shoot he wanted to learn
 

563
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,950
teaching him to shoot he wanted to learn
three-pointers and I said dude you can't

564
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
three-pointers and I said dude you can't
 

565
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,110
three-pointers and I said dude you can't
shoot from four feet off we're not going

566
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
shoot from four feet off we're not going
 

567
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,029
shoot from four feet off we're not going
to do three-pointers we'll learn the

568
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
to do three-pointers we'll learn the
 

569
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,510
to do three-pointers we'll learn the
mechanics up close do do you see um and

570
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,520
mechanics up close do do you see um and
 

571
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,029
mechanics up close do do you see um and
uh

572
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:05,039
uh
 

573
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,150
uh
and now he now he can sink the three. So

574
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
and now he now he can sink the three. So
 

575
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,310
and now he now he can sink the three. So
you you can't there there's just too

576
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
you you can't there there's just too
 

577
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,750
you you can't there there's just too
much human variation and and deviation

578
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
much human variation and and deviation
 

579
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,390
much human variation and and deviation
that occurs as the as the thing is more

580
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,400
that occurs as the as the thing is more
 

581
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,190
that occurs as the as the thing is more
difficult. No different again like you

582
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
difficult. No different again like you
 

583
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,270
difficult. No different again like you
want to you want to shoot and be

584
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
want to you want to shoot and be
 

585
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,470
want to you want to shoot and be
accurate at 25 yards. The new the new

586
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
accurate at 25 yards. The new the new
 

587
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,470
accurate at 25 yards. The new the new
recruits always think I need more

588
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
recruits always think I need more
 

589
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,350
recruits always think I need more
practice at 25 yards. There's too it's

590
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360
practice at 25 yards. There's too it's
 

591
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,430
practice at 25 yards. There's too it's
too difficult there. the variables are

592
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
too difficult there. the variables are
 

593
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,390
too difficult there. the variables are
too too um too numerous for us to fix

594
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
too too um too numerous for us to fix
 

595
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,029
too too um too numerous for us to fix
the mistakes. Let's hit at let's

596
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
the mistakes. Let's hit at let's
 

597
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,590
the mistakes. Let's hit at let's
practice at three yards. Do you see? If

598
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
practice at three yards. Do you see? If
 

599
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,190
practice at three yards. Do you see? If
you can put bullet holes and bullet

600
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200
you can put bullet holes and bullet
 

601
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,350
you can put bullet holes and bullet
holes at three yards, then you're going

602
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,360
holes at three yards, then you're going
 

603
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,510
holes at three yards, then you're going
to hit the 25 yard. Do you see that? Um

604
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
to hit the 25 yard. Do you see that? Um
 

605
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,350
to hit the 25 yard. Do you see that? Um
so same thing here. This is too

606
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
so same thing here. This is too
 

607
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,150
so same thing here. This is too
difficult a cultivation field, but it

608
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
difficult a cultivation field, but it
 

609
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,789
difficult a cultivation field, but it
does function as a confirmation field.

610
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:56,799
does function as a confirmation field.
 

611
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,510
does function as a confirmation field.
Okay. So,

612
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,520
Okay. So,
 

613
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,669
Okay. So,
and I think we're getting what we're

614
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
and I think we're getting what we're
 

615
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,430
and I think we're getting what we're
want out of this. In other words, and

616
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
want out of this. In other words, and
 

617
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,750
want out of this. In other words, and
let me show you the futility of this. We

618
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
let me show you the futility of this. We
 

619
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,630
let me show you the futility of this. We
might as well do it. Okay?

620
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640

 

621
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,110

Just because I want you to understand

622
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
Just because I want you to understand
 

623
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,190
Just because I want you to understand
you have to know how to train yourself.

624
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200
you have to know how to train yourself.
 

625
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,950
you have to know how to train yourself.
Okay? So, here here we are, right? Okay.

626
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960
Okay? So, here here we are, right? Okay.
 

627
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,710
Okay? So, here here we are, right? Okay.
And then now we're gonna have the same

628
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
And then now we're gonna have the same
 

629
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,029
And then now we're gonna have the same
thing. Do you see? All right. Let's try

630
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:23,039
thing. Do you see? All right. Let's try
 

631
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,190
thing. Do you see? All right. Let's try
let's try drill two.

632
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
let's try drill two.
 

633
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,750
let's try drill two.
What what do you what can you predict is

634
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,760
What what do you what can you predict is
 

635
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:34,310
What what do you what can you predict is
going to happen in drill two and why?

636
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320

 

637
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,669

Okay, now why the skill level required?

638
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
Okay, now why the skill level required?
 

639
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,630
Okay, now why the skill level required?
How? What? Come on, be an engineer. Tell

640
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:40,640
How? What? Come on, be an engineer. Tell
 

641
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,149
How? What? Come on, be an engineer. Tell
me what part is making it more

642
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
me what part is making it more
 

643
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,870
me what part is making it more
difficult?

644
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
difficult?
 

645
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,270
difficult?
Okay, where are more forces coming from?

646
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,280

 

647
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,430

Come on. Come on. Explain it. What's

648
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:53,440
Come on. Come on. Explain it. What's
 

649
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,270
Come on. Come on. Explain it. What's
going on?

650
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,280
going on?
 

651
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,110
going on?
We've got more momentum behind the mass.

652
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
We've got more momentum behind the mass.
 

653
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,029
We've got more momentum behind the mass.
Okay. So there's going to be more what

654
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
Okay. So there's going to be more what
 

655
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,310
Okay. So there's going to be more what
at contact force more force there

656
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
at contact force more force there
 

657
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,310
at contact force more force there
because the opposing energy. Do you do

658
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
because the opposing energy. Do you do
 

659
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,470
because the opposing energy. Do you do
you understand? So we come up bouncing.

660
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:10,480

 

661
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,350

Okay. And we do the the first drill.

662
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,360
Okay. And we do the the first drill.
 

663
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,510
Okay. And we do the the first drill.
Okay. And here here I am.

664
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
Okay. And here here I am.
 

665
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,510
Okay. And here here I am.
This is going to be amplified. You're

666
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520
This is going to be amplified. You're
 

667
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,350
This is going to be amplified. You're
going to project me back. Do you see?

668
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
going to project me back. Do you see?
 

669
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,070
going to project me back. Do you see?
Do do you guys get it? So there's no

670
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,080
Do do you guys get it? So there's no
 

671
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,549
Do do you guys get it? So there's no
we're not you no point in doing drill

672
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
we're not you no point in doing drill
 

673
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,110
we're not you no point in doing drill
two and then no point as you go on and

674
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,120
two and then no point as you go on and
 

675
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,430
two and then no point as you go on and
on. There's like no because the force

676
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:33,440
on. There's like no because the force
 

677
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,070
on. There's like no because the force
equations become harder to navigate for

678
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,080
equations become harder to navigate for
 

679
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,990
equations become harder to navigate for
these reasons that they become amplified

680
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,000
these reasons that they become amplified
 

681
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,430
these reasons that they become amplified
as you're going up and we're taking away

682
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440
as you're going up and we're taking away
 

683
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,310
as you're going up and we're taking away
as we go higher in the drills your

684
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
as we go higher in the drills your
 

685
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,549
as we go higher in the drills your
bracing angle. Do you see that? So we're

686
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
bracing angle. Do you see that? So we're
 

687
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,029
bracing angle. Do you see that? So we're
weakening your force engine as we're

688
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:49,039
weakening your force engine as we're
 

689
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,789
weakening your force engine as we're
increasing their force. There's no

690
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
increasing their force. There's no
 

691
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,310
increasing their force. There's no
there's no way. Okay. And that's why we

692
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
there's no way. Okay. And that's why we
 

693
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,310
there's no way. Okay. And that's why we
don't do it. This is not how to

694
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,320
don't do it. This is not how to
 

695
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,870
don't do it. This is not how to
cultivate. Is it pretty interesting?

696
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:58,880
cultivate. Is it pretty interesting?
 

697
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,549
cultivate. Is it pretty interesting?
Yeah, it's pretty interesting. But at

698
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
Yeah, it's pretty interesting. But at
 

699
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,310
Yeah, it's pretty interesting. But at
the same time, if I could do the first

700
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,320
the same time, if I could do the first
 

701
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,830
the same time, if I could do the first
drill set, this is this is not a big

702
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
drill set, this is this is not a big
 

703
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,470
drill set, this is this is not a big
deal. Do do you get it? It's like so no

704
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
deal. Do do you get it? It's like so no
 

705
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,870
deal. Do do you get it? It's like so no
point in doing it. There's other things

706
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:10,880
point in doing it. There's other things
 

707
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,830
point in doing it. There's other things
uh that are more interesting.

708
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
uh that are more interesting.
 

709
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,029
uh that are more interesting.
Um and which is the the two edges of

710
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:17,039
Um and which is the the two edges of
 

711
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,110
Um and which is the the two edges of
this sword. It's like um there's so much

712
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
this sword. It's like um there's so much
 

713
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,230
this sword. It's like um there's so much
self in the hands, in the arms, in our

714
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,240
self in the hands, in the arms, in our
 

715
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,669
self in the hands, in the arms, in our
consciousness. Okay? And so that's why

716
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
consciousness. Okay? And so that's why
 

717
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,390
consciousness. Okay? And so that's why
it's important that you learn how to do

718
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,400
it's important that you learn how to do
 

719
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,909
it's important that you learn how to do
the set as it's first prescribed to you.

720
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919
the set as it's first prescribed to you.
 

721
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,950
the set as it's first prescribed to you.
Okay? Um

722
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
Okay? Um
 

723
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,630
Okay? Um
so let's uh know for example that we

724
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,640
so let's uh know for example that we
 

725
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,470
so let's uh know for example that we
have this

726
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
have this
 

727
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,950
have this
okay we have this confusion between

728
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:44,960
okay we have this confusion between
 

729
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,350
okay we have this confusion between
relaxing and releasing and we have this

730
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360
relaxing and releasing and we have this
 

731
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,029
relaxing and releasing and we have this
okay

732
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:51,039
okay
 

733
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,549
okay
uh and then we also have okay once I get

734
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:54,559
uh and then we also have okay once I get
 

735
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,190
uh and then we also have okay once I get
positionally

736
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,200
positionally
 

737
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,230
positionally
uh stabilized I should go inside my body

738
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
uh stabilized I should go inside my body
 

739
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,870
uh stabilized I should go inside my body
and release the tension. Okay. All right

740
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
and release the tension. Okay. All right
 

741
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,950
and release the tension. Okay. All right
let's try it.

742
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960

 

743
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,510

We're with two hands now.

744
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
We're with two hands now.
 

745
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,830
We're with two hands now.
Two hands. Back to the hand, the hand

746
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
Two hands. Back to the hand, the hand
 

747
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,110
Two hands. Back to the hand, the hand
variation, the hands set. But feel those

748
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,120
variation, the hands set. But feel those
 

749
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:29,270
variation, the hands set. But feel those
turning forces, those tilting forces.

751
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:41,510

You can let go real quick.

753
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,230

You got to release.

754
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,240
You got to release.
 

755
00:23:44,240 --> 00:24:44,660
You got to release.
I can't just release on good days.

00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:06,960

 

815
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,789

and he's leaning forward. You see he's

816
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:08,799
and he's leaning forward. You see he's
 

817
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,710
and he's leaning forward. You see he's
leaning forward. So Sean, let's go

818
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:10,720
leaning forward. So Sean, let's go
 

819
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,389
leaning forward. So Sean, let's go
quickly when he wants.

820
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:14,399
quickly when he wants.
 

821
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,470
quickly when he wants.
Well, we pushed him past it and he came

822
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:16,480
Well, we pushed him past it and he came
 

823
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,190
Well, we pushed him past it and he came
back to neutral,

824
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
back to neutral,
 

825
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,510
back to neutral,
which you should have been able to feel.

826
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,520
which you should have been able to feel.
 

827
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,470
which you should have been able to feel.
We're barely hanging on right now. Okay.

828
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
We're barely hanging on right now. Okay.
 

829
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,070
We're barely hanging on right now. Okay.
So, where do you where then? There's

830
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,080
So, where do you where then? There's
 

831
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,630
So, where do you where then? There's
that. Okay. So go back. Go a little

832
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
that. Okay. So go back. Go a little
 

833
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,870
that. Okay. So go back. Go a little
slower and a little longer.

834
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:34,880

 

835
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,310

Okay. And where do you feel flexion?

836
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,320
Okay. And where do you feel flexion?
 

837
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,430
Okay. And where do you feel flexion?
That's what I want

838
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:41,440
That's what I want
 

839
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,990
That's what I want
is the first question.

840
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,000

 

841
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,789

The back of your right leg. Okay. And

842
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:50,799
The back of your right leg. Okay. And
 

843
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,710
The back of your right leg. Okay. And
we'll keep pressing. And where do you

844
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:52,720
we'll keep pressing. And where do you
 

845
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,190
we'll keep pressing. And where do you
feel flexion?

846
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,200

 

847
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,590

Okay. Now go back. Come back out, Sean.

848
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:03,600
Okay. Now go back. Come back out, Sean.
 

849
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,710
Okay. Now go back. Come back out, Sean.
And now go back. Feel the flexion. And

850
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:06,720
And now go back. Feel the flexion. And
 

851
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,350
And now go back. Feel the flexion. And
then I want you to re relax that

852
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:09,360
then I want you to re relax that
 

853
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,789
then I want you to re relax that
flexion. Relax, not release. Okay. Do

854
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:12,799
flexion. Relax, not release. Okay. Do
 

855
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,950
flexion. Relax, not release. Okay. Do
you got it?

856
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:14,960
you got it?
 

857
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,830
you got it?
Okay.

858
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
Okay.
 

859
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,909
Okay.
Let's deal with the lower ab flexion.

860
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:19,919
Let's deal with the lower ab flexion.
 

861
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,750
Let's deal with the lower ab flexion.
Okay. Tell me when you feel the flexion.

862
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:23,760
Okay. Tell me when you feel the flexion.
 

863
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,350
Okay. Tell me when you feel the flexion.
If you need more force, he'll give you

864
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,360
If you need more force, he'll give you
 

865
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:32,310
If you need more force, he'll give you
more force slowly.

866
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,320

 

867
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,710

Okay. And now relax that flexion. Sean,

868
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:34,720
Okay. And now relax that flexion. Sean,
 

869
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,070
Okay. And now relax that flexion. Sean,
you keep that pressure. Relax it more.

870
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
you keep that pressure. Relax it more.
 

871
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,630
you keep that pressure. Relax it more.
What's happening to your body?

872
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:46,640

 

873
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,870

Okay.

874
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880

 

875
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,230

Keep it relaxed.

876
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,240

 

877
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,269

Is the flexion there?

878
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:01,279

 

879
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,830

Okay. And uh as I'm talking, Sean,

880
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:03,840
Okay. And uh as I'm talking, Sean,
 

881
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,669
Okay. And uh as I'm talking, Sean,
whenever you want, you'll quickly let

882
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:05,679
whenever you want, you'll quickly let
 

883
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,029
whenever you want, you'll quickly let
go.

884
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:09,039

 

885
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,549

Okay.

886
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:12,559

 

887
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:21,830

So, let's try it again.

888
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:21,840

 

889
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,590

So there's that. Okay. So I'm barely

890
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,600
So there's that. Okay. So I'm barely
 

891
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,190
So there's that. Okay. So I'm barely
pushing and um right that was barely

892
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
pushing and um right that was barely
 

893
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,190
pushing and um right that was barely
touched you. Okay. Um

894
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,200

 

895
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,950

you have to be able to feel that. Okay.

896
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:38,960
you have to be able to feel that. Okay.
 

897
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,389
you have to be able to feel that. Okay.
All right. You're doing it again.

898
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:42,399
All right. You're doing it again.
 

899
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,070
All right. You're doing it again.
What I what you're doing is you're

900
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,080
What I what you're doing is you're
 

901
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,549
What I what you're doing is you're
you're leaning into your shiaku. Okay.

902
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:48,559
you're leaning into your shiaku. Okay.
 

903
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,110
you're leaning into your shiaku. Okay.
And it is to stop the it's to stop that

904
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,120
And it is to stop the it's to stop that
 

905
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,909
And it is to stop the it's to stop that
rotational weakness there. Okay. There

906
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:53,919
rotational weakness there. Okay. There
 

907
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,110
rotational weakness there. Okay. There
you go. All right.

908
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,120
you go. All right.
 

909
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,669
you go. All right.
Careful. Don't lean in the shikaku.

910
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
Careful. Don't lean in the shikaku.
 

911
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,430
Careful. Don't lean in the shikaku.
Okay. So, there there is that reason

912
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:03,440
Okay. So, there there is that reason
 

913
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,789
Okay. So, there there is that reason
you're flexing the abdominals. Okay. So,

914
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:06,799
you're flexing the abdominals. Okay. So,
 

915
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,510
you're flexing the abdominals. Okay. So,
flex your abdominals again. Yeah. Okay.

916
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:09,520
flex your abdominals again. Yeah. Okay.
 

917
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,029
flex your abdominals again. Yeah. Okay.
Got it. Unflex them again. And what what

918
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:13,039
Got it. Unflex them again. And what what
 

919
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,750
Got it. Unflex them again. And what what
do you feel when you do that difference?

920
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:15,760
do you feel when you do that difference?
 

921
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,430
do you feel when you do that difference?
My scar. Yeah, you're going backwards.

922
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,440
My scar. Yeah, you're going backwards.
 

923
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,389
My scar. Yeah, you're going backwards.
Okay. So, here, flex it again. Okay. And

924
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:20,399
Okay. So, here, flex it again. Okay. And
 

925
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,590
Okay. So, here, flex it again. Okay. And
there I'll keep that pressure. Right.

926
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,600
there I'll keep that pressure. Right.
 

927
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,909
there I'll keep that pressure. Right.
And then release that. Release it.

928
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:27,919
And then release that. Release it.
 

929
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:35,350
And then release that. Release it.
And you're going in that shikaku again.

930
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:35,360

 

931
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,389

There's the hinge. It's right there.

932
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:38,399
There's the hinge. It's right there.
 

933
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,669
There's the hinge. It's right there.
Okay.

934
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:41,679

 

935
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,230

Got it. Okay. So, we got two things.

936
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,240
Got it. Okay. So, we got two things.
 

937
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,830
Got it. Okay. So, we got two things.
We we have a rotational weakness

938
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:49,840
We we have a rotational weakness
 

939
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,549
We we have a rotational weakness
and we have this hinge weakness. And

940
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:52,559
and we have this hinge weakness. And
 

941
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,669
and we have this hinge weakness. And
your rotational solution is to lean this

942
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:55,679
your rotational solution is to lean this
 

943
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,710
your rotational solution is to lean this
way. Okay?

944
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
way. Okay?
 

945
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,149
way. Okay?
Which is exposed when we

946
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:02,159
Which is exposed when we
 

947
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,909
Which is exposed when we
let go. You're just you're just falling

948
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:03,919
let go. You're just you're just falling
 

949
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,029
let go. You're just you're just falling
that way. Do you see? Okay. And then the

950
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:07,039
that way. Do you see? Okay. And then the
 

951
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,110
that way. Do you see? Okay. And then the
other one is this hinge one, which your

952
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,120
other one is this hinge one, which your
 

953
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,590
other one is this hinge one, which your
solution is flex here. Do do you

954
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:11,600
solution is flex here. Do do you
 

955
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,350
solution is flex here. Do do you
understand? Okay. So now we're here.

956
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:15,360
understand? Okay. So now we're here.
 

957
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,350
understand? Okay. So now we're here.
And you want to feel for those two

958
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:19,360
And you want to feel for those two
 

959
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,190
And you want to feel for those two
pseudo solutions. So you're you're

960
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:21,200
pseudo solutions. So you're you're
 

961
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,950
pseudo solutions. So you're you're
already doing it. Okay. You're already

962
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:24,960
already doing it. Okay. You're already
 

963
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,789
already doing it. Okay. You're already
Can you guys see that? Yeah. So you can

964
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:26,799
Can you guys see that? Yeah. So you can
 

965
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,990
Can you guys see that? Yeah. So you can
see how he moves that way. Okay.

966
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,000

 

967
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,310

And there's the h there's the the You're

968
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:34,320
And there's the h there's the the You're
 

969
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:49,350
And there's the h there's the the You're
coming up over the top. Do you see?

970
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,360

 

971
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,630

Okay. Stay here. Stay where you are. And

972
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:52,640
Okay. Stay here. Stay where you are. And
 

973
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,870
Okay. Stay here. Stay where you are. And
now without moving from where you are.

974
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:56,880
now without moving from where you are.
 

975
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,830
now without moving from where you are.

aware of them from the shoulder drill,
 

1133
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,750
aware of them from the shoulder drill,
but you're over here looking like I

1134
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:45,760
but you're over here looking like I
 

1135
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,829
but you're over here looking like I
don't know. And then we could see,

1136
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:47,839
don't know. And then we could see,
 

1137
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,829
don't know. And then we could see,
right? You didn't know with your hands.

1138
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:49,839
right? You didn't know with your hands.
 

1139
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,550
right? You didn't know with your hands.
And then you got to we can't get around

1140
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:52,560
And then you got to we can't get around
 

1141
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,470
And then you got to we can't get around
the training equations. You're barely

1142
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,480
the training equations. You're barely
 

1143
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,190
the training equations. You're barely
training now. So there's no sensitivity

1144
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,200
training now. So there's no sensitivity
 

1145
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,990
training now. So there's no sensitivity
or as much sensitivity as someone else.

1146
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
or as much sensitivity as someone else.
 

1147
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,109
or as much sensitivity as someone else.
Okay? So you have to put the time in. Uh

1148
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:03,119
Okay? So you have to put the time in. Uh
 

1149
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,670
Okay? So you have to put the time in. Uh
it has to be done wisely. You can't get

1150
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:05,680
it has to be done wisely. You can't get
 

1151
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,950
it has to be done wisely. You can't get
lost in today I'm not doing it. You got

1152
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:08,960
lost in today I'm not doing it. You got
 

1153
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,390
lost in today I'm not doing it. You got
it? All that stuff. Okay. Um so let's go

1154
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:12,400
it? All that stuff. Okay. Um so let's go
 

1155
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,910
it? All that stuff. Okay. Um so let's go
back to this drill and try to feel

1156
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:15,920
back to this drill and try to feel
 

1157
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,150
back to this drill and try to feel
what's actually happening to you. It's

1158
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160
what's actually happening to you. It's
 

1159
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,470
what's actually happening to you. It's
not magic. If it's not luck of the draw,

1160
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:20,480
not magic. If it's not luck of the draw,
 

1161
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,390
not magic. If it's not luck of the draw,
like Tristan used to do that, like my

1162
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,400
like Tristan used to do that, like my
 

1163
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,829
like Tristan used to do that, like my
shot is off. No, your shot is not off.

1164
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:25,839
shot is off. No, your shot is not off.
 

1165
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,349
shot is off. No, your shot is not off.
Your mechanics, you're not doing your

1166
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:27,359
Your mechanics, you're not doing your
 

1167
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,109
Your mechanics, you're not doing your
mechanics. That is all what it means.

1168
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:29,119
mechanics. That is all what it means.
 

1169
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,630
mechanics. That is all what it means.
Okay? Um, it's not luck whether you hit

1170
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:32,640
Okay? Um, it's not luck whether you hit
 

1171
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,109
Okay? Um, it's not luck whether you hit
the target with your round or not. Do

1172
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:35,119
the target with your round or not. Do
 

1173
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,630
the target with your round or not. Do
you know what I mean? You change the

1174
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:36,640
you know what I mean? You change the
 

1175
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,950
you know what I mean? You change the
mechanics. So, what I always tell the

1176
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:38,960
mechanics. So, what I always tell the
 

1177
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,870
mechanics. So, what I always tell the
recruits is every time your round is

1178
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:42,880
recruits is every time your round is
 

1179
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,349
recruits is every time your round is
somewhere else, it's because you change

1180
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:45,359
somewhere else, it's because you change
 

1181
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,069
somewhere else, it's because you change
your mechanics. you just aren't aware of

1182
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:48,079
your mechanics. you just aren't aware of
 

1183
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,829
your mechanics. you just aren't aware of
how you're changing your mechanics,

1184
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:49,839
how you're changing your mechanics,
 

1185
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,550
how you're changing your mechanics,
okay? Or to what degree. So, very

1186
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:52,560
okay? Or to what degree. So, very
 

1187
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,470
okay? Or to what degree. So, very
similar here. We It's an awareness

1188
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:54,480
similar here. We It's an awareness
 

1189
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,190
similar here. We It's an awareness
issue. Okay. All right. Let's try the

1190
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:57,200
issue. Okay. All right. Let's try the
 

1191
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,599
issue. Okay. All right. Let's try the
hand drill.
