00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400
uh we just learned the uh

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,070
uh we just learned the uh
the handwork okay so i'm gonna go

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
the handwork okay so i'm gonna go
 

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,130
the handwork okay so i'm gonna go
here

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:15,140

[Music]

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320

 

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,869

short grip

12
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879

 

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:52,229

start like this

14
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239

 

15
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,950

you're gonna start with him turn okay

16
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
you're gonna start with him turn okay
 

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,950
you're gonna start with him turn okay
he'll start

18
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960

 

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:22,950

across this disposal

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960

 

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:38,789

okay let's try it

22
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799

 

23
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,270

now you're going to want to tweak this

24
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
now you're going to want to tweak this
 

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,550
now you're going to want to tweak this
but there's no strength there

26
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
but there's no strength there
 

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,389
but there's no strength there
pull out

28
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399

 

29
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,670

that's not what we're doing okay so if

30
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
that's not what we're doing okay so if
 

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,749
that's not what we're doing okay so if
you pay attention

32
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
you pay attention
 

33
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,109
you pay attention
when when you turn his arm

34
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
when when you turn his arm
 

35
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,030
when when you turn his arm
it makes the elbow go down

36
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
it makes the elbow go down
 

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,630
it makes the elbow go down
okay um so

38
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
okay um so
 

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,910
okay um so
i'm not going to turn it this way though

40
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
i'm not going to turn it this way though
 

41
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,790
i'm not going to turn it this way though
you can kind of do the same thing if you

42
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
you can kind of do the same thing if you
 

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,990
you can kind of do the same thing if you
keep going

44
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
keep going
 

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,190
keep going
and then like that

46
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
and then like that
 

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,470
and then like that
which is how you do cutting comments

48
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
which is how you do cutting comments
 

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,030
which is how you do cutting comments
so think more uh

50
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040

 

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,150

and then i've turned his elbow down

52
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160

 

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,589

not torque it down now

54
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
not torque it down now
 

55
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,630
not torque it down now
you find his his body his body

56
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
you find his his body his body
 

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,869
you find his his body his body
you see how he can move his leg i'm not

58
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
you see how he can move his leg i'm not
 

59
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,150
you see how he can move his leg i'm not
torquing his arm

60
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
torquing his arm
 

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:48,710
torquing his arm
i mean his body

62
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720

 

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,550

his pulse is here and my knuckle of my

64
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
his pulse is here and my knuckle of my
 

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,070
his pulse is here and my knuckle of my
index finger

66
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080

 

67
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,750

you find his body in his in his arm

68
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
you find his body in his in his arm
 

69
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,990
you find his body in his in his arm
it's like you don't need the knuckle you

70
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
it's like you don't need the knuckle you
 

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,790
it's like you don't need the knuckle you
see that okay

72
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
see that okay
 

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,589
see that okay
find his body turn the elbow down

74
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
find his body turn the elbow down
 

75
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,790
find his body turn the elbow down
don't crank the elbow down here

76
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
don't crank the elbow down here
 

77
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:27,509
don't crank the elbow down here
find his body so you see ikey adhesion

78
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519

 

79
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,830

so now you're just doing it with the

80
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
so now you're just doing it with the
 

81
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,789
so now you're just doing it with the
grip

82
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799

 

83
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,470

if you feel it in your knuckle you're

84
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
if you feel it in your knuckle you're
 

85
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,390
if you feel it in your knuckle you're
doing it wrong

86
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
doing it wrong
 

87
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,990
doing it wrong
okay what what the knuckle does is

88
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
okay what what the knuckle does is
 

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,309
okay what what the knuckle does is
though he can't he can't uh

90
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
though he can't he can't uh
 

91
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,869
though he can't he can't uh
twist he gets into that knuckle

92
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
twist he gets into that knuckle
 

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,149
twist he gets into that knuckle
just like uh

94
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159

 

95
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,390

right he uh

96
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
right he uh
 

97
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,509
right he uh
it reduces angles that he has so then i

98
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
it reduces angles that he has so then i
 

99
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,869
it reduces angles that he has so then i
can get into his body

100
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879

 

101
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,910

so the same thing it again you don't

102
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
so the same thing it again you don't
 

103
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,309
so the same thing it again you don't
need

104
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
need
 

105
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,990
need
you don't need that but it reduces

106
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
you don't need that but it reduces
 

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,110
you don't need that but it reduces
angles that he can do so

108
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
angles that he can do so
 

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,590
angles that he can do so
that's what that's for but it's all in

110
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
that's what that's for but it's all in
 

111
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,760
that's what that's for but it's all in
his body

112
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:24,770

and then bringing that down and then

116
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
and then bringing that down and then
 

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,950
and then bringing that down and then
you're doing the same thing

118
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
you're doing the same thing
 

119
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,430
you're doing the same thing
with your grip in his body

120
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440

 

121
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,629

if you try to do it here like you could

122
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
if you try to do it here like you could
 

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,990
if you try to do it here like you could
tell that elbows

124
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
tell that elbows
 

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,670
tell that elbows
so what i did in his body

126
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
so what i did in his body
 

127
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,710
so what i did in his body
and control the elbow when you focus

128
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
and control the elbow when you focus
 

129
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,030
and control the elbow when you focus
just on hurting him

130
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
just on hurting him
 

131
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,990
just on hurting him
you don't control the elbow so just like

132
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
you don't control the elbow so just like
 

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,510
you don't control the elbow so just like
the sword is pretty

134
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
the sword is pretty
 

135
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,909
the sword is pretty
comfortable grip but it's in his body

136
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
comfortable grip but it's in his body
 

137
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,749
comfortable grip but it's in his body
and when you feel the pressure on the

138
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
and when you feel the pressure on the
 

139
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,270
and when you feel the pressure on the
knuckle do you see

140
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
knuckle do you see
 

141
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,110
knuckle do you see
okay that's when you change

142
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
okay that's when you change
 

143
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,670
okay that's when you change
the pastor on it's telling you you want

144
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
the pastor on it's telling you you want
 

145
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,189
the pastor on it's telling you you want
to find zero pressure

146
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199

 

147
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,749

so when i feel it then that's not the

148
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
so when i feel it then that's not the
 

149
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,350
so when i feel it then that's not the
right angle

150
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
right angle
 

151
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:29,270
right angle
you see go back to zero

152
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280

 

153
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,270

don't you if you're strong enough you're

154
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
don't you if you're strong enough you're
 

155
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,550
don't you if you're strong enough you're
gonna like it

156
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
gonna like it
 

157
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,629
gonna like it
you're gonna feel your power but if you

158
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
you're gonna feel your power but if you
 

159
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,790
you're gonna feel your power but if you
feel your power you're not powerful

160
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
feel your power you're not powerful
 

161
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:48,790
feel your power you're not powerful
okay you don't need you don't need that

162
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800

 

163
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,870

of course if you resist just like nicole

164
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
of course if you resist just like nicole
 

165
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,990
of course if you resist just like nicole
mikio

166
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
mikio
 

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,270
mikio
it hurt that knuckle gets you okay

168
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280

 

169
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,150

but in his body in his body

170
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160

 

171
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,510

bought

172
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520

 

173
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,390

so if that's what's happening it sounds

174
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
so if that's what's happening it sounds
 

175
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,150
so if that's what's happening it sounds
kind of irrelevant

176
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
kind of irrelevant
 

177
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,790
kind of irrelevant

maybe i maybe maybe i shrink it you see
 

563
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,749
maybe i maybe maybe i shrink it you see
but the principle is still the same his

564
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:45,759
but the principle is still the same his

he absorbs do you see he absorbs

642
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
he absorbs do you see he absorbs
 

643
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,549
he absorbs do you see he absorbs
i still have to be able to find his

644
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
i still have to be able to find his
 

645
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,390
i still have to be able to find his
center okay

646
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,400
center okay
 

647
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,669
center okay
so um

648
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679

 

649
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,150

don't change it don't go to the obvious

650
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
don't change it don't go to the obvious
 

651
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,950
don't change it don't go to the obvious
down here

652
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
down here
 

653
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,029
down here
okay and then this has to find his

654
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
okay and then this has to find his
 

655
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,110
okay and then this has to find his
center no

656
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
center no
 

657
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,150
center no
no find his center find his center

658
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
no find his center find his center
 

659
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,190
no find his center find his center
it changes every time so some of you are

660
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,200
it changes every time so some of you are
 

661
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,630
it changes every time so some of you are
going like that

662
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
going like that
 

663
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,430
going like that
you see you have to find his center and

664
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
you see you have to find his center and
 

665
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,270
you see you have to find his center and
then some of you when you get over here

666
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
then some of you when you get over here
 

667
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,870
then some of you when you get over here
and you go to turn it

668
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:48,880
and you go to turn it
 

669
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,789
and you go to turn it
you leave his body and you're just in

670
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
you leave his body and you're just in
 

671
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,990
you leave his body and you're just in
the arm you see

672
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
the arm you see
 

673
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,310
the arm you see
so if you it's fine to turn it you do

674
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
so if you it's fine to turn it you do
 

675
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,430
so if you it's fine to turn it you do
want to turn it but

676
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
want to turn it but
 

677
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,750
want to turn it but
you want to turn it in a way that it's

678
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
you want to turn it in a way that it's
 

679
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,190
you want to turn it in a way that it's
affecting his center

680
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
affecting his center
 

681
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,870
affecting his center
okay but not at the elbow

682
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:02,880
okay but not at the elbow
 

683
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,350
okay but not at the elbow
down here okay let's try it okay so this

684
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360
down here okay let's try it okay so this
 

685

down here okay let's try it okay so this
time

686
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640
time
 

687
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,029
time
we're gonna we're gonna find the

688
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
we're gonna we're gonna find the
 

689
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,310
we're gonna we're gonna find the
movement

690
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
movement
 

691
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,789

now we're you're still getting a rep on
 

695
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,909
now we're you're still getting a rep on
that other thing

696
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
that other thing
 

697
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,950
that other thing
okay but uh this time

698
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:18,960
okay but uh this time
 

699
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,470
okay but uh this time
we're gonna find the transition

700
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480
we're gonna find the transition
 

701
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,590
we're gonna find the transition
okay but as i do the transition

702
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,600
okay but as i do the transition
 

703
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,150
okay but as i do the transition
i can't come out of his body okay

704
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160

 

705
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,190

so you see this is not in his body so i

706
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
so you see this is not in his body so i
 

707
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,789
so you see this is not in his body so i
find it's in his body

708
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
find it's in his body
 

709
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,190
find it's in his body
it's in his body and it stays in his

710
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
it's in his body and it stays in his
 

711
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,830
it's in his body and it stays in his
mind

712
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:37,840
mind
 

713
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,270
mind
so in a way in a way

714
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,280
so in a way in a way
 

715
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,470
so in a way in a way

he he goes to push and he runs into the
 

723
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,230
he he goes to push and he runs into the
ground he runs into the same thing

724
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
ground he runs into the same thing
 

725
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,270
ground he runs into the same thing
so it's not that i'm going here

726
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
so it's not that i'm going here
 

727
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,310
so it's not that i'm going here
why'd i start over and then i go

728
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,320
why'd i start over and then i go
 

729
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,510
why'd i start over and then i go
that's not what's happening okay so i'm

730
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
that's not what's happening okay so i'm
 

731
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,150
that's not what's happening okay so i'm
sending energy into that do you see how

732
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
sending energy into that do you see how
 

733
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,190
sending energy into that do you see how
that's happening

734
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
that's happening
 

735
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,150
that's happening
so in his body on his body

736
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160

 

737
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,190

and that ground that grounding is what

738
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,200
and that ground that grounding is what
 

739
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,350
and that ground that grounding is what
i'm doing now i just do it with the grip

740
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360
i'm doing now i just do it with the grip
 

741
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,669
i'm doing now i just do it with the grip
okay so the same same grip

you you could go like that i got his
 

755
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,590
you you could go like that i got his
body again you could but that

756
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
body again you could but that
 

757
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,630
body again you could but that
let's not do that let's transfer

758
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:48,640
let's not do that let's transfer

you go here right
 

773
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,350
you go here right
and then it's not that i keep taking

774
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
and then it's not that i keep taking
 

775
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,310
and then it's not that i keep taking
them down on that same line

776
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:20,320
them down on that same line
 

777
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,070
them down on that same line
is that i take i take this energy

778
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
is that i take i take this energy
 

779
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,149
is that i take i take this energy
and throw it back at me let's go in here

780
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:28,159
and throw it back at me let's go in here
 

781
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,870
and throw it back at me let's go in here
back at me and that's where this hand

782
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:30,880
back at me and that's where this hand
 

783
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,710
back at me and that's where this hand
comes in

784
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:32,720
comes in
 

785
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,110
comes in
do you see so the the technique has a

786
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
do you see so the the technique has a
 

787
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,909
do you see so the the technique has a
beat in it

788
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:35,919
beat in it
 

789
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,190
beat in it
it's not down down down down down down

790
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
it's not down down down down down down
 

791
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,470
it's not down down down down down down
there's a beat there

792
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
there's a beat there
 

793
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,470
there's a beat there
do you see it so i trade in which

794
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
do you see it so i trade in which
 

795
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:55,750
do you see it so i trade in which
is

796
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:55,760

 

797
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,110

don't forget your basics so

798
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
don't forget your basics so
 

799
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,190
don't forget your basics so
he has he has to do the kazushi pattern

800
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,200
he has he has to do the kazushi pattern
 

801
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,029
he has he has to do the kazushi pattern
so this is the inward the front inward

802
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:07,039
so this is the inward the front inward
 

803
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,029
so this is the inward the front inward
got it but then i'm going to change it

804
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
got it but then i'm going to change it
 

805
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,149
got it but then i'm going to change it
because i'm going to

806
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159
because i'm going to
 

807
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,149
because i'm going to
do a pin so i'm going to create a zone

808
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
do a pin so i'm going to create a zone
 

809
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,149
do a pin so i'm going to create a zone
of sanctuary with a cross lateral check

810
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,159
of sanctuary with a cross lateral check
 

811
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:14,870
of sanctuary with a cross lateral check
on the

812
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:14,880
on the
 

813
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,710
on the
homologous so he can't be standing he

814
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
homologous so he can't be standing he
 

815
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,310
homologous so he can't be standing he
can't be like that

816
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
can't be like that
 

817
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,430
can't be like that
he can't beat this way okay

818
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,440
he can't beat this way okay
 

819
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,909
he can't beat this way okay
so this this arm

820
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:27,919
so this this arm
 

821
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,029
so this this arm
you recognize okay and we're going to

822
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:31,039
you recognize okay and we're going to
 

823
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,950
you recognize okay and we're going to
show it a little different

824
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:32,960
show it a little different
 

825
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,310
show it a little different
okay so he's going this arm is going to

826
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
okay so he's going this arm is going to
 

827
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,110
okay so he's going this arm is going to
go like

828
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,120
go like
 

829
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,590
go like
this now

830
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600

 

831
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,710

so if you pay attention now

832
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
so if you pay attention now
 

833
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,230
so if you pay attention now
you're recognizing io if this

834
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
you're recognizing io if this
 

835
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,789
you're recognizing io if this
hand keeps going that way you're going

836
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
hand keeps going that way you're going
 

837
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,549
hand keeps going that way you're going
to stay in equal

838
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:52,559
to stay in equal
 

839
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,149
to stay in equal
this hand has to come back

840
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
this hand has to come back
 

841
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,270
this hand has to come back
this way

842
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
this way
 

843
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,310
this way
so as you pay attention

844
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,320
so as you pay attention
 

845
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,470
so as you pay attention
right pressure actually increases

846
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
right pressure actually increases
 

847
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,549
right pressure actually increases
right then do you see do you feel that

848
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559
right then do you see do you feel that
 

849
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,549
right then do you see do you feel that
all right so it's not here

850
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
all right so it's not here
 

851
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,710
all right so it's not here
pressure's going off this hand

852
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:18,720
pressure's going off this hand
 

853
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,830
pressure's going off this hand
has to come back

854
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840

 

855
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,630

and

856
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
and
 

857
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,390
and
so again this hand don't go here that

858
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,400
so again this hand don't go here that
 

859
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,990
so again this hand don't go here that
would be in the elbow

860
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
would be in the elbow
 

861
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,110
would be in the elbow
this pressure is now going to

862
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,120
this pressure is now going to
 

863
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,710
this pressure is now going to
push okay

864
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,720
push okay
 

865
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,750
push okay
oh now i don't just do it with the other

866
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:41,760
oh now i don't just do it with the other
 

867
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,070
oh now i don't just do it with the other
heart

868
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,080
heart
 

869
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,510
heart
you see that this handstand but this

870
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
you see that this handstand but this
 

871
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,310
you see that this handstand but this
hand has to bring it in

872
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,320
hand has to bring it in
 

873
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,830
hand has to bring it in
so if you pay attention this hand is

874
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:53,840
so if you pay attention this hand is
 

875
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,470
so if you pay attention this hand is
going to come

876
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
going to come
 

877
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,470
going to come
back not keep going into

878
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:58,480
back not keep going into
 

879
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,510
back not keep going into
you you have like let me forget oh he's

880
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:01,520
you you have like let me forget oh he's
 

881
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,110
you you have like let me forget oh he's
almost down

882
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,120
almost down
 

883
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,590
almost down
i but he's not down you're gonna he's

884
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:05,600
i but he's not down you're gonna he's
 

885
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,510
i but he's not down you're gonna he's
gonna come back up on me

886
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
gonna come back up on me
 

887
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,669
gonna come back up on me
so keep the kazushi going whoa

888
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679

 

889
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:26,149

what's it coming back to

890
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159

 

891
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,789

again if you watch the center it moves

892
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:28,799
again if you watch the center it moves
 

893
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,230
again if you watch the center it moves
twice

894
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,240
twice
 

895
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,870
twice
the center is moving then it's not that

896
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:32,880
the center is moving then it's not that
 

897
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,789
the center is moving then it's not that
it stays there

898
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:34,799
it stays there
 

899
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,990
it stays there
it's gonna move again

900
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000

 

901
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,710

okay because we need position you're

902
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
okay because we need position you're
 

903
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,590
okay because we need position you're
painting the

904
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:43,600
painting the
 

905
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,110
painting the
ending again okay this i'm not gonna do

906
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,120
ending again okay this i'm not gonna do
 

907
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:59,430
ending again okay this i'm not gonna do
the technique i just want you to see the

908
00:23:59,430 --> 00:23:59,440

 

909
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,390

there's projection capacity everywhere

910
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
there's projection capacity everywhere
 

911
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,990
there's projection capacity everywhere
you see at every uh degree

912
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
you see at every uh degree
 

913
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,029
you see at every uh degree
of the radius you can project project

914
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:11,039
of the radius you can project project
 

915
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,149
of the radius you can project project
okay now so even though i'm going

916
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:14,159
okay now so even though i'm going
 

917
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,390
okay now so even though i'm going
back you see the arms going back towards

918
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
back you see the arms going back towards
 

919
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,630
back you see the arms going back towards
me it still

920
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
me it still
 

921
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,909
me it still
projects you get it so

922
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919
projects you get it so
 

923
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,590
projects you get it so
i'm over here like this and this hand

924
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
i'm over here like this and this hand
 

925
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,750
i'm over here like this and this hand
is not going to do the obvious and pull

926
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
is not going to do the obvious and pull
 

927
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,510
is not going to do the obvious and pull
this down

928
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:29,520
this down
 

929
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,430
this down
this this is basically going to project

930
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
this this is basically going to project
 

931
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,830
this this is basically going to project
on into this boom

932
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840

 

933
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,909

so these are different patterns that

934
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
so these are different patterns that
 

935
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,909
so these are different patterns that
you're doing you're doing this

936
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
you're doing you're doing this
 

937
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,630
you're doing you're doing this
okay and this pattern is here

938
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:48,640

 

939
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,269

can you see that difference so you gotta

940
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:51,279
can you see that difference so you gotta
 

941
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,070
can you see that difference so you gotta
come

942
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
come
 

943
00:24:52,080 --> 00:25:05,830
come
one boom and boom

944
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840

 

945
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,510

so let's just try that one

946
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:09,520
so let's just try that one
 

947
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,710
so let's just try that one
okay don't get goodness come back around

948
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:12,720
okay don't get goodness come back around
 

949
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,750
okay don't get goodness come back around
and push

950
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,760

 

951
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,870

on don't

952
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
on don't
 

953
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,590
on don't
keep the pressure come around it and

954
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
keep the pressure come around it and
 

955
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:23,909
keep the pressure come around it and
then

956
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919
then
 

957
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,269
then
push again

958
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:27,279

 

959
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:33,350

so it's what does that look like to you

960
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360

 

961
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,470

all let's just our spiral okay

962
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480
all let's just our spiral okay
 

963
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,750
all let's just our spiral okay
a warm pressure

964
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:39,760
a warm pressure
 

965
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,029
a warm pressure
you're gonna go here around

966
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
you're gonna go here around
 

967
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,669
you're gonna go here around
again okay try just that can see so

968
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:47,679
again okay try just that can see so
 

969
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,430
again okay try just that can see so
when you don't have cool q skills

970
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,440
when you don't have cool q skills
 

971
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,230
when you don't have cool q skills
then it's always push-pull and you can't

972
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,240
then it's always push-pull and you can't
 

973
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,950
then it's always push-pull and you can't
understand

974
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:54,960
understand
 

975
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,950
understand
how these geometries are actually

976
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960
how these geometries are actually
 

977
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,630
how these geometries are actually
working okay

978
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
working okay
 

979
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,510
working okay
uh and then if he resists because you're

980
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,520
uh and then if he resists because you're
 

981
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,110
uh and then if he resists because you're
pushing and pulling he resists and the

982
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
pushing and pulling he resists and the
 

983
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,230
pushing and pulling he resists and the
technique doesn't work

984
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,240
technique doesn't work
 

985
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,430
technique doesn't work
but if he if he resists he's he's gonna

986
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
but if he if he resists he's he's gonna
 

987
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,149
but if he if he resists he's he's gonna
push

988
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:08,159
push
 

989
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,510
push
and he's gonna go further out okay

990
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,520
and he's gonna go further out okay
 

991
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,190
and he's gonna go further out okay
so um let's move on though okay

992
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,200
so um let's move on though okay
 

993
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,590
so um let's move on though okay
so uh we're gonna bring in the other

994
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
so uh we're gonna bring in the other
 

995
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,789
so uh we're gonna bring in the other
hand so

996
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:18,799
hand so
 

997
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,310
hand so
same drill what my other hand is here

998
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,320
same drill what my other hand is here
 

999
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,870
same drill what my other hand is here
okay and the other hand is doing the

1000
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:24,880
okay and the other hand is doing the
 

1001
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,230
okay and the other hand is doing the
same

1002
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240
same
 

1003
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,269
same
helping okay the reason i took that hand

1004
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
helping okay the reason i took that hand
 

1005
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:29,909
helping okay the reason i took that hand
off

1006
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:29,919
off
 

1007
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,909
off
is because you're gonna become dependent

1008
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:31,919
is because you're gonna become dependent
 

1009
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,669
is because you're gonna become dependent
on the elbow

1010
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
on the elbow
 

1011
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,830
on the elbow
and then you're back here you see he's

1012
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:35,840
and then you're back here you see he's
 

1013
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,110
and then you're back here you see he's
just hanging out there

1014
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,120
just hanging out there
 

1015
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,950
just hanging out there
so again but it didn't matter that i was

1016
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:40,960
so again but it didn't matter that i was
 

1017
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,390
so again but it didn't matter that i was
in the other hand

1018
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,400
in the other hand
 

1019
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,909
in the other hand
or not so this hand is still doing the

1020
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
or not so this hand is still doing the
 

1021
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:46,710
or not so this hand is still doing the
same thing

1022
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:46,720
same thing
 

1023
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,950
