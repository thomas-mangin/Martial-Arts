1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,429

okay

2
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:03,439
okay
 

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,869
okay
so again the first drill

4
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:06,879
so again the first drill
 

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,669
so again the first drill
he's going to push and i'm taking the

6
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
he's going to push and i'm taking the
 

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,870
he's going to push and i'm taking the
static drill

8
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
static drill
 

9
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,669
static drill
which is he's pushing i'm letting the

10
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:13,679
which is he's pushing i'm letting the
 

11
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,430
which is he's pushing i'm letting the
energy go through me

12
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
energy go through me
 

13
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,070
energy go through me
and it's just going down to the ground

14
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080
and it's just going down to the ground
 

15
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,070
and it's just going down to the ground
okay

16
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,080
okay
 

17
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,750
okay
now i'm going to keep the ground vector

18
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
now i'm going to keep the ground vector
 

19
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,230
now i'm going to keep the ground vector
but change the back angle and he is

20
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
but change the back angle and he is
 

21
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,750
but change the back angle and he is
still doing the same

22
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
still doing the same
 

23
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,870
still doing the same
he's keeping his ground vector as he's

24
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
he's keeping his ground vector as he's
 

25
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,990
he's keeping his ground vector as he's
pushing

26
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
pushing
 

27
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,110
pushing
then we're going to move it

28
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
then we're going to move it
 

29
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,470
then we're going to move it
he has to go back and accept the ground

30
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
he has to go back and accept the ground
 

31
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,310
he has to go back and accept the ground
vector give me a little more please i'm

32
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
vector give me a little more please i'm
 

33
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,750
vector give me a little more please i'm
going to go in a little more

34
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
going to go in a little more
 

35
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,950
going to go in a little more
there you go and then he goes

36
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:46,960

 

37
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,110

and the key part of this drill is that

38
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
and the key part of this drill is that
 

39
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,790
and the key part of this drill is that
when i change directions i'm not

40
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
when i change directions i'm not
 

41
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,790
when i change directions i'm not
shutting it off to change directions

42
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
shutting it off to change directions
 

43
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,750
shutting it off to change directions
i'm here and i push it never goes off

44
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
i'm here and i push it never goes off
 

45
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,750
i'm here and i push it never goes off
give me a little more

46
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
give me a little more
 

47
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,630
give me a little more
and then he goes without it going off i

48
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
and then he goes without it going off i
 

49
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,189
and then he goes without it going off i
still feel the ground through him

50
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
still feel the ground through him
 

51
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,870
still feel the ground through him
and he still feels the ground through me

52
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
and he still feels the ground through me
 

53
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,350
and he still feels the ground through me
so if he's pushing

54
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
so if he's pushing
 

55
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,270
so if he's pushing
he's just going into the ground he's not

56
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
he's just going into the ground he's not
 

57
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,789
he's just going into the ground he's not
going to i'm going to shut it off so you

58
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
going to i'm going to shut it off so you
 

59
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,789
going to i'm going to shut it off so you
can see the difference

60
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
can see the difference
 

61
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,710
can see the difference
okay or i'm going to have tension

62
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
okay or i'm going to have tension
 

63
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,030
okay or i'm going to have tension
unnecessarily in my body and he pushes

64
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
unnecessarily in my body and he pushes
 

65
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,670
unnecessarily in my body and he pushes
and my legs will come up i'm just here

66
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
and my legs will come up i'm just here
 

67
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,070
and my legs will come up i'm just here
and we're just hanging out here all day

68
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
and we're just hanging out here all day
 

69
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,350
and we're just hanging out here all day
and then i'll change direction

70
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
and then i'll change direction
 

71
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,550
and then i'll change direction

stays on on me that's drill one

78
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
stays on on me that's drill one
 

79
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,310
stays on on me that's drill one
drill two i

80
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
drill two i
 

81
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,149
drill two i
have that same connection his ground

82
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
have that same connection his ground
 

83
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,910
have that same connection his ground
his center into his hands my ground into

84
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
his center into his hands my ground into
 

85
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,350
his center into his hands my ground into
my center into my hands

86
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
my center into my hands
 

87
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,030
my center into my hands
okay we're gonna go drill one okay here

88
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
okay we're gonna go drill one okay here
 

89
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,550
okay we're gonna go drill one okay here
then in and then percussively

90
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
then in and then percussively
 

91
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,109
then in and then percussively
boom

92
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119

 

93
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,950

as i do drill two it's important that he

94
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
as i do drill two it's important that he
 

95
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,389
as i do drill two it's important that he
does not shut his off

96
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
does not shut his off
 

97
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,670
does not shut his off
i want a good resistance

98
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
i want a good resistance
 

99
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,270
i want a good resistance
that i can trade myself with so

100
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
that i can trade myself with so
 

101
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,670
that i can trade myself with so
it's on and boom

102
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:21,680
it's on and boom
 

103
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,110
it's on and boom
and as i go you can up

104
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
and as i go you can up
 

105
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,229
and as i go you can up
the tension okay so he's upping the

106
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
the tension okay so he's upping the
 

107
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,110
the tension okay so he's upping the
tension

108
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
tension
 

109
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,470
tension
boom and i'll try to make my move

110
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
boom and i'll try to make my move
 

111
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,589
boom and i'll try to make my move
boom smaller and smaller

112
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
boom smaller and smaller
 

113
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,990
boom smaller and smaller
and make sure my hands are not going in

114
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
and make sure my hands are not going in
 

115
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,830
and make sure my hands are not going in
and out

116
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840

 

117
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,470

and more relaxed

118
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480

 

119
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,430

smaller and smaller

120
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440

 

121
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,949

okay okay so uh drill one is just

122
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
okay okay so uh drill one is just
 

123
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,350
okay okay so uh drill one is just
uh not to shut it at all

124
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360

 

125
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,070

but there's an absorption that happens

126
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
but there's an absorption that happens
 

127
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,869
but there's an absorption that happens
okay

128
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
okay
 

129
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,309
okay
so as i'm doing it externally though

130
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
so as i'm doing it externally though
 

131
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,430
so as i'm doing it externally though
so as he brings me back that

132
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
so as he brings me back that
 

133
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,309
so as he brings me back that
has his energy coming in and that's what

134
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
has his energy coming in and that's what
 

135
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,830
has his energy coming in and that's what
i use to displace

136
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
i use to displace
 

137
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,509
i use to displace
okay oh absorb

138
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
okay oh absorb
 

139
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,550
okay oh absorb
boom and the smaller i make that

140
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
boom and the smaller i make that
 

141
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,350
boom and the smaller i make that
the closer i'm gonna be to drill three

142
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
the closer i'm gonna be to drill three
 

143
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,390
the closer i'm gonna be to drill three
okay

144
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
okay
 

145
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,670
okay
so um i'm gonna go this time i'm gonna

146
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
so um i'm gonna go this time i'm gonna
 

147
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,030
so um i'm gonna go this time i'm gonna
start going forward

148
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
start going forward
 

149
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,589
start going forward
i'm gonna go forward and then he comes

150
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
i'm gonna go forward and then he comes
 

151
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,030
i'm gonna go forward and then he comes
back

152
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040

 

153
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:54,789

and i take that in so he comes in

154
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799

 

155
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,309

the other one i was young

156
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
the other one i was young
 

157
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,589
the other one i was young
pushing on this one he's coming

158
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
pushing on this one he's coming
 

159
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,229
pushing on this one he's coming
in and i'm hitting that ground do you

160
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
in and i'm hitting that ground do you
 

161
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,190
in and i'm hitting that ground do you
get it

162
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
get it
 

163
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:15,429
get it
okay so in boom

164
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
okay so in boom
 

165
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,550
okay so in boom
okay so again there's still

166
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
okay so again there's still
 

167
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,830
okay so again there's still
a disequilibrium formula

168
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
a disequilibrium formula
 

169
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,390
a disequilibrium formula
so it's still based on basin support

170
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
so it's still based on basin support
 

171
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,469
so it's still based on basin support
center of gravity line of gravity

172
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
center of gravity line of gravity
 

173
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,670
center of gravity line of gravity
okay i can't go over the top of his

174
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
okay i can't go over the top of his
 

175
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,230
okay i can't go over the top of his
center of gravity because then his line

176
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
center of gravity because then his line
 

177
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,629
center of gravity because then his line
of gravity is not getting displaced

178
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
of gravity is not getting displaced
 

179
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,189
of gravity is not getting displaced
and i can't go in front of his center of

180
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
and i can't go in front of his center of
 

181
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,310
and i can't go in front of his center of
gravity because

182
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
gravity because
 

183
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,830
gravity because
the line of gravity is not being

184
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
the line of gravity is not being
 

185
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,590
the line of gravity is not being
displaced outside

186
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
displaced outside
 

187
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,870
displaced outside
of the base of support so when he pushes

188
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
of the base of support so when he pushes
 

189
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,150
of the base of support so when he pushes
i still have to move that

190
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
i still have to move that
 

191
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,469
i still have to move that
center of gravity enough outside the

192
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
center of gravity enough outside the
 

193
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,590
center of gravity enough outside the
base of the support

194
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
base of the support
 

195
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,830
base of the support
so the line of gravity falls outside the

196
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
so the line of gravity falls outside the
 

197
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,950
so the line of gravity falls outside the
base of support

198
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
base of support
 

199
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,469
base of support
so even if so he goes to push

200
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
so even if so he goes to push
 

201
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,029
so even if so he goes to push
and i go over i did get some projection

202
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
and i go over i did get some projection
 

203
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:05,590
and i go over i did get some projection
but

204
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
but
 

205
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,430
but
it was going over it doesn't move the

206
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
it was going over it doesn't move the
 

207
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,110
it was going over it doesn't move the
center of gravity enough

208
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
center of gravity enough
 

209
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,950
center of gravity enough
let's say i'm on the line but i do a

210
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
let's say i'm on the line but i do a
 

211
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,469
let's say i'm on the line but i do a
little one it doesn't it's not going to

212
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
little one it doesn't it's not going to
 

213
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,749
little one it doesn't it's not going to
do it okay

214
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
do it okay
 

215
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,110
do it okay
i have to be able to get enough

216
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
i have to be able to get enough
 

217
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,990
i have to be able to get enough
of a projection on the center so that

218
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
of a projection on the center so that
 

219
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,909
of a projection on the center so that
the line of gravity moves over

220
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
the line of gravity moves over
 

221
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,189
the line of gravity moves over
okay so the beginner usually uh

222
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
okay so the beginner usually uh
 

223
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,469
okay so the beginner usually uh
is trying to reduce the resistance so

224
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
is trying to reduce the resistance so
 

225
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,230
is trying to reduce the resistance so
the person comes in they're like whoa

226
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
the person comes in they're like whoa
 

227
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,629
the person comes in they're like whoa
that's

228
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
that's
 

229
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,870
that's
heavy and then they try to reduce the

230
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
heavy and then they try to reduce the
 

231
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,830
heavy and then they try to reduce the
resistance

232
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
resistance
 

233
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,909
resistance
that's not what you want so you want

234
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
that's not what you want so you want
 

235
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,870
that's not what you want so you want
that heaviness

236
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
that heaviness
 

237
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,310
that heaviness
pull that's the thing you want to push

238
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
pull that's the thing you want to push
 

239
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,110
pull that's the thing you want to push
on

240
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
on
 

241
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:50,230
on
boom

242
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240

 

243
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,629

okay that thing you want to push on okay

244
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
okay that thing you want to push on okay
 

245
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,830
okay that thing you want to push on okay
try

246
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
try
 

247
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,150
try
so like you're going to start and you're

248
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
so like you're going to start and you're
 

249
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,029
so like you're going to start and you're
going to think

250
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
going to think
 

251
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,749
going to think
oh i i have his elbows locked out and

252
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
oh i i have his elbows locked out and
 

253
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,790
oh i i have his elbows locked out and
then i'm pushing

254
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
then i'm pushing
 

255
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,590
then i'm pushing
his elbows down okay so we got we have

256
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
his elbows down okay so we got we have
 

257
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,350
his elbows down okay so we got we have
to understand that's not what's

258
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
to understand that's not what's
 

259
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,670
to understand that's not what's
happening on you you can't do it you can

260
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
happening on you you can't do it you can
 

261
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,830
happening on you you can't do it you can
do that same move

262
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
do that same move
 

263
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,070
do that same move
but the engine is different so we're

264
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
but the engine is different so we're
 

265
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,029
but the engine is different so we're
going to do it

266
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
going to do it
 

267
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,710
going to do it
we're now going to do the same last two

268
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
we're now going to do the same last two
 

269
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,070
we're now going to do the same last two
drills but

270
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
drills but
 

271
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,110
drills but
from the

272
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
from the
 

273
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,230
from the
the side so i'm not gripping him

274
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
the side so i'm not gripping him
 

275
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,629
the side so i'm not gripping him
i'm here okay so he's gonna push me back

276
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
i'm here okay so he's gonna push me back
 

277
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,230
i'm here okay so he's gonna push me back
boom and then i'm gonna push him

278
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240

 

279
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:43,350

say he pushed me back and then actively

280
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360

 

281
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,430

so i don't grip this this is the eye key

282
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
so i don't grip this this is the eye key
 

283
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,270
so i don't grip this this is the eye key
application

284
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
application
 

285
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,749
application
of the same koku expression

286
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
of the same koku expression
 

287
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,110
of the same koku expression
okay try i start forward he starts back

288
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
okay try i start forward he starts back
 

289
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,510
okay try i start forward he starts back
and then he comes forward and he and he

290
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
and then he comes forward and he and he
 

291
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:13,830
and then he comes forward and he and he
hits that

292
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840

 

293
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:25,029

you can change direction

294
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039

 

295
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,309

it's the same thing so i'm not

296
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
it's the same thing so i'm not
 

297
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,950
it's the same thing so i'm not
struggling here he he's just going into

298
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
struggling here he he's just going into
 

299
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,189
struggling here he he's just going into
the he's just going into the ground

300
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
the he's just going into the ground
 

301
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,230
the he's just going into the ground
he's pushing i'm not leaning on him

302
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
he's pushing i'm not leaning on him
 

303
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,950
he's pushing i'm not leaning on him
he he's just stabilizing me every

304
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
he he's just stabilizing me every
 

305
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,790
he he's just stabilizing me every
everything's relaxed okay

306
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
everything's relaxed okay
 

307
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,189
everything's relaxed okay
well i'm gonna first change the angle

308
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
well i'm gonna first change the angle
 

309
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,550
well i'm gonna first change the angle
slightly

310
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
slightly
 

311
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,909
slightly
so that he starts to tilt do you get it

312
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919

 

313
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,189

so it's going to go here boom and then

314
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
so it's going to go here boom and then
 

315
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,550
so it's going to go here boom and then
here is where he hits the

316
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
here is where he hits the
 

317
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,589
here is where he hits the
in space at this new vector

318
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
in space at this new vector
 

319
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,950
in space at this new vector
so just like in the other drill um

320
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
so just like in the other drill um
 

321
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,710
so just like in the other drill um
when he came forward boom he hits that

322
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
when he came forward boom he hits that
 

323
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,589
when he came forward boom he hits that
space

324
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
space
 

325
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,869
space
he's gonna hit that space over here

326
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
he's gonna hit that space over here
 

327
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,749
he's gonna hit that space over here
boom is where it hits it do you get that

328
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
boom is where it hits it do you get that
 

329
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,309
boom is where it hits it do you get that
it's not

330
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
it's not
 

331
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,430
it's not
it's not me going like this that's not

332
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
it's not me going like this that's not
 

333
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,629
it's not me going like this that's not
what's happening

334
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
what's happening
 

335
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,070
what's happening
okay so it's here like this i'm going to

336
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
okay so it's here like this i'm going to
 

337
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,430
okay so it's here like this i'm going to
clear the line

338
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
clear the line
 

339
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,430
clear the line
i'm going to bring this over here

340
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
i'm going to bring this over here
 

341
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,550
i'm going to bring this over here
foaming that spot

342
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
foaming that spot
 

343
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,510
foaming that spot
okay so the harder just like the same

344
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
okay so the harder just like the same
 

345
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,070
okay so the harder just like the same
thing

346
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
thing
 

347
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,310
thing
the harder he's pushing the more stable

348
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
the harder he's pushing the more stable
 

349
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,269
the harder he's pushing the more stable
i become

350
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
i become
 

351
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,269
i become
so the same thing the harder he's

352
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
so the same thing the harder he's
 

353
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,310
so the same thing the harder he's
pushing

354
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
pushing
 

355
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,190
pushing
the more he goes into the position you

356
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
the more he goes into the position you
 

357
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,310
the more he goes into the position you
see that

358
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
see that
 

359
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:51,670
see that
then my arm moves to stay with him

360
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680

 

361
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,949

so it's not me manipulating him

362
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
so it's not me manipulating him
 

363
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:06,829
so it's not me manipulating him
you see it's just another cookie

364
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839

 

365
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:23,350

projection

366
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360

 

367
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,070

okay let's try this step okay so you

368
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
okay let's try this step okay so you
 

369
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,550
okay let's try this step okay so you
have an

370
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
have an
 

371
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,829
have an
external understanding of

372
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
external understanding of
 

373
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,190
external understanding of
you so he's he's pushing

374
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
you so he's he's pushing
 

375
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,470
you so he's he's pushing
and then i'm going to externally yield

376
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
and then i'm going to externally yield
 

377
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,389
and then i'm going to externally yield
do you understand but there's an

378
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
do you understand but there's an
 

379
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,870
do you understand but there's an
internal understanding of it too

380
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
internal understanding of it too
 

381
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,470
internal understanding of it too
so that's what we're doing here so

382
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
so that's what we're doing here so
 

383
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,990
so that's what we're doing here so
uh when when he pushes into me

384
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
uh when when he pushes into me
 

385
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,230
uh when when he pushes into me
i'm letting that energy go to the ground

386
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240

 

387
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,550

he pushes into me and it goes through me

388
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
he pushes into me and it goes through me
 

389
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,590
he pushes into me and it goes through me
to the ground

390
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
to the ground
 

391
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,389
to the ground
you see do you understand that concept

392
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
you see do you understand that concept
 

393
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,070
you see do you understand that concept
okay

394
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
okay
 

395
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,069
okay
so uh when he's coming

396
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
so uh when he's coming
 

397
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,590
so uh when he's coming
through me i start with an external

398
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
through me i start with an external
 

399
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,310
through me i start with an external
just to create a geometry where the line

400
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
just to create a geometry where the line
 

401
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,910
just to create a geometry where the line
of gravity

402
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920

403
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,110
of gravity
and the base of support is going to

404
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
and the base of support is going to
 

405
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,230
and the base of support is going to
lead to a geometry of falling but i'm

406
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
lead to a geometry of falling but i'm
 

407
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,670
lead to a geometry of falling but i'm
not

408
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
not
 

409
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,509
not
going and doing that

410
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
going and doing that
 

411
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,670
going and doing that
you pay attention so he's going to have

412
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
you pay attention so he's going to have
 

413
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,269
you pay attention so he's going to have
his aggressive action he has his

414
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
his aggressive action he has his
 

415
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,949
his aggressive action he has his
displacement copper

416
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
displacement copper
 

417
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,990
displacement copper
that's the energy that i used

418
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
that's the energy that i used
 

419
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,509
that's the energy that i used
he's off my arm is going up

420
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
he's off my arm is going up
 

421
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,590
he's off my arm is going up
as he's going out not my arm

422
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
as he's going out not my arm
 

423
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,350
as he's going out not my arm
is making him go with his weights on me

424
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
is making him go with his weights on me
 

425
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,389
is making him go with his weights on me
do you understand that difference so he

426
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
do you understand that difference so he
 

427
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,030
do you understand that difference so he
he hits he's going to hit boom that spot

428
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
he hits he's going to hit boom that spot
 

429
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,910
he hits he's going to hit boom that spot
and at the angle he's at it creates the

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
and at the angle he's at it creates the
 

431
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,509
and at the angle he's at it creates the
topsy-turny effect

432
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
topsy-turny effect
 

433
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,710
topsy-turny effect
it's not me going here and moving him

434
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
it's not me going here and moving him
 

435
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,030
it's not me going here and moving him

external leverage advantage it could be

438
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
external leverage advantage it could be
 

439
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,430
external leverage advantage it could be
a leverage advantage wouldn't be strong

440
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
a leverage advantage wouldn't be strong
 

441
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,630
a leverage advantage wouldn't be strong
enough

442
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
enough
 

443
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,949
enough
it might not be it's like the boulder's

444
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
it might not be it's like the boulder's
 

445
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,910
it might not be it's like the boulder's
big enough

okay this is the internal
so he goes

454
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
so he goes
 

455
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,250
so he goes
and my arm stays up with him so

456
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:25,260

going back to the other two drills okay

476
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
going back to the other two drills okay
 

477
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,629
going back to the other two drills okay
i would say that the first one is about

478
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
i would say that the first one is about
 

479
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,030
i would say that the first one is about
just not having on and off

480
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
just not having on and off
 

481
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,750
just not having on and off
this would be a mindfulness problem

482
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
this would be a mindfulness problem
 

483
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,710

problem okay and then i just wanted to

486
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
problem okay and then i just wanted to

make sure you have the the correct
 

489
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,670
make sure you have the the correct
vector so

490
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
vector so
 

491
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,470
vector so
in here and then i wanted it percussive

492
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,480
in here and then i wanted it percussive
 

493
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,870

again

504
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519

505
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,550

i wanted it home for

506
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560

that i'm not it's not group dependent

512
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
that i'm not it's not group dependent
 

513
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,910
that i'm not it's not group dependent
it's not joint dependent

514
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
it's not joint dependent
 

515
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,750
it's not joint dependent
okay um so now we're in the technique

516
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
okay um so now we're in the technique
 

517
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,110
okay um so now we're in the technique
and i need those lessons

518
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
and i need those lessons
 

519
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,430
and i need those lessons
it's not group dependent it's not joint

520
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
it's not group dependent it's not joint
 

521
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,110
it's not group dependent it's not joint
dependent

522
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
dependent
 

523
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,710
dependent
and it's relative to how much energy i

524
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
and it's relative to how much energy i
 

525
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,350
and it's relative to how much energy i
let in

526
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
let in
 

527
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,230
let in
i have to let it in okay and so the

528
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
i have to let it in okay and so the
 

529
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,790
i have to let it in okay and so the
beginner mistake is to always keep it up

530
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
beginner mistake is to always keep it up
 

531
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,350
beginner mistake is to always keep it up
and keep it out like that okay and then

532
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
and keep it out like that okay and then
 

533
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,910
and keep it out like that okay and then
you don't

534
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920
you don't
 

535
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,990
you don't
have any rebounding because you didn't

536
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
have any rebounding because you didn't
 

537
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,269
have any rebounding because you didn't
let the energy in

538
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
let the energy in
 

539
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,829
let the energy in
and in fact you're contesting the energy

540
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
and in fact you're contesting the energy
 

541
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,870
and in fact you're contesting the energy
that's coming out

542
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:14,880
that's coming out
 

543
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,990
that's coming out
okay so when i go here i want

544
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
okay so when i go here i want
 

545
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,230
okay so when i go here i want
i want him to go in and hit

546
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
i want him to go in and hit
 

547
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,629
i want him to go in and hit
that vector do you understand and how

548
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
that vector do you understand and how
 

549
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,150
that vector do you understand and how
far he goes out

550
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
far he goes out
 

551
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,350
far he goes out
is dependent upon how much i let in

552
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
is dependent upon how much i let in
 

553
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,150
is dependent upon how much i let in
how much young there is is depending on

554
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
how much young there is is depending on
 

555
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,750
how much young there is is depending on
how much yin there is

556
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
how much yin there is
 

557
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,310
how much yin there is
so when you try to get him to go further

558
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
so when you try to get him to go further
 

559
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,310
so when you try to get him to go further
out don't make the mistake

560
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
out don't make the mistake
 

561
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,189
out don't make the mistake
and do more yaw you have to do more yin

562
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
and do more yaw you have to do more yin
 

563
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,150
and do more yaw you have to do more yin
okay

564
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
okay
 

565
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,710
okay
so we're going and i'm bringing his

566
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
so we're going and i'm bringing his
 

567
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,189
so we're going and i'm bringing his
weight

568
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:45,199
weight
 

569
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,509
weight
onto me and he'll bounce off

570
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
onto me and he'll bounce off
 

571
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,470
onto me and he'll bounce off
so i'm exaggerating it with my arm as

572
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
so i'm exaggerating it with my arm as
 

573
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,790
so i'm exaggerating it with my arm as
you can tell right so i want him to come

574
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:54,800
you can tell right so i want him to come
 

575
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,550
you can tell right so i want him to come
into me

576
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560

 

577
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,470

and i wanted to hit that ground vector

578
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
and i wanted to hit that ground vector
 

579
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,020
and i wanted to hit that ground vector
at that angle

580
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,030
at that angle
 

581
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:09,990
at that angle
[Music]

582
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000

 

583
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,069

the difference is is whether this arm's

584
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
the difference is is whether this arm's
 

585
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,269
the difference is is whether this arm's
pushing

586
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
pushing
 

587
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,189
pushing
or whether this arm was letting his

588
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199
or whether this arm was letting his
 

589
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,550
or whether this arm was letting his
energy still come in

590
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
energy still come in
 

591
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,310
energy still come in
boom and he hits that spot

592
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:20,320
boom and he hits that spot
 

593
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:33,269
boom and he hits that spot
so boom boom

594
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279

 

595
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,389

okay let's go try it again okay so

596
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:36,399
okay let's go try it again okay so
 

597
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,550
okay let's go try it again okay so
the question was on the first two girls

598
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:40,560
the question was on the first two girls
 

599
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,590
the question was on the first two girls
how do you not uh so he goes

600
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
how do you not uh so he goes
 

601
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,509
how do you not uh so he goes
forward how do you not let that happen

602
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
forward how do you not let that happen
 

603
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,470
forward how do you not let that happen
it's happening because at the beginning

604
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
it's happening because at the beginning
 

605
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:50,870
it's happening because at the beginning
to

606
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
to
 

607
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,910
to
create the organization you tense

608
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
create the organization you tense
 

609
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,590
create the organization you tense
everything up

610
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:55,600
everything up
 

611
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,910
everything up
okay and what to continue to advance

612
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
okay and what to continue to advance
 

613
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,710
okay and what to continue to advance
you don't want that it's fine in the

614
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
you don't want that it's fine in the
 

615
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,430
you don't want that it's fine in the
beginning

616
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
beginning
 

617
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,110
beginning
to have a solid organization

618
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
to have a solid organization
 

619
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,829
to have a solid organization
but as you get going that's too much to

620
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
but as you get going that's too much to
 

621
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,590
but as you get going that's too much to
ask of marshally

622
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
ask of marshally
 

623
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,829
ask of marshally
it's not really what you want to do

624
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
it's not really what you want to do
 

625
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,629
it's not really what you want to do
anyways because it reduces the yin

626
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639
anyways because it reduces the yin
 

627
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,430
anyways because it reduces the yin
absorption you understand that so you

628
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
absorption you understand that so you
 

629
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,350
absorption you understand that so you
can't project because

630
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
can't project because
 

631
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,710
can't project because
you're too flexed you're over organized

632
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
you're too flexed you're over organized
 

633
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,110
you're too flexed you're over organized
for example and there's not enough ian

634
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
for example and there's not enough ian
 

635
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,949
for example and there's not enough ian
absorption so the yam

636
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
absorption so the yam
 

637
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,990
absorption so the yam
release is not as great as it could be

638
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
release is not as great as it could be
 

639
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,269
release is not as great as it could be
so all you really need

640
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
so all you really need
 

641
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,949
so all you really need
is whatever contact point you have

642
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
is whatever contact point you have
 

643
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,150
is whatever contact point you have
through that center of your body maybe

644
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
through that center of your body maybe
 

645
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,590
through that center of your body maybe
not even that

646
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
not even that
 

647
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,710
not even that
but then a relationship of a greater

648
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
but then a relationship of a greater
 

649
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,590
but then a relationship of a greater
mass

650
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
mass
 

651
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,189
mass
okay so um

652
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
okay so um
 

653
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,629
okay so um
for example as as i'm here

654
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
for example as as i'm here
 

655
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,550
for example as as i'm here
you could you could be in very

656
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
you could you could be in very
 

657
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,069
you could you could be in very
awkward positions and i can still

658
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
awkward positions and i can still
 

659
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,829
awkward positions and i can still
find the movement

660
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:06,839

 

661
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,030

so you can still do it

662
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
so you can still do it
 

663
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,389
so you can still do it
um so if i

664
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
um so if i
 

665
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,710
um so if i
am here okay this seems very weird

666
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
am here okay this seems very weird
 

667
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,030
am here okay this seems very weird
but my right uh big toe

668
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,040
but my right uh big toe
 

669
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,790
but my right uh big toe
and part of the right ball of the foot

670
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
and part of the right ball of the foot
 

671
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,110
and part of the right ball of the foot
is able to ground vector so he's going

672
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
is able to ground vector so he's going
 

673
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,069
is able to ground vector so he's going
to push

674
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
to push
 

675
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,069
to push
and you see if you feel that we're not

676
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,079
and you see if you feel that we're not
 

677
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,990
and you see if you feel that we're not
going anywhere so with that

678
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,000
going anywhere so with that
 

679
