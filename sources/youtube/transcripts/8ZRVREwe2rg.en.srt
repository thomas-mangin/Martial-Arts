00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,120
thank you so it's very common when
 

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,009
thank you so it's very common when
people do China and go you'll be not gay

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:10,019
people do China and go you'll be not gay
 

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,950
people do China and go you'll be not gay
is the person will come in

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
is the person will come in

doesn't matter if they're straight

8
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:14,880
doesn't matter if they're straight
 

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,730
doesn't matter if they're straight
sometimes you make a big deal out of

10
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:16,740
sometimes you make a big deal out of
 

11
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,529
sometimes you make a big deal out of
being angled

12
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:18,539
being angled
 

13
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,330
being angled
and then they hold really tight here

14
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:23,340
and then they hold really tight here
 

15
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,670
and then they hold really tight here
so if you look at me my tactic is not my

16
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:28,680
so if you look at me my tactic is not my
 

17
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,089
so if you look at me my tactic is not my
spinal displacement okay

18
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:32,099
spinal displacement okay
 

19
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,709
spinal displacement okay
his tactic is a turning tactic so these

20
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
his tactic is a turning tactic so these
 

21
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,990
his tactic is a turning tactic so these
don't go together so I don't have a

22
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,000
don't go together so I don't have a
 

23
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,630
don't go together so I don't have a
young tactic he's trying to do a Yin

24
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:41,640
young tactic he's trying to do a Yin
 

25
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,049
young tactic he's trying to do a Yin
tactic it doesn't work okay and we made

26
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:45,059
tactic it doesn't work okay and we made
 

27
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,470
tactic it doesn't work okay and we made
that point in uh Gateway Aikido video 15

28
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:48,480
that point in uh Gateway Aikido video 15
 

29
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,029
that point in uh Gateway Aikido video 15
okay so you you reverse engineer uh I'm

30
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
okay so you you reverse engineer uh I'm
 

31
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,850
okay so you you reverse engineer uh I'm
now nage if you reverse engineer that

32
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:55,860
now nage if you reverse engineer that
 

33
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,330
now nage if you reverse engineer that
I'm going to do a turn then he must do a

34
00:00:59,330 --> 00:00:59,340
I'm going to do a turn then he must do a
 

35
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,389
I'm going to do a turn then he must do a
young chapter okay

36
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
young chapter okay
 

37
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,670
young chapter okay
um so hence

38
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:04,680
um so hence
 

39
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,190
um so hence
he's pushing me

40
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
he's pushing me
 

41
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,429
he's pushing me
there's his spinal displacement

42
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:10,439
there's his spinal displacement
 

43
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,490
there's his spinal displacement
and I'm going to turn him and turn

44
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:13,500
and I'm going to turn him and turn
 

45
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,109
and I'm going to turn him and turn
myself

46
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
myself
 

47
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,649
myself
this is how we do it now okay

48
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:18,659
this is how we do it now okay
 

49
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,469
this is how we do it now okay
sometimes

50
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:21,479
sometimes
 

51
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,429
sometimes
people not understanding the Tactical

52
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
people not understanding the Tactical
 

53
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,910
people not understanding the Tactical
opening for an attorney movement

54
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:28,920
opening for an attorney movement
 

55
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,270
opening for an attorney movement
make a big deal over the risk technique

56
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:32,280
make a big deal over the risk technique
 

57
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,550
make a big deal over the risk technique
so he and he'll grab really hard to hold

58
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
so he and he'll grab really hard to hold
 

59
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,490
so he and he'll grab really hard to hold
it in place and then I don't know why

60
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:37,500
it in place and then I don't know why
 

61
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,890
it in place and then I don't know why
but some for some reason

62
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:39,900
but some for some reason
 

63
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,050
but some for some reason
this is considered what you want to do

64
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,060
this is considered what you want to do
 

65
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,749
this is considered what you want to do
it's some sort of joint manipulation is

66
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
it's some sort of joint manipulation is
 

67
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,450
it's some sort of joint manipulation is
some sort of Leverage uh manipulation

68
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:50,460
some sort of Leverage uh manipulation
 

69
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,330
some sort of Leverage uh manipulation
again that is not Aikido we we don't

70
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:53,340
again that is not Aikido we we don't
 

71
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,109
again that is not Aikido we we don't
look to overpower our person our our UK

72
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
look to overpower our person our our UK
 

73
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,149
look to overpower our person our our UK
or our opponent through leverage because

74
00:01:59,149 --> 00:01:59,159
or our opponent through leverage because
 

75
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,030
or our opponent through leverage because
Leverage is nothing more than a

76
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,040
Leverage is nothing more than a
 

77
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,010
Leverage is nothing more than a
mechanical advantage and mechanical

78
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,020
mechanical advantage and mechanical
 

79
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,290
mechanical advantage and mechanical
advantage is relative so for example

80
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:09,300
advantage is relative so for example
 

81
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,229
advantage is relative so for example
she's gonna do it you're not yet when

82
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
she's gonna do it you're not yet when
 

83
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,570
she's gonna do it you're not yet when
you duplicate what I did

84
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:14,580
you duplicate what I did
 

85
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,430
you duplicate what I did
yeah we'll let her do it the first time

86
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:16,440
yeah we'll let her do it the first time
 

87
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,250
yeah we'll let her do it the first time
this one just goes here straight under

88
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:19,260
this one just goes here straight under
 

89
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,830
this one just goes here straight under
get your weight under you and you go

90
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
get your weight under you and you go
 

91
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,510
get your weight under you and you go
okay cool don't don't let her do it

92
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:26,520
okay cool don't don't let her do it
 

93
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,070
okay cool don't don't let her do it
okay

94
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
okay
 

95
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,910
okay
so I could do it on him I could get that

96
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
so I could do it on him I could get that
 

97
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,150
so I could do it on him I could get that
leverage on him like she could not okay

98
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160

 

99
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,229

um

100
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:41,239

 

101
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,930

so that's not Aikido

102
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:44,940
so that's not Aikido
 

103
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,270
so that's not Aikido
from a physical point of view

104
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
from a physical point of view
 

105
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,190
from a physical point of view
but from an energetic point of view

106
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
but from an energetic point of view
 

107
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,410
but from an energetic point of view
remember there's three components an

108
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:51,420
remember there's three components an
 

109
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,930
remember there's three components an
energetic component is the is the

110
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:53,940
energetic component is the is the
 

111
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,610
energetic component is the is the
important one because it stands between

112
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:55,620
important one because it stands between
 

113
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,830
important one because it stands between
the spiritual component and the physical

114
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
the spiritual component and the physical
 

115
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,290
the spiritual component and the physical
component

116
00:02:59,290 --> 00:02:59,300
component
 

117
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,210
component
energetically uh there's something else

118
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:02,220
energetically uh there's something else
 

119
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,410
energetically uh there's something else
that happens

120
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:03,420
that happens
 

121
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,070
that happens
that allows for most people to not

122
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,080
that allows for most people to not
 

123
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,130
that allows for most people to not
problematize what we just did there and

124
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:10,140
problematize what we just did there and
 

125
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,550
problematize what we just did there and
that is

126
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:13,560

 

127
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,390

and uh in some lineages you'll see

128
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,400
and uh in some lineages you'll see
 

129
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,930
and uh in some lineages you'll see
they'll have a good grip but then they

130
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:20,940
they'll have a good grip but then they
 

131
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,550
they'll have a good grip but then they
let him go ahead and do that technique

132
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
let him go ahead and do that technique
 

133
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,910
let him go ahead and do that technique
this right here

134
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920

 

135
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,149

so I took my palm off of the technique

136
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:29,159
so I took my palm off of the technique
 

137
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,729
so I took my palm off of the technique
and this is this is because they do not

138
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:31,739
and this is this is because they do not
 

139
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,190
and this is this is because they do not
recognize the energetic aspect of King

140
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,200
recognize the energetic aspect of King
 

141
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,770
recognize the energetic aspect of King

okay so and this is where you first get

184
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,440
okay so and this is where you first get
 

185
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,129
okay so and this is where you first get
that IC adhesion going

186
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:40,139
that IC adhesion going
 

187
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,770
that IC adhesion going
means I'm sensitive to the relationship

188
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:42,780
means I'm sensitive to the relationship
 

189
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,129
means I'm sensitive to the relationship

between my palm and him and I can bring
 

191
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,510
between my palm and him and I can bring
awareness to it so I don't need a grip

192
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:50,520
awareness to it so I don't need a grip
 

193
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,689
awareness to it so I don't need a grip
but I bring that idea Legion in at the

00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:53,699
but I bring that idea Legion in at the
 

195
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,150
but I bring that idea Legion in at the
pump and if he throws the strike as

we've been doing that is now on the palm

198
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:58,919
we've been doing that is now on the palm
 

199
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,390

00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:56,700

 

341
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,690

okay let's try it

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:26,700
in Taino haircut I know it looks like
 

399
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,670
in Taino haircut I know it looks like
it's going inward but it's a Taoist

400
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:28,680
it's going inward but it's a Taoist
 

401

I change my footwork you would see that

404
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
I change my footwork you would see that
 

405
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,490
I change my footwork you would see that
it is coming upward it appears to go

406
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:37,500
it is coming upward it appears to go
 

407
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,490
it is coming upward it appears to go
inward because I rotate as it's going

408
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:40,500
inward because I rotate as it's going
 

409
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,850
inward because I rotate as it's going
into a shape

410
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:43,860
into a shape

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,970
into a shape
is the hour spiral you you should think

um now for the Ashi sabaki the footwork

416
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:52,279
um now for the Ashi sabaki the footwork
 

417
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,130
um now for the Ashi sabaki the footwork
midfoot Vector on the back foot so

418
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:55,140
midfoot Vector on the back foot so
 

419
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,590
midfoot Vector on the back foot so
there's that sacred spot on the right

420
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
there's that sacred spot on the right
 

421
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,389
there's that sacred spot on the right
foot in this case I turn him

422
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
foot in this case I turn him
 

423
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,810
foot in this case I turn him
I create the yin the tsuki for me to

424
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:05,820
I create the yin the tsuki for me to
 

425
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,850
I create the yin the tsuki for me to
enter into it okay

426
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:07,860
enter into it okay
 

427
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,949
enter into it okay
my footwork

428
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:09,959
my footwork
 

429
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,710
my footwork
is not going to be here

430
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
is not going to be here
 

431
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,690
is not going to be here
because the fight

432
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:14,700
because the fight
 

433
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,170
because the fight
is rotating

434
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,180

 

435
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,050

if I step straight

436
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:21,060
if I step straight
 

437
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,170
if I step straight
you're going to say that you lose the

438
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:24,180
you're going to say that you lose the
 

439
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,569
you're going to say that you lose the
outward spiral you're gonna have to make

440
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:26,579
outward spiral you're gonna have to make
 

441
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,910
outward spiral you're gonna have to make
it an Inward and up one now and when you

442
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:28,920
it an Inward and up one now and when you
 

443
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,550
it an Inward and up one now and when you
do that you're gonna lose eye adhesion

444
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:31,560
do that you're gonna lose eye adhesion
 

445
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,650
do that you're gonna lose eye adhesion
because you're going to go positive on

446
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:33,660
because you're going to go positive on
 

447
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,050
because you're going to go positive on
the young side plus song and you end up

448
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:36,060
the young side plus song and you end up
 

449
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,710
the young side plus song and you end up
pulling them around

450
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:39,720

 

451
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,590

so as the five rotates I step on the

452
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
so as the five rotates I step on the
 

453
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,170
so as the five rotates I step on the
rotation

454
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,180

 

455
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,170

you try to watch my right foot

456
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,180
you try to watch my right foot
 

457
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,630
you try to watch my right foot
as it rotates

458
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:53,640
as it rotates
 

459
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,509
as it rotates
I step on the rotation

460
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519

 

461
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,210

I don't want to think in an XY grid

462
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:02,220
I don't want to think in an XY grid
 

463
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,470
I don't want to think in an XY grid
which is what you have here

464
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480

 

465
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,910

this thing is rotating

466
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:10,920

 

467
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,170

the whole thing is rotating

468
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:15,180

 

469
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,190

so rotate your EDB EDM doesn't mean

470
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
so rotate your EDB EDM doesn't mean
 

471
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,310
so rotate your EDB EDM doesn't mean
straight it means to enter in with the

472
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
straight it means to enter in with the
 

473
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,530
straight it means to enter in with the
body enter into what into the center of

474
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:24,540
body enter into what into the center of
 

475
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,110
body enter into what into the center of
the rotation but the rotation is moving

476
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
the rotation but the rotation is moving
 

477
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,750
the rotation but the rotation is moving
so you have to also be rotating As you

478
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
so you have to also be rotating As you
 

479
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,310
so you have to also be rotating As you
move to the center of the rotation

480
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320

 

481
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,750

we'll go back to the right foot

482
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:38,760

 

483
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,769

that rotation now marks

484
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:42,779
that rotation now marks
 

485
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,170
that rotation now marks
where your 10 bond is

486
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:45,180
where your 10 bond is
 

487
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:51,230
where your 10 bond is
maybe come to this side

488
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:51,240

 

489
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,730

you don't want to ten con

490
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:55,740
you don't want to ten con
 

491
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,790
you don't want to ten con
in such a way that that foot is now

492
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
in such a way that that foot is now
 

493
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,889
in such a way that that foot is now
turning out against you

494
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:00,899
turning out against you
 

495
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,889
turning out against you
and you're in this

496
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:03,899
and you're in this
 

497
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,870
and you're in this
goofy stance

498
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:05,880
goofy stance
 

499
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,449
goofy stance
this is not Marshall you're on a tight

500
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:08,459
this is not Marshall you're on a tight
 

501
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:12,829
this is not Marshall you're on a tight
rope and this is not anatomically sound

502
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:12,839
rope and this is not anatomically sound
 

503
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,310
rope and this is not anatomically sound
it's gonna hurt your knee

504
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320

 

505
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:23,569

so as I go I enter on the rotation

506

and that marks
 

509
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,009
and that marks
where my other foot can go

00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:31,019

 

511
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,889

so that I don't keep over rotating it

okay let's try it so we had a question

560
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:55,380
okay let's try it so we had a question
 

561
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,509
okay let's try it so we had a question
here as you can uh not feeling the

562
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
here as you can uh not feeling the
 

563
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,670
here as you can uh not feeling the
connection

564
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
connection
 

565
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,389

00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:05,399
um your job as UK is to maintain the
 

567
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,370
um your job as UK is to maintain the
connection okay because energetically

568
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:07,380
connection okay because energetically
 

569
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,910
connection okay because energetically
that's what's happening okay

570
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:10,920
that's what's happening okay
 

571
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,069
that's what's happening okay
um you can always just engage a

572
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:13,079
um you can always just engage a
 

573
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,290
um you can always just engage a
connection as we demonstrated in the

574
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:15,300
connection as we demonstrated in the
 

575
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,050
connection as we demonstrated in the
final part it was a part five of uh

Gateway Aikido video 15 okay
 

579
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,470
Gateway Aikido video 15 okay
um marshally that would open you up back

580
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
um marshally that would open you up back
 

581
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,230
um marshally that would open you up back
to Young tactics but energetically it's

582
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:27,240
to Young tactics but energetically it's
 

583
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,790
to Young tactics but energetically it's
like letting all the air out of a

584
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
like letting all the air out of a
 

585
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,430
like letting all the air out of a
balloon it just deflates okay

586
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
balloon it just deflates okay
 

587
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,370
balloon it just deflates okay
uh usually when we do this and you were

588
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:34,380
uh usually when we do this and you were
 

589
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,210
uh usually when we do this and you were
doing it here is as he go you you pushed

590
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:38,220
doing it here is as he go you you pushed
 

591
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,629
doing it here is as he go you you pushed
it originally and then as he goes you're

592
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:41,639
it originally and then as he goes you're
 

593
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,189
it originally and then as he goes you're
moving around in this way okay you end

594
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:46,199
moving around in this way okay you end
 

595
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,769
moving around in this way okay you end
up running around him

596
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:48,779
up running around him
 

597
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,389
up running around him
you can go a little quicker so I can

598
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
you can go a little quicker so I can
 

599
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,430
you can go a little quicker so I can
demonstrate

600
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:52,440
demonstrate
 

601
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,129
demonstrate
see that but if you pay attention you'll

602
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:55,139
see that but if you pay attention you'll
 

603
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,810
see that but if you pay attention you'll
be able to feel it you guys might not

604
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:56,820
be able to feel it you guys might not
 

605
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,470
be able to feel it you guys might not
see it is the pressure at the Ikea

606
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
see it is the pressure at the Ikea
 

607
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,629
see it is the pressure at the Ikea
adhesion at the contact Point goes up

608
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
adhesion at the contact Point goes up
 

609
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,430
adhesion at the contact Point goes up
and down up and down in energetic value

610
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:04,440
and down up and down in energetic value
 

611
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,410
and down up and down in energetic value
okay so you'll recognize it here and uh

612
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:09,420
okay so you'll recognize it here and uh
 

613
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,810
okay so you'll recognize it here and uh
as as you start and you feel see how I

614
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:11,820
as as you start and you feel see how I
 

615
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,090
as as you start and you feel see how I
do that you see that and now it's off

616
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,100
do that you see that and now it's off
 

617
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,990
do that you see that and now it's off
okay now for you if you watch my Center

618
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
okay now for you if you watch my Center
 

619
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,769
okay now for you if you watch my Center
my Center is going to disengage okay so

620
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:21,779
my Center is going to disengage okay so
 

621
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,350
my Center is going to disengage okay so
as he goes you see it goes backwards if

622
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:24,360
as he goes you see it goes backwards if
 

623
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,350
as he goes you see it goes backwards if
you watch but if I if I'm driving the

624
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
you watch but if I if I'm driving the
 

625
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,090

young energy my Center is going to go

626
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,100
young energy my Center is going to go
 

627
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,269
young energy my Center is going to go
forward and it'll fall into the empty

628
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:32,279
forward and it'll fall into the empty
 

629
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,069
forward and it'll fall into the empty

640
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
fields and he moves and boom you'll fall
 

641
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,329

647
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,930

but let us say at least cosmetically go

648
00:16:59,930 --> 00:16:59,940
but let us say at least cosmetically go
 

649
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,250
but let us say at least cosmetically go
it's not keep going it's not this

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,549

in my experience what it tends to be

654
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:13,559
in my experience what it tends to be
 

655
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,090
in my experience what it tends to be
is uh an initial fall

656
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:17,100
is uh an initial fall
