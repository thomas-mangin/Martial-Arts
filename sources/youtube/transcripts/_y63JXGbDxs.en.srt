a year before i released them
 

225
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,029
a year before i released them
to the general public

consider the breath
 

233
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,870
consider the breath
because of all the things i've already

spoken about the arts the different
 

237
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,909
spoken about the arts the different
ways in

00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
ways in
 

239
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,189
ways in
which they all

have a name
 

243
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,390
have a name
but it all means

244
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
but it all means
 

245
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,230
but it all means
that you should use the breath

246
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
that you should use the breath
 

247
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,110
that you should use the breath
efficiently

248
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120

 

249
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,350

learning to use the breath is an art in

try to make the out breath longer
 

265
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,230
try to make the out breath longer
it may seem a confusing thing because if

266
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
it may seem a confusing thing because if
 

267
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,830
it may seem a confusing thing because if
you take an

269
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,029

in-breath how can you make the out

00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
in-breath how can you make the out
 

271
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,390
in-breath how can you make the out
breath longer

273
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,189

well it's called muscle control and the

00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
well it's called muscle control and the
 

275
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,870
well it's called muscle control and the
mind is working at making it longer

00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
mind is working at making it longer
 

277
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,110
mind is working at making it longer
perhaps there's some still left in the

278
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
perhaps there's some still left in the
 

279
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,309
perhaps there's some still left in the
lungs and if as the lungs expand become

280
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
lungs and if as the lungs expand become
 

281
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,070
lungs and if as the lungs expand become
more efficient the more air they will

282
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
more efficient the more air they will
 

283
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,629
more efficient the more air they will
hold and the more efficient

284
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
hold and the more efficient
 

285
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,189
hold and the more efficient
the control will be

286
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
the control will be
 

287
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:25,749
the control will be

so you see
 

315
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,510
so you see
we need the breath

316
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
we need the breath
 

317
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,110
we need the breath
in many things

318
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
in many things
 

319
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,469
in many things
and for the normal 24 7 your body will

and for the normal 24 7 your body will
 

321
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,029
and for the normal 24 7 your body will
regulate how much you need

322

regulate how much you need
 

323
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,070
regulate how much you need
if you over exercise or demand too much

going up a hill or something this could
 

327
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,909
going up a hill or something this could
call upon you needing more breath

328
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
call upon you needing more breath
 

329
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,830
call upon you needing more breath
if you haven't learned to be efficient

with your breath
 

333
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,790
with your breath
then it's going to be harder for you to

334
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
then it's going to be harder for you to
 

335
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,150
then it's going to be harder for you to
recover

your breath
 

341
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,469
your breath
then it's fuel that you need to make the

then it's fuel that you need to make the
 

343
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,950
then it's fuel that you need to make the
body recuperate quicker

344
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
body recuperate quicker
