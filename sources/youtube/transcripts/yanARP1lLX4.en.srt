after the the rocking and the movement
 

285
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,550
after the the rocking and the movement
and the imbalancing of my body

286
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
and the imbalancing of my body
 

287
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,150
and the imbalancing of my body
it's like holding on clutching onto the

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
it's like holding on clutching onto the
 

289
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,170
it's like holding on clutching onto the
edge

290
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:21,180
edge
 

291
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,969

00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:30,300
and it does pass
 

297
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,350
and it does pass
but while this is going on

298
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
