want you to stop hang out there for a
little while feel

172
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120

 

173
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,870

that okay try to the next drill

174
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
that okay try to the next drill
 

175
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,710
that okay try to the next drill
progression two

176
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
progression two
 

177
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,350
progression two
here okay you line it up and again now I

178
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
here okay you line it up and again now I
 

179
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,909
here okay you line it up and again now I
want you to stop right on contact right

180
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
want you to stop right on contact right
 

181
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,270
want you to stop right on contact right
when you feel the feet okay with you and

182
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,280
when you feel the feet okay with you and
 

183
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,110
when you feel the feet okay with you and
me you should feel like right when your

184
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,120
me you should feel like right when your
 

185
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,909
me you should feel like right when your
fingers touch you should be able to feel

186
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
fingers touch you should be able to feel
 

187
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,710
fingers touch you should be able to feel
that got it okay so he's gonna get there

188
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
that got it okay so he's gonna get there
 

189
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,350
that got it okay so he's gonna get there
it's before that what I mean is I feel

190
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
it's before that what I mean is I feel
 

191
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,710
it's before that what I mean is I feel
you touch and then I feel you increase

192
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:43,720
you touch and then I feel you increase
 

193
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,230
you touch and then I feel you increase
but you should have felt it before that

194
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
but you should have felt it before that
 

195
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,550
but you should have felt it before that
okay so maybe slow down a little bit so

196
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
okay so maybe slow down a little bit so
 

197
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,230
okay so maybe slow down a little bit so
you're not like driving in the car and

198
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,240
you're not like driving in the car and
 

199
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,550
you're not like driving in the car and
volume okay why don't you park the damn

200
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:53,560
volume okay why don't you park the damn
 

201
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,950
volume okay why don't you park the damn
car and then maybe turn it a tiny bit

202
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
car and then maybe turn it a tiny bit
 

203
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,629
car and then maybe turn it a tiny bit
okay all

204
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
okay all
 

205
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,590
okay all
right so he goes right there it is right

206
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
right so he goes right there it is right
 

207
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,469
right so he goes right there it is right
maybe a little more there you go okay

208
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
maybe a little more there you go okay
 

209
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,830
maybe a little more there you go okay
and now we're he going to hang out there

210
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
and now we're he going to hang out there
 

211
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,590
and now we're he going to hang out there
and he's going to keep that value that

212
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:12,600
and he's going to keep that value that
 

213
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,350
and he's going to keep that value that
pressure he feels in his hands and in

214
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,360
pressure he feels in his hands and in
 

215
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,990
pressure he feels in his hands and in
his feet he's going to start releasing

216
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,000
his feet he's going to start releasing
 

217
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,710
his feet he's going to start releasing
all tension don't lose the pressure

218
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:19,720
all tension don't lose the pressure
 

219
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,350
all tension don't lose the pressure
though I'm going to start releasing all

220
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,360
though I'm going to start releasing all
 

221
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,710
though I'm going to start releasing all
muscle tension too more and more keep

222
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
muscle tension too more and more keep
 

223
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,749
muscle tension too more and more keep
releasing more if you pay ATT

224
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:30,759
releasing more if you pay ATT
 

225
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,790
releasing more if you pay ATT
the pressure at the hands

226
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
the pressure at the hands
 

227
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,189
the pressure at the hands
got higher higher rate higher volume

228
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:36,199
got higher higher rate higher volume
 

229
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,629
got higher higher rate higher volume
higher pressure see that the more I

230
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
higher pressure see that the more I
 

231
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,950
higher pressure see that the more I
release that's more pressure right there

232
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
release that's more pressure right there
 

233
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,390
release that's more pressure right there
increase it the

234
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:43,400
increase it the
 

235
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,870
increase it the
hands and just keep

236
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:45,880
hands and just keep
 

237
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,230
hands and just keep
releasing you're basically doing a

238
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
releasing you're basically doing a
 

239
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,749
releasing you're basically doing a
paired standing meditation right now

240
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
paired standing meditation right now
 

241
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,629
paired standing meditation right now
just keep releasing all

242
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639

 

243
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:10,309

tension release it

244
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319

 

245
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:24,550

all releasing

246
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560

 

247
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,029

it at how much pressure right now at the

248
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
it at how much pressure right now at the
 

249
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,270
it at how much pressure right now at the
hands do you feel that right watch this

250
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:30,280
hands do you feel that right watch this
 

251
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,909
hands do you feel that right watch this
I'm keep there I'm going to really like

252
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:32,919
I'm keep there I'm going to really like
 

253
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:46,510
I'm keep there I'm going to really like
like pressure just up whoa you

254
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:46,520

 

255
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,309

see good look how much is actually there

256
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
see good look how much is actually there
 

257
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,390
see good look how much is actually there
right

258
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
right
 

259
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,189
right
now

260
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:54,199
now
 

261
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,950
now
okay all

262
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
okay all
 

263
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,790
okay all
right as you go I'm on you you're just

264
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:01,800
right as you go I'm on you you're just
 

265
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,869
right as you go I'm on you you're just
basically keep standing for muscle

266
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:03,879
basically keep standing for muscle
 

267
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:07,270
basically keep standing for muscle
tension and let muscle tension okay I

268
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
tension and let muscle tension okay I
 

269
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,469
tension and let muscle tension okay I
don't know if you're going to get to

270
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
don't know if you're going to get to
 

271
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,830
don't know if you're going to get to
where you feel it increases pressure

272
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:10,840
where you feel it increases pressure
 

273
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,629
where you feel it increases pressure
because it gets pretty freaking

274
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
because it gets pretty freaking
 

275
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,670
because it gets pretty freaking
significant at the end it felt

276
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:16,680
significant at the end it felt
 

277
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,749
significant at the end it felt
like this much pressure right without

278
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:20,759
like this much pressure right without
 

279
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,589
like this much pressure right without
you actually physically doing it

280
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:24,599
you actually physically doing it
 

281
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,950
you actually physically doing it
okay don't worry about that whether you

282
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
okay don't worry about that whether you
 

283
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,189
okay don't worry about that whether you
feel that or not maybe you're staying at

284
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
feel that or not maybe you're staying at
 

285
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,629
feel that or not maybe you're staying at
the same same level as in progression

286
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:31,639
the same same level as in progression
 

287
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,790
the same same level as in progression
one but we're getting rid of all that

288
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:35,800
one but we're getting rid of all that
 

289
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,830
one but we're getting rid of all that
unnecessary residual tension muscle

290
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:38,840
unnecessary residual tension muscle
 

291
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,510
unnecessary residual tension muscle
flexion okay as you're trying to go now

292
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:42,520
flexion okay as you're trying to go now
 

293
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,469
flexion okay as you're trying to go now
the hard part for you is going to be

294
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:45,479
the hard part for you is going to be
 

295
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,589
the hard part for you is going to be
that you relax and everything goes so

296
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:48,599
that you relax and everything goes so
 

297
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,350
that you relax and everything goes so
there's a caveat there release the

298
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
there's a caveat there release the
 

299
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,629
there's a caveat there release the
muscle tension without decreasing the

300
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:55,639
muscle tension without decreasing the
 

301
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,710
muscle tension without decreasing the
pressure from progression one okay all

302
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
pressure from progression one okay all
 

303
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,390
pressure from progression one okay all
right let's try

304
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
right let's try
 

305
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,790
right let's try
okay so we're going to do the third

306
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
okay so we're going to do the third
 

307
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,110
okay so we're going to do the third
progression for and this is for your

308
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
progression for and this is for your
 

309
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,629
progression for and this is for your
levels okay for where you're at and the

310
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:07,639
levels okay for where you're at and the
 

311
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,430
levels okay for where you're at and the
and the difficulties that we've had to

312
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
and the difficulties that we've had to
 

313
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,830
and the difficulties that we've had to
get here okay got it um all right so we

314
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
get here okay got it um all right so we
 

315
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,589
get here okay got it um all right so we
get into it going speed it up a little

316
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
get into it going speed it up a little
 

317
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,749
get into it going speed it up a little
bit be soft there okay

318
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
bit be soft there okay
 

319
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,029
bit be soft there okay
um so as we get there we're going to

320
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:24,039
um so as we get there we're going to
 

321
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,830
um so as we get there we're going to
quickly release go ahead and release as

322
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
quickly release go ahead and release as
 

323
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,589
quickly release go ahead and release as
fast as you can cool there's the

324
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
fast as you can cool there's the
 

325
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,390
fast as you can cool there's the
increase in pressure okay and now what

326
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
increase in pressure okay and now what
 

327
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,190
increase in pressure okay and now what
I'm going to do is take the weight

328
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
I'm going to do is take the weight
 

329
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,589
I'm going to do is take the weight
