he can turn his head either way
and my hand will slip off

174
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
and my hand will slip off
 

175
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,670
and my hand will slip off
if i go

176
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
if i go
 

177
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,429
if i go
that way

178
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
that way
 

179
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,710
that way
if i go

180
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
if i go
 

181
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,910
if i go
that way so you add a bit of that

182
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
that way so you add a bit of that
 

183
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:13,270
that way so you add a bit of that
it goes in there

184
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280

 

185
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,390

uh

186
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
uh
 

187
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,629
uh
everybody all you seniors all think

188
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
everybody all you seniors all think
 

189
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,189
everybody all you seniors all think
they're basic what's basic to you

190
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199

 

191
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,189

kion but what is key on i mean these

192
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
kion but what is key on i mean these
 

193
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,469
kion but what is key on i mean these
people at the back there they want to

194
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
people at the back there they want to
 

195
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,990
people at the back there they want to
know what keon is

196
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
know what keon is
 

197
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,469
know what keon is
so we're going to work on keyhole

198
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
so we're going to work on keyhole
 

199
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,110
so we're going to work on keyhole
and look at um what makes the difference

200
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
and look at um what makes the difference
 

201
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,030
and look at um what makes the difference
so so that's all

202
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
so so that's all
 

203
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,550
so so that's all
change of they might turn their head

204
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
change of they might turn their head
 

205
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,270
change of they might turn their head
if you just push it away

206
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
if you just push it away
 

207
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,830
if you just push it away
or if you sort of try and do that

208
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
or if you sort of try and do that
 

209
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,830
or if you sort of try and do that
even if it looks like that as long as

210
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
even if it looks like that as long as
 

211
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,749
even if it looks like that as long as
you you're doing that

212
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
you you're doing that
 

213
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,270
you you're doing that
and i've since i tested since you do

214
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
and i've since i tested since you do
 

215
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,710
and i've since i tested since you do
this

216
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
this
 

217
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,350
this
then it locks them

218
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
then it locks them
 

219
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:04,150
then it locks them
what is

220
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160

 

221
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,310

that's not basic

222
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320

 

223
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:16,230

that's not basic

224
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240

 

225
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,710

that's basic

226
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720

 

227
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,430

that's basic

228
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
that's basic
 

229
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,870
that's basic
so i'll tell you the answer if you

230
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
so i'll tell you the answer if you
 

231
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,870
so i'll tell you the answer if you
haven't seen already it's when

232
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
haven't seen already it's when
 

233
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,350
haven't seen already it's when
i have one hand

234
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
i have one hand
 

235
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,430
i have one hand
attached to my partner

236
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440

 

237
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,230

because at any time my partner can take

238
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
because at any time my partner can take
 

239
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,350
because at any time my partner can take
his hand away

240
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360

 

241
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,830

if i do so this isn't basic so a lot of

242
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
if i do so this isn't basic so a lot of
 

243
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,469
if i do so this isn't basic so a lot of
the the masters this chick stands and

244
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
the the masters this chick stands and
 

245
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,909
the the masters this chick stands and
that they'll go like this and i'm going

246
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
that they'll go like this and i'm going
 

247
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,189
that they'll go like this and i'm going
to face it

248
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
to face it
 

249
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,029
to face it
but you see the point is they had a bit

250
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
but you see the point is they had a bit
 

251
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,070
but you see the point is they had a bit
messing out the cake

252
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080

 

253
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,790

yes it looks good doesn't it

254
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
yes it looks good doesn't it
 

255
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,350
yes it looks good doesn't it
so psycho sensei said i went to

256
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
so psycho sensei said i went to
 

257
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,909
so psycho sensei said i went to
i went to the hombu dojo and they were

258
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
i went to the hombu dojo and they were
 

259
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,590
i went to the hombu dojo and they were
teaching this

260
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
teaching this
 

261
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,309
teaching this
to their students is basic

262
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
to their students is basic
 

263
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,110
to their students is basic
but i like the technique so what i done

264
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
but i like the technique so what i done
 

265
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,990
but i like the technique so what i done
was

266
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
was
 

267
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,830
was
i went back to one and thought how can

268
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
i went back to one and thought how can
 

269
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,870
i went back to one and thought how can
we make it as close to basic as possible

270
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
we make it as close to basic as possible
 

271
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,870
we make it as close to basic as possible
and he said take it as quick

272
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
and he said take it as quick
 

273
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,670
and he said take it as quick
so he said make basic

274
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
so he said make basic
 

275
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,150
so he said make basic
even though it's not basic might face it

276
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
even though it's not basic might face it
 

277
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,670
even though it's not basic might face it
become

278
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
become
 

279
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,270
become
a smaller distance of time between

280
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
a smaller distance of time between
 

281
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,510
a smaller distance of time between
them escaping and you doing the

282
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
them escaping and you doing the
 

283
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,390
them escaping and you doing the
technique

284
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400

 

285
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,070

so by doing taina hancock on basic

286
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
so by doing taina hancock on basic
 

287
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,070
so by doing taina hancock on basic
that means now

288
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
that means now
 

289
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,510
that means now
not

290
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
not
 

291
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,390
not
it's not me holding him one hand so when

292
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
it's not me holding him one hand so when
 

293
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,469
it's not me holding him one hand so when
we do techniques you should always be

294
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
we do techniques you should always be
 

295
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,870
we do techniques you should always be
attached that's basic

296
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
attached that's basic
 

297
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,350
attached that's basic
if you don't need to attach

298
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
if you don't need to attach
 

299
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,629
if you don't need to attach
that's basic

300
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
that's basic
 

301
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:09,589
that's basic
if you don't need to attach

302
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599

 

303
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,510

itself

304
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
itself
 

305
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,029
itself
so

306
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
so
 

307
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,589
so
you could say but he could let go at any

308
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
you could say but he could let go at any
 

309
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,950
you could say but he could let go at any
time

310
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
time
 

311
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,830
time
if i'm in front of him just half a foot

312
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
if i'm in front of him just half a foot
 

313
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,830
if i'm in front of him just half a foot
or quarter of a foot

314
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
or quarter of a foot
 

315
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,110
or quarter of a foot
i won't get him to come

316
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
i won't get him to come
 

317
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,230
i won't get him to come
round

318
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240

 

319
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,350

so basically i was going to go deeper

320
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
so basically i was going to go deeper
 

321
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,150
so basically i was going to go deeper
and the depth of basic now is i'm going

322
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
and the depth of basic now is i'm going
 

323
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,029
and the depth of basic now is i'm going
to

324
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
to
 

325
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,670
to
i use the word the other day

326
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
i use the word the other day
 

327
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,150
i use the word the other day
there's osmosis and there's a moles

328
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
there's osmosis and there's a moles
 

329
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,950
there's osmosis and there's a moles
what was the word i use nigel

330
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960

 

331

equilibrium

332
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
equilibrium
 

333
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,749
equilibrium
my foot is level with therefore

334
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
