1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:08,209

so over that under aim to the center

2
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:08,219
so over that under aim to the center
 

3
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:15,410
so over that under aim to the center
okay so the problem is that our art is

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:15,420
okay so the problem is that our art is
 

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,930
okay so the problem is that our art is
external

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:19,940

 

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,560

working on his lives and you're trying

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:23,570
working on his lives and you're trying
 

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,950
working on his lives and you're trying
to get vocals token some levers through

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:26,960
to get vocals token some levers through
 

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,679
to get vocals token some levers through
his skeletal system okay but that's

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:29,689
his skeletal system okay but that's
 

13
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:33,040
his skeletal system okay but that's
going to require a force output capable

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,050
going to require a force output capable
 

15
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:39,100
going to require a force output capable
of what existence but there's no

16
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,110
of what existence but there's no
 

17
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,380
of what existence but there's no
guarantee you can generate enough energy

18
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:41,390
guarantee you can generate enough energy
 

19
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,299
guarantee you can generate enough energy
or force to do that and also fulcrums

20
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:46,309
or force to do that and also fulcrums
 

21
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:49,810
or force to do that and also fulcrums
and levers move and you can easily lose

22
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:49,820
and levers move and you can easily lose
 

23
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,150
and levers move and you can easily lose
your mechanical advantage does that make

24
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
your mechanical advantage does that make
 

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,060
your mechanical advantage does that make
sense so I don't want a technique that

26
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,070
sense so I don't want a technique that
 

27
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,290
sense so I don't want a technique that
has such a finite chemical advantage and

28
00:00:59,290 --> 00:00:59,300
has such a finite chemical advantage and
 

29
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,590
has such a finite chemical advantage and
such a dubious one so we're going to

30
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:02,600
such a dubious one so we're going to
 

31
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,880
such a dubious one so we're going to
find another way of doing this and it's

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:06,890
find another way of doing this and it's
 

33
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,370
find another way of doing this and it's
how I aim to the center so we were

34
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:09,380
how I aim to the center so we were
 

35
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,630
how I aim to the center so we were
working with meteorite and you'll see

36
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:13,640
working with meteorite and you'll see
 

37
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,330
working with meteorite and you'll see
like you guys want to reach over and you

38
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:16,340
like you guys want to reach over and you
 

39
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,870
like you guys want to reach over and you
get these kind of cranks like that but

40
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
get these kind of cranks like that but
 

41
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,630
get these kind of cranks like that but
this this is enough to aim for him to

42
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
this this is enough to aim for him to
 

43
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,059
this this is enough to aim for him to
aim them so we want to get there okay so

44
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:28,069
aim them so we want to get there okay so
 

45
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:30,339
aim them so we want to get there okay so
we don't so we're not just cranking on

46
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:30,349
we don't so we're not just cranking on
 

47
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:33,160
we don't so we're not just cranking on
joints with stronger people and braver

48
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,170
joints with stronger people and braver
 

49
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,900
joints with stronger people and braver
people just override okay so we have to

50
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:37,910
people just override okay so we have to
 

51
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,389
people just override okay so we have to
know what we are feeling for that's the

52
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:40,399
know what we are feeling for that's the
 

53
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,719
know what we are feeling for that's the
problem is I can tell you to do it you

54
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:43,729
problem is I can tell you to do it you
 

55
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,660
problem is I can tell you to do it you
can see it you can feel it but when you

56
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:46,670
can see it you can feel it but when you
 

57
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,530
can see it you can feel it but when you
try to do it you think

58
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:49,540
try to do it you think
 

59
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,800
try to do it you think
and through skeletal tokens and lepers

60
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:52,810
and through skeletal tokens and lepers
 

61
00:01:52,810 --> 00:02:00,030
and through skeletal tokens and lepers
okay so the first drill is I don't want

62
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,040
okay so the first drill is I don't want
 

63
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,010
okay so the first drill is I don't want
you to think of the goal I'm going to

64
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,020
you to think of the goal I'm going to
 

65
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,400
you to think of the goal I'm going to
give you I want you to try to understand

66
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,410
give you I want you to try to understand
 

67
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,690
give you I want you to try to understand
what it feels like so he's helping me

68
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:08,700
what it feels like so he's helping me
 

69
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,660
what it feels like so he's helping me
gain an awareness of the feeling so he

70
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:12,670
gain an awareness of the feeling so he
 

71
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,290
gain an awareness of the feeling so he
is pushing and I should feel a pressure

72
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:16,300
is pushing and I should feel a pressure
 

73
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,510
is pushing and I should feel a pressure
as I maintain my position okay and I'm

74
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
as I maintain my position okay and I'm
 

75
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,430
as I maintain my position okay and I'm
not here I'm just not caving it so he

76
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:26,440
not here I'm just not caving it so he
 

77
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,680
not here I'm just not caving it so he
will slowly generate it and I almost

78
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:31,690
will slowly generate it and I almost
 

79
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:43,820
will slowly generate it and I almost
feel that pressure start to fill me up

80
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:43,830

 

81
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,980

what I'm doing is the same grounding

82
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:46,990
what I'm doing is the same grounding
 

83
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,790
what I'm doing is the same grounding
drill I'm taking this energy and aiming

84
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
drill I'm taking this energy and aiming
 

85
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,510
drill I'm taking this energy and aiming
it in the ground but that's not my goal

86
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:54,520
it in the ground but that's not my goal
 

87
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,710
it in the ground but that's not my goal
I'm doing that to generate a sensation

88
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
I'm doing that to generate a sensation
 

89
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,270
I'm doing that to generate a sensation
of de pressure do you understand so if I

90
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
of de pressure do you understand so if I
 

91
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,850
of de pressure do you understand so if I
if for example if I don't ground it

92
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:05,860
if for example if I don't ground it
 

93
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,900
if for example if I don't ground it
pressure is in my back it's not filling

94
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:09,910
pressure is in my back it's not filling
 

95
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,140
pressure is in my back it's not filling
me up and that's the wrong sensation so

96
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,150
me up and that's the wrong sensation so
 

97
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,449
me up and that's the wrong sensation so
I use the ground vector in the ground

98
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:15,459
I use the ground vector in the ground
 

99
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,449
I use the ground vector in the ground
path to generate this nonlocalized

100
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:20,459
path to generate this nonlocalized
 

101
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,160
path to generate this nonlocalized
pressure that goes through my entire

102
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,170
pressure that goes through my entire
 

103
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:33,699
pressure that goes through my entire
body

104
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:33,709

 

105
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:39,830

so you can keep pushing and I am now I

106
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
so you can keep pushing and I am now I
 

107
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,460
so you can keep pushing and I am now I
can leave the ground pop and just hold

108
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:43,470
can leave the ground pop and just hold
 

109
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:55,610
can leave the ground pop and just hold
the pressure I can feel my stomach start

110
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:55,620
the pressure I can feel my stomach start
 

111
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,619
the pressure I can feel my stomach start
to swell you should be able to see it as

112
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:57,629
to swell you should be able to see it as
 

113
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:06,379
to swell you should be able to see it as
I'm leaving the ground pop then I hand

114
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:06,389
I'm leaving the ground pop then I hand
 

115
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:08,930
I'm leaving the ground pop then I hand
this is for you I'm going to release

116
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:08,940
this is for you I'm going to release
 

117
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,690
this is for you I'm going to release
tension as it had nothing to do with the

118
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:11,700
tension as it had nothing to do with the
 

119
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,149
tension as it had nothing to do with the
pressure and you will feel yourself sink

120
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
pressure and you will feel yourself sink
 

121
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:23,450
pressure and you will feel yourself sink
in more you feel it in the chest

122
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:23,460

 

123
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,780

and I

124
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:26,790
and I
 

125
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,960
and I
somehow stabilized and he is really blue

126
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:32,970
somehow stabilized and he is really blue
 

127
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:39,320
somehow stabilized and he is really blue
to me okay you might not get that far

128
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,330
to me okay you might not get that far
 

129
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,040
to me okay you might not get that far
you might go here he pushes and you

130
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,050
you might go here he pushes and you
 

131
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,700
you might go here he pushes and you
might holy cow okay try the ground puff

132
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:46,710
might holy cow okay try the ground puff
 

133
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:52,040
might holy cow okay try the ground puff
okay and then have your partner so he's

134
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,050
okay and then have your partner so he's
 

135
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,350
okay and then have your partner so he's
gonna aim it down and have your partner

136
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:56,360
gonna aim it down and have your partner
 

137
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,550
gonna aim it down and have your partner
help you by sensing for example let's

138
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:01,560
help you by sensing for example let's
 

139
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,980
help you by sensing for example let's
say I push I do that you see so I would

140
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:03,990
say I push I do that you see so I would
 

141
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,960
say I push I do that you see so I would
feel that about to happen so I will

142
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:05,970
feel that about to happen so I will
 

143
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,690
feel that about to happen so I will
decrease do you see

144
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:07,700
decrease do you see
 

145
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,030
decrease do you see
decrease and allow him time to get back

146
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:11,040
decrease and allow him time to get back
 

147
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,940
decrease and allow him time to get back
to where he wants to be needs to be

148
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:13,950
to where he wants to be needs to be
 

149
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,270
to where he wants to be needs to be
because I want him to feel the pressure

150
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
because I want him to feel the pressure
 

151
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:26,860
because I want him to feel the pressure
of the connection

152
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:26,870

 

153
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,970

okay let's try it okay Taylor

154
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:33,980

 

155
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,170

so as I generate this pressure you don't

156
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,180
so as I generate this pressure you don't
 

157
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,440
so as I generate this pressure you don't
want to waste 50% of your training time

158
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:41,450
want to waste 50% of your training time
 

159
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:47,700
want to waste 50% of your training time
so you as you go ahead and do it right

160
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:47,710

 

161
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,920

you should be able to start to feel the

162
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:50,930
you should be able to start to feel the
 

163
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,280
you should be able to start to feel the
pressure to okay and you I want you to

164
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,290
pressure to okay and you I want you to
 

165
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,670
pressure to okay and you I want you to
feel for that you can you might have to

166
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
feel for that you can you might have to
 

167
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,580
feel for that you can you might have to
increase keep feeling keep feeling and

168
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:03,590
increase keep feeling keep feeling and
 

169
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,490
increase keep feeling keep feeling and
now leave it on don't take it off even

170
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:06,500
now leave it on don't take it off even
 

171
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,140
now leave it on don't take it off even
if as you start to move do you

172
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,150
if as you start to move do you
 

173
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,020
if as you start to move do you
understand that keep this same feeling

174
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,030
understand that keep this same feeling
 

175
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,010
understand that keep this same feeling
okay now I'm going to take the pressure

176
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,020
okay now I'm going to take the pressure
 

177
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,120
okay now I'm going to take the pressure
and task myself with moving without

178
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,130
and task myself with moving without
 

179
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,360
and task myself with moving without
shutting off the feeling and you will be

180
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,370
shutting off the feeling and you will be
 

181
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,870
shutting off the feeling and you will be
moved as you get and task yourself with

182
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:25,880
moved as you get and task yourself with
 

183
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,090
moved as you get and task yourself with
being moved without shutting off the

184
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:28,100
being moved without shutting off the
 

185
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,970
being moved without shutting off the
feeling okay the movement makes it

186
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:30,980
feeling okay the movement makes it
 

187
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,160
feeling okay the movement makes it
difficult and gets a respond a more

188
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,170
difficult and gets a respond a more
 

189
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,250
difficult and gets a respond a more
refined skill but when we have the

190
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:36,260
refined skill but when we have the
 

191
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,680
refined skill but when we have the
pressure and you feel the pressure we

192
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:38,690
pressure and you feel the pressure we
 

193
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,880
pressure and you feel the pressure we
are connected okay so I'm going to move

194
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:42,890
are connected okay so I'm going to move
 

195
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,650
are connected okay so I'm going to move
without shutting off the pressure and

196
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:44,660
without shutting off the pressure and
 

197
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,700
without shutting off the pressure and
you will be moved without

198
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:49,710

 

199
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,850

it's a very simple thing don't don't

200
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:53,860
it's a very simple thing don't don't
 

201
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,550
it's a very simple thing don't don't
make it complicated she generates it and

202
00:06:59,550 --> 00:06:59,560
make it complicated she generates it and
 

203
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,840
make it complicated she generates it and
then you'll feel that you have feel for

204
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:03,850
then you'll feel that you have feel for
 

205
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,450
then you'll feel that you have feel for
the sensation just like I'm touching you

206
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:06,460
the sensation just like I'm touching you
 

207
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,000
the sensation just like I'm touching you
here and you feel for that touch you

208
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,010
here and you feel for that touch you
 

209
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,360
here and you feel for that touch you
feel for the pressure and then I tasked

210
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,370
feel for the pressure and then I tasked
 

211
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,210
feel for the pressure and then I tasked
myself with moving and she tasks

212
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:15,220
myself with moving and she tasks
 

213
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:25,050
myself with moving and she tasks
yourself with being moved so if see how

214
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:25,060
yourself with being moved so if see how
 

215
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,300
yourself with being moved so if see how
it got disconnected no you're fine I

216
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,310
it got disconnected no you're fine I
 

217
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,120
it got disconnected no you're fine I
just want you to feel the difference do

218
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,130
just want you to feel the difference do
 

219
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,810
just want you to feel the difference do
you think okay I'm here and I gender

220
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:33,820
you think okay I'm here and I gender
 

221
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,620
you think okay I'm here and I gender
that the pressure start to swell I go

222
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:37,630
that the pressure start to swell I go
 

223
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,420
that the pressure start to swell I go
through the relaxation I want you to

224
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:39,430
through the relaxation I want you to
 

225
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,680
through the relaxation I want you to
feel this you'll sink in you see okay

226
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:43,690
feel this you'll sink in you see okay
 

227
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,740
feel this you'll sink in you see okay
and now we're really glued so don't be

228
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:46,750
and now we're really glued so don't be
 

229
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:52,680
and now we're really glued so don't be
afraid as I move you keep the sensation

230
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:52,690

 

231
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,410

[Music]

232
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:54,420
[Music]
 

233
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,410
[Music]
so even if I you go we generate the

234
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:58,420
so even if I you go we generate the
 

235
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:58,950
so even if I you go we generate the
pressure

236
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
pressure
 

237
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,280
pressure
I let the release there it is

238
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,290
I let the release there it is
 

239
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,350
I let the release there it is
did you see it even steals your breath

240
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:04,360
did you see it even steals your breath
 

241
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,500
did you see it even steals your breath
okay it doesn't matter whether I go slow

242
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:07,510
okay it doesn't matter whether I go slow
 

243
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,490
okay it doesn't matter whether I go slow
I'll go slow and we'll keep the pressure

244
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:10,500
I'll go slow and we'll keep the pressure
 

245
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,430
I'll go slow and we'll keep the pressure
pressure pressure pressure you see it's

246
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:14,440
pressure pressure pressure you see it's
 

247
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,470
pressure pressure pressure you see it's
coming back and the pressure and the

248
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:16,480
coming back and the pressure and the
 

249
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,060
coming back and the pressure and the
pressure and you see your stance is

250
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,070
pressure and you see your stance is
 

251
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,309
pressure and you see your stance is
getting lighter pressure

252
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:21,319
getting lighter pressure
 

253
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,730
getting lighter pressure
sensation yeah okay now there's no

254
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:25,740
sensation yeah okay now there's no
 

255
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,010
sensation yeah okay now there's no
reason other than a psychological one of

256
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,020
reason other than a psychological one of
 

257
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:34,089
reason other than a psychological one of
why it has to change when I go fast okay

258
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:34,099

 

259
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:45,260

pressure and you keep the feeling there

260
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,270
pressure and you keep the feeling there
 

261
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,480
pressure and you keep the feeling there
is no other reason to sight except for

262
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:47,490
is no other reason to sight except for
 

263
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,030
is no other reason to sight except for
the psychological one why I can't do it

264
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,040
the psychological one why I can't do it
 

265
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,470
the psychological one why I can't do it
upon you understand

266
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
upon you understand
 

267
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,560
upon you understand
okay so you got play with it you can

268
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:57,570
okay so you got play with it you can
 

269
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,319
okay so you got play with it you can
keep it slow because a lot of times if

270
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:00,329
keep it slow because a lot of times if
 

271
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:02,600
keep it slow because a lot of times if
we start to lose it when we when we try

272
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:02,610
we start to lose it when we when we try
 

273
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:17,680
we start to lose it when we when we try
to go so I can go slow

274
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:17,690

 

275
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,310

you can let it gradually get pressure

276
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
you can let it gradually get pressure
 

277
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,520
you can let it gradually get pressure
and then move it or you can just you see

278
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:28,530
and then move it or you can just you see
 

279
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,890
and then move it or you can just you see
that okay each one is a little more

280
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:30,900
that okay each one is a little more
 

281
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,950
that okay each one is a little more
difficult isn't it right okay okay so as

282
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:35,960
difficult isn't it right okay okay so as
 

283
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,470
difficult isn't it right okay okay so as
as we try to do this we get tasked with

284
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:39,480
as we try to do this we get tasked with
 

285
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,280
as we try to do this we get tasked with
this results and didn't want you to do

286
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,290
this results and didn't want you to do
 

287
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,390
this results and didn't want you to do
that your focus is the pressure between

288
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:47,400
that your focus is the pressure between
 

289
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,160
that your focus is the pressure between
the two of you not her falling okay so

290
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,170
the two of you not her falling okay so
 

291
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,010
the two of you not her falling okay so
as you make the mistake and task

292
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,020
as you make the mistake and task
 

293
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,710
as you make the mistake and task
yourself but we're falling that's where

294
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:57,720
yourself but we're falling that's where
 

295
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,310
yourself but we're falling that's where
we see this stuff so you go in here like

296
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:01,320
we see this stuff so you go in here like
 

297
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
we see this stuff so you go in here like
that

298
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,330
that
 

299
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,540
that
no we're gonna increase the pressure

300
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:05,550
no we're gonna increase the pressure
 

301
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,260
no we're gonna increase the pressure
just like I said it's a sensation I can

302
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,270
just like I said it's a sensation I can
 

303
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,530
just like I said it's a sensation I can
feel it and now I'm going to move

304
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:12,540
feel it and now I'm going to move
 

305
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,400
feel it and now I'm going to move
without losing the feeling so when I

306
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,410
without losing the feeling so when I
 

307
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,590
without losing the feeling so when I
turn like that it goes off do you see

308
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:18,600
turn like that it goes off do you see
 

309
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,750
turn like that it goes off do you see
that that's when I lose connection

310
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:20,760
that that's when I lose connection
 

311
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,670
that that's when I lose connection
that's where I don't have their Center

312
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:22,680
that's where I don't have their Center
 

313
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,190
that's where I don't have their Center
and actually they have the initiative

314
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
and actually they have the initiative
 

315
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,750
and actually they have the initiative
okay so I have the feeling and keeping

316
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
okay so I have the feeling and keeping
 

317
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,690
okay so I have the feeling and keeping
the feeling tells me where I need to go

318
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:32,700
the feeling tells me where I need to go
 

319
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:38,480
the feeling tells me where I need to go
so she is again Lucas on the inside of

320
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:38,490
so she is again Lucas on the inside of
 

321
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,440
so she is again Lucas on the inside of
the feeling so she keeps the feeling

322
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,450
the feeling so she keeps the feeling
 

323
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,060
the feeling so she keeps the feeling
and I could move this feeling anywhere

324
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,070
and I could move this feeling anywhere
 

325
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,820
and I could move this feeling anywhere
they get go counterclockwise

326
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:48,830
they get go counterclockwise
 

327
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,690
they get go counterclockwise
I can go clock wise and we don't lose

328
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:52,700
I can go clock wise and we don't lose
 

329
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,090
I can go clock wise and we don't lose
the feeling

330
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,100
the feeling
 

331
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,630
the feeling
keep your feeling again I don't even

332
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640
keep your feeling again I don't even
 

333
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,830
keep your feeling again I don't even
need good posture to keep the feeling do

334
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:02,840
need good posture to keep the feeling do
 

335
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,030
need good posture to keep the feeling do
you see I don't even need face to keep

336
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
you see I don't even need face to keep
 

337
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,740
you see I don't even need face to keep
the feeling I can move and we will be

338
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:11,750
the feeling I can move and we will be
 

339
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,790
the feeling I can move and we will be
here so even suit ndin techniques have

340
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:15,800
here so even suit ndin techniques have
 

341
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,860
here so even suit ndin techniques have
this same feeling you see this is not

342
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:17,870
this same feeling you see this is not
 

343
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,140
this same feeling you see this is not
right that's not so heavy

344
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,150
right that's not so heavy
 

345
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:26,640
right that's not so heavy
okay so I am generate so let's try

346
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:26,650
okay so I am generate so let's try
 

347
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,970
okay so I am generate so let's try
without the throw and let's do this

348
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:30,980
without the throw and let's do this
 

349
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,170
without the throw and let's do this
counterclockwise and then a clockwise

350
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:35,180
counterclockwise and then a clockwise
 

351
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,550
counterclockwise and then a clockwise
and again will not shut off the pressure

352
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:41,560
and again will not shut off the pressure
 

353
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,650
and again will not shut off the pressure
okay let's try to take the throw out so

354
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:44,660
okay let's try to take the throw out so
 

355
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,110
okay let's try to take the throw out so
we're not so attempted God so but here

356
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
we're not so attempted God so but here
 

357
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,740
we're not so attempted God so but here
the feeling the pressure feeling and

358
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:50,750
the feeling the pressure feeling and
 

359
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,270
the feeling the pressure feeling and
pressure is a poetic

360
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:52,280
pressure is a poetic
 

361
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,130
pressure is a poetic
it's not just what it feels like

362
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:56,140
it's not just what it feels like
 

363
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,640
it's not just what it feels like
okay

364
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:57,650
okay
 

365
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,280
okay
it's just to paya might be a big sense

366
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,290
it's just to paya might be a big sense
 

367
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,200
it's just to paya might be a big sense
today maybe it does maybe I change

368
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,210
today maybe it does maybe I change
 

369
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,640
today maybe it does maybe I change
somewhere tomorrow okay so here the

370
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:06,650
somewhere tomorrow okay so here the
 

371
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,760
somewhere tomorrow okay so here the
pressure was generated this way okay

372
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:09,770
pressure was generated this way okay
 

373
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,800
pressure was generated this way okay
we're gonna generate the pressure this

374
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:11,810
we're gonna generate the pressure this
 

375
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,780
we're gonna generate the pressure this
way okay

376
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:13,790
way okay
 

377
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,630
way okay
let's generate it this way it's no

378
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:16,640
let's generate it this way it's no
 

379
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,019
let's generate it this way it's no
differences that's my shoulder

380
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:19,029
differences that's my shoulder
 

381
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:24,370
differences that's my shoulder
that's his arm he pushes and I let the

382
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:24,380
that's his arm he pushes and I let the
 

383
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,700
that's his arm he pushes and I let the
pressure if I push here I filled it here

384
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:27,710
pressure if I push here I filled it here
 

385
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,670
pressure if I push here I filled it here
I don't feel the pressure here so he

386
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:30,680
I don't feel the pressure here so he
 

387
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,880
I don't feel the pressure here so he
goes and I just increase the pressure

388
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:33,890
goes and I just increase the pressure
 

389
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:40,900
goes and I just increase the pressure
and then once we both have it I do the

390
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:40,910
and then once we both have it I do the
 

391
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,940
and then once we both have it I do the
same movement drill let's do the first

392
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:42,950
same movement drill let's do the first
 

393
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:51,160
same movement drill let's do the first
one he keeps it and I am not moving to

394
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,170
one he keeps it and I am not moving to
 

395
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,250
one he keeps it and I am not moving to
throw him not moving to take them off

396
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:54,260
throw him not moving to take them off
 

397
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,180
throw him not moving to take them off
balance

398
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,190
balance
 

399
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,180
balance
I'm moving to maintain the pressure do

400
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,190
I'm moving to maintain the pressure do
 

401
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,960
I'm moving to maintain the pressure do
you understand that

402
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:58,970
you understand that
 

403
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,720
you understand that
okay so that's why I wouldn't go like

404
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:01,730
okay so that's why I wouldn't go like
 

405
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,440
okay so that's why I wouldn't go like
that that takes it off okay I'm here

406
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:05,450
that that takes it off okay I'm here
 

407
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,890
that that takes it off okay I'm here
like that generate the pressure and then

408
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:08,900
like that generate the pressure and then
 

409
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,860
like that generate the pressure and then
we're I'm gonna task myself with moving

410
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:11,870
we're I'm gonna task myself with moving
 

411
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,380
we're I'm gonna task myself with moving
it he's gonna task himself with keeping

412
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:14,390
it he's gonna task himself with keeping
 

413
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:26,010
it he's gonna task himself with keeping
it as he gets moved so I started

414
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,020

 

415
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,950

you may ask yourself I noticed a turn at

416
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:28,960
you may ask yourself I noticed a turn at
 

417
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,420
you may ask yourself I noticed a turn at
the end what is the difference between

418
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:30,430
the end what is the difference between
 

419
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,880
the end what is the difference between
that turn at the end and this turn well

420
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:32,890
that turn at the end and this turn well
 

421
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,820
that turn at the end and this turn well
he is falling to one side that's where

422
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:35,830
he is falling to one side that's where
 

423
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,590
he is falling to one side that's where
the pressure is going do you understand

424
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600
the pressure is going do you understand
 

425
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,560
the pressure is going do you understand
so as we go this way he's gonna start to

426
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:43,570
so as we go this way he's gonna start to
 

427
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,440
so as we go this way he's gonna start to
go that way in order to keep the pili I

428
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:46,450
go that way in order to keep the pili I
 

429
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,470
go that way in order to keep the pili I
have to start the turn you see that if

430
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:49,480
have to start the turn you see that if
 

431
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,350
have to start the turn you see that if
he's going that way and I keep pushing

432
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:52,360
he's going that way and I keep pushing
 

433
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,590
he's going that way and I keep pushing
straight let's exaggerated it goes off

434
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
straight let's exaggerated it goes off
 

435
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,920
straight let's exaggerated it goes off
do you see goes off so I'm not turning

436
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:58,930
do you see goes off so I'm not turning
 

437
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,620
do you see goes off so I'm not turning
it like you might think like that I am

438
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:01,630
it like you might think like that I am
 

439
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,560
it like you might think like that I am
keeping the sensation as long as

440
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:04,570
keeping the sensation as long as
 

441
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,810
keeping the sensation as long as
possible I can feel it starting to go

442
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:06,820
possible I can feel it starting to go
 

443
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,110
possible I can feel it starting to go
off so I have to turn them to keep it do

444
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,120
off so I have to turn them to keep it do
 

445
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,660
off so I have to turn them to keep it do
you understand okay so I'm here and

446
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:14,670
you understand okay so I'm here and
 

447
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,160
you understand okay so I'm here and
again you can do the same thing

448
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,170
again you can do the same thing
 

449
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:30,700
again you can do the same thing
you can't go slow

450
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:30,710

 

451
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:35,650

you can slowly generate it got it and

452
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:35,660
you can slowly generate it got it and
 

453
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:41,220
you can slowly generate it got it and
then BOOM oh I can't do it on the touch

454
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:41,230
then BOOM oh I can't do it on the touch
 

455
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:46,210
then BOOM oh I can't do it on the touch
okay let's go so this is the only

456
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:46,220
okay let's go so this is the only
 

457
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,000
okay let's go so this is the only
difference between a gradual pressure

458
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,010
difference between a gradual pressure
 

459
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,660
difference between a gradual pressure
and the slow projection or a gradual

460
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:52,670
and the slow projection or a gradual
 

461
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,570
and the slow projection or a gradual
pressure and a quick projection or

462
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:54,580
pressure and a quick projection or
 

463
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,340
pressure and a quick projection or
projection immediately on contact

464
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:57,350
projection immediately on contact
 

465
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,840
projection immediately on contact
it's just psychological okay

466
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:00,850
it's just psychological okay
 

467
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,639
it's just psychological okay
mechanically physiological is to say

468
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:03,649
mechanically physiological is to say
 

469
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:07,420
mechanically physiological is to say
well same thing here the only difference

470
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:07,430
well same thing here the only difference
 

471
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,740
well same thing here the only difference
between this pressure and this pressure

472
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:11,750
between this pressure and this pressure
 

473
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,930
between this pressure and this pressure
is psychological okay so when we go to

474
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:16,940
is psychological okay so when we go to
 

475
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,300
is psychological okay so when we go to
katatetori

476
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:18,310
katatetori
 

477
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:23,620
katatetori
it's psychological you have to stop

478
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:23,630
it's psychological you have to stop
 

479
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,780
it's psychological you have to stop
yourself from doing skeletal alignment

480
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:25,790
yourself from doing skeletal alignment
 

481
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,660
yourself from doing skeletal alignment
do you see that that's why we started

482
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:28,670
do you see that that's why we started
 

483
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,590
do you see that that's why we started
with this okay so even though my arm is

484
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:32,600
with this okay so even though my arm is
 

485
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,070
with this okay so even though my arm is
extended at the close-quarter combat

486
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:36,080
extended at the close-quarter combat
 

487
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,810
extended at the close-quarter combat
range it's not a skeletal alignment do

488
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:40,820
range it's not a skeletal alignment do
 

489
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,420
range it's not a skeletal alignment do
you understand that it's pressure

490
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:43,430
you understand that it's pressure
 

491
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:48,640
you understand that it's pressure
generated so just like push this is

492
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:48,650
generated so just like push this is
 

493
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:54,699
generated so just like push this is
wrong this is wrong you see it's the

494
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:54,709
wrong this is wrong you see it's the
 

495
00:15:54,709 --> 00:16:00,810
wrong this is wrong you see it's the
same use of generating the pressure okay

496
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:00,820
same use of generating the pressure okay
 

497
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,320
same use of generating the pressure okay
so keep going and you can you'll feel

498
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,330
so keep going and you can you'll feel
 

499
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:10,510
so keep going and you can you'll feel
that I can keep my shape of my hand but

500
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:10,520
that I can keep my shape of my hand but
 

501
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,519
that I can keep my shape of my hand but
internally you're gonna see what I miss

502
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:12,529
internally you're gonna see what I miss
 

503
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:16,990
internally you're gonna see what I miss
you already

504
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:17,000
you already
 

505
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,960
you already
because I really see that isolated

506
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:21,970
because I really see that isolated
 

507
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,240
because I really see that isolated
flexion and just focusing in on the

508
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,250
flexion and just focusing in on the
 

509
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,300
flexion and just focusing in on the
pressure okay and then I keep that

510
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,310
pressure okay and then I keep that
 

511
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:35,200
pressure okay and then I keep that
pressure so let's start right there

512
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,210
pressure so let's start right there
 

513
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,540
pressure so let's start right there
drilling the other thing because the

514
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:37,550
drilling the other thing because the
 

515
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,850
drilling the other thing because the
skeletal alignment and the isolating

516
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:39,860
skeletal alignment and the isolating
 

517
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,370
skeletal alignment and the isolating
flexion has nothing to do with the

518
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:42,380
flexion has nothing to do with the
 

519
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:54,850
flexion has nothing to do with the
pressure okay but I don't want if I if I

520
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:54,860
pressure okay but I don't want if I if I
 

521
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,700
pressure okay but I don't want if I if I
see you this do you see that is because

522
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:57,710
see you this do you see that is because
 

523
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,410
see you this do you see that is because
I am trying not to have my forearm

524
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:01,420
I am trying not to have my forearm
 

525
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,940
I am trying not to have my forearm
collapsing you squeeze my tendons it

526
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:03,950
collapsing you squeeze my tendons it
 

527
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,220
collapsing you squeeze my tendons it
does that but there's nothing there

528
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,230
does that but there's nothing there
 

529
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,189
does that but there's nothing there
there's nothing it's just you keep

530
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199
there's nothing it's just you keep
 

531
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,740
there's nothing it's just you keep
trying with that part it's just mushy

532
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:11,750
trying with that part it's just mushy
 

533
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,280
trying with that part it's just mushy
mushy all the way is just not going to

534
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,290
mushy all the way is just not going to
 

535
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,730
mushy all the way is just not going to
go anywhere but I feel the push okay and

536
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:18,740
go anywhere but I feel the push okay and
 

537
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,040
go anywhere but I feel the push okay and
you can hear it in my voice there's no

538
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,050
you can hear it in my voice there's no
 

539
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,010
you can hear it in my voice there's no
tension in my voice it's just as much as

540
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,020
tension in my voice it's just as much as
 

541
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,760

this hand is out this hand is out now I

542
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:27,770
this hand is out this hand is out now I
 

543
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,530
this hand is out this hand is out now I
keep the feeling and I move it I can do

544
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:32,540
keep the feeling and I move it I can do
 

545
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:39,870
keep the feeling and I move it I can do
the circle again

546
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:39,880

 

547
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,019

or is that

548
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:42,029
or is that
 

549
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:45,120
or is that
okay the reason why I mentioned this is

550
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,130
okay the reason why I mentioned this is
 

551
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,880
okay the reason why I mentioned this is
because you already have a physiological

552
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:47,890
because you already have a physiological
 

553
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:53,820
because you already have a physiological
past a skeletal and isolated flexion do

554
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:53,830
past a skeletal and isolated flexion do
 

555
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,549
past a skeletal and isolated flexion do
you see and we want to know and take

556
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
you see and we want to know and take
 

557
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,980
you see and we want to know and take
what we did in the last row and change

558
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:58,990
what we did in the last row and change
 

559
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,279
what we did in the last row and change
our concept of katatetori okay I'm

560
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:02,289
our concept of katatetori okay I'm
 

561
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:06,330
our concept of katatetori okay I'm
changing it instead I'm using this to

562
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:06,340
changing it instead I'm using this to
 

563
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,750
changing it instead I'm using this to
feel the pressure feel the pressure and

564
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
feel the pressure feel the pressure and
 

565
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,840
feel the pressure feel the pressure and
then I ask myself but moving without

566
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:12,850
then I ask myself but moving without
 

567
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,430
then I ask myself but moving without
going back to this

568
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:14,440
going back to this
 

569
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,980
going back to this
I'm just here and I keep the pressure

570
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:16,990
I'm just here and I keep the pressure
 

571
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,340
I'm just here and I keep the pressure
and you test yourself with being moved

572
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:20,350
and you test yourself with being moved
 

573
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:26,130
and you test yourself with being moved
and you keep the pressure so again watch

574
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,140
and you keep the pressure so again watch
 

575
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,870
and you keep the pressure so again watch
I'm gonna shut it off you'll feel it

576
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:27,880
I'm gonna shut it off you'll feel it
 

577
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,470
I'm gonna shut it off you'll feel it
you see cuz I wasn't pushing into it I

578
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:31,480
you see cuz I wasn't pushing into it I
 

579
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:41,900
you see cuz I wasn't pushing into it I
keep the pressure

580
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:41,910

 

581
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:47,250

got it okay try it you always feel like

582
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:47,260
got it okay try it you always feel like
 

583
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,400
got it okay try it you always feel like
crowd noise but like that that's why

584
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,410
crowd noise but like that that's why
 

585
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:58,020
crowd noise but like that that's why
you're so Kentucky Dodie it's some way

586
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,030
you're so Kentucky Dodie it's some way
 

587
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,200
you're so Kentucky Dodie it's some way
looks easier because I can use my pecs

588
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,210
looks easier because I can use my pecs
 

589
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,500
looks easier because I can use my pecs
and get you to go but in other ways it's

590
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:04,510
and get you to go but in other ways it's
 

591
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,380
and get you to go but in other ways it's
harder precisely because I can use my

592
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:07,390
harder precisely because I can use my
 

593
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,500
harder precisely because I can use my
pecs you see that okay so remember the

594
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:10,510
pecs you see that okay so remember the
 

595
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:15,530
pecs you see that okay so remember the
guidelines I gave you so I have pressure

596
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:15,540
guidelines I gave you so I have pressure
 

597
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:21,180
guidelines I gave you so I have pressure
then releasing okay it's not releasing

598
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,190
then releasing okay it's not releasing
 

599
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,860
then releasing okay it's not releasing
the vaccine and then I try to get

600
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:22,870
the vaccine and then I try to get
 

601
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,310
the vaccine and then I try to get
pressure that your balloon is but on the

602
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320
pressure that your balloon is but on the
 

603
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,950
pressure that your balloon is but on the
airs coming out so she grabs if she

604
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:28,960
airs coming out so she grabs if she
 

605
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,860
airs coming out so she grabs if she
grabs really hard and I'm relaxed you

606
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:31,870
grabs really hard and I'm relaxed you
 

607
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,810
grabs really hard and I'm relaxed you
can see what she's doing to my fingers

608
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:33,820
can see what she's doing to my fingers
 

609
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,420
can see what she's doing to my fingers
you see that but if I let the pressure

610
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:36,430
you see that but if I let the pressure
 

611
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,230
you see that but if I let the pressure
go she can't she can't close them but

612
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
go she can't she can't close them but
 

613
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,900
go she can't she can't close them but
it's mushy okay and now I just now I

614
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:45,910
it's mushy okay and now I just now I
 

615
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,830
it's mushy okay and now I just now I
would relax now I keep going and it'll

616
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
would relax now I keep going and it'll
 

617
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,220
would relax now I keep going and it'll
let the pressure keep expanding okay and

618
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,230
let the pressure keep expanding okay and
 

619
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,550
let the pressure keep expanding okay and
as the pressure expands you get spot to

620
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:56,560
as the pressure expands you get spot to
 

621
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,340
as the pressure expands you get spot to
me it's easy it's easier with small

622
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,350
me it's easy it's easier with small
 

623
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,920
me it's easy it's easier with small
movements to move you do see the small

624
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:01,930
movements to move you do see the small
 

625
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,640
movements to move you do see the small
movements if I go stiff right that goes

626
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:05,650
movements if I go stiff right that goes
 

627
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,150
movements if I go stiff right that goes
here but if I start relaxing let the

628
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:09,160
here but if I start relaxing let the
 

629
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,730
here but if I start relaxing let the
pressure go small movements move you

630
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:11,740
pressure go small movements move you
 

631
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,420
pressure go small movements move you
okay do you guys got that so we're using

632
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:15,430
okay do you guys got that so we're using
 

633
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:20,520
okay do you guys got that so we're using
the hand not caving in as a symptom to

634
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:20,530
the hand not caving in as a symptom to
 

635
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,920
the hand not caving in as a symptom to
note that I did follow the order

636
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:22,930
note that I did follow the order
 

637
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,220
note that I did follow the order
pressure then releasing acceptance

638
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,230
pressure then releasing acceptance
 

639
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,410
pressure then releasing acceptance
relaxation okay it's all again is

640
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:30,420
relaxation okay it's all again is
 

641
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,350
relaxation okay it's all again is
psychological so the mind is faster than

642
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:34,360
psychological so the mind is faster than
 

643
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,490
psychological so the mind is faster than
you can do this you

644
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:36,500
you can do this you
 

645
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,850
you can do this you
so when she begins to touch there's

646
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:39,860
so when she begins to touch there's
 

647
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,260
so when she begins to touch there's
already pressure and I've already

648
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,270
already pressure and I've already
 

649
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,470
already pressure and I've already
released do you see so but you can go

650
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:44,480
released do you see so but you can go
 

651
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,539
released do you see so but you can go
slow in the drill you could start tense

652
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:46,549
slow in the drill you could start tense
 

653
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:49,810
slow in the drill you could start tense
okay get a pressure feeling and then

654
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:49,820
okay get a pressure feeling and then
 

655
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,210
okay get a pressure feeling and then
release but you're moving at the speed

656
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:52,220
release but you're moving at the speed
 

657
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,560
release but you're moving at the speed
of mind it happens in an instant okay

658
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:56,570
of mind it happens in an instant okay
 

659
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,710
of mind it happens in an instant okay
that the whole pressure and releasing on

660
00:20:59,710 --> 00:20:59,720
that the whole pressure and releasing on
 

661
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,120
that the whole pressure and releasing on
it okay let's try it

662
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,130
it okay let's try it
 

663
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:08,919
it okay let's try it
okay so again where you touch is just a

664
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:08,929
okay so again where you touch is just a
 

665
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:11,529
okay so again where you touch is just a
psychological difference so as I go to

666
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:11,539
psychological difference so as I go to
 

667
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:16,330
psychological difference so as I go to
grab as you kick I should be able to do

668
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:16,340
grab as you kick I should be able to do
 

669
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,980
grab as you kick I should be able to do
the same thing as you can

670
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:17,990
the same thing as you can
 

671
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,010
the same thing as you can
so I generate the pressure through my

672
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:21,020
so I generate the pressure through my
 

673
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,230
so I generate the pressure through my
own agency to see and then I can make

674
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,240
own agency to see and then I can make
 

675
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,820
own agency to see and then I can make
the center loop we have Center

676
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:27,830
the center loop we have Center
 

677
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,560
the center loop we have Center
engagement and I can make the center

678
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:29,570
engagement and I can make the center
 

679
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,310
engagement and I can make the center
move in the same way do you understand

680
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:33,320
move in the same way do you understand
 

681
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,190
move in the same way do you understand
me so I go here I will generate the

682
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,200
me so I go here I will generate the
 

683
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,020
me so I go here I will generate the
pressure that's what I was doing for him

684
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,030
pressure that's what I was doing for him
 

685
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,760
pressure that's what I was doing for him
in the other drill well that generated

686
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:42,770
in the other drill well that generated
 

687
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,770
in the other drill well that generated
pressure for me and as much as he's

688
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:44,780
pressure for me and as much as he's
 

689
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,140
pressure for me and as much as he's
connected to me I am connected to him

690
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,150
connected to me I am connected to him
 

691
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,140
connected to me I am connected to him
but now I'm going to be the agent so

692
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,150
but now I'm going to be the agent so
 

693
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,330
but now I'm going to be the agent so
don't lose this and don't start doing

694
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:52,340
don't lose this and don't start doing
 

695
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,930
don't lose this and don't start doing
that feel the pressure and move the

696
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:55,940
that feel the pressure and move the
 

697
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:03,230
that feel the pressure and move the
pressure to keep it

698
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:03,240

 

699
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,159

and again you can do this gradual like

700
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:07,169
and again you can do this gradual like
 

701
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:10,010
and again you can do this gradual like
that you can find it and move it a

702
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,020
that you can find it and move it a
 

703
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,620
that you can find it and move it a
little quicker and you can't do it on

704
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:12,630
little quicker and you can't do it on
 

705
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:17,570
little quicker and you can't do it on
touch point you got it okay after you

706
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:17,580
touch point you got it okay after you
 

707
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,620
touch point you got it okay after you
getting it take the next step

708
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:21,630
getting it take the next step
 

709
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,380
getting it take the next step
your fingers have nothing to do with it

710
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,390
your fingers have nothing to do with it
 

711
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,399
your fingers have nothing to do with it
okay so I can open my palm and I

712
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:28,409
okay so I can open my palm and I
 

713
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:30,830
okay so I can open my palm and I
generate the pressure at my club and I

714
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:30,840
generate the pressure at my club and I
 

715
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,019
generate the pressure at my club and I
can project that in tune so again it's

716
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:36,029
can project that in tune so again it's
 

717
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,909
can project that in tune so again it's
not that I'm grabbing here and then

718
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:37,919
not that I'm grabbing here and then
 

719
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,889
not that I'm grabbing here and then
you're like you're slipping up his arm

720
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:39,899
you're like you're slipping up his arm
 

721
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:43,639
you're like you're slipping up his arm
you're just here okay feel the pressure

722
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:43,649
you're just here okay feel the pressure
 

723
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:47,600
you're just here okay feel the pressure
and then keep that and task myself with

724
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:47,610
and then keep that and task myself with
 

725
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,450
and then keep that and task myself with
moving

726
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:49,460
moving
 

727
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,440
moving
he tasks himself with being moved so

728
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:54,450
he tasks himself with being moved so
 

729
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,620
he tasks himself with being moved so
although you can normally graphs in this

730
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:57,630
although you can normally graphs in this
 

731
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:17,080
although you can normally graphs in this
case and Nagas good

732
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,090

 

733
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:22,039

okay let's go I saw you you're trying to

734
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:22,049
okay let's go I saw you you're trying to
 

735
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:25,850
okay let's go I saw you you're trying to
open your breath okay so look look at my

736
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:25,860
open your breath okay so look look at my
 

737
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,360
open your breath okay so look look at my
girl and you'll feel the pressure

738
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:29,370
girl and you'll feel the pressure
 

739
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,860
girl and you'll feel the pressure
increase you see my good weight pay

740
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:33,870
increase you see my good weight pay
 

741
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,159
increase you see my good weight pay
attention don't shut off the pressure

742
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:36,169
attention don't shut off the pressure
 

743
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:41,990
attention don't shut off the pressure
don't shut it off

744
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,000

 

745
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,890

[Music]

746
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:45,900

 

747
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,020

what's the difference you're trying to

748
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,030
what's the difference you're trying to
 

749
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,460
what's the difference you're trying to
do a little look okay

750
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:50,470
do a little look okay
 

751
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,240
do a little look okay
and then sometimes you would use the

752
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,250
and then sometimes you would use the
 

753
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:58,490
and then sometimes you would use the
push of your webbing you see that okay

754
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:58,500
push of your webbing you see that okay
 

755
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:05,400
push of your webbing you see that okay
so it's the pressure you feel the

756
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,410
so it's the pressure you feel the
 

757
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,560
so it's the pressure you feel the
pressure increasing okay so pressure is

758
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:07,570
pressure increasing okay so pressure is
 

759
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,580
pressure increasing okay so pressure is
increasing and pressure pressure

760
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:11,590
increasing and pressure pressure
 

761
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:19,649
increasing and pressure pressure
pressure okay

762
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:19,659

 

763
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:30,460

it's not it's not the external ledge you

764
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:30,470
it's not it's not the external ledge you
 

765
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,399
it's not it's not the external ledge you
see even when it is an external ledge

766
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:33,409
see even when it is an external ledge
 

767
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:36,820
see even when it is an external ledge
it's the pressure that I'm doing okay so

768
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:36,830
it's the pressure that I'm doing okay so
 

769
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,690
it's the pressure that I'm doing okay so
all I'm demonstrating is that there's no

770
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:40,700
all I'm demonstrating is that there's no
 

771
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,190
all I'm demonstrating is that there's no
ledge do you see

772
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:42,200
ledge do you see
 

773
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,289
ledge do you see
but I'm demonstrating to say like

774
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:44,299
but I'm demonstrating to say like
 

775
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,239
but I'm demonstrating to say like
increasing the pressure is increasing

776
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:46,249
increasing the pressure is increasing
 

777
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:49,930
increasing the pressure is increasing
and then once once once I have this

778
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:49,940
and then once once once I have this
 

779
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,789
and then once once once I have this
connection right you can you see I keep

780
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:54,799
connection right you can you see I keep
 

781
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,690
connection right you can you see I keep
that connection

782
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:55,700
that connection
 

783
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,399
that connection
I'll see you like a good this is a

784
00:24:57,399 --> 00:24:57,409
I'll see you like a good this is a
 

785
00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:00,159
I'll see you like a good this is a
stupid trick but it was kind of hard for

786
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:00,169
stupid trick but it was kind of hard for
 

787
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:03,820
stupid trick but it was kind of hard for
me okay but see how I'm slipping yes I

788
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:03,830
me okay but see how I'm slipping yes I
 

789
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,919
me okay but see how I'm slipping yes I
that's because I can't do it internally

790
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:05,929
that's because I can't do it internally
 

791
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:09,299
that's because I can't do it internally
enough okay so let's go back to mine

792
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:09,309
enough okay so let's go back to mine
 

793
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:14,109
enough okay so let's go back to mine
here and now I have the friction because

794
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:14,119
here and now I have the friction because
 

795
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:19,690
here and now I have the friction because
I have the pressure okay and then okay

796
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:19,700
I have the pressure okay and then okay
 

797
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,499
I have the pressure okay and then okay
so if you're going to open your grip

798
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:23,509
so if you're going to open your grip
 

799
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:26,019
so if you're going to open your grip
actually open your grip don't don't

800
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:26,029
actually open your grip don't don't
 

801
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:31,049
actually open your grip don't don't
trick like that okay but in the same way

802
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:31,059
trick like that okay but in the same way
 

803
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:35,169
trick like that okay but in the same way
that katate dori was actually harder for

804
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:35,179
that katate dori was actually harder for
 

805
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:37,869
that katate dori was actually harder for
us because it was so easy to do external

806
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:37,879
us because it was so easy to do external
 

807
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:40,760
us because it was so easy to do external
then the same thing is

808
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:40,770
then the same thing is
 

809
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,130
then the same thing is
this is harder for us because it's so

810
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,140
this is harder for us because it's so
 

811
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,970
this is harder for us because it's so
easy to do the external edges okay all

812
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:46,980
easy to do the external edges okay all
 

813
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,120
easy to do the external edges okay all
right

814
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,130
right
 

815
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,750
right
again psychologically there is no

816
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
again psychologically there is no
 

817
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,780
again psychologically there is no
difference between two hands touching

818
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:56,790
difference between two hands touching
 

819
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:01,730
difference between two hands touching
you anywhere okay so how you'll feel the

820
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:01,740
you anywhere okay so how you'll feel the
 

821
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,680
you anywhere okay so how you'll feel the
pressure feeling you see I feel the

822
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:03,690
pressure feeling you see I feel the
 

823
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,810
pressure feeling you see I feel the
pressure feeling and I'm not squeezing

824
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:05,820
pressure feeling and I'm not squeezing
 

825
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,000
pressure feeling and I'm not squeezing
you to get friction I just have two

826
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,010
you to get friction I just have two
 

827
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,400
you to get friction I just have two
points of contact okay two points of

828
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:10,410
points of contact okay two points of
 

829
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,350
points of contact okay two points of
contact here it goes there's the

830
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:12,360
contact here it goes there's the
 

831
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,140
contact here it goes there's the
pressure it's going on right and then I

832
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,150
pressure it's going on right and then I
 

833
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:23,120
pressure it's going on right and then I
can move you okay so that's just for now

834
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,130
can move you okay so that's just for now
 

835
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:31,250
can move you okay so that's just for now
do it here like okay and here we go okay

836
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,260
do it here like okay and here we go okay
 

837
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,370
do it here like okay and here we go okay
and then one side we have it and then I

838
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:34,380
and then one side we have it and then I
 

839
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,650
and then one side we have it and then I
tasked myself with moving it and you

840
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:36,660
tasked myself with moving it and you
 

841
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,600
tasked myself with moving it and you
test yourself with not shutting it off

842
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:38,610
test yourself with not shutting it off
 

843
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:48,710
test yourself with not shutting it off
oh and do it right on the touch you can

844
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
oh and do it right on the touch you can
 

845
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,320
oh and do it right on the touch you can
go slow if you want gradually increase

846
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,330
go slow if you want gradually increase
 

847
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,299
go slow if you want gradually increase
it again it's not that is it just

848
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:55,309
it again it's not that is it just
 

849
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:58,280
it again it's not that is it just
feeling that pressure and then when you

850
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,290
feeling that pressure and then when you
 

851
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:11,600
feeling that pressure and then when you
have it you can gradually or again I'm

852
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:11,610
have it you can gradually or again I'm
 

853
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:16,430
have it you can gradually or again I'm
not doing this it's not that elbow

854
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:16,440
not doing this it's not that elbow
 

855
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,520
not doing this it's not that elbow
fulcrum it's just this it's nothing more

856
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:19,530
fulcrum it's just this it's nothing more
 

857
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,620
fulcrum it's just this it's nothing more
than the pressure and the connection I

858
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:21,630
than the pressure and the connection I
 

859
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,080
than the pressure and the connection I
just I'm touching you here everything

860
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,090
just I'm touching you here everything
 

861
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,860
just I'm touching you here everything
else is just a psychological difference

862
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:26,870
else is just a psychological difference
 

863
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,320
else is just a psychological difference
okay let's try it

864
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,330
okay let's try it
 

865
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,870
okay let's try it
so we're gonna do what you think is a

866
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:32,880
so we're gonna do what you think is a
 

867
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,630
so we're gonna do what you think is a
pain compliance technique but I'm not

868
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:35,640
pain compliance technique but I'm not
 

869
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,790
pain compliance technique but I'm not
gonna actually put all the elements in

870
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:37,800
gonna actually put all the elements in
 

871
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,680
gonna actually put all the elements in
there so before I had two points of

872
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:39,690
there so before I had two points of
 

873
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:45,140
there so before I had two points of
contact here and generate the pressure

874
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,150
contact here and generate the pressure
 

875
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,780
contact here and generate the pressure
again and then I just aim it through

876
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:47,790
again and then I just aim it through
 

877
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:55,640
again and then I just aim it through
there so I'm not torquing anything I'm

878
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:55,650
there so I'm not torquing anything I'm
 

879
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,370
there so I'm not torquing anything I'm
just touch of them here touch it in here

880
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:58,380
just touch of them here touch it in here
 

881
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,490
just touch of them here touch it in here
I'm closer to the technique do you see

882
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:00,500
I'm closer to the technique do you see
 

883
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:06,169
I'm closer to the technique do you see
then there generate depression if I go

884
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:06,179
then there generate depression if I go
 

885
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:10,460
then there generate depression if I go
like this see it's not there it's gotta

886
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:10,470
like this see it's not there it's gotta
 

887
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:19,280
like this see it's not there it's gotta
go up his arm you can go slow just keep

888
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,290
go up his arm you can go slow just keep
 

889
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,980
go up his arm you can go slow just keep
feeling for the pressure and you're

890
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:21,990
feeling for the pressure and you're
 

891
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:28,900
feeling for the pressure and you're
moving it

892
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:28,910

 

893
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:33,270

and of course you can go on contact okay

894
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:33,280
and of course you can go on contact okay
 

895
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,300
and of course you can go on contact okay
okay just lie Kotaku daughter was harder

896
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:37,310
okay just lie Kotaku daughter was harder
 

897
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,580
okay just lie Kotaku daughter was harder
because it looks like something else and

898
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:39,590
because it looks like something else and
 

899
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,260
because it looks like something else and
just like when you grabbed him it look

900
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:41,270
just like when you grabbed him it look
 

901
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,840
just like when you grabbed him it look
like something else right and just like

902
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:43,850
like something else right and just like
 

903
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,630
like something else right and just like
when I told you to open your ribbon look

904
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640
when I told you to open your ribbon look
 

905
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,130
when I told you to open your ribbon look
like some pledges alright this looks

906
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:51,140
like some pledges alright this looks
 

907
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,890
like some pledges alright this looks
like a pain compliance technique do you

908
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:53,900
like a pain compliance technique do you
 

909
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,320
like a pain compliance technique do you
see that so we'll get it get it in place

910
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:56,330
see that so we'll get it get it in place
 

911
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,410
see that so we'll get it get it in place
but I'm not gonna go external it's gonna

912
00:28:59,410 --> 00:28:59,420
but I'm not gonna go external it's gonna
 

913
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,080
but I'm not gonna go external it's gonna
go into his body it's the same exact

914
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,090
go into his body it's the same exact
 

915
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:07,390
go into his body it's the same exact
thing so right now I'm just moving it in

916
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:07,400
thing so right now I'm just moving it in
 

917
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,760
thing so right now I'm just moving it in
the same pattern that I had before I

918
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:09,770
the same pattern that I had before I
 

919
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,160
the same pattern that I had before I
want you to have the lock in place and

920
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,170
want you to have the lock in place and
 

921
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,800
want you to have the lock in place and
not start tweaking things just feel the

922
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:14,810
not start tweaking things just feel the
 

923
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,400
not start tweaking things just feel the
connection even those arms bent you're

924
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:18,410
connection even those arms bent you're
 

925
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,980
connection even those arms bent you're
not going this way your feeling for the

926
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:20,990
not going this way your feeling for the
 

927
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,190
not going this way your feeling for the
connection so my grips are the grips of

928
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,200
connection so my grips are the grips of
 

929
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,030
connection so my grips are the grips of
Mikio my elbows need y'all I'm in Kisa

930
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,040
Mikio my elbows need y'all I'm in Kisa
 

931
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,760
Mikio my elbows need y'all I'm in Kisa
but I feel the pressure and I do another

932
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:33,770
but I feel the pressure and I do another
 

933
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:37,410
but I feel the pressure and I do another
pressure drill closer to the technique

934
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:37,420
pressure drill closer to the technique
 

935
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:49,810
pressure drill closer to the technique
home again you can do it slow you can

936
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:49,820
home again you can do it slow you can
 

937
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,360
home again you can do it slow you can
enjoy it in circles if you want you can

938
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:52,370
enjoy it in circles if you want you can
 

939
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:57,540
enjoy it in circles if you want you can
do circles keeping the pressure you can

940
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:57,550
do circles keeping the pressure you can
 

941
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:02,170
do circles keeping the pressure you can
do it on touch okay let's go okay so

942
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:02,180
do it on touch okay let's go okay so
 

943
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,830
do it on touch okay let's go okay so
your life well I had that our arms so

944
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
your life well I had that our arms so
 

945
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,540
your life well I had that our arms so
that's like a Ledge you see that there

946
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:10,550
that's like a Ledge you see that there
 

947
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,670
that's like a Ledge you see that there
you go like you have this and then

948
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:12,680
you go like you have this and then
 

949
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,520
you go like you have this and then
you're using this arm

950
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:14,530
you're using this arm
 

951
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,370
you're using this arm
push that arm but what people do is that

952
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:17,380
push that arm but what people do is that
 

953
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,370
push that arm but what people do is that
you go around you go around nursing the

954
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:20,380
you go around you go around nursing the
 

955
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,740
you go around you go around nursing the
energy actually has to go up it has to

956
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:22,750
energy actually has to go up it has to
 

957
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,400
energy actually has to go up it has to
go up so I again it's not fear that I'm

958
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:26,410
go up so I again it's not fear that I'm
 

959
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,500
go up so I again it's not fear that I'm
doing it that's why you can open your

960
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:28,510
doing it that's why you can open your
 

961
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,910
doing it that's why you can open your
grip right and I'm going around so watch

962
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:32,920
grip right and I'm going around so watch
 

963
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,180
grip right and I'm going around so watch

that do you see that but that's actually
not your Center

1122
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,270
not your Center
 

1123
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:05,910
not your Center
it is an external angle constellation

1124
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:05,920
it is an external angle constellation
 

1125
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,820
it is an external angle constellation
but it is not the center manipulation so

1126
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:08,830
but it is not the center manipulation so
 

1127
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,750
but it is not the center manipulation so
your your elbow will go down like that

1128
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:12,760
your your elbow will go down like that
 

1129
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,250
your your elbow will go down like that
but it's not it's incidental to the to

1130
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:17,260
but it's not it's incidental to the to
 

1131
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,260
but it's not it's incidental to the to
the center connection to see Center

1132
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:19,270
the center connection to see Center
 

1133
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:24,120
the center connection to see Center
connection center connection and then I

1134
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,130
connection center connection and then I
 

1135
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,880
connection center connection and then I
move that elbow down with the center

1136
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:26,890
move that elbow down with the center
 

1137
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,030
move that elbow down with the center
connection it's not I did the elbow

1138
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,040
connection it's not I did the elbow
 

1139
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,980
connection it's not I did the elbow
right on and then that guy goes out and

1140
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:31,990
right on and then that guy goes out and
 

1141
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,580
right on and then that guy goes out and
goes out there you see that so I the

1142
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:35,590
goes out there you see that so I the
 

1143
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:39,600
goes out there you see that so I the
angle is just incidental to what I want

1144
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:39,610
angle is just incidental to what I want
 

1145
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,060
angle is just incidental to what I want
combative Lee in the larger scale but

1146
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,070
combative Lee in the larger scale but
 

1147
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,600
combative Lee in the larger scale but
the concept of it should still aim in

1148
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:45,610
the concept of it should still aim in
 

1149
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:50,670
the concept of it should still aim in
your Center guys got that again so don't

1150
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:50,680
your Center guys got that again so don't
 

1151
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,420
your Center guys got that again so don't
over rely on the angle cancellation on

1152
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:54,430
over rely on the angle cancellation on
 

1153
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,690
over rely on the angle cancellation on
the elbow because that's an external

1154
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:56,700
the elbow because that's an external
 

1155
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,710
the elbow because that's an external
focal lever okay use that elbow point in

1156
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:01,720
focal lever okay use that elbow point in
 

1157
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,700
focal lever okay use that elbow point in
is just another vector for Center

1158
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:05,710
is just another vector for Center
 

1159
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:32,100
is just another vector for Center
connection for pressure but there should

1160
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,110
connection for pressure but there should
 

1161
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:43,100
connection for pressure but there should
be a projection unless there's a

1162
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,110

 

1163
00:36:43,110 --> 00:37:01,280

1165
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:05,070

you can watch sometimes pocket and in

1166
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:05,080
you can watch sometimes pocket and in
 

1167
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:12,439
you can watch sometimes pocket and in
this light we're not moving

1168
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:12,449

 

1169
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:16,459

but if you watch you can you can tell

but if you watch you can you can tell
 

1171
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:19,589
but if you watch you can you can tell
how much energy there's actually hit the
