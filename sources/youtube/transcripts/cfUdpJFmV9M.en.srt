um the question is like how do you
 

13
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,750
um the question is like how do you
decide what you're going to work

14
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
decide what you're going to work
 

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,390
decide what you're going to work
on and how to not be technique

16
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:27,400
on and how to not be technique
 

17
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,830
on and how to not be technique
Centric we're not technique Centric

18
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
Centric we're not technique Centric
 

19
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,630
Centric we're not technique Centric
um so what's always behind everything is

20
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:35,640
um so what's always behind everything is
 

21
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,110
um so what's always behind everything is
the single goal of the

22
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
the single goal of the
 

23
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,069
the single goal of the
training okay and then what you're

24
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
training okay and then what you're
 

25
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,869
training okay and then what you're
trying to do is move them there and

26
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
trying to do is move them there and
 

27
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,270
trying to do is move them there and
technique is not the single goal of the

28
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:48,280
technique is not the single goal of the
 

29
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,110
technique is not the single goal of the
training it is that for many people

30
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
training it is that for many people
 

31
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,830

harder and then they will always tell
 

73
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,190
harder and then they will always tell
you how the techniques can be used

74

techniques and if you push like what are
 

113
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,309

you where are you going with this
 

115
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,149
you where are you going with this

something like that going um but all it
 

137
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,470
something like that going um but all it
does is justify that you're technique

138
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
does is justify that you're technique

of this what is at the center is the
 

155
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,990
of this what is at the center is the
singular goal and then the individual

Desi proximity to that goal and that's
 

159
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,750
Desi proximity to that goal and that's
what the teacher is there for so to get

160
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
what the teacher is there for so to get
 

161
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,630
what the teacher is there for so to get
you more proximal to the singular

162
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
you more proximal to the singular
 

163
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,190
you more proximal to the singular
goal for that reason uh the Sensei Desi

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,389
that and we want it to do something and
that is not what we are doing here

00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,670
that is not what we are doing here
Divine communion is not uh uh having it

Divine communion is not uh uh having it
 

651
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,110
Divine communion is not uh uh having it
do something for us okay if you keep

652
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
do something for us okay if you keep
 

653
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,829
do something for us okay if you keep
that mind if you keep that position in

that mind if you keep that position in
 

655
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,470
that mind if you keep that position in
your head you will never release the

self you will keep trying to do
something by releasing the self and when

660
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:26,440
something by releasing the self and when
 

661
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,069
something by releasing the self and when
you keep trying to do something your ego

662
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:29,079
you keep trying to do something your ego
 

663
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:32,030
you keep trying to do something your ego
tripartite mind keeps functioning that

664
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,040
tripartite mind keeps functioning that
 

665
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,829
tripartite mind keeps functioning that
is a reification of self that is an

666
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
is a reification of self that is an
 

667
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,350
is a reification of self that is an
obstacle to Divine Grace so you are

668
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
obstacle to Divine Grace so you are
 

669
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,870
obstacle to Divine Grace so you are
contesting God okay and so we're not

670
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
contesting God okay and so we're not
 

671
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,269
contesting God okay and so we're not
doing that so the answer is there what

672
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:44,279
doing that so the answer is there what
 

673
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,430
doing that so the answer is there what
are we trying to do with the skill of

674
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,440
are we trying to do with the skill of
 

675
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,189
are we trying to do with the skill of
release practice non-c contestation

676
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:50,199
release practice non-c contestation
 

677
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:53,110
release practice non-c contestation
towards God it's a concentric

678
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
towards God it's a concentric
 

679
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,230
towards God it's a concentric
art so we have non- contestation between

art so we have non- contestation between
 

681
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,990

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079
singular goal so what we end up doing is
 

693
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,590
singular goal so what we end up doing is
nothing more than uh

levels that that is all we're doing we

700
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:26,039
levels that that is all we're doing we
 

701
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,190
levels that that is all we're doing we
don't do techniques we use a technique

702
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
don't do techniques we use a technique
 

703
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,350
don't do techniques we use a technique
as it reveals that what we're working on

704
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:32,360
as it reveals that what we're working on
 

705
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,750
as it reveals that what we're working on
but we're not here to learn techniques

706
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:34,760
but we're not here to learn techniques
 

707
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,830
but we're not here to learn techniques
okay uh and very quickly you know we

708
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
okay uh and very quickly you know we
 

709
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,669
okay uh and very quickly you know we
learned the hard way so you're going to

710
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
learned the hard way so you're going to
 

711
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,190
learned the hard way so you're going to
do some technique right yeah I got my

712
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,200
do some technique right yeah I got my
 

713
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,510
do some technique right yeah I got my
technique and then sooner or later we're

714
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,520
technique and then sooner or later we're
 

715
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,990
technique and then sooner or later we're
doing G Wasa and you're like do

716
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:47,000
doing G Wasa and you're like do
 

717
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,430
doing G Wasa and you're like do
you get it because you were doing

718
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:48,440
you get it because you were doing
 

719
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,310
you get it because you were doing
techniques and you were not doing self-

720
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
techniques and you were not doing self-
 

721
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,950
techniques and you were not doing self-
relase

722
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:51,960
relase
 

723
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,950
relase
okay um as an example

724
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:55,960
okay um as an example
 

725
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,430
okay um as an example
today what I do sometimes is

726
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
today what I do sometimes is
 

727
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,549
today what I do sometimes is
is sometimes there's a positive lesson

728
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
is sometimes there's a positive lesson
 

729
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,070
is sometimes there's a positive lesson
for a person that's on the mat because

730
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
for a person that's on the mat because
 

731
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,630
for a person that's on the mat because
the

732
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:07,640
the
 

733
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,470
the
degree of population the variance in the

734
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:11,480
degree of population the variance in the
 

735
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,430
degree of population the variance in the
population is just too

736
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
population is just too
 

737
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,310
population is just too
dispersed and I can't come up with one

738
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,320
dispersed and I can't come up with one
 

739
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,230
dispersed and I can't come up with one
way uh that everyone is positively

740
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
way uh that everyone is positively
 

741
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,070
way uh that everyone is positively
addressing self- reification

742
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,080
addressing self- reification
 

743
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,789
addressing self- reification
okay uh and so what I do then is I have

744
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:27,799
okay uh and so what I do then is I have
 

745
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:30,510
okay uh and so what I do then is I have
a positive less for that one to two to

746
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:30,520
a positive less for that one to two to
 

747
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,430
a positive less for that one to two to
three people and then I have a negative

748
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440
three people and then I have a negative
 

749
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,270
three people and then I have a negative
lesson uh for the remaining people and

750
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:36,280
lesson uh for the remaining people and
 

751
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,710
lesson uh for the remaining people and
what I mean by this somebody is very

752
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:38,720
what I mean by this somebody is very
 

753
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,789
what I mean by this somebody is very
close to getting to another level of

754
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:41,799
close to getting to another level of
 

755
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:45,630
close to getting to another level of
self-release uh and other people like

756
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:45,640
self-release uh and other people like
 

757
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,230
self-release uh and other people like
you're just you can't do it you're we're

758
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
you're just you can't do it you're we're
 

759
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,990
you're just you can't do it you're we're
we're working Beyond you so for example

760
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
we're working Beyond you so for example
 

761
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,350
we're working Beyond you so for example
uh yesterday's technique on on vouching

762
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,360
uh yesterday's technique on on vouching
 

763
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,430
uh yesterday's technique on on vouching
your question yesterday like I can't get

764
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,440
your question yesterday like I can't get
 

765
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,310
your question yesterday like I can't get
the neck hand to function because

766
00:18:59,310 --> 00:18:59,320
the neck hand to function because
 

767
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,909
the neck hand to function because
there's no I key yet there it was the

768
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
there's no I key yet there it was the
 

769
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,070
there's no I key yet there it was the
same question when we did um the knife

770
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,080
same question when we did um the knife
 

771
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,110
same question when we did um the knife
the knife training with Andrew and Ronin

772
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
the knife training with Andrew and Ronin
 

773
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,630
the knife training with Andrew and Ronin
you had to seize the center to create

774
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:11,640
you had to seize the center to create
 

775
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,070
you had to seize the center to create
the Dilemma seizing of the center is

776
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
the Dilemma seizing of the center is
 

777
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,110
the Dilemma seizing of the center is
from the ik adhesion okay and when we

778
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
from the ik adhesion okay and when we
 

779
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,669
from the ik adhesion okay and when we
allowed the UK to counter our angles of

780
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:20,679
allowed the UK to counter our angles of
 

781
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:22,870
allowed the UK to counter our angles of
deflection if we did not have their

782
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:22,880
deflection if we did not have their
 

783
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,350
deflection if we did not have their
Center they were just going to have a

784
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:24,360
Center they were just going to have a
 

785
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,149
Center they were just going to have a
field day with us but if we had their

786
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:26,159
field day with us but if we had their
 

787
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,310
field day with us but if we had their
Center to counter our angles of

788
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
Center to counter our angles of
 

789
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,390
Center to counter our angles of
deflection they would have to first free

790
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,400
deflection they would have to first free
 

791
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,750
deflection they would have to first free
their Center you see and that created

792
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:32,760
their Center you see and that created
 

793
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,590
their Center you see and that created
the Dilemma so we reached the limits of

794
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600
the Dilemma so we reached the limits of
 

795
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,190
the Dilemma so we reached the limits of
your uh skill set with ie not there on

796
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
your uh skill set with ie not there on
 

797
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,830
your uh skill set with ie not there on
the ninth day and we reach the limits of

798
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
the ninth day and we reach the limits of
 

799
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,870
the ninth day and we reach the limits of
the um technique in adaga at the IE

800
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:45,880
the um technique in adaga at the IE
 

801
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,270
the um technique in adaga at the IE
adhesion Point okay as well so it's a

802
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
adhesion Point okay as well so it's a
 

803
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,470
adhesion Point okay as well so it's a
kind of negative uh lesson for you

804
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:51,480
kind of negative uh lesson for you
 

805

the world view is so subtle that we
 

979
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,390
the world view is so subtle that we
don't really notice it but it does have

980
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:15,400
don't really notice it but it does have
 

981
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,029
don't really notice it but it does have
huge impacts on this okay so I would go

982
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:19,039
huge impacts on this okay so I would go
 

983
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,669
huge impacts on this okay so I would go
back in my mind I see who's here and

okay so we're working with the
 

1031
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,590
okay so we're working with the
following um let's say we have UK coming

1032
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:38,600
following um let's say we have UK coming
 

1033

following um let's say we have UK coming
this

1034
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
this
 

1035
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,909
this
way and we don't want to I'm going to

1036
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:42,919
way and we don't want to I'm going to

something I don't want to be moved okay
this is a stress

1042
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:51,919
this is a stress
 

1043
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,950
this is a stress
adaptation uh device for training so for

1044
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:54,960
adaptation uh device for training so for
 

1045
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,310
adaptation uh device for training so for
example as I already mentioned for my

1046
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:57,320
example as I already mentioned for my
 

1047
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,990
example as I already mentioned for my
sons uh we're going to practice fighting

1048
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,000
sons uh we're going to practice fighting
 

1049
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,789
sons uh we're going to practice fighting
because violence is more likely than

1050
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:03,799
because violence is more likely than
 

1051
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:06,710
because violence is more likely than
anything else to trigger you and see if

1052
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:06,720
anything else to trigger you and see if
 

1053
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,350
anything else to trigger you and see if
you exhibit U behaviors or actions or

1054
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:10,360
you exhibit U behaviors or actions or
 

1055
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,389
you exhibit U behaviors or actions or
reactions consistent with self-

1056
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:12,399
reactions consistent with self-
 

1057
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:15,510
reactions consistent with self-
reification or whether you stay in the

00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,520
reification or whether you stay in the
 

1059
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,230

godm state or not physically
 

1061
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,990
godm state or not physically
energetically and spiritually okay this

1062
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,000
energetically and spiritually okay this
 

1063
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,630
energetically and spiritually okay this
is no different it's just

1064
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:23,640
is no different it's just
 

1065
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,430
is no different it's just
simplified so you UK is going this way

1066
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:27,440
simplified so you UK is going this way
 

1067
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,149
simplified so you UK is going this way
and your task with not moving you see it

1068
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
and your task with not moving you see it
 

1069
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,350
and your task with not moving you see it
sets up the potential for a young young

1070
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:32,360
sets up the potential for a young young
 

1071
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,669
sets up the potential for a young young
clash and we're going to increase that

1072
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:34,679
clash and we're going to increase that
 

1073
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,149
clash and we're going to increase that
potential by saying not only do you not

1074
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:38,159
potential by saying not only do you not
 

1075
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,190
potential by saying not only do you not
move but they have to

1076
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,200
move but they have to
 

1077
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,750
move but they have to
move you see and so it's setting up now

1078
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:45,760
move you see and so it's setting up now
 

1079
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,870
move you see and so it's setting up now
will you Yong Yong clash with the

1080
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:47,880
will you Yong Yong clash with the
 

1081
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,789
will you Yong Yong clash with the
obvious materialist way or will you use

1082
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:53,799
obvious materialist way or will you use
 

1083
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:57,389
obvious materialist way or will you use
your internals so that this energy is

1084
00:26:57,389 --> 00:26:57,399
your internals so that this energy is
 

1085
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:00,549
your internals so that this energy is
actually not contesting energetically

1086
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
actually not contesting energetically
 

1087
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,830
actually not contesting energetically
with either of these goals do not move

1088
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840
with either of these goals do not move
 

1089
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,950
with either of these goals do not move
and make them go the other way

1090
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
and make them go the other way
 

1091
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,549
and make them go the other way
okay um for some of us as I said you're

1092
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:10,559
okay um for some of us as I said you're
 

1093
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,710
okay um for some of us as I said you're
going to do this stuff and okay cool but

1094
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:13,720
going to do this stuff and okay cool but
 

1095
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,909
going to do this stuff and okay cool but
sooner or later someone in the class is

1096
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
sooner or later someone in the class is
 

1097
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,710
sooner or later someone in the class is
going to do it right on you and you're

1098
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:17,720
going to do it right on you and you're
 

1099
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,510
going to do it right on you and you're
going to get the negative lesson I'm not

1100
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,520
going to get the negative lesson I'm not
 

1101
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,149
going to get the negative lesson I'm not
doing that okay all right so that's

1102
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:24,159
doing that okay all right so that's
 

1103
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,430
doing that okay all right so that's
that's what we're doing with our little

1104
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:26,440
that's what we're doing with our little
 

1105
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,149
that's what we're doing with our little
exercise you can see how it's just a

1106
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:29,159
exercise you can see how it's just a
 

1107
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,630
exercise you can see how it's just a
stress adaptation model it sets you up

1108
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
stress adaptation model it sets you up
 

1109
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,870
stress adaptation model it sets you up
for self- reification and

1110
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
for self- reification and
 

1111
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,909
for self- reification and
contestation and then to do the drill

1112
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:37,919
contestation and then to do the drill
 

1113
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,310
contestation and then to do the drill
correctly you have to do not that okay

1114
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:42,320
correctly you have to do not that okay
 

1115
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,190
correctly you have to do not that okay

and I am creating a Coq projection

1132
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:08,919

if we get there okay so I'll show you

1280
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:06,559
if we get there okay so I'll show you
 

1281
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,230
if we get there okay so I'll show you
what that drill looks like

1282
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:09,240
what that drill looks like
 

1283
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,950
what that drill looks like
now okay in essence it's C hole but

1284
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:12,960
now okay in essence it's C hole but
 

1285
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,629
now okay in essence it's C hole but
we're standing as we're going to work on

1286
00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:16,639
we're standing as we're going to work on
 

1287
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:21,110
we're standing as we're going to work on
our uh midfoot ground vect and also as

1288
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,120
our uh midfoot ground vect and also as
 

1289
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,990
our uh midfoot ground vect and also as
you can see how tailor is she has a HT

1290
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,000
you can see how tailor is she has a HT
 

1291
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,990
you can see how tailor is she has a HT
knee and so she's not she we

1292
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,000
knee and so she's not she we
 

1293
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,389
knee and so she's not she we
I'm not going to make her do s w we're

1294
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:31,399
I'm not going to make her do s w we're
 

1295
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,870
I'm not going to make her do s w we're
going to do standing okay so it's very

1296
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:33,880
going to do standing okay so it's very
 

1297
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,710
going to do standing okay so it's very
tailored to where she's

1298
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:35,720
tailored to where she's
 

1299
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,549
tailored to where she's
at the ferite will go W you got to do uh

1300
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:39,559
at the ferite will go W you got to do uh
 

1301
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,549
at the ferite will go W you got to do uh
you got to do CAD DOA it's got to be

1302
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:41,559
you got to do CAD DOA it's got to be
 

1303
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,029
you got to do CAD DOA it's got to be
sitting down that's technique Centric

1304
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:44,039
sitting down that's technique Centric
 

1305
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,629
sitting down that's technique Centric
well I don't give a if she never

1306
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:45,639
well I don't give a if she never

Divine communion okay so in this girl we
start out with the wrist grab and I'm

1316
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:01,279
start out with the wrist grab and I'm
 

1317
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,710
start out with the wrist grab and I'm
going to here's the C youan is already

1318
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:03,720
going to here's the C youan is already
 

1319
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,509
going to here's the C youan is already
on her Center you see but I'm going to

1320
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:06,519
on her Center you see but I'm going to
 

1321
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:10,430
on her Center you see but I'm going to
use this hand with an adhesion to keep

1322
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:10,440
use this hand with an adhesion to keep
 

1323
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,990
use this hand with an adhesion to keep
loading this

1324
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,000
loading this
 

1325
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,070
loading this
hand and the Y value is increasing you

1326
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,080
hand and the Y value is increasing you
 

1327
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,830
hand and the Y value is increasing you
feel it a young value

1328
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:17,840
feel it a young value
 

1329
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,549
feel it a young value
increases and you'll get the same

1330
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:20,559
increases and you'll get the same
 

1331
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,149
increases and you'll get the same
projection without your hands pushing

1332
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:24,159
projection without your hands pushing
 

1333
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,350
projection without your hands pushing
okay so normally at at the lower levels

1334
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,360
okay so normally at at the lower levels
 

1335
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,430
okay so normally at at the lower levels
right where do we do I I want you just

1336

00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:33,559
to do that we're at at her
 

1339
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:36,669
to do that we're at at her
level and I'm not going to push this the

1340
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:36,679
level and I'm not going to push this the
 

1341
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:39,549
level and I'm not going to push this the
C you hand I'm going to use the I hand

1342
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:39,559
C you hand I'm going to use the I hand
 

1343
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,070
C you hand I'm going to use the I hand
to load the C hand

1344
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,080
to load the C hand
 

1345
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,470
to load the C hand
okay so here we

1346
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:47,480

 

1347
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,029

go there it's pushing out you see but it

1348
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,039
go there it's pushing out you see but it
 

1349
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,389
go there it's pushing out you see but it
never pushes out it keeps loading this

1350
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:53,399
never pushes out it keeps loading this
 

1351
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,710
never pushes out it keeps loading this
hand keeps loading this hand keeps

00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:12,879
don't smell the the projection this is a
 

1363
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,950
don't smell the the projection this is a
goal oriented don't smell it keep it

keep the

1366
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:20,760

 

1367
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,909

relationship need some off it's a little

relationship need some off it's a little
 

1369
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,470
relationship need some off it's a little
hard right it's a little heavy for you

1370
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,480
hard right it's a little heavy for you
 

1371
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,790
hard right it's a little heavy for you

you're going like

1376
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,040

 

1377
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,470

this you're going like this and pay

1378
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:35,480
this you're going like this and pay
 

1379
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,790
this you're going like this and pay
attention how much projection is there

1380
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:37,800
attention how much projection is there
 

1381
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,950
attention how much projection is there
actually on this

1382
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:39,960
actually on this
 

1383
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,990
actually on this
hand not much do you

1384
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:44,000

 

1385
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,990

see it again don't get confused it

1386
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:47,000
see it again don't get confused it
 

1387
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,190
see it again don't get confused it
doesn't have to be that angle I just

1388
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,200
doesn't have to be that angle I just
 

1389
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,669
doesn't have to be that angle I just
have to keep feeding it so I won't go

1390
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:51,679
have to keep feeding it so I won't go
 

1391
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,629
have to keep feeding it so I won't go
down into it but you can feel that it

1392
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:53,639
down into it but you can feel that it
 

1393
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,230
down into it but you can feel that it
increases the the pressure there okay

1394
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,240
increases the the pressure there okay
 

1395
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,470
increases the the pressure there okay
but it's going to do the same thing

1396
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:57,480
but it's going to do the same thing
 

1397
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,589
but it's going to do the same thing
there you see I'm going out it's doing

1398
00:34:59,589 --> 00:34:59,599
there you see I'm going out it's doing
 

1399
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,870
there you see I'm going out it's doing
the same

1400
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:00,880
the same
 

1401
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:15,390
the same
thing okay all right so we'll work on it

1402
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:15,400

 

1403
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,270

trying to steal for to load the Yang
 

1415
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,190
trying to steal for to load the Yang
hand yeah I load the Yang hand with the

1416
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:43,200
hand yeah I load the Yang hand with the
 

1417
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,109
hand yeah I load the Yang hand with the
IT hand okay that's what I want to do

1418
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:46,119
IT hand okay that's what I want to do
 

1419
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:49,870
IT hand okay that's what I want to do
see that this is pretty light you get it

1420
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:49,880
see that this is pretty light you get it
 

1421
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,829
see that this is pretty light you get it
okay got

1422
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:51,839
okay got
 

1423
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,670
okay got
heavier there it is

1424
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:55,680
heavier there it is
 

1425
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:11,710
heavier there it is
Boom Boom

1426
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:11,720

 

1427
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,109

I want you to feel how that handle start

1428
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:15,119
I want you to feel how that handle start
 

1429
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,710
I want you to feel how that handle start
to increase y value throughout the

1430
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:17,720
to increase y value throughout the
 

1431
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,390
to increase y value throughout the
movement of this never goes out you're

1432
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:22,400
movement of this never goes out you're
 

1433
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:36,390
movement of this never goes out you're
going to KN go out

1434
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,400

 

1435
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:48,550

and my stance is

1436
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:48,560

 

1437
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,710

irrelevant Dan is irrelevant because

1438
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:52,720
irrelevant Dan is irrelevant because
 

1439
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,190
irrelevant Dan is irrelevant because
why because it's not in the stance it's

1440
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,200
why because it's not in the stance it's
 

1441
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,430
why because it's not in the stance it's
so what what is it

1442
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:58,440
so what what is it
 

1443
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,950
so what what is it
it's in the

1444
00:36:59,950 --> 00:36:59,960
it's in the
 

1445
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,750
it's in the
vector it's in you rebounding um from

1446
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:04,760
vector it's in you rebounding um from
 

1447
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,030
vector it's in you rebounding um from
the earth so here's what I'm going to

1448
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,040
the earth so here's what I'm going to
 

1449
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,710
the earth so here's what I'm going to
tell you stance is 2

1450
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:09,720
tell you stance is 2
 

1451
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,470
tell you stance is 2
feet and when I don't stand in any

1452
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:12,480
feet and when I don't stand in any
 

1453
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,349
feet and when I don't stand in any
stance I don't have a twoot relationship

1454
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:15,359
stance I don't have a twoot relationship
 

1455
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,150
stance I don't have a twoot relationship
anyone anytime someone says a stance

1456
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160
anyone anytime someone says a stance
 

1457
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,710
anyone anytime someone says a stance
they're going to name the relationship

1458
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:19,720
they're going to name the relationship
 

1459
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,950
they're going to name the relationship
between two

1460
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:20,960
between two
 

1461
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,309
between two
feet you're doing a cat it's a

1462
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:23,319
feet you're doing a cat it's a
 

1463
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:25,550
feet you're doing a cat it's a
relationship between the two feet it's a

1464
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:25,560
relationship between the two feet it's a
 

1465
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,550
relationship between the two feet it's a
relationship between the two feet even

1466
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:27,560
relationship between the two feet even
 

1467
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,470
relationship between the two feet even
even though on one leg even though

1468
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:29,480
even though on one leg even though
 

1469
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,589
even though on one leg even though
predominantly on one leg it's still a

1470
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:31,599
predominantly on one leg it's still a
 

1471
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,069
predominantly on one leg it's still a
relationship between two feet we don't

1472
00:37:33,069 --> 00:37:33,079
relationship between two feet we don't
 

1473
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:35,309
relationship between two feet we don't
want a relationship between two feet

1474
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:35,319
want a relationship between two feet
 

1475
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,630
want a relationship between two feet
okay all I need is a single round Vector

1476
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:38,640
okay all I need is a single round Vector
 

1477
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,190
okay all I need is a single round Vector
so they St as irrelevant because doesn't

1478
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,200
so they St as irrelevant because doesn't
 

1479
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,950
so they St as irrelevant because doesn't
matter what the relationship is between

1480
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:42,960
matter what the relationship is between
 

1481
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,510
matter what the relationship is between
my two Fe okay martially that's

1482
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:47,520
my two Fe okay martially that's
 

1483
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,670
my two Fe okay martially that's
important more your Marshal base is

1484
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:51,680
important more your Marshal base is
 

1485
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,430
important more your Marshal base is
dependent upon the relationship between

1486
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:54,440
dependent upon the relationship between
 

1487
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,390
dependent upon the relationship between
two Fe the less Dynamic you can be okay

1488
00:37:59,390 --> 00:37:59,400
two Fe the less Dynamic you can be okay
 

1489
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,710
two Fe the less Dynamic you can be okay
and uh hopefully we get there at the end

1490
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:01,720
and uh hopefully we get there at the end
 

1491
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,589
and uh hopefully we get there at the end
and I'll show you what what I mean by

1492
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:03,599
and I'll show you what what I mean by
 

1493
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,230
and I'll show you what what I mean by
that okay but you have to be able to be

1494
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:07,240
that okay but you have to be able to be
 

1495
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,870
that okay but you have to be able to be
dynamic you cannot be like you see those

1496
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:10,880
dynamic you cannot be like you see those
 

1497
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,230
dynamic you cannot be like you see those

mik Tyson who's moving all over and

1502
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,040
mik Tyson who's moving all over and
 

1503
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,750
mik Tyson who's moving all over and
you're like here like this you see that

1504
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:19,760
you're like here like this you see that
 

1505
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,030
you're like here like this you see that
cuz you're going to go you're going to

1506
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,040
cuz you're going to go you're going to
 

1507
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,589
cuz you're going to go you're going to
touch them and then you're going to go

1508
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:22,599
touch them and then you're going to go
 

1509
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:25,309
touch them and then you're going to go
no you're not you're going to touch them

1510
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:25,319
no you're not you're going to touch them
 

1511
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:26,829
no you're not you're going to touch them
they're going to deviate and then

1512
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:26,839
they're going to deviate and then
 

1513
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:28,349
they're going to deviate and then
they're going to CL walk you over the

1514
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:28,359
they're going to CL walk you over the
 

1515
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:30,270
they're going to CL walk you over the
top which is what we see every single

1516
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:30,280
top which is what we see every single
 

1517
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,990
top which is what we see every single
time okay so careful on the stances try

1518
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,000
time okay so careful on the stances try
 

1519
00:38:34,000 --> 00:39:00,540
time okay so careful on the stances try
it again

1520
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:00,550

 

1521
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:05,750

[Music]

1522
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:05,760

 

1523
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,910

okay so where do you feel her her

1524
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:09,920
okay so where do you feel her her
 

1525
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,069
okay so where do you feel her her
uh let's call it the the uh radius of

1526
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:13,079
uh let's call it the the uh radius of
 

1527
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:16,309
uh let's call it the the uh radius of
her CQ do you do you can you deduce what

1528
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:16,319
her CQ do you do you can you deduce what
 

1529
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:17,870
her CQ do you do you can you deduce what
I mean by that it's going over the

1530
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:17,880
I mean by that it's going over the
 

1531
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,430
I mean by that it's going over the
shoulder okay you feel that going over

1532
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:19,440
shoulder okay you feel that going over
 

1533
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,950
shoulder okay you feel that going over
the shoulder is it is it actually going

1534
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:21,960
the shoulder is it is it actually going
 

1535
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,390
the shoulder is it is it actually going
over your shoulder I know this Vector is

1536
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:24,400
over your shoulder I know this Vector is
 

1537
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,710
over your shoulder I know this Vector is
over your shoulder but is the radius is

1538
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:26,720
over your shoulder but is the radius is
 

1539
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,309
over your shoulder but is the radius is
it actually going over your

1540
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:29,319
it actually going over your
 

1541
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:31,589
it actually going over your
shoulder in other words is is your

1542
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:31,599
shoulder in other words is is your
 

1543
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,270
shoulder in other words is is your
shoulder going flying backwards right

1544
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:33,280
shoulder going flying backwards right
 

1545
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,190
shoulder going flying backwards right
now so no so what's the where's the

1546
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:38,200

 

1547
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,349

radius you feel it in your chest where

1548
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:41,359
radius you feel it in your chest where
 

1549
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,190
radius you feel it in your chest where
do you feel it it's kind of going into

1550
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,200
do you feel it it's kind of going into
 

1551
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,430
do you feel it it's kind of going into
the space right is that where you feel

1552
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:45,440
the space right is that where you feel
 

1553
00:39:45,440 --> 00:40:01,829
the space right is that where you feel
it think about it

1554
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:01,839

 

1555
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,510

so I feel here but I think that's my own

1556
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:04,520
so I feel here but I think that's my own
 

1557
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,710
so I feel here but I think that's my own
tension okay so just release that

1558
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:07,720
tension okay so just release that
 

1559
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,349
tension okay so just release that
tension where is the radius of

1560
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
tension where is the radius of
 

1561
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,309
tension where is the radius of
her

1562
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:13,319
her
 

1563
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:15,829
her
CQ anyone else take a guess where do you

1564
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:15,839
CQ anyone else take a guess where do you
 

1565
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,910
CQ anyone else take a guess where do you
see

1566
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:19,920

 

1567
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,510

it do it again same exact thing don't

1568
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:22,520
it do it again same exact thing don't
 

1569
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,790
it do it again same exact thing don't
change anything where do you see

1570
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:25,800
change anything where do you see
 

1571
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,910
change anything where do you see
it here uh let's try it again

1572
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:31,920

 

1573
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,589

here so the radius in your shoulder you

1574
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:35,599
here so the radius in your shoulder you
 

1575
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,470
here so the radius in your shoulder you
see the radius is in your shoulder

1576
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:38,480
see the radius is in your shoulder
 

1577
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,150
see the radius is in your shoulder
shoulder got you see that the vector

1578
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:41,160
shoulder got you see that the vector
 

1579
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,069
shoulder got you see that the vector
might be in your shoulder but the radius

1580
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:44,079
might be in your shoulder but the radius
 

1581
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,390
might be in your shoulder but the radius
is not do you guys get that okay so

1582
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,400
is not do you guys get that okay so
 

1583
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,870
is not do you guys get that okay so
again I'm down here the vector might be

1584
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:50,880
again I'm down here the vector might be
 

1585
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,589
again I'm down here the vector might be
in your chest but the radius is not in

1586
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:54,599
in your chest but the radius is not in
 

1587
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,030
in your chest but the radius is not in
your chest you see yes you guys

1588
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,040
your chest you see yes you guys
 

1589
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,109
your chest you see yes you guys
understand

1590
00:40:58,109 --> 00:40:58,119
understand
 

1591
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,950
understand
okay yes or no yeah okay so I want you

1592
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:01,960
okay yes or no yeah okay so I want you

1595
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,589

understand see it from the first example

1596
00:41:08,589 --> 00:41:08,599
understand see it from the first example
 

1597
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:12,470
understand see it from the first example
the shoulder it in the chest you

1598
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:12,480
the shoulder it in the chest you
 

1599
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,349
the shoulder it in the chest you
see the

1600
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:14,359
see the
 

1601
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:18,150
see the
radius here is we know in iido we're

1602
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,160
radius here is we know in iido we're
 

1603
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,470
radius here is we know in iido we're
going to we're going to spiral rotate

1604
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:20,480
going to we're going to spiral rotate
 

1605
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,270
going to we're going to spiral rotate
not

1606
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:21,280
not
 

1607
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,069
not
only across the three components okay

1608
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:26,079
only across the three components okay
 

1609
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,069
only across the three components okay
so the Tom Den for example is going to

1610
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:29,079
so the Tom Den for example is going to
 

1611
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:32,910
so the Tom Den for example is going to
SP rotation okay but at the physical

1612
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:32,920
SP rotation okay but at the physical
 

1613
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,990
SP rotation okay but at the physical
level the relationship between knock nag

1614
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,000
level the relationship between knock nag
 

1615
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,390
level the relationship between knock nag
huk is also going to spir locate

1616
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:39,400
huk is also going to spir locate
 

1617
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,390
huk is also going to spir locate
okay so that is

1618
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:42,400
okay so that is
 

1619
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,270
okay so that is
why we don't do yesterday's technique

1620
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:46,280
why we don't do yesterday's technique
 

1621
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,510
why we don't do yesterday's technique
like

1622
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:49,520

 

1623
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,950

this the fight did not did not TR rotate

1624
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:53,960
this the fight did not did not TR rotate
 

1625
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:59,069
this the fight did not did not TR rotate
we we are going to have the whole thing

1626
00:41:59,069 --> 00:41:59,079
we we are going to have the whole thing
 

1627
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:01,710
we we are going to have the whole thing
turn how far at least

1628
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:01,720
turn how far at least
 

1629
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,910
turn how far at least
90° okay so we throw it over here the

1630
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:05,920
90° okay so we throw it over here the
 

1631
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,870
90° okay so we throw it over here the
two people UK and net for an attacker

1632
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:09,880
two people UK and net for an attacker
 

1633
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,230
two people UK and net for an attacker
and the defender the defender is going

1634
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,240
and the defender the defender is going
 

1635
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,829
and the defender the defender is going
to follow rotate okay so that is why we

1636
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:15,839
to follow rotate okay so that is why we
 

1637
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,550
to follow rotate okay so that is why we
can talk about a

1638
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:17,560
can talk about a
 

1639
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:27,230
can talk about a
radius got it and the radius is

1640
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,240

 

1641
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,109

when you have a

1642
00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:30,119

 

1643
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:33,589

circle the radius is the distance from

1644
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:33,599
circle the radius is the distance from
 

1645
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,910
circle the radius is the distance from
this the circumference to the center

1646
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:38,920
this the circumference to the center
 

1647
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,430
this the circumference to the center
okay so I was asking how long is the

1648
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:43,440
okay so I was asking how long is the
 

1649
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,470
okay so I was asking how long is the
radius or where is this end of the

1650
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:48,480
radius or where is this end of the
 

1651
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,870
radius or where is this end of the
radius okay

1652
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:50,880
radius okay
 

1653
00:42:50,880 --> 00:43:00,870
radius okay
or uh how big is her Circle

1654
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:00,880

 

1655
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,670

so we'll just do with one hand okay

1656
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:05,680
so we'll just do with one hand okay
 

1657
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,750
so we'll just do with one hand okay
and from the

1658
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:07,760
and from the
 

1659
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,270
and from the
grip I'm more about

1660
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:10,280
grip I'm more about
 

1661
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,670
grip I'm more about
there if the radius was actually past

1662
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:15,680
there if the radius was actually past
 

1663
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,430
there if the radius was actually past
that like this you see then the shoulder

1664
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:20,440
that like this you see then the shoulder
 

1665
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,309
that like this you see then the shoulder
gets

1666
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:21,319
gets
 

1667
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:25,309
gets
display I would not

1668
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:25,319

 

1669
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:31,309

see this

1670
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:31,319

 

1671
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:34,589

see can so can you push

1672
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:34,599
see can so can you push
 

1673
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:40,589
see can so can you push
in no but I'm hanging out in front of

1674
00:43:40,589 --> 00:43:40,599
in no but I'm hanging out in front of
 

1675
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:45,109
in no but I'm hanging out in front of
you you see yes you get that so my

1676
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:45,119
you you see yes you get that so my
 

1677
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,510
you you see yes you get that so my
radius is not yet in that center it's

1678
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:49,520
radius is not yet in that center it's
 

1679
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,390
radius is not yet in that center it's
kind of relaxed it's kind of

1680
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:52,400
kind of relaxed it's kind of
 

1681
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,670
kind of relaxed it's kind of
here and as a result I just tilt you

1682
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:57,680
here and as a result I just tilt you
 

1683
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,790
here and as a result I just tilt you
can you see

1684
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:00,800

 

1685
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,349

yes but I have to compress you feel that

1686
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:04,359
yes but I have to compress you feel that
 

1687
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:07,150
yes but I have to compress you feel that
you see and I'm compressing and you can

1688
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:07,160
you see and I'm compressing and you can
 

1689
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,230
you see and I'm compressing and you can
look at the difference watch his watch

1690
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:09,240
look at the difference watch his watch
 

1691
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,630
look at the difference watch his watch
his

1692
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:12,640

 

1693
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,270

body feel your Center like what do you

1694
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:15,280
body feel your Center like what do you
 

1695
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,309
body feel your Center like what do you
feel in your Center it should probably

1696
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:17,319
feel in your Center it should probably
 

1697
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:19,190
feel in your Center it should probably
feel pretty relaxed yeah you're tilted

1698
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,200
feel pretty relaxed yeah you're tilted
 

1699
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,829
feel pretty relaxed yeah you're tilted
but it feels pretty

1700
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:21,839
but it feels pretty
 

1701
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,630
but it feels pretty
relaxed

1702
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:23,640
relaxed
 

1703
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,309
relaxed
boom right and you can see how he

1704
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:27,319
boom right and you can see how he
 

1705
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:29,710
boom right and you can see how he
already looks like he's like that you

1706
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:29,720
already looks like he's like that you
 

1707
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,710
already looks like he's like that you
see cuz I'm pushing into that

1708
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:32,720
see cuz I'm pushing into that
 

1709
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,349
see cuz I'm pushing into that
Center uh and not you see there I'm

1710
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:37,359
Center uh and not you see there I'm
 

1711
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,109
Center uh and not you see there I'm
pushing into the center got it and now I

1712
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:41,119
pushing into the center got it and now I
 

1713
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,829
pushing into the center got it and now I
do I keep that line and now I do this

1714
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:44,839
do I keep that line and now I do this
 

1715
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:47,750
do I keep that line and now I do this
thing so let's look at what he's doing

1716
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:47,760
thing so let's look at what he's doing
 

1717
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,549
thing so let's look at what he's doing
here on the first one he's going to

1718
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:50,559
here on the first one he's going to
 

1719
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,589
here on the first one he's going to
tilt until he can't tilt it anymore he

1720
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:53,599
tilt until he can't tilt it anymore he
 

1721
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,829
tilt until he can't tilt it anymore he
loses

1722
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:54,839
loses
 

1723
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:58,870
loses
balance on this one into the body he's

1724
00:44:58,870 --> 00:44:58,880
balance on this one into the body he's
 

1725
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,069
balance on this one into the body he's
already moving that foot you see that

1726
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:02,079
already moving that foot you see that
 

1727
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,470
already moving that foot you see that
because this now is loading his hand so

1728
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:05,480
because this now is loading his hand so
 

1729
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,150
because this now is loading his hand so
go back to the lesson that we're working

1730
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:07,160
go back to the lesson that we're working
 

1731
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,549
go back to the lesson that we're working
on okay feel whatever pressure that is

1732
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:10,559
on okay feel whatever pressure that is
 

1733
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:14,349
on okay feel whatever pressure that is
but it's here it's not here it's here

1734
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:14,359
but it's here it's not here it's here
 

1735
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:17,230
but it's here it's not here it's here
okay and now I start to load that and

1736
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:17,240
okay and now I start to load that and
 

1737
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,589
okay and now I start to load that and
you can see what his body wants to do it

1738
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:20,599
you can see what his body wants to do it
 

1739
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:25,470
you can see what his body wants to do it
wants to move this foot you see

1740
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:25,480
wants to move this foot you see
 

1741
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,549
wants to move this foot you see
okay not line of gravity

1742
00:45:29,549 --> 00:45:29,559
okay not line of gravity
 

1743
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:32,309
okay not line of gravity
outside until he moves the foot on his

1744
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:32,319
outside until he moves the foot on his
 

1745
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,109
outside until he moves the foot on his
own to protect himself from falling okay

1746
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:35,119
own to protect himself from falling okay
 

1747
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,390
own to protect himself from falling okay
there's a difference there all right try

1748
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:38,400
there's a difference there all right try
 

1749
00:45:38,400 --> 00:46:08,190
there's a difference there all right try
it keep going

1750
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:08,200

 

1751
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:20,030

that's

1752
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:20,040

 

1753
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,630

good good all

1754
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:23,640
good good all
 

1755
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,950
good good all
right okay so again at this level so

1756
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:26,960
right okay so again at this level so
 

1757
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,790
right okay so again at this level so
what I've done as a teacher already uh

1758
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:29,800
what I've done as a teacher already uh
 

1759
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,069
what I've done as a teacher already uh
is they all know the techniques you got

1760
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:32,079
is they all know the techniques you got
 

1761
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,990
is they all know the techniques you got
to you do have to introduce the the the

1762
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:35,000
to you do have to introduce the the the
 

1763
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,790
to you do have to introduce the the the

make sure they're understanding the

discovering it on their own in other
places uh which is possible because we

2031
00:53:47,069 --> 00:53:47,079
places uh which is possible because we
 

2032
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:50,470
places uh which is possible because we
have a cohesive understanding of the AR

2033

that's is why it makes sense this is why

00:53:52,789 --> 00:53:52,799
that's is why it makes sense this is why
 

2036
00:53:52,799 --> 00:53:55,390
that's is why it makes sense this is why
people try to steal all the terminology

so if we take kosa which I told you what

2041
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:02,400
so if we take kosa which I told you what
 

2042
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,150
so if we take kosa which I told you what
we were doing with

2043
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:04,160
we were doing with
 

2044
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,270
we were doing with
kosa in kosa other than in the ferite

2045

way where you do this kind of stuff and

2047
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:10,640
way where you do this kind of stuff and
 

2048
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,710
way where you do this kind of stuff and
you have two young hands is what you

2049
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:13,720
you have two young hands is what you
 

2050
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,510
you have two young hands is what you
have okay we don't do that because

2051
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:16,520
have okay we don't do that because
 

2052
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,190
have okay we don't do that because
there's an energetic component and the

2053
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:20,200
there's an energetic component and the
 

2054
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,030
there's an energetic component and the
whole point of everything is to lose the

2055
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:23,040
whole point of everything is to lose the
 

2056
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,710
whole point of everything is to lose the
dichotomy and so we don't we would never

2057
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:25,720
dichotomy and so we don't we would never
 

2058
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,270
dichotomy and so we don't we would never
have young of anything there has to be a

00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:28,280
have young of anything there has to be a
 

2060
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,150
have young of anything there has to be a
Yin in there okay and so the yin hand is

2061
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:32,160
Yin in there okay and so the yin hand is
 

2062
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,470
Yin in there okay and so the yin hand is
on this hand and if you pay attention it

2063
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:35,480
on this hand and if you pay attention it
 

2064
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,069
on this hand and if you pay attention it
will be

2065
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:37,079
will be
 

2066
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:38,990
will be
adhering not

2067
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:39,000
adhering not
 

2068
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,750
adhering not
projecting and it will be yielding not

2069
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:42,760
projecting and it will be yielding not
 

2070
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:49,030
projecting and it will be yielding not
going forward and it will be on a

2071
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:49,040

 

2072
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,589

curve the other hand is

2073
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:53,599
curve the other hand is
 

2074
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,950
curve the other hand is
doing the CW hand

2075
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:56,960
doing the CW hand
 

2076
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,710
doing the CW hand
the poku hand is

2077
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:00,720

 

2078
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,510

projecting it is moving

2079
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:04,520
projecting it is moving
 

2080
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:10,990
projecting it is moving
forward and it is on a

2081
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:11,000

 

2082
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,870

2102
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:54,430

anym okay one's curving and adhering and

2103
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:54,440
anym okay one's curving and adhering and
 

2104
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,829
anym okay one's curving and adhering and
that curve and adhering is but is

2105
00:55:56,829 --> 00:55:56,839
that curve and adhering is but is
 

2106
00:55:56,839 --> 00:56:11,549
that curve and adhering is but is
feeding the projection line okay

2107
00:56:11,549 --> 00:56:11,559

 

2108
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:15,990

try okay so I had a I had where I wanted

2109
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,000
try okay so I had a I had where I wanted
 

2110
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,150
try okay so I had a I had where I wanted
to go uh I said I was going to do

2111
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:19,160
to go uh I said I was going to do
 

2112
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,150
to go uh I said I was going to do
something um because I I know where

2113
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,160
something um because I I know where
 

2114
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,549
something um because I I know where
she's at and I was going to do something

2115
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:25,559
she's at and I was going to do something
 

2116
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:29,230
she's at and I was going to do something
that made it possible for her to do that

2117
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:29,240
that made it possible for her to do that
 

2118
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,230
that made it possible for her to do that
because that

2119
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:32,240
because that
 

2120
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:37,710
because that
um uh is your what is that that is

2121
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:37,720
um uh is your what is that that is
 

2122
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,230
um uh is your what is that that is
your you you become attached to the to

2123
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:41,240
your you you become attached to the to
 

2124
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:41,910
your you you become attached to the to
the

2125
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:41,920
the
 

2126
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,270
the
rooting but I don't root you know what I

2127
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:45,280
rooting but I don't root you know what I
 

2128
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,990
rooting but I don't root you know what I
mean you guys understand so uh

2129
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:49,000
mean you guys understand so uh
 

2130
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,029
mean you guys understand so uh
why why did I teach you rooting at

2131
00:56:53,029 --> 00:56:53,039
why why did I teach you rooting at
 

2132
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:57,870
why why did I teach you rooting at
first okay you know come on you can't do

2133
00:56:57,870 --> 00:56:57,880
first okay you know come on you can't do
 

2134
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,910
first okay you know come on you can't do
what no why is it it is a beginner

2135
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:01,920
what no why is it it is a beginner
 

2136
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,750
what no why is it it is a beginner
progression okay what is what is rooting

2137
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:04,760
progression okay what is what is rooting
 

2138
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,589
progression okay what is what is rooting
is where I hold my feet still you see

2139
00:57:08,589 --> 00:57:08,599
is where I hold my feet still you see
 

2140
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:11,589
is where I hold my feet still you see
and I do the projection I was telling

2141
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:11,599
and I do the projection I was telling
 

2142
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,430
and I do the projection I was telling
Sean don't move your feet till after

2143
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:13,440
Sean don't move your feet till after
 

2144
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,630
Sean don't move your feet till after
they're projected got it okay so he's

2145
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:16,640
they're projected got it okay so he's
 

2146
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,789
they're projected got it okay so he's
still not

2147
00:57:17,789 --> 00:57:17,799
still not
 

2148
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:21,630
still not
rooting why did I want you to root is

2149
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:21,640
rooting why did I want you to root is
 

2150
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,190
rooting why did I want you to root is
another way of asking the same question

2151
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:24,200
another way of asking the same question
 

2152
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,589
another way of asking the same question
what are you doing when you're moving

2153
00:57:26,589 --> 00:57:26,599
what are you doing when you're moving
 

2154
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:29,309
what are you doing when you're moving
your feet you're not feeling the ground

2155
00:57:29,309 --> 00:57:29,319
your feet you're not feeling the ground
 

2156
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:31,710
your feet you're not feeling the ground
path okay yeah so I don't have a ground

2157
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:31,720
path okay yeah so I don't have a ground
 

2158
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,870
path okay yeah so I don't have a ground
path and what are you using

2159
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:33,880
path and what are you using
 

2160
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,950
path and what are you using
instead yeah your body momentum you see

2161
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:36,960
instead yeah your body momentum you see
 

2162
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,589
instead yeah your body momentum you see
which is an external Force engine okay

2163
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:39,599
which is an external Force engine okay
 

2164
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,670
which is an external Force engine okay
so you have to you teach people don't

2165
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:41,680
so you have to you teach people don't
 

2166
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,910
so you have to you teach people don't
move your feet so that they're not doing

2167
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:43,920
move your feet so that they're not doing
 

2168
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,309
move your feet so that they're not doing
this okay don't move your feet but now

2169
00:57:48,309 --> 00:57:48,319
this okay don't move your feet but now
 

2170
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:53,029
this okay don't move your feet but now
the downside of that is we now are not

2171
00:57:53,029 --> 00:57:53,039
the downside of that is we now are not
 

2172
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:57,950
the downside of that is we now are not
able to ground vector internalize

2173
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:57,960
able to ground vector internalize
 

2174
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:01,349
able to ground vector internalize
rebound uh dynamically which is why you

2175
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:01,359
rebound uh dynamically which is why you
 

2176
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,950
rebound uh dynamically which is why you
have a lot of taichi people that don't

2177
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:04,960
have a lot of taichi people that don't
 

2178
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,309
have a lot of taichi people that don't
move their feet versus ronin's able to

2179
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:08,319
move their feet versus ronin's able to
 

2180
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,750
move their feet versus ronin's able to
dance around you see we can dance around

2181
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:11,760
dance around you see we can dance around
 

2182
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,870
dance around you see we can dance around
okay right cuz we need to dance around

2183
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:14,880
okay right cuz we need to dance around
 

2184
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,589
okay right cuz we need to dance around
uh in some situations I can't stand here

2185
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:18,599
uh in some situations I can't stand here
 

2186
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:22,150
uh in some situations I can't stand here
and have someone as you saw with the

2187
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:22,160
and have someone as you saw with the
 

2188
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,710
and have someone as you saw with the
knife drill I cannot stand still on

2189
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:24,720
knife drill I cannot stand still on
 

2190
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,150
knife drill I cannot stand still on
someone who's Dynamic I'm dead I have to

2191
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:27,160
someone who's Dynamic I'm dead I have to
 

2192
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,990
someone who's Dynamic I'm dead I have to
be able to move movement becomes more

2193
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:29,000
be able to move movement becomes more
 

2194
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,109
be able to move movement becomes more
important but we cannot contrast

2195
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:32,119
important but we cannot contrast
 

2196
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:34,230
important but we cannot contrast
movement with the

2197
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:34,240
movement with the
 

2198
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,990
movement with the
rebounding you see do you get that so we

2199
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:37,000
rebounding you see do you get that so we
 

2200
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,829
rebounding you see do you get that so we
start with a progression that makes

2201
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:39,839
start with a progression that makes
 

2202
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:43,630
start with a progression that makes
distinct body momentum but now we got

2203
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:43,640
distinct body momentum but now we got
 

2204
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:47,109
distinct body momentum but now we got
stuck okay so when I was going with Sean

2205
00:58:47,109 --> 00:58:47,119
stuck okay so when I was going with Sean
 

2206
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:48,990
stuck okay so when I was going with Sean
you could tell that I'm just walking

2207
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:49,000
you could tell that I'm just walking
 

2208
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,990
you could tell that I'm just walking
around and do being able to do the same

2209
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:52,000
around and do being able to do the same
 

2210
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,990
around and do being able to do the same
thing okay I wanted us to get there but

2211
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:55,000
thing okay I wanted us to get there but
 

2212
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,069
thing okay I wanted us to get there but
we're out of time we have another class

2213
00:58:57,069 --> 00:58:57,079
we're out of time we have another class
 

2214
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:00,589
we're out of time we have another class
so I I chalk it up and as I watch your

2215
00:59:00,589 --> 00:59:00,599
so I I chalk it up and as I watch your
 

2216
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:01,470
so I I chalk it up and as I watch your
last

2217
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:01,480
last
 

2218
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,230
last
rep uh I can see

2219
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:04,240
rep uh I can see
 

2220
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,430
rep uh I can see
your materialist ways of understanding

2221
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:07,440
your materialist ways of understanding
 

2222
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,870
your materialist ways of understanding
what you were feeling and you got lower

2223
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:10,880
what you were feeling and you got lower
 

2224
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,430
what you were feeling and you got lower
you see you're down here at the

2225
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:13,440
you see you're down here at the
 

2226
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,910
you see you're down here at the
end that came after I told you get into

2227
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:16,920
end that came after I told you get into
 

2228
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,309
end that came after I told you get into
their Center and even though I told you

2229
00:59:20,309 --> 00:59:20,319
their Center and even though I told you
 

2230
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:21,990
their Center and even though I told you
it has nothing to do with the height of

2231
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:22,000
it has nothing to do with the height of
 

2232
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,190
it has nothing to do with the height of
your hands it has to do with the release

2233
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:25,200
your hands it has to do with the release
 

2234
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,510
your hands it has to do with the release
of self and the sinking of chi and it

2235
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:27,520
of self and the sinking of chi and it
 

2236
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,630
of self and the sinking of chi and it
just happens you're like no it has to

2237
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:30,640
just happens you're like no it has to
 

2238
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,789
just happens you're like no it has to
happen physically you see and so I keep

2239
00:59:33,789 --> 00:59:33,799
happen physically you see and so I keep
 

2240
00:59:33,799 --> 00:59:36,870
happen physically you see and so I keep
that in mind as a teacher uh but it

2241
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:36,880
that in mind as a teacher uh but it
 

2242
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,870
that in mind as a teacher uh but it
