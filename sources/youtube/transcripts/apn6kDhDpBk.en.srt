00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
would now call that context so i could
 

275
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,230
would now call that context so i could
change the context around in order to

276
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
change the context around in order to
 

277
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,230
change the context around in order to

279
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,909

324
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
and people in brazil had taken it
 

325
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,950
and people in brazil had taken it
further and made it into a more

326
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
further and made it into a more
 

327
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,430
further and made it into a more
specified ground grappling system but

328
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
specified ground grappling system but
 

329
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,590
specified ground grappling system but

330
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
aikido was kind of untouched and left
 

331
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,430
aikido was kind of untouched and left
like traditional jiu-jitsu so the

332
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
like traditional jiu-jitsu so the
 

333
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,189
like traditional jiu-jitsu so the
context of that was

334
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
context of that was
 

335
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,790
context of that was
armed grappling

336
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
armed grappling
 

337
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,110
armed grappling
so my original ideas of how aikido must

338
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
so my original ideas of how aikido must
 

339
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,510

like it's some kind of armed grappling
system and that's what i really thought

344
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
system and that's what i really thought
 

345
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,150
system and that's what i really thought
um and i was a real advocate of this you

349
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,309
know it's it's an arm grappling system

so the two video clips i'm putting in
 

351
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,189
so the two video clips i'm putting in
here are from early attempts in 2007

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
together and when everyone would leave
 

361
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,870
together and when everyone would leave
we'd lock the door and then we would

362
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
we'd lock the door and then we would
 

363
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,270
we'd lock the door and then we would
just get together and we would try this

stuff out right so this is armed
grappling attempts now at the time i

368
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
grappling attempts now at the time i
 

369
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,230
grappling attempts now at the time i
would have said oh this is what aikido

370
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
would have said oh this is what aikido
 

371
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,990
would have said oh this is what aikido
live training looks like and now i

372
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
live training looks like and now i
 

373
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,510
live training looks like and now i
realize that there's a whole lot more to

374
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
realize that there's a whole lot more to
 

375
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,270
realize that there's a whole lot more to
it than this but these are our first

376
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
it than this but these are our first
 

377
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,990
it than this but these are our first
attempts at that

378
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
attempts at that
 

379
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,590
attempts at that
okay so we were starting these off from

380
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
okay so we were starting these off from
 

381
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,909
okay so we were starting these off from
a grab so we weren't worrying at the

382
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
a grab so we weren't worrying at the
 

383
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,230
a grab so we weren't worrying at the
time about anything that was done

384
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
time about anything that was done
 

385
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,230
time about anything that was done
pre-grab so that's not the focus we were

386
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
pre-grab so that's not the focus we were
 

387
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,629
pre-grab so that's not the focus we were
trying to see aikido techniques and so

388
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
trying to see aikido techniques and so
 

389
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,790
trying to see aikido techniques and so
right here you can see a sankyo coming

390
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
right here you can see a sankyo coming
 

391
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,350
right here you can see a sankyo coming
off and turning into a yonkyo and so i'm

392
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
off and turning into a yonkyo and so i'm
 

393
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,710
off and turning into a yonkyo and so i'm
turning uchimori's what you call that

394
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
turning uchimori's what you call that
 

395
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,189
turning uchimori's what you call that

00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
nikita setting up a sankyo trying to get
 

397
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,029
nikita setting up a sankyo trying to get
the sankyo turning that into a yonkyo

398
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
the sankyo turning that into a yonkyo
 

399
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,629
the sankyo turning that into a yonkyo
michael turned his back switched knife

400
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
michael turned his back switched knife
 

401
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,469
michael turned his back switched knife
hands and came after me you're gonna see

402
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
hands and came after me you're gonna see
 

403
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,749
hands and came after me you're gonna see
a lot of that switching because in the

404
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
a lot of that switching because in the
 

405
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,909
a lot of that switching because in the
beginning didn't really understand how

406
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
beginning didn't really understand how
 

407
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,070
beginning didn't really understand how
to stop knife switches

408
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080

 

409
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,790

so all this clinch work you're seeing is

410
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
so all this clinch work you're seeing is
 

411
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,870
so all this clinch work you're seeing is
not indicative of classic aikido but at

412
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
not indicative of classic aikido but at
 

413
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,870
not indicative of classic aikido but at
the time i was completely ignoring that

414
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
the time i was completely ignoring that
 

415
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,110
the time i was completely ignoring that
and the idea was i wanted to see aikido

416
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
and the idea was i wanted to see aikido
 

417
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,350
and the idea was i wanted to see aikido
techniques come off and so when there's

418
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
techniques come off and so when there's
 

419
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,749
techniques come off and so when there's
an emphasis on these wrist grabs that

420
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
an emphasis on these wrist grabs that
 

421
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,230
an emphasis on these wrist grabs that
will happen so here's the second clip

422
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
will happen so here's the second clip
 

423
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,390
will happen so here's the second clip
again we're starting from the wrist grab

424
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
again we're starting from the wrist grab
 

425
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,430
again we're starting from the wrist grab
mike's trying to cut me whenever he can

426
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
mike's trying to cut me whenever he can
 

427
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,189
mike's trying to cut me whenever he can
and trying to get free so that's his

428
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
and trying to get free so that's his
 

429
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,790
and trying to get free so that's his
objective my objective is to get the

430
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
objective my objective is to get the
 

431
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,629
objective my objective is to get the
weapon from him or get him into a

432
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
weapon from him or get him into a
 

433
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,589
weapon from him or get him into a
controllable position so we're trying to

434
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
controllable position so we're trying to
 

435
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,150
controllable position so we're trying to
emulate what i think aikido is which is

436
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
emulate what i think aikido is which is
 

437
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,309
emulate what i think aikido is which is
at this time i think it's some kind of

438
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
at this time i think it's some kind of
 

439
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,869
at this time i think it's some kind of
uh jiu-jitsu remnant

440
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
uh jiu-jitsu remnant
 

441
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,150
uh jiu-jitsu remnant
so you can see there mike's cutting my

442
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
so you can see there mike's cutting my
 

443
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,070
so you can see there mike's cutting my
wrist uh played that a few times you can

444
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
wrist uh played that a few times you can
 

445
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,950
wrist uh played that a few times you can
see

446
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
see
 

447
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,230
see
these are things actually let me stop

448
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
these are things actually let me stop
 

449
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,909
these are things actually let me stop
this real quick these are the things

450
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
this real quick these are the things
 

451
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,230
this real quick these are the things
you'll see a lot in these videos because

452
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
you'll see a lot in these videos because
 

453
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,990
you'll see a lot in these videos because
these early videos because

454
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
these early videos because
 

455
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,309
these early videos because
we really didn't have a concept of how

456
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
we really didn't have a concept of how
 

457
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,230
we really didn't have a concept of how
to keep the person from cutting you

458
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
to keep the person from cutting you
 

459
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,710
to keep the person from cutting you
other than just holding the wrist hard

460
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
other than just holding the wrist hard
 

461
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,469
other than just holding the wrist hard
and as we

462
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
and as we
 

463
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,749
and as we
get better at it you'll see that

464
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
get better at it you'll see that
 

465
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,029
get better at it you'll see that
starting to happen less and less and

466
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
starting to happen less and less and
 

467
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,550
starting to happen less and less and
less

468
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
less
 

469
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,830
less
honestly i believe those things are

470
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
honestly i believe those things are
 

471
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,189
honestly i believe those things are
accounted for in the forums i just

472
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
accounted for in the forums i just
 

473
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,790
accounted for in the forums i just
didn't know how to interpret them at the

474
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
didn't know how to interpret them at the
 

475
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,830
didn't know how to interpret them at the
time so

476
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
time so
 

477
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,510
time so
you'll see a lot of that knife switching

478
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
you'll see a lot of that knife switching
 

479
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,189
you'll see a lot of that knife switching
and a lot of

480
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
and a lot of
 

481
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,589
and a lot of
cutting even though it's being held so

482
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
cutting even though it's being held so
 

483
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,510
cutting even though it's being held so
i'll go ahead and start her again here
