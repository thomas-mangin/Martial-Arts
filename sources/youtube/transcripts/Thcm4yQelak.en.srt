where he's actually falling into the

28
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
where he's actually falling into the
 

29
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,190
where he's actually falling into the
hole okay

30
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
hole okay
 

31
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,110

my back in this side circle guard

34
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
my back in this side circle guard
 

35
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,110
my back in this side circle guard
all right now i have a couple ways of

36
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
all right now i have a couple ways of
 

37
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,630
all right now i have a couple ways of
doing this

38
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
doing this
 

39
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,670
doing this
if i throw him all the way it's just a

40
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
if i throw him all the way it's just a
 

41
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,869
if i throw him all the way it's just a
minor adjustment

42
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
minor adjustment
 

43
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,670
minor adjustment
and i can just do it by using my legs on

44
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
and i can just do it by using my legs on
 

45
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,470
and i can just do it by using my legs on
him

46
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480

 

47
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,709

we'll start with the easiest one okay

48
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
we'll start with the easiest one okay
 

49
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,549
we'll start with the easiest one okay
but it's not the best one

50
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559
but it's not the best one
 

51
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,110
but it's not the best one
so i'm doing everything the same i'm

52
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
so i'm doing everything the same i'm
 

53
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,350
so i'm doing everything the same i'm
going to take my foot often

54
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
going to take my foot often
 

55
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,630
going to take my foot often
off his back post it near

56
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
off his back post it near
 

57
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,350
off his back post it near
his foot i don't want to have it way out

58
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
his foot i don't want to have it way out
 

59
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,270
his foot i don't want to have it way out
here because he'll step over

60
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
here because he'll step over
 

61
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,870
here because he'll step over
into a mouth or a half guard go back

62
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
into a mouth or a half guard go back
 

63
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,070
into a mouth or a half guard go back
so when i take it off his back i'm aware

64
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
so when i take it off his back i'm aware
 

65
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,510
so when i take it off his back i'm aware
of where his foot is

66
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
of where his foot is
 

67
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,590
of where his foot is
try it again he'll find that much he's

68
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
try it again he'll find that much he's
 

69
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,789
try it again he'll find that much he's
much harder to step

70
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
much harder to step
 

71
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,710
much harder to step
over and i have to be fast so

72
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
over and i have to be fast so
 

73
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,990
over and i have to be fast so
over shrimp and then

74
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
over shrimp and then
 

75
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,710
over shrimp and then
re-close second option

76
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720

 

77
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,670

i'm over here he goes a little i'm gonna

78
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
i'm over here he goes a little i'm gonna

put my foot
on his on his hip and he'll find that

82
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
on his on his hip and he'll find that
 

83
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,389
on his on his hip and he'll find that
even harder to step

84
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
even harder to step
 

85
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,749
even harder to step
over but i can shrink on using that

86
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
over but i can shrink on using that
 

87
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,830

00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840

 

89
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,870

next option is to i will uncross

90
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
