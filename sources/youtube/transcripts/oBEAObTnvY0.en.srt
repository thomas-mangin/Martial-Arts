i think a really important thing that
 

53
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,349
i think a really important thing that
this points out about the system is the

54
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
this points out about the system is the
 

55
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,109
this points out about the system is the
system is built for multiple attackers

56
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
system is built for multiple attackers
 

57
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,350
system is built for multiple attackers
not built for one-on-one engagements

58
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
not built for one-on-one engagements
 

59
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,270
not built for one-on-one engagements
like so that's its purpose is one is

60
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
like so that's its purpose is one is
 

61
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,030
like so that's its purpose is one is
multiple tigers the reason we know that

62
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
multiple tigers the reason we know that
 

63
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,789
multiple tigers the reason we know that
is because we have to train for someone

64
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
is because we have to train for someone
 

65
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,630
is because we have to train for someone
being behind me boxing has no ushirawaza

66
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
being behind me boxing has no ushirawaza
 

67
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,310
being behind me boxing has no ushirawaza
right boxers don't practice anything

68
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
right boxers don't practice anything
 

69
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,149
right boxers don't practice anything
like this kickboxers don't practice

70
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
like this kickboxers don't practice
 

71
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,270
like this kickboxers don't practice
things like this wrestlers don't

72
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
things like this wrestlers don't
 

73
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,270
things like this wrestlers don't
practice things like this because they

74
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
practice things like this because they
 

75
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,350
practice things like this because they
don't need to because in the sport we

76
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
don't need to because in the sport we
 

77
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,789
don't need to because in the sport we
line up like this and we're not going to

78
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
line up like this and we're not going to
 

79
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,390
line up like this and we're not going to
get behind each other

80
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
get behind each other
 

81
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,149
get behind each other
one person it's really really hard for

82
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
one person it's really really hard for
 

83
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,069
one person it's really really hard for
them to get behind you now you know it's

84
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
them to get behind you now you know it's
 

85
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,190
them to get behind you now you know it's
true that in wrestling there are

86
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
true that in wrestling there are
 

87
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,870
true that in wrestling there are
situations where a guy slides behind

88
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
situations where a guy slides behind
 

89
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,390
situations where a guy slides behind
once they're in a clinch and there are

90
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400
once they're in a clinch and there are
 

91
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,469
once they're in a clinch and there are
clinch positions for it but aikido just

92
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
clinch positions for it but aikido just
 

93
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,190
clinch positions for it but aikido just
has the whole concept of ushirowaza and

94
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
has the whole concept of ushirowaza and
 

95
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,870
has the whole concept of ushirowaza and
the only reason that really could be is

96
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
the only reason that really could be is
 

97
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,630
the only reason that really could be is
because there's a second attacker i mean

98
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
because there's a second attacker i mean
 

99
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,230
because there's a second attacker i mean
i guess we could have ninja sneak

100
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
i guess we could have ninja sneak
 

101
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,069
i guess we could have ninja sneak
attacks or something but it's most

102
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
attacks or something but it's most
 

103
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,230
attacks or something but it's most
likely because there's a second attacker

104
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
likely because there's a second attacker
 

105
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,789
likely because there's a second attacker
all right now how do we start to address

106
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
all right now how do we start to address
 

107
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,550
all right now how do we start to address
it so i think an important thing to

108
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
it so i think an important thing to
 

109
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,109
it so i think an important thing to
understand is that aikido's basic answer

110
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
understand is that aikido's basic answer
 

111
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,670
understand is that aikido's basic answer
for this is generally sotomawari and so

112
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
for this is generally sotomawari and so
 

113
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,550
for this is generally sotomawari and so
a sotomori from ushiro is simply this

114
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
a sotomori from ushiro is simply this
 

115
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,990
a sotomori from ushiro is simply this
right so that's an

116
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
right so that's an
 

117
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,309
right so that's an
a sotomori an outside turn so if we were

118
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
a sotomori an outside turn so if we were
 

119
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,830
a sotomori an outside turn so if we were
facing each other outside turn looks

120
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
facing each other outside turn looks
 

121
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,550
facing each other outside turn looks
like this if i'm this way outside turn

122
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
like this if i'm this way outside turn
 

123
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,229
like this if i'm this way outside turn
looks like this right but i'm trying to

124
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
looks like this right but i'm trying to
 

125
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,630
looks like this right but i'm trying to
turn to the outside right so outside of

126
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
turn to the outside right so outside of
 

127
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,589
turn to the outside right so outside of
josh

128
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
josh
 

129
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,670
josh
and then of course we do have 45s and

130
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
and then of course we do have 45s and
 

131
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,110
and then of course we do have 45s and
triangles and other stuff that's in this

132
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
triangles and other stuff that's in this
 

133
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,710
triangles and other stuff that's in this
but that's our main idea

134
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
but that's our main idea
 

135
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,190
but that's our main idea
when we're doing that our we also want

136
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
when we're doing that our we also want
 

137
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,430
when we're doing that our we also want
to have the hand up that we're turning

138
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
to have the hand up that we're turning
 

139
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,350
to have the hand up that we're turning
to so if i'm turning to my right i want

140
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
to so if i'm turning to my right i want
 

141
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,949
to so if i'm turning to my right i want
to have that hand up and it does a lot

142
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
to have that hand up and it does a lot
 

143
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,550
to have that hand up and it does a lot
of great things one thing it does is it

144
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
of great things one thing it does is it
 

145
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,229
of great things one thing it does is it
gets josh reacting to me so you notice

146
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
gets josh reacting to me so you notice
 

147
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,589
gets josh reacting to me so you notice
how josh's hands come up because you

148
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
how josh's hands come up because you
 

149
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,190
how josh's hands come up because you
don't want me hit him in the face so his

150
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
don't want me hit him in the face so his
 

151
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,110
don't want me hit him in the face so his
hands immediately start coming up and

152
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
hands immediately start coming up and
 

153
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,830
hands immediately start coming up and
that gives me a position to turn off of

154
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
that gives me a position to turn off of
 

155
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,990
that gives me a position to turn off of
right so i got a position turn off of

156
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
right so i got a position turn off of
 

157
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,509
right so i got a position turn off of
and plus i'm already putting up some

158
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
and plus i'm already putting up some
 

159
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,030
and plus i'm already putting up some
kind of defense in the area so even if

160
