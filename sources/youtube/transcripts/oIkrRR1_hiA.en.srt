00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,440
going to be more traversing of the
sagittal plane it's going to be more

Kentucky Derby hat and strangely this is
 

21
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,709
Kentucky Derby hat and strangely this is
the same shape as your okay okay so my

22
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
the same shape as your okay okay so my
 

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,880
the same shape as your okay okay so my
hands are more like that you see because

24
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:46,890
hands are more like that you see because
 

25
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,790
hands are more like that you see because
that gives me structural integrity

26
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:49,800
that gives me structural integrity
 

27
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,029
that gives me structural integrity
that this is difficult more difficult to

28
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
that this is difficult more difficult to

00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:01,069
that this is difficult more difficult to
do so if boom whoa I move my body to get
