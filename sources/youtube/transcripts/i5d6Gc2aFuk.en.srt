let's talk about the kind of spear

6
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
let's talk about the kind of spear
 

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,709
let's talk about the kind of spear
you're going to need for

8
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:10,719
you're going to need for
 

9
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,549
you're going to need for
training so we're training with a

10
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
training so we're training with a
 

11
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,910
training so we're training with a
japanese style spear let me show you

12
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
japanese style spear let me show you
 

13
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,589
japanese style spear let me show you
traditional japanese style spear

14
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,599
traditional japanese style spear
 

15
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,510
traditional japanese style spear
so this is a traditional japanese style

16
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
so this is a traditional japanese style
 

17
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,990
so this is a traditional japanese style
spear and it's more elaborate than

18
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
spear and it's more elaborate than
 

19
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,150
spear and it's more elaborate than
what we're going to work with and also

20
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,160
what we're going to work with and also
 

21
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,150
what we're going to work with and also
it's this is a battlefield sphere so

22
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,160
it's this is a battlefield sphere so
 

23
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,990
it's this is a battlefield sphere so
this sphere is seven feet tall

24
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
this sphere is seven feet tall
 

25
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,910
this sphere is seven feet tall
this is a medium-sized spear for the

26
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:27,920
this is a medium-sized spear for the
 

27
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,750
this is a medium-sized spear for the
battlefield and not what we're going to

28
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,760
battlefield and not what we're going to
 

29
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,189
battlefield and not what we're going to
generally be using for iq to practice

30
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
generally be using for iq to practice
 

31
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,709
generally be using for iq to practice
although you could do all the actions

32
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
although you could do all the actions
 

33
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,830
although you could do all the actions
we do with this size spear it's just not

34
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:35,840
we do with this size spear it's just not
 

35
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,030
we do with this size spear it's just not
really what you're looking for

36
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
really what you're looking for
 

37
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,110
really what you're looking for
and especially in a training situation

38
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
and especially in a training situation
 

39
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,310
and especially in a training situation
when you're training with partners

40
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
when you're training with partners
 

41
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,229
when you're training with partners
this wouldn't be very good now this to

42
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
this wouldn't be very good now this to
 

43
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,229
this wouldn't be very good now this to
maybe take out and have a bale of hay

44
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
maybe take out and have a bale of hay
 

45
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,110
maybe take out and have a bale of hay
or something that you stick it in

46
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
or something that you stick it in
 

47
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,110
or something that you stick it in
repeatedly that might be good to to do

48
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
repeatedly that might be good to to do
 

49
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,389
repeatedly that might be good to to do
something with this

50
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
something with this
 

51
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,990
something with this
but this is not the kind of spear we're

52
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000
but this is not the kind of spear we're
 

53
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,110
but this is not the kind of spear we're
generally going to be using for this

54
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
generally going to be using for this
 

55
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,910
generally going to be using for this
practice

56
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
practice
 

57
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,830
practice
now we could use a metal tipped sphere

58
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
now we could use a metal tipped sphere
 

59
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,150
now we could use a metal tipped sphere
here so this is i made these i don't

60
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
here so this is i made these i don't
 

61
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,349
here so this is i made these i don't
think they're commercially available but

62
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
think they're commercially available but
 

63
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,470
think they're commercially available but
they're not too hard to make

64
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
they're not too hard to make
 

65
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,750
they're not too hard to make
um so i just fashioned a sankaku yachty

66
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
um so i just fashioned a sankaku yachty
 

67
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,590
um so i just fashioned a sankaku yachty
head which is a triangular shaped yachty

68
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
head which is a triangular shaped yachty
 

69
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,149
head which is a triangular shaped yachty
head

70
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
head
 

71
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,590
head
this one's made out of aluminum because

72
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
this one's made out of aluminum because
 

73
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,030
this one's made out of aluminum because
it doesn't need to cut anything or put

74
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
it doesn't need to cut anything or put
 

75
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,469
it doesn't need to cut anything or put
up with a ton of riggers

76
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
up with a ton of riggers
 

77
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,950
up with a ton of riggers
and so uh we made these and used these

78
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
and so uh we made these and used these
 

79
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,910
and so uh we made these and used these
for a long time

80
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
for a long time
 

81
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,510
for a long time
and they're great because you definitely

82
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
and they're great because you definitely
 

83
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,109
and they're great because you definitely
can see that the spearhead's there and

84
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
can see that the spearhead's there and
 

85
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,789
can see that the spearhead's there and
how the spearhead would be working and

86
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
how the spearhead would be working and
 

87
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,310
how the spearhead would be working and
if you were trying to learn anything

88
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
if you were trying to learn anything
 

89
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,670
if you were trying to learn anything
about working with the edges you could

90
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
about working with the edges you could
 

91
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,950
about working with the edges you could
see where the edges were

92
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
see where the edges were
 

93
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,630
see where the edges were
and that's great the problem with

94
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
and that's great the problem with
 

95
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,990
and that's great the problem with
training with these uh spear

96
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
training with these uh spear
 

97
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,630
training with these uh spear
on spear and anything besides uh cebudi

98
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
on spear and anything besides uh cebudi
 

99
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,149
on spear and anything besides uh cebudi
and solo forms

100
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
and solo forms
 

101
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,109
and solo forms
is that um these will chew the heck out

102
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
is that um these will chew the heck out
 

103
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:33,590
is that um these will chew the heck out
of the

104
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
of the
 

105
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,990
of the
the spear shafts so um this one's got

106
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
the spear shafts so um this one's got
 

107
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,749
the spear shafts so um this one's got
some some nice nicks in it and the other

108
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
some some nice nicks in it and the other
 

109
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,950
some some nice nicks in it and the other
ones we use against it

110
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
ones we use against it
 

111
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,350
ones we use against it
um the the spear tip will catch these

112
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
um the the spear tip will catch these
 

113
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,550
um the the spear tip will catch these
shafts over and over and over

114
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
shafts over and over and over
 

115
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,069
shafts over and over and over
and they'll knock big chunks out of it

116
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
and they'll knock big chunks out of it
 

117
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,590
and they'll knock big chunks out of it
so you'll have to replace the shaft a

118
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
so you'll have to replace the shaft a
 

119
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,190
so you'll have to replace the shaft a
lot that's a lot of work because this is

120
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
lot that's a lot of work because this is
 

121
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,870
lot that's a lot of work because this is
made in a somewhat traditional fashion

122
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
made in a somewhat traditional fashion
 

123
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,830
made in a somewhat traditional fashion
where there's a makugi uh uh rat tail a

124
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
where there's a makugi uh uh rat tail a
 

125
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,389
where there's a makugi uh uh rat tail a
tang

126
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
tang
 

127
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,149
tang
that goes down inside the shaft and so

128
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
that goes down inside the shaft and so
 

129
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,069
that goes down inside the shaft and so
the shaft has to be hollowed out and

130
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
the shaft has to be hollowed out and
 

131
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,510
the shaft has to be hollowed out and
then it's cut in a square because if it

132
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
then it's cut in a square because if it
 

133
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,030
then it's cut in a square because if it
was in a circle it would spin

134
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
was in a circle it would spin
 

135
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,950
was in a circle it would spin
it's cutting a square and then you have

136
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
it's cutting a square and then you have
 

137
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,789
it's cutting a square and then you have
to to fit the head perfectly to it so

138
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
to to fit the head perfectly to it so
 

139
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,590
to to fit the head perfectly to it so
it's a lot of work

140
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
it's a lot of work
 

141
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,069
it's a lot of work
so busting the shaft is no fun um and so

142
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
so busting the shaft is no fun um and so
 

143
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,190
so busting the shaft is no fun um and so
while these are really cool and they're

144
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
while these are really cool and they're
 

145
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,990
while these are really cool and they're
great for cebu

146
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
great for cebu
 

147
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,070
great for cebu
and solo practice i wouldn't do a whole

148
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
and solo practice i wouldn't do a whole
 

149
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,869
and solo practice i wouldn't do a whole
lot of spear on spear stuff with these

150
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
lot of spear on spear stuff with these
 

151
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,030
lot of spear on spear stuff with these
now there are wooden alternatives right

152
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
now there are wooden alternatives right
 

153
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,030
now there are wooden alternatives right
so this one

154
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
so this one
 

155
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,030
so this one
this one comes from scuba mountain in

156
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
this one comes from scuba mountain in
 

157
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,550
this one comes from scuba mountain in
japan um and is

158
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
japan um and is
 

159
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,510
japan um and is
probably the exact replica of the kind

160
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
probably the exact replica of the kind
 

161
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,190
probably the exact replica of the kind
of spear that yuishi would use or

162
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
of spear that yuishi would use or
 

163
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,710
of spear that yuishi would use or
a similar one that he might have used

164
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
a similar one that he might have used
 

165
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,350
a similar one that he might have used

the problem with this is again this will
 

177
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,470
the problem with this is again this will
take damage so these fine little tips

of these for us to practice with and
 

197
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,710
of these for us to practice with and
these are great i think these are still

198
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
these are great i think these are still
 

199
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,270

at kingfisher woodworks and so this is
 

203
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,790
at kingfisher woodworks and so this is
great but again while this would be

204
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
great but again while this would be
 

205
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,390
great but again while this would be
really good for solo work

206
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
really good for solo work
 

207
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,229
really good for solo work
this tip is likely to get broken and

208
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
this tip is likely to get broken and
 

209
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,910
this tip is likely to get broken and
we've already broken a few tips and some

210
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
we've already broken a few tips and some
 

211
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,350
we've already broken a few tips and some
are splintered this one's got a couple

212
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
are splintered this one's got a couple
 

213
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,350
are splintered this one's got a couple
weird spots in it because these these

214
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
weird spots in it because these these
 

215
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,550
weird spots in it because these these
fine little points are going to get

216
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
fine little points are going to get
 

217
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,149
fine little points are going to get
knocked around really hard by the shafts

218
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
knocked around really hard by the shafts
 

219
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,949
knocked around really hard by the shafts
of the other sphere

220
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
of the other sphere
 

221
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,229
of the other sphere
and they just don't put up with a lot of

222
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
and they just don't put up with a lot of
 

223
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,990
and they just don't put up with a lot of
abuse so this is a great thing

224
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
abuse so this is a great thing
 

225
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,710
abuse so this is a great thing
for practicing sabudi or any kind of

226
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
for practicing sabudi or any kind of
 

227
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,589
for practicing sabudi or any kind of

solo work
 

229
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,670
solo work

but um to actually hit another spear
 

231
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,190
but um to actually hit another spear
with these aren't really a great thing

232
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
with these aren't really a great thing
 

233
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,910
with these aren't really a great thing
to use

234
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
to use
 

235
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,270
to use
but they are commercially available and

236
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
but they are commercially available and
 

237
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,710
but they are commercially available and
they're fun to have and they're nice and

do
 

243
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,830
do
forms with this

244
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
forms with this
 

245
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,070
forms with this
is what we use for all of our spear on

246
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
is what we use for all of our spear on
 

247
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,869
is what we use for all of our spear on
spear action

248
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
spear action
 

249
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,949
spear action
and it's just a joke that we taped the

250
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
and it's just a joke that we taped the
 

251
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:39,910
and it's just a joke that we taped the
end up now

252
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
end up now
 

253
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,270
end up now
we taped this so that way you always

254
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
we taped this so that way you always
 

255
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,789
we taped this so that way you always
know where your spear tip would be so

256
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
know where your spear tip would be so
 

257
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,990
know where your spear tip would be so
that black tape lets you know where your

258
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
that black tape lets you know where your
 

259
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,869
that black tape lets you know where your
spear tip would be

260
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
spear tip would be
 

261
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,869
spear tip would be
this is also a cheap way to introduce

262
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
this is also a cheap way to introduce
 

263
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,949
this is also a cheap way to introduce
people to spear so if you have a joe

264
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
people to spear so if you have a joe
 

265
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,110
people to spear so if you have a joe
put a piece of tape on it if your dojo

266
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
put a piece of tape on it if your dojo
 

267
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,149
put a piece of tape on it if your dojo
has a bunch of joes

268
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
has a bunch of joes
 

269
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,830
has a bunch of joes
put some tape on them right so if you

270
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
put some tape on them right so if you
 

271
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,990
put some tape on them right so if you
look at our videos of us doing joe work

272
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
look at our videos of us doing joe work
 

273
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,350
look at our videos of us doing joe work
almost all of our joes now have a piece

274
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
almost all of our joes now have a piece
 

275
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,789
almost all of our joes now have a piece
of tape on them so you can use them as a

276
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
of tape on them so you can use them as a
 

277
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,789
of tape on them so you can use them as a
spear or use them as a joe

278
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
spear or use them as a joe
 

279
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,270
spear or use them as a joe
also because it's just a joe there's no

280
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
also because it's just a joe there's no
 

281
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,190
also because it's just a joe there's no
head that's particularly damaging the

282
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
head that's particularly damaging the
 

283
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,030
head that's particularly damaging the
other shafts and no fragile parts to get

284
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
other shafts and no fragile parts to get
 

285
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,589
other shafts and no fragile parts to get
broken

286
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
broken
 

287
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,830
broken
and this basically serves the purpose so

288
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
and this basically serves the purpose so
 

289
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,830
and this basically serves the purpose so
you can do most all of the work for the

290
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
you can do most all of the work for the
 

291
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,110
you can do most all of the work for the
spear on spear stuff

292
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
spear on spear stuff
 

293
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,589
spear on spear stuff
with these that said we occasionally do

294
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
with these that said we occasionally do
 

295
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,870
with these that said we occasionally do
break out the other ones but we just

296
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
break out the other ones but we just
 

297
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,069
break out the other ones but we just
don't do it that much with them because

298
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
don't do it that much with them because
 

299
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,830
don't do it that much with them because
they take a lot of damage that way so

300
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
they take a lot of damage that way so
 

301
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,189
they take a lot of damage that way so
i would recommend especially just

302
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
i would recommend especially just
 

303
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,270
i would recommend especially just
starting out get your joes put a piece

304
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
starting out get your joes put a piece
 

305
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,230
starting out get your joes put a piece
of tape on the end

306
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
of tape on the end
 

307
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,670
of tape on the end
and that's a good way to start training

308
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
and that's a good way to start training
 

309
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,749
and that's a good way to start training
spear and then as you want to move up

310
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
spear and then as you want to move up
 

311
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,270
spear and then as you want to move up
you can either make your own spheres or

312
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
you can either make your own spheres or
 

313
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,790
you can either make your own spheres or
you can have some made for you

314
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
you can have some made for you
 

315
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,070
you can have some made for you
um or there's some commercially

316
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
um or there's some commercially
 

317
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,510
um or there's some commercially
available kingfisher woodworks has those

318
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
available kingfisher woodworks has those
 

319
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,950
available kingfisher woodworks has those
spears still available i believe

320
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
spears still available i believe
 

321
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,710
spears still available i believe
um so that's a good way to go so don't

322
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
um so that's a good way to go so don't
 

323
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,150
um so that's a good way to go so don't
let the equipment stop you it's as

324
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
let the equipment stop you it's as
 

325
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,990
let the equipment stop you it's as
simple as get a joe put a piece of tape

326
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
simple as get a joe put a piece of tape
 

327
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,590
simple as get a joe put a piece of tape
