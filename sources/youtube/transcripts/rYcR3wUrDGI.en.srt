00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:10,280

 

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,509

uh let's look

4
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
uh let's look
 

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,470
uh let's look
at1 so he's doing

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,480
at1 so he's doing
 

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,910
at1 so he's doing
K and he's trying to hit me

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
K and he's trying to hit me
 

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,710
K and he's trying to hit me
here now I got to clear the line of

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:21,720
here now I got to clear the line of
 

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,710
here now I got to clear the line of
attack so I'm here and I lined up on his

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:25,720
attack so I'm here and I lined up on his
 

13
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,269
attack so I'm here and I lined up on his
Center so where I moved into was the

14
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
Center so where I moved into was the
 

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,470
Center so where I moved into was the
zone of s

16
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:31,480
zone of s
 

17
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,709
zone of s
and the zone of sanctuary is

18
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
and the zone of sanctuary is
 

19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,549
and the zone of sanctuary is
identifiable if you use a

20
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:37,559
identifiable if you use a
 

21
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,229
identifiable if you use a
circle inside a square you shade in the

22
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:41,239
circle inside a square you shade in the
 

23
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,110
circle inside a square you shade in the
circle the corners of the square are

24
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
circle the corners of the square are
 

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,869
circle the corners of the square are
unshaded so those are your diagonals 10

26
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
unshaded so those are your diagonals 10
 

27
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,069
unshaded so those are your diagonals 10
2 4 and 8 okay and what that's going to

28
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
2 4 and 8 okay and what that's going to
 

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,549
2 4 and 8 okay and what that's going to
do is if I

30
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
do is if I
 

31
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,430
do is if I
move perfectly North

32
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:00,440
move perfectly North
 

33
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,990
move perfectly North
I am back in the radius of that Circle

34
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
I am back in the radius of that Circle
 

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,190
I am back in the radius of that Circle
and getting hit if I move at the angle

36
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,200
and getting hit if I move at the angle
 

37
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,749
and getting hit if I move at the angle
you see that I start to move outside the

38
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:11,759
you see that I start to move outside the
 

39
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:13,789
you see that I start to move outside the
radius I'm in the corner of the square

40
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:13,799
radius I'm in the corner of the square
 

41
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,390
radius I'm in the corner of the square
at 4:00 okay so you want to move to

42
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:17,400
at 4:00 okay so you want to move to
 

43
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,469
at 4:00 okay so you want to move to
four and you're now lined up on his

44
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
four and you're now lined up on his
 

45
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,789
four and you're now lined up on his
Center okay so this is the m you guys

46
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:23,799
Center okay so this is the m you guys
 

47
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,310
Center okay so this is the m you guys
can move those lights for you here too

48
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:25,320
can move those lights for you here too
 

49
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,510
can move those lights for you here too
we can keep going all right and my

50
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:28,520
we can keep going all right and my
 

51
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,149
we can keep going all right and my
target

52
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
target
 

53
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,230
target
is the hands

54
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:33,240
is the hands
 

55
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,670
is the hands
okay and my power hand is my right hand

56
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
okay and my power hand is my right hand
 

57
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,069
okay and my power hand is my right hand
and it has to stay on the wui line okay

58
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
and it has to stay on the wui line okay
 

59
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,109
and it has to stay on the wui line okay
and then I have to allow that two to

60
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:46,119
and then I have to allow that two to
 

61
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:48,870
and then I have to allow that two to
three in there for my margin for error

62
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
three in there for my margin for error
 

63
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,870
three in there for my margin for error
if I miss so in other words if I move

64
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
if I miss so in other words if I move
 

65
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,950
if I miss so in other words if I move
way

66
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960

 

67
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,510

outside and I put my power Hound where

68
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
outside and I put my power Hound where
 

69
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,389
outside and I put my power Hound where
it goes goes I missed the

70
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
it goes goes I missed the
 

71
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,830
it goes goes I missed the
target if I get

72
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:04,840
target if I get
 

73
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,029
target if I get
here I touch the Target but I I have

74
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:08,039
here I touch the Target but I I have
 

75
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,109
here I touch the Target but I I have
very little margin for error as we're

76
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:10,119
very little margin for error as we're
 

77
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,470
very little margin for error as we're
going on so I always have to give that 2

78
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
going on so I always have to give that 2
 

79
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,229
going on so I always have to give that 2
to three Ines past the Target and this

80
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:17,239
to three Ines past the Target and this
 

81
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,309
to three Ines past the Target and this
works okay and then we reverse engineer

82
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:21,319
works okay and then we reverse engineer
 

83
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:24,430
works okay and then we reverse engineer
everything so he'll

84
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:24,440
everything so he'll
 

85
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,790
everything so he'll
rewind and we

86
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
rewind and we
 

87
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,070
rewind and we
know that my Joe can't go outside my

88
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,080
know that my Joe can't go outside my
 

89
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,390
know that my Joe can't go outside my
outer rim so it stays

90
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
outer rim so it stays
 

91
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,309
outer rim so it stays
here so as he's

92
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319

 

93
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,509

going I'm going to be late here but

94
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:42,519
going I'm going to be late here but
 

95
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,149
going I'm going to be late here but
embryonically he stops

96
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:45,159
embryonically he stops
 

97
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,430
embryonically he stops
here then I hit my

98
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
here then I hit my
 

99
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,470
here then I hit my
target okay but let's look at the

100
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
target okay but let's look at the
 

101
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,830
target okay but let's look at the
embryonic because this this often messes

102
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:52,840
embryonic because this this often messes
 

103
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,070
embryonic because this this often messes
up ieto

104
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,080
up ieto
 

105
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,229
up ieto
people this is a

106
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:57,239
people this is a
 

107
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,869
people this is a
block and there's no blocking in Ikea

108
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
block and there's no blocking in Ikea
 

109
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,309
block and there's no blocking in Ikea
and this this is still a block okay and

110
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
and this this is still a block okay and
 

111
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,630
and this this is still a block okay and
that's a pipe

112
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:05,640
that's a pipe
 

113
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,589
that's a pipe
tra the the non-c

114
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:08,599
tra the the non-c
 

115
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,910
tra the the non-c
contestation is to rotate here not to

116
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:12,920
contestation is to rotate here not to
 

117
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,789
contestation is to rotate here not to
rotate your weapon against the Y aspect

118
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:16,799
rotate your weapon against the Y aspect
 

119
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,030
rotate your weapon against the Y aspect
that's not non-c contestation okay so

120
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
that's not non-c contestation okay so
 

121
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,430
that's not non-c contestation okay so
this is a

122
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:22,440
this is a
 

123
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,670
this is a
block let's just look at it as a block

124
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
block let's just look at it as a block
 

125
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,589
block let's just look at it as a block
but first note this is not

126
00:03:28,589 --> 00:03:28,599
but first note this is not
 

127

closer to his
weapon you see my hands are now

138
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:49,720
weapon you see my hands are now
 

139
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,030
weapon you see my hands are now
vulnerable to the strike okay so I can't

140

vulnerable to the strike okay so I can't
 

141
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,390
vulnerable to the strike okay so I can't
do that all right so let's trade rolls

you see but when he goes to to not risk

168
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
you see but when he goes to to not risk
 

169
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,909
you see but when he goes to to not risk
his hand then he can't he can't hold

that Weapon It's just leverage okay and

172
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
that Weapon It's just leverage okay and
 

173
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,830
that Weapon It's just leverage okay and
so for example the more I am at the

174
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:46,840
so for example the more I am at the
 

175
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,150
so for example the more I am at the
distal end the more leverage I'll have

176
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,160
distal end the more leverage I'll have
 

177
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,590
distal end the more leverage I'll have
the easier that is um this is enough

178
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
the easier that is um this is enough
 

179
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,029
the easier that is um this is enough

183
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,590

the Joe's going that way and then it

506
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:39,480
the Joe's going that way and then it
 

507

the Joe's going that way and then it
glances off you don't want that okay all

when I first started with other of his
 

525
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,990
when I first started with other of his
students this is he did it like this

526
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,000
students this is he did it like this
 

527
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,110
students this is he did it like this
stay on the line come here you see and

528
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
stay on the line come here you see and
 

529
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,430
stay on the line come here you see and
then he'd come off the line and

530
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,440
then he'd come off the line and
 

531
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,829
then he'd come off the line and
sometimes he'd go like

532
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:20,839
sometimes he'd go like
 

533
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,470
sometimes he'd go like
this because he was acrobatic weird okay

534
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
this because he was acrobatic weird okay
 

535
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,269
this because he was acrobatic weird okay
or sometimes he'd violate the rule of

536
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:26,279
or sometimes he'd violate the rule of
 

537
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,230
or sometimes he'd violate the rule of
One Two To None okay

538
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
One Two To None okay
 

539
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,790
One Two To None okay
but later he he'd move one so as he does

540
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:35,800
but later he he'd move one so as he does
 

541
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,150
but later he he'd move one so as he does
his one step I did my one step and then

542
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,160
his one step I did my one step and then
 

543
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,629
his one step I did my one step and then
I tapped here okay so careful if you're

544
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
I tapped here okay so careful if you're
 

545
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,590
I tapped here okay so careful if you're
watching

546
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
watching
 

547
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,910
watching
videos cuz you're going to see the he

548
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:46,920
videos cuz you're going to see the he
 

549
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,550
videos cuz you're going to see the he
does this he stayed on the line that

550
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
does this he stayed on the line that
 

551
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,590
does this he stayed on the line that
doesn't make sense stay on the line what

552
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:50,600
doesn't make sense stay on the line what
 

553
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,310
doesn't make sense stay on the line what
happens if my Joe breaks that doesn't

554
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
happens if my Joe breaks that doesn't
 

555
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,310
happens if my Joe breaks that doesn't
make sense that's a contestation and

556
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:55,320
make sense that's a contestation and
 

557
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,350
make sense that's a contestation and
this isn't going to stop it okay so

558
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
this isn't going to stop it okay so
 

559
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,030
this isn't going to stop it okay so
you're going to do if you watch what

560
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,040
you're going to do if you watch what
 

561
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,310
you're going to do if you watch what
ronan's doing in the video he's doing

562
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
ronan's doing in the video he's doing
 

563
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,430
ronan's doing in the video he's doing
what I taught him which is one two okay

564
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
what I taught him which is one two okay
 

565
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,189
what I taught him which is one two okay
that's the first thing don't stay on the

566
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,199
that's the first thing don't stay on the
 

567
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,269
that's the first thing don't stay on the
line it

568
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
line it
 

569
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,710
line it
is one two then we got to deal with the

570
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
is one two then we got to deal with the
 

571
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,389
is one two then we got to deal with the
block

572
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
block
 

573
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,069
block
okay and you don't want to

574
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:21,079
okay and you don't want to
 

575
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:25,509
okay and you don't want to
block it is an embrionic thing so he

576
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
block it is an embrionic thing so he
 

577
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,470
block it is an embrionic thing so he
goes here and now I have another

578
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
goes here and now I have another
 

579
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,550
goes here and now I have another
guideline

580
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
guideline
 

581
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,309
guideline
and that's what I

582
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:32,319
and that's what I
 

583
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:35,069
and that's what I
use to follow straight

584
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:35,079
use to follow straight
 

585
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:39,470
use to follow straight
down okay that means go back and let's

586
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:39,480
down okay that means go back and let's
 

587
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,230
down okay that means go back and let's
say he's doing showman the real

588
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,240
say he's doing showman the real
 

589
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,509
say he's doing showman the real
technique is right there okay without

590
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:46,519
technique is right there okay without
 

591
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,389
technique is right there okay without
the

592
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:47,399
the
 

593
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,990
the
block so let's look at

594
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,000
block so let's look at
 

595
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,829
block so let's look at
Power because most

596
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
Power because most
 

597
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,309
Power because most
people emphasize the block

598
00:15:59,309 --> 00:15:59,319
people emphasize the block
 

599
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,150
people emphasize the block
with this big thing between your hands

600
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
with this big thing between your hands
 

601
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,629
with this big thing between your hands
okay but

602
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639
okay but
 

603
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,710
okay but
now you won't have as much power as you

604
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:07,720
now you won't have as much power as you
 

605
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,110
now you won't have as much power as you
think okay I know it feels weird cuz

606
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,120
think okay I know it feels weird cuz
 

607
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,710
think okay I know it feels weird cuz
that looks like it's power but off of

608
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
that looks like it's power but off of
 

609
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,790
that looks like it's power but off of
his

610
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:13,800
his
 

611
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,150
his
Joe when I'm here like this it's very

612
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,160
Joe when I'm here like this it's very
 

613
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,910
Joe when I'm here like this it's very
hard to control that you can see how it

614
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:18,920
hard to control that you can see how it
 

615
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,629
hard to control that you can see how it
wiggled on me even at that pace okay you

616
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:21,639
wiggled on me even at that pace okay you
 

617
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,749
wiggled on me even at that pace okay you
got to choke up on the weapon you have

618
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
got to choke up on the weapon you have
 

619
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,430
got to choke up on the weapon you have

so watch How I do
 

625
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,509
so watch How I do
that you're at third Joe and in the

626
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:36,519
that you're at third Joe and in the
 

627
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,350
that you're at third Joe and in the
technique don't go all the way to there

628
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:40,360
technique don't go all the way to there
 

629
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,189
technique don't go all the way to there
in the technique here short boom hit

630
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:44,199
in the technique here short boom hit
 

631
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:46,550
in the technique here short boom hit
right there now you're back at third jaw

632
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
right there now you're back at third jaw
 

633
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,309
right there now you're back at third jaw
on the other side okay so if you

634
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:51,319
on the other side okay so if you
 

635
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:55,949
on the other side okay so if you
go uh boom you're here oh I don't know

639
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,629
what you're going to do you see that so

640
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
you follow the third Joe
 

641
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,470
you follow the third Joe
Rule and you look for this kind of short

642
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:05,480
Rule and you look for this kind of short
 

643
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,909
Rule and you look for this kind of short
stick not long stick yeah under this

stick not long stick yeah under this
 

645
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,710
stick not long stick yeah under this
ideal conditions you could do that but

646
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
ideal conditions you could do that but
 

647
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,350
ideal conditions you could do that but
you're going to pull to the new third

648
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
you're going to pull to the new third
 

649
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,350
you're going to pull to the new third
Joe and is where you your hip at and

650
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
Joe and is where you your hip at and
 

651
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,150
Joe and is where you your hip at and
it's just smacking B down okay not this

652
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:23,160
it's just smacking B down okay not this
 

653
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,750
it's just smacking B down okay not this
kind of Wiggly thing okay all right

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,870
kind of Wiggly thing okay all right
we're going to play with that short joke

656
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:27,880
we're going to play with that short joke
 

657
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,350
we're going to play with that short joke
hitting the bag

658
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
hitting the bag
 

659
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,789
hitting the bag
try so on all the atos you have a rule

660
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:33,799
try so on all the atos you have a rule
 

661
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:36,110
try so on all the atos you have a rule
you can't expose the spine of your

662
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,120
you can't expose the spine of your
 

663
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,990
you can't expose the spine of your
weapon because the weapon like all

664
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,000
weapon because the weapon like all
 

665
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,390
weapon because the weapon like all
weapons they have to be between you and

666
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:41,400
weapons they have to be between you and
 

667
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,470
weapons they have to be between you and
the person so when you point it down

668
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
the person so when you point it down
 

669
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,750
the person so when you point it down
it's not ready it's not in the fight

670
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:46,760
it's not ready it's not in the fight
 

671
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,789
it's not ready it's not in the fight
it's vulnerable okay it would be like a

672
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:49,799
it's vulnerable okay it would be like a
 

673
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,710
it's vulnerable okay it would be like a
gunfight and the threat is already here

674
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720
gunfight and the threat is already here
 

675
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,669
gunfight and the threat is already here
and I'm going to point my weapon at the

676
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:54,679
and I'm going to point my weapon at the
 

677
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,270
and I'm going to point my weapon at the
ground just no that's a no no okay um

678
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
ground just no that's a no no okay um
 

679
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,909
ground just no that's a no no okay um
weapon has to be between you and the

680
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:00,919
weapon has to be between you and the
 

681
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:03,789
weapon has to be between you and the
opponent so let's do the first

682
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:03,799
opponent so let's do the first
 

683
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:07,990
opponent so let's do the first
onei and I'm here you don't want to ever

684
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,000
onei and I'm here you don't want to ever
 

685
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,630
onei and I'm here you don't want to ever
hit so hard and so unrelated with the

686
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:11,640
hit so hard and so unrelated with the
 

687
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,110
hit so hard and so unrelated with the
power hand being the right hand that the

688
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,120
power hand being the right hand that the
 

689
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,830
power hand being the right hand that the
Joe is pointed down because now the

690
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:16,840
Joe is pointed down because now the
 

691
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,310
Joe is pointed down because now the
spine is vulnerable to him he can't he

692
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:19,320
spine is vulnerable to him he can't he
 

693
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,549
spine is vulnerable to him he can't he
can just push it down come in and then

694
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:21,559
can just push it down come in and then
 

695
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,830
can just push it down come in and then
that's it I'm done the weapon's gone

696
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:23,840
that's it I'm done the weapon's gone
 

697
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,990
that's it I'm done the weapon's gone
okay you never do that so on this

698
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,000
okay you never do that so on this
 

699
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,510
okay you never do that so on this
technique when I'm going to

700
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
technique when I'm going to
 

701
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,190
technique when I'm going to
when I'm going around when you come back

702
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:32,200
when I'm going around when you come back
 

703
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,870
when I'm going around when you come back
here like this it's very hard to keep

704
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:34,880
here like this it's very hard to keep
 

705
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,470
here like this it's very hard to keep
that that tip up and so you'll see a lot

706
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:37,480
that that tip up and so you'll see a lot
 

707
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,470
that that tip up and so you'll see a lot
of people when they're doing it it's

708
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:39,480
of people when they're doing it it's
 

709
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,549
of people when they're doing it it's
like it's pointed down at the end and no

710
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
like it's pointed down at the end and no
 

711
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,270
like it's pointed down at the end and no
okay that on top of the fact that now

712
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:46,280
okay that on top of the fact that now
 

713
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,870
okay that on top of the fact that now
you're not at third Joe you got to do

714
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:48,880
you're not at third Joe you got to do
 

715
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,549
you're not at third Joe you got to do
something weird to come back okay so

716
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
something weird to come back okay so
 

717
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,110
something weird to come back okay so
it's out oh it's where you're hitting

718
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
it's out oh it's where you're hitting
 

719
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,549
it's out oh it's where you're hitting
here you're at third Joe and you're good

720
00:18:57,549 --> 00:18:57,559
here you're at third Joe and you're good
 

721
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,669
here you're at third Joe and you're good
to go okay

722
00:18:59,669 --> 00:18:59,679
to go okay
 

723
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,870
to go okay
um when you do it he didn't really take

724
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:01,880
um when you do it he didn't really take
 

725
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,270
um when you do it he didn't really take
the C me I didn't want to break his

726
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280
the C me I didn't want to break his
 

727
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,710
the C me I didn't want to break his
hands but it goes to parallel to the

728
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:05,720
hands but it goes to parallel to the
 

729
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,669
hands but it goes to parallel to the
deck is what you want to do parallel to

730
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
deck is what you want to do parallel to
 

731
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,190
deck is what you want to do parallel to
the deck

732
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,200
the deck
 

733
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,350
the deck
okay all right try Okay so again I I

734
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:14,360
okay all right try Okay so again I I
 

735
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,630
okay all right try Okay so again I I
know it looks like you get this big

736
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:17,640
know it looks like you get this big
 

737
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,909
know it looks like you get this big
whack there okay uh but the problem is

738
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:22,919
whack there okay uh but the problem is
 

739
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,669
whack there okay uh but the problem is
that here's where you first hit the

740
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:25,679
that here's where you first hit the
 

741
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,950
that here's where you first hit the
hands

742
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:26,960
hands
 

743
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,190
hands
right and that's where it completes okay

744
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
right and that's where it completes okay
 

745
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,630
right and that's where it completes okay
so it has to pass through those hands to

746
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
so it has to pass through those hands to
 

747
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,870
so it has to pass through those hands to
get here and what ends up happening go

748
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
get here and what ends up happening go
 

749
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,870
get here and what ends up happening go
ahead do what you did he went too

750
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:41,880
ahead do what you did he went too
 

751
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,029
ahead do what you did he went too
far yeah okay and now he goes to the

752
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:46,039
far yeah okay and now he goes to the
 

753
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:49,350
far yeah okay and now he goes to the
strike and now this is the same problem

754
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,360
strike and now this is the same problem
 

755
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,630
strike and now this is the same problem
with the block this is the dislin you

756
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,640
with the block this is the dislin you
 

757
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,830
with the block this is the dislin you
see and it doesn't

758
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:55,840
see and it doesn't
 

759
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,310
see and it doesn't
have the mechanical advantage you think

760
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,320
have the mechanical advantage you think
 

761
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,190
have the mechanical advantage you think
it does because it's too far away from

762
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200
it does because it's too far away from
 

763
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,110
it does because it's too far away from
the fulcrum but when he moves

764
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,120
the fulcrum but when he moves
 

765
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,990
the fulcrum but when he moves
closer do you see goinging it up he gets

766
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,000
closer do you see goinging it up he gets
 

767
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,990
closer do you see goinging it up he gets
more control now he starts to put his

768
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,000
more control now he starts to put his
 

769
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,549
more control now he starts to put his
weight into it and he has a lot more

770
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
weight into it and he has a lot more
 

771
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,990
weight into it and he has a lot more
control go

772
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,000
control go
 

773
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,190
control go
back push a weight into it and the

774
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:20,200
back push a weight into it and the
 

775
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,909
back push a weight into it and the
handle's going to go the grip's going to

776
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
handle's going to go the grip's going to
 

777
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,909
handle's going to go the grip's going to
go down without this okay so that's why

778
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:24,919
go down without this okay so that's why
 

779
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,590
go down without this okay so that's why
you got to choke up on on the weapon

780
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
you got to choke up on on the weapon
 

781
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,630
you got to choke up on on the weapon
okay from being able to control the tip

782
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,640
okay from being able to control the tip
 

783
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,600
okay from being able to control the tip
and not exposing the spine
