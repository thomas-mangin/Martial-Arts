work is understanding how to make it
 

27
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,750
work is understanding how to make it

someone and a lot of schools if I could

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:45,450
someone and a lot of schools if I could

have spent a lot of time doing savuti
 

35
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,560
have spent a lot of time doing savuti
for just this reason because the idea is

36
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:48,570
for just this reason because the idea is
 

37
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,850
for just this reason because the idea is
like if I have a perfect cut then I'll

38
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:49,860
like if I have a perfect cut then I'll

make a good attack the problem is that

40
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,110
make a good attack the problem is that
 

41
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,750
make a good attack the problem is that
you have to always account for the other

42
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
you have to always account for the other
 

43
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,420
you have to always account for the other
person when you're making attacks so if

44
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,430
person when you're making attacks so if
 

45
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,279
person when you're making attacks so if
someone attacks you and or if you attack

46
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:58,289
someone attacks you and or if you attack
 

47
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,560
someone attacks you and or if you attack
someone and you do not account for the

48
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:00,570
someone and you do not account for the
 

49
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,910
someone and you do not account for the
fact that they can immediately attack

50
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
fact that they can immediately attack
 

51
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,039
fact that they can immediately attack
you back then you've made a poor attack

52
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:04,049
you back then you've made a poor attack
 

53
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,810
you back then you've made a poor attack
so all of our attacks have to have this

54
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:05,820
so all of our attacks have to have this
 

55
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,940
so all of our attacks have to have this
basic understanding so before we get to

56
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:07,950
basic understanding so before we get to
 

57
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,679
basic understanding so before we get to
the basic attacks that we use here in

58
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:09,689
the basic attacks that we use here in
 

59
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,080
the basic attacks that we use here in
this school we have to explain it theory

60
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,090
this school we have to explain it theory
 

61
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,920
this school we have to explain it theory
so if I get Josh in here so Josh and I

62
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:15,930
so if I get Josh in here so Josh and I
 

63
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,050
so if I get Josh in here so Josh and I
are in here sort of the sword so we have

64
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:18,060
are in here sort of the sword so we have
 

65
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,300
are in here sort of the sword so we have
good MA so when we're setting the ma

66
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,310
good MA so when we're setting the ma
 

67
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,460
good MA so when we're setting the ma
here an important thing to understand is

68
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:22,470
here an important thing to understand is
 

69
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,770
here an important thing to understand is
that if I don't take a step I can't

70
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:24,780
that if I don't take a step I can't
 

71
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,600
that if I don't take a step I can't
reach Josh and that's Epps really

72
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:26,610
reach Josh and that's Epps really
 

73
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,830
reach Josh and that's Epps really
important to judge just like in regular

74
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:27,840
important to judge just like in regular
 

75
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,569
important to judge just like in regular
on your theory that step gives you

76
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:29,579
on your theory that step gives you
 

77
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,190
on your theory that step gives you
enough of reaction time to deal with

78
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
enough of reaction time to deal with

00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:35,009
just the tips of our sword touching and
 

83
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,010
just the tips of our sword touching and
if I don't take a step I can't quite hit

jobs for two to come in and make an

88
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:40,950
jobs for two to come in and make an
 

89
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,420
jobs for two to come in and make an
attack on an angle like this and I'm

90
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:44,430
attack on an angle like this and I'm
 

91
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,999
attack on an angle like this and I'm
immediately able to get Josh back that

92
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:47,009
immediately able to get Josh back that
 

93
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,069
immediately able to get Josh back that
attack was a poor attack and the reason

94
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:49,079
attack was a poor attack and the reason
 

95
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,560
attack was a poor attack and the reason
is because my arms will move so fast at

96
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:51,570
is because my arms will move so fast at
 

97
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,539
is because my arms will move so fast at
this range that it's very unlikely that

98
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:53,549
this range that it's very unlikely that
 

99
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:54,859
this range that it's very unlikely that
he'll be able to get his sword down and

100
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:54,869
he'll be able to get his sword down and
 

101
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,050
he'll be able to get his sword down and
defend before I can attack him so he's

102
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,060
defend before I can attack him so he's
 

103
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,600
defend before I can attack him so he's
exposed himself here in this so what

104
00:01:59,600 --> 00:01:59,610
exposed himself here in this so what
 

105
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,200
exposed himself here in this so what
Josh wants to do when he lands

if you want to attack in a way at that

108
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:03,980
if you want to attack in a way at that
 

109
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,580
if you want to attack in a way at that
angle then an eye were immediately

110
