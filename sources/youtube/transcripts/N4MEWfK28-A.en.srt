00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:11,910
guitar so I keep myself over it you see
 

9
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,089
guitar so I keep myself over it you see
how I'm doing that and then I can go

10
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:14,099
how I'm doing that and then I can go
 

11
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,929
how I'm doing that and then I can go
down that's a skeleton so keep lifting

12
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:20,939
down that's a skeleton so keep lifting
 

13
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,040
down that's a skeleton so keep lifting
keep lifting Tokyo is me leveraging off

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,050
keep lifting Tokyo is me leveraging off
 

15
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,140
keep lifting Tokyo is me leveraging off
of my same projection engine so I am

16
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:30,150
of my same projection engine so I am
 

17
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,170
of my same projection engine so I am
holding the stability by leveraging off

18
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:33,180
holding the stability by leveraging off
 

19
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,220
holding the stability by leveraging off
so when I want to drop my hand I

20
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:36,230
so when I want to drop my hand I
 

21
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,650
so when I want to drop my hand I
leverage you off of that same center so

22
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:39,660
leverage you off of that same center so
 

23
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:59,029
leverage you off of that same center so
a little alignment okay so skeletal

24
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
a little alignment okay so skeletal
 

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,729
a little alignment okay so skeletal
alignment you see and yes you can chuck

26
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:01,739
alignment you see and yes you can chuck
 

27
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,520
alignment you see and yes you can chuck
a mask on that okay

28
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:04,530
a mask on that okay
 

29
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,250
a mask on that okay
whole queue itself internal leverage and

30
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:07,260
whole queue itself internal leverage and
 

31
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,890
whole queue itself internal leverage and
internal leverage okay so you can do the

32
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:12,900
internal leverage okay so you can do the
 

33
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,890
internal leverage okay so you can do the
opposite of skeletal alignment lift it

34
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:15,900
opposite of skeletal alignment lift it
 

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,749
opposite of skeletal alignment lift it
up lift it up right so same thing you

36
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:20,759
up lift it up right so same thing you
 

37
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,630
up lift it up right so same thing you
see go ahead lift it up lift it up you

38
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:23,640
see go ahead lift it up lift it up you
 

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,020
see go ahead lift it up lift it up you
see Oh same thing see how I'm doing

40
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,030
see Oh same thing see how I'm doing
 

41
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,520
see Oh same thing see how I'm doing
do you understand what I'm doing though

42
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:28,530
do you understand what I'm doing though
 

43
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,590
do you understand what I'm doing though
okay so skeletal alignment it works

44
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
okay so skeletal alignment it works
 

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,130
okay so skeletal alignment it works
because it's mass and matter right but

46
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,140
because it's mass and matter right but
 

47
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,920
because it's mass and matter right but
it's not cookie okay so when you're

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:39,930
it's not cookie okay so when you're
 

49
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,280
it's not cookie okay so when you're
doing your coal you're not yet here you

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,290
doing your coal you're not yet here you
 

51
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,430
doing your coal you're not yet here you
brought the hand

52
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:44,440
brought the hand
 

53
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,310
brought the hand
Center and then you move the skeletal on

54
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:47,320
Center and then you move the skeletal on
 

55
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:55,320

it's all here okay so your drill in the

68
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:20,860
it's all here okay so your drill in the
 

69
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,000
it's all here okay so your drill in the
next drill won't here hold it

next drill won't here hold it
 

71
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,010
next drill won't here hold it
come on flicks off the center and drop

72
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,020
come on flicks off the center and drop
 

73
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,400
come on flicks off the center and drop
the center okay let's go

74
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,410
the center okay let's go
 

75
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,750
the center okay let's go
so when I when I do my savuti right I'm

76
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
so when I when I do my savuti right I'm
 

77
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,330
so when I when I do my savuti right I'm
kicking up with that tissue organization

78
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:36,340
kicking up with that tissue organization
 

79
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,860
kicking up with that tissue organization
up close the sort oh that's my first

80
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:39,870
up close the sort oh that's my first
 

81
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,740
up close the sort oh that's my first
pulsing of it all up come the source

82
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:42,750
pulsing of it all up come the source
 

83
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,410
pulsing of it all up come the source
then when it comes down oh I have

84
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:46,420
then when it comes down oh I have
 

85
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,160
then when it comes down oh I have
another own selection up at the same

86
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,170
another own selection up at the same
 

87
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:58,080
another own selection up at the same
tissue organization okay so it's the

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,090
tissue organization okay so it's the
 

89
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,280
tissue organization okay so it's the
same organization that we have in a

90
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,290
same organization that we have in a
 

91
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:09,120
same organization that we have in a
projection so boom boom same thing same

92
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,130
projection so boom boom same thing same
 

93
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,800
projection so boom boom same thing same

matter how small you get it
 

99
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,589
matter how small you get it
okay so I'm now using that fleshing on

100
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:24,599
okay so I'm now using that fleshing on
 

101
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,190
okay so I'm now using that fleshing on
against my own levers okay to give me

102
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
against my own levers okay to give me
 

103
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,490
against my own levers okay to give me
more leverage so I don't want you to

104
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:32,500
more leverage so I don't want you to
 

105
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,530
more leverage so I don't want you to
think I don't want you to think it's

106
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:37,540
think I don't want you to think it's
 

107
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,270
think I don't want you to think it's
muscle that's what I was trying to show

108
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
muscle that's what I was trying to show
 

109
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,970
muscle that's what I was trying to show
here right let's let if I try to use my

110
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:41,980
here right let's let if I try to use my
 

111
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,650
here right let's let if I try to use my
my shoulder I can't do it okay but I can

112
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:46,660
my shoulder I can't do it okay but I can
 

113
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,320
my shoulder I can't do it okay but I can
flex off of off of my my center-right

114
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,330
flex off of off of my my center-right
 

115
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,569
flex off of off of my my center-right
flexing off of it you think so when you

116
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:57,579
flexing off of it you think so when you
 

117
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:00,059
flexing off of it you think so when you
come here you have to watch look I'm

118
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:00,069
come here you have to watch look I'm
 

119
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:01,680
come here you have to watch look I'm
trying to get a mechanical advantage

120
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:01,690
trying to get a mechanical advantage
 

121
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,600
trying to get a mechanical advantage
over him do you understand it's kind of

122
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:06,610
over him do you understand it's kind of
 

123
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,569
over him do you understand it's kind of
like here you're trying to get a

124
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:08,579
like here you're trying to get a
 

125
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:12,150
like here you're trying to get a
mechanical advantage and here you're

126
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,160
mechanical advantage and here you're
 

127
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,650
mechanical advantage and here you're
trying to get a mechanical advantage so

128
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:15,660
trying to get a mechanical advantage so
 

129
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,710
trying to get a mechanical advantage so
don't all I'm doing is this okay

130
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:19,720
don't all I'm doing is this okay
 

131
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,200
don't all I'm doing is this okay
you can regrip if he wants well these

weights on the on the bench okay so you

154
00:04:59,190 --> 00:04:59,200
weights on the on the bench okay so you
 

155
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,500
weights on the on the bench okay so you
can't pulse it but we're gonna hold it

156
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:01,510
can't pulse it but we're gonna hold it
 

157
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,730
can't pulse it but we're gonna hold it
so he's there right and I just keep that

158
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:05,740
so he's there right and I just keep that
 

159
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,560
so he's there right and I just keep that
