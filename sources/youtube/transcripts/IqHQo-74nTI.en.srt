geometry so there's the diagonal in this

10
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:31,399
geometry so there's the diagonal in this
 

11
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:34,419
geometry so there's the diagonal in this
frame you see that see that right and

12
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:34,429
frame you see that see that right and
 

13
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:38,740
frame you see that see that right and
then there's that hip mark and that

14
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:38,750
then there's that hip mark and that
 

15
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,880
then there's that hip mark and that
you'd universally throw everyone

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:41,890
you'd universally throw everyone
 

17
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,410
you'd universally throw everyone
utilizing that diagonal because it is

18
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:44,420
