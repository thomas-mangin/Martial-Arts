technique this arm goes here do you see
 

243
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,350
technique this arm goes here do you see
and I'm controlling it disty you have a

244

and I'm controlling it disty you have a
 

245
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,390
and I'm controlling it disty you have a
couple options this is one of them right

246
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
couple options this is one of them right
 

247
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,950
couple options this is one of them right
so I'm at the distal end and my hip is

248
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
so I'm at the distal end and my hip is
 

249
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,150
so I'm at the distal end and my hip is
driving into him okay to lock that in

250
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
driving into him okay to lock that in
 

251
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,390
driving into him okay to lock that in
place another option is a two onone from

252
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:33,400
place another option is a two onone from
 

253
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,510
place another option is a two onone from
the from the forearm so I'm in this that

254
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:36,520
the from the forearm so I'm in this that
 

255
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,390
the from the forearm so I'm in this that
might be necessary is really strong ear

256
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
might be necessary is really strong ear
 

257
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,950
might be necessary is really strong ear
here like that

258
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:39,960
here like that
 

259
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,909
here like that
okay so I can use my forarm I can do it

one another one is you can leave it
 

265
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,909
one another one is you can leave it
there and go two on two on one and not

there and go two on two on one and not
 

267
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,790
there and go two on two on one and not
go to the forarm grip do you understand

see you don't see me doing that weird

332
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:50,200
see you don't see me doing that weird
 

333
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,990
see you don't see me doing that weird
turn right okay let's just look at the

334
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
turn right okay let's just look at the
 

335
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,829
turn right okay let's just look at the
mechanics of the technique so he's down

336
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
mechanics of the technique so he's down
 

337
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,829
mechanics of the technique so he's down
okay and

338
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839

 

339
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,630

okay this this leg is not necessary for

340
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:05,640
okay this this leg is not necessary for
 

341
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,389
okay this this leg is not necessary for
the break it does not need to go across

342
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
the break it does not need to go across
 

343
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,949
the break it does not need to go across
his body so we're we're not bringing it

344
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
his body so we're we're not bringing it
 

345
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,230
his body so we're we're not bringing it
across this leg

346
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
across this leg
 

347
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,590
across this leg
is so this

348
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:20,600

 

349
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,910

leg is going to pin his head

350
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
leg is going to pin his head
 

351
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,590
leg is going to pin his head
down so you don't want to pull him in

352
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
down so you don't want to pull him in
 

353
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,509
down so you don't want to pull him in
with your knee up because with with your

354
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
with your knee up because with with your
 

355
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,389
with your knee up because with with your
knee up he can sit up he sits up he

356
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:33,399
knee up he can sit up he sits up he
 

357
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,829
knee up he can sit up he sits up he
starts to get out of it you push your

358
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
starts to get out of it you push your
 

359
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,829
starts to get out of it you push your
knee down by extending your leg do you

360
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:38,839
knee down by extending your leg do you
 

361
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,790
knee down by extending your leg do you
feel that so no pressure push it down a

362
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:43,800
feel that so no pressure push it down a
 

363
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,990
feel that so no pressure push it down a
lot of people bring this in to keep him

364
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
lot of people bring this in to keep him
 

365
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,069
lot of people bring this in to keep him
close that's not what keeps him close

366
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
close that's not what keeps him close
 

367
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,470
close that's not what keeps him close
you the arm keeps him close and you're

368
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
you the arm keeps him close and you're
 

369
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,389
you the arm keeps him close and you're
maneuvering okay this goes that way if

370
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
maneuvering okay this goes that way if
 

371
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,430
maneuvering okay this goes that way if
you come back

372
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440

 

373
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,870

I'm not a fan of using the pubic bone or

374
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
I'm not a fan of using the pubic bone or
 

375
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,190
I'm not a fan of using the pubic bone or
the testicles for breaking people's arms

376
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:08,200
the testicles for breaking people's arms
 

377
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,710
the testicles for breaking people's arms
so his elbow at the tricep tendon of

378
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:13,720
so his elbow at the tricep tendon of
 

379
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,310
so his elbow at the tricep tendon of
insertion is going to be broken on my

380
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:17,320
insertion is going to be broken on my
 

381
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,230
insertion is going to be broken on my
inner

382
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:19,240
inner
 

383
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,710
inner
thigh that means that his thumb's not

384
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:21,720
thigh that means that his thumb's not
 

385
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,829
thigh that means that his thumb's not
going to be

386
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:22,839
going to be
 

387
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,550
going to be
up his thumb's going to be at the angle

388
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
up his thumb's going to be at the angle
 

389
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,190
up his thumb's going to be at the angle
make a thumb that I can break this

390
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:30,200
make a thumb that I can break this
 

391
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,590
make a thumb that I can break this
on my inner

392
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:31,600
on my inner
 

393
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,030
on my inner
thigh my inner thigh is going that

394
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
thigh my inner thigh is going that
 

395
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,389
thigh my inner thigh is going that
way my two hand grip is going

396
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:41,399
way my two hand grip is going
 

397
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,790
way my two hand grip is going
perpendicular to it as I do

398
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
perpendicular to it as I do
 

399
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,069
perpendicular to it as I do
this it's not going down on my stomach

400
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
this it's not going down on my stomach
 

401
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,310
this it's not going down on my stomach
look

402
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,320
look
 

403
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,750
look
nothing I lift

404
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
nothing I lift
 

405
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,069
nothing I lift
up different look at this I have all

406
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:55,079
up different look at this I have all
 

407
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,350
up different look at this I have all
that all that range of motion to do this

408
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:58,360
that all that range of motion to do this
 

409
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,670
that all that range of motion to do this
break okay okay so this the variant I

410
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:04,680

 

411
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,190

like let us make sure we have those

412
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,200

 

413
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,509

mechanics okay a stronger variation of

414
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
mechanics okay a stronger variation of
 

415
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,030
mechanics okay a stronger variation of
the technique but there's more

416
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
the technique but there's more
 

417
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,030
the technique but there's more
transition and uh transition

418
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
transition and uh transition
 

419
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,550
transition and uh transition
requires things you might not have time

420
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:23,560
requires things you might not have time
 

421
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,790
requires things you might not have time
and space okay but they might move into

422
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
and space okay but they might move into
 

423
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,389
and space okay but they might move into
it so that's why I teach these these

424
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:29,399
it so that's why I teach these these
 

425
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,310
it so that's why I teach these these
pairs okay so he goes to the counter I

426
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
pairs okay so he goes to the counter I
 

427
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,470
pairs okay so he goes to the counter I
come in around here and I take it this

428
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:35,480
come in around here and I take it this
 

429
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,629
come in around here and I take it this
way okay and so I still obeying the

430
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:39,639
way okay and so I still obeying the
 

431
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,750
way okay and so I still obeying the
leverage law okay make sense I I'm going

432
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
leverage law okay make sense I I'm going
 

433
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,389
leverage law okay make sense I I'm going
to drw I'm going to loosen it so I can

434
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:45,399
to drw I'm going to loosen it so I can
 

435
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,030
to drw I'm going to loosen it so I can
drop safely I drop the

436
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,040
drop safely I drop the
 

437
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,910
drop safely I drop the
same I might fall all the way but I come

438
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:50,920
same I might fall all the way but I come
 

439
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,430
same I might fall all the way but I come
up eventually and then I do it this

440
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
up eventually and then I do it this
 

441
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,710
up eventually and then I do it this
way so my whole body all my cord

442
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
way so my whole body all my cord
 

443
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,069
way so my whole body all my cord
everything plus my body

444
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:03,079
everything plus my body
 

445
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:06,550
everything plus my body
weight and the arm's going to go okay so

446
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:06,560
weight and the arm's going to go okay so
 

447
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,069
weight and the arm's going to go okay so
do it

448
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:11,079

 

449
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:14,430

again here this way and you just same

450
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:14,440
again here this way and you just same
 

451
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,590
again here this way and you just same
fall same Su I'm going to loosen it for

452
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,600
fall same Su I'm going to loosen it for
 

453
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,350
fall same Su I'm going to loosen it for
safety I might go all the way but then

454
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:20,360
safety I might go all the way but then
 

455
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:27,150
safety I might go all the way but then
you come back up and then you do

456
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,160

 

457
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,269

it please do it in two stages like that

458
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:30,279
it please do it in two stages like that
 

459
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,150
it please do it in two stages like that
cuz I don't want you in the in the

460
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
cuz I don't want you in the in the
 

461
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,230
cuz I don't want you in the in the
street you you don't fall the

462
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:35,240
street you you don't fall the
 

463
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,310
street you you don't fall the
arm relieves the structural integrity

464
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:39,320
arm relieves the structural integrity
 

465
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,189
arm relieves the structural integrity
and that's why you fall but in training

466
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:42,199
and that's why you fall but in training
 

467
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:44,509
and that's why you fall but in training
leave it Loose go

468
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:44,519
leave it Loose go
 

469
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,230
leave it Loose go
down come back up and reset it without

470
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
down come back up and reset it without
 

471
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,959
down come back up and reset it without
the inertia falling okay
