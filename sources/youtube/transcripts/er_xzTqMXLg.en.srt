the circle they're not they're not going
 

189
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,130
the circle they're not they're not going
to be even that would be a circle okay

190
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:30,140
to be even that would be a circle okay
 

191
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,790
to be even that would be a circle okay
so uh maybe I need a hand or two

192
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
so uh maybe I need a hand or two
 

193
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,290
so uh maybe I need a hand or two
okay uh here we are like this his test

194
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:39,300
okay uh here we are like this his test
 

195
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,810
okay uh here we are like this his test
and I'll tell you what to do his hand is

196
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:41,820
and I'll tell you what to do his hand is
 

197
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,550
and I'll tell you what to do his hand is
going to come around his head is going

198
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:43,560
going to come around his head is going
 

199
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,670
going to come around his head is going
to come around like that do you see that

200
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:46,680
to come around like that do you see that
 

201
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,250
to come around like that do you see that
I'm not going to try to make his upper

202
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:49,260
I'm not going to try to make his upper
 

203
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,210
I'm not going to try to make his upper
body

204
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:50,220
body
 

205
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,190
body
go that way

206
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200

 

207
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,750

so

208
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:56,760
so
 

209
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,470
so
you come here and you make this

210
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
you come here and you make this
 

211
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,509
you come here and you make this
very slowly you're going to just control

212
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:02,519
very slowly you're going to just control
 

213
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,490
very slowly you're going to just control
this thing get off the sit

214
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:04,500
this thing get off the sit
 

215
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,530
this thing get off the sit
this is the energy of my pattern and my

216
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:09,540
this is the energy of my pattern and my
 

217
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,930
this is the energy of my pattern and my
head control

218
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:14,940

 

219
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,090

here it is

220
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:17,100
here it is
 

221
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,329
here it is
the Coq projection do you see that

222
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:20,339
the Coq projection do you see that
 

223
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,670
the Coq projection do you see that
I don't want his leg to go into

224
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:22,680
I don't want his leg to go into
 

225
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,470
I don't want his leg to go into
somersault

226
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
somersault
 

227
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,570
somersault
so I'm not going to make his hand go

228
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:26,580
so I'm not going to make his hand go
 

229
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,310
so I'm not going to make his hand go
that way

230
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
that way
 

231
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,350
that way
I want his hip

232
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:30,360
I want his hip
 

233
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,670
I want his hip
to go that way that way okay

234
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:34,680
to go that way that way okay
 

235
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,509
to go that way that way okay
so just ever so slowly

236
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:38,519
so just ever so slowly
 

237
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,210
so just ever so slowly
bring that head around and out ever so

238
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:41,220
bring that head around and out ever so
 

239
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,910
bring that head around and out ever so
slowly

240
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920

 

241
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,610

but here we're not in contact with the

242
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:46,620
but here we're not in contact with the
 

243
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,730
but here we're not in contact with the
hip directly but that's the vector we're

244
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:49,740
hip directly but that's the vector we're
 

245
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,490
hip directly but that's the vector we're
in contact with the hand you see that so

246
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:52,500
in contact with the hand you see that so
 

247
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,430
in contact with the hand you see that so
I'm not going to push this way so he

248
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
I'm not going to push this way so he
 

249
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,889
I'm not going to push this way so he
does a somersault I'm not trying to

00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:57,899
does a somersault I'm not trying to
 

251
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,410
does a somersault I'm not trying to
follow the head I'm trying to project

252
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:00,420
follow the head I'm trying to project
 

253
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,730
follow the head I'm trying to project
into the hip okay got it so he's going

254
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:04,740
into the hip okay got it so he's going
 

255

275
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,550

and this head is going this way with the

276
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:37,560
and this head is going this way with the
 

277
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,790
and this head is going this way with the
body you see

278
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800

 

279
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,150

but this arm is not going to take that

280
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
but this arm is not going to take that
 

281
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,590
but this arm is not going to take that
easy path

282
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
easy path
 

283
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,930
easy path
this way

284
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:50,940

 

285
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,769

it's gonna project that way got it so

286
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:54,779
it's gonna project that way got it so
 

287
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,530
it's gonna project that way got it so
here I'll leave that head off I'm not

288
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:57,540
here I'll leave that head off I'm not
 

289

turning
 

291
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,610
turning
this is where the arm goes

292
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:04,620

 

293
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:11,449

combine those

294
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:11,459

 

295
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:15,829

see that okay don't bring them

296
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
see that okay don't bring them
 

297
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,069
see that okay don't bring them
on the same curve

00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:19,079
on the same curve
 

299
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,470
on the same curve
now okay

300
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:21,480
now okay
 

301
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,110
now okay
all right let's try watch for that now

302
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,120
all right let's try watch for that now
 

303
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,090
all right let's try watch for that now
watch for that different vectors

304
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,100
