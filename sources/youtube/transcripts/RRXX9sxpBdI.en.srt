perfect range to hit me so um he's got a
 

91
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,950
perfect range to hit me so um he's got a
little bit of an advantage in this

come back and get him this way okay
 

159
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,190
come back and get him this way okay
let's switch sides here and we'll talk

160
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
let's switch sides here and we'll talk
 

161
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,910
let's switch sides here and we'll talk
about the rest of it okay so what's

162
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
about the rest of it okay so what's
 

163
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,630
about the rest of it okay so what's
happening here is we're at a close

164
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:55,640
happening here is we're at a close
 

165
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,710
happening here is we're at a close
position and Josh is in a more favorable

166
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:57,720
position and Josh is in a more favorable
 

167
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,030
position and Josh is in a more favorable
position than I am so my first thought

168
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,040
position than I am so my first thought
 

169
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,149
position than I am so my first thought
is I got to get out of this distance and

170
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
is I got to get out of this distance and
 

171
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,750
is I got to get out of this distance and
I'm going to back up right so I want to

172
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
I'm going to back up right so I want to
 

173
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,030
I'm going to back up right so I want to
make distance for myself now when Josh

174
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,040
make distance for myself now when Josh
 

175
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,509
make distance for myself now when Josh
sees me make distance for himself he

176
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
sees me make distance for himself he
 

177
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,990
sees me make distance for himself he
does what we do in a lot of the forms

178
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,000
does what we do in a lot of the forms
 

179
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,430
does what we do in a lot of the forms
which is transition J hu bang right so

180
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
which is transition J hu bang right so
 

181
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,430
which is transition J hu bang right so
now he's set up for that okay and he

182
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
now he's set up for that okay and he
 

183
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,149
now he's set up for that okay and he
manages to do that faster than I can get

184
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
manages to do that faster than I can get
 

185
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,869
manages to do that faster than I can get
my weapon around the way I want it right

186
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:17,879
my weapon around the way I want it right
 

187
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,190
my weapon around the way I want it right
so I'm not going to be in the ideal

188
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
so I'm not going to be in the ideal
 

189
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,470
so I'm not going to be in the ideal
position yet so I'm about here and right

190
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:21,480
position yet so I'm about here and right
 

191
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,910
position yet so I'm about here and right
when he comes in oh I'm in a bad way now

192
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
when he comes in oh I'm in a bad way now
 

193
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,949
when he comes in oh I'm in a bad way now
if I had got it over faster I could just

194
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:25,959
if I had got it over faster I could just
 

195
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:28,509
if I had got it over faster I could just
go into first form right so understand

196
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:28,519
go into first form right so understand
 

197
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,550
go into first form right so understand
that if we're here and I got over faster

198
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
that if we're here and I got over faster
 

199
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,229
that if we're here and I got over faster
I could go here right into first form

200
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
I could go here right into first form
 

201
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,550
I could go here right into first form
okay but I'm kind of in the interim here

202
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
okay but I'm kind of in the interim here
 

203
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,070
okay but I'm kind of in the interim here
and he comes in again so I use the

Advantage by crowding him so here when I

214
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:46,760
Advantage by crowding him so here when I
 

215
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,030
Advantage by crowding him so here when I
push it away I'm coming in at this guy

216
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
push it away I'm coming in at this guy
 

217
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,750
push it away I'm coming in at this guy
right and then as I do that I'm scared

218
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:50,760
right and then as I do that I'm scared
 

219
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,910
right and then as I do that I'm scared
he's going to hit me right so if he

220
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
he's going to hit me right so if he
 

221
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,270
he's going to hit me right so if he
comes and makes a little bit of room he

222
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
comes and makes a little bit of room he
 

223
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,190
comes and makes a little bit of room he
could hit he can hit high or low right

224
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
could hit he can hit high or low right
 

225
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,470
could hit he can hit high or low right
and he can do all kinds of stuff so what

226
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
and he can do all kinds of stuff so what
 

227
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,149
and he can do all kinds of stuff so what
I'm going to do is right after I do that

228
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
I'm going to do is right after I do that
 

229
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,869
I'm going to do is right after I do that
I'm going to track him down I take a P

230
00:03:59,869 --> 00:03:59,879
I'm going to track him down I take a P
 

231
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,990
I'm going to track him down I take a P
That Elbow right and that gives me

232
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,000
That Elbow right and that gives me
 

233
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,509
That Elbow right and that gives me
control so now it's hard for him to hit

234
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:02,519
control so now it's hard for him to hit
 

235
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,910
control so now it's hard for him to hit
me now as he continues through I come

236
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:04,920
me now as he continues through I come
 

237
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,149
me now as he continues through I come
down I catch his neck I apply pressure

238
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:07,159
down I catch his neck I apply pressure
 

239
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,030
down I catch his neck I apply pressure
from the back in here and that squeezes

240
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
from the back in here and that squeezes
 

241
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,429
from the back in here and that squeezes
his neck and then I can drive him back

242
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:10,439
his neck and then I can drive him back
 

243
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,429
his neck and then I can drive him back
for a CAG right so I get a choke and a

244
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:12,439
for a CAG right so I get a choke and a
 

245
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,990
for a CAG right so I get a choke and a
CAG but what we're seeing in this form

246
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,000
CAG but what we're seeing in this form
 

247
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,270
CAG but what we're seeing in this form
is a lot of changing in distance and how

248
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
is a lot of changing in distance and how
 

249
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,870
is a lot of changing in distance and how
we change our ideals right so this is

250
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
we change our ideals right so this is
 

251
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,710
we change our ideals right so this is
teaching us how to transition short to

252
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
teaching us how to transition short to
 

253
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,189
teaching us how to transition short to
long and long to short right so Josh uh

254
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
long and long to short right so Josh uh
 

255
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,270
long and long to short right so Josh uh
and and we've been working with this a

256
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,280
and and we've been working with this a
 

257
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,150
and and we've been working with this a
lot in the forms is understanding the

258
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
lot in the forms is understanding the
 

259
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,990
lot in the forms is understanding the
same concept that if I get really far

260
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
same concept that if I get really far
 

261
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,629
same concept that if I get really far
back he should transition into a long

262
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:29,639
back he should transition into a long
 

263
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,430
back he should transition into a long
long attack stance okay I seeing that

264
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
long attack stance okay I seeing that
 

265
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,749
long attack stance okay I seeing that
and getting caught underwear decide to

266
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:34,759
and getting caught underwear decide to
 

267
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,790
and getting caught underwear decide to
start transitioning into a closer stance

268
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
start transitioning into a closer stance
 

269
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,749
start transitioning into a closer stance
right so wall we're in the middle of all

270
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:38,759
right so wall we're in the middle of all
 

271
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,909
right so wall we're in the middle of all
that I go here and boom okay and now as

272
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:40,919
that I go here and boom okay and now as
 

273
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,029
that I go here and boom okay and now as
he comes around one more time in the

274
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:42,039
he comes around one more time in the
 

275
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:43,790
he comes around one more time in the
long stance still I crowd him even more

276
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:43,800
long stance still I crowd him even more
 

277
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,830
long stance still I crowd him even more
right and this is eliminating a lot of

278
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
right and this is eliminating a lot of
 

279
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,110
right and this is eliminating a lot of
the advantage he has with the weapon in

280
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
the advantage he has with the weapon in
 

281
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,110
the advantage he has with the weapon in
that position I come back here boom I

282
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
that position I come back here boom I
 

283
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,390
that position I come back here boom I
choke and I drop off this is my third

284
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,400
choke and I drop off this is my third
 

285
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,189
choke and I drop off this is my third
form if you take one two and three they

286
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:54,199
form if you take one two and three they
 

287
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,990
form if you take one two and three they
all play really really nicely together I

288
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
all play really really nicely together I
 

289
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,310
all play really really nicely together I
can show you how they all link up and in

290
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:57,320
can show you how they all link up and in
 

291
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,629
can show you how they all link up and in
fact in the next set of videos I will

292
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
fact in the next set of videos I will
 

293
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,590
fact in the next set of videos I will
show you how they all link up up um but

294
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:00,600
show you how they all link up up um but
 

295
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,590
show you how they all link up up um but
these three are really really valuable

296
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:02,600
these three are really really valuable
 

297
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,510
these three are really really valuable
this is from cyto sensei's 8 n and 10 so

I think what he tacked on the end is a
 

301
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,430
I think what he tacked on the end is a
real interesting set to tack onto the

302
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
real interesting set to tack onto the
 

303
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,150
real interesting set to tack onto the
beginning um for mine so um those that's

304
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,160
beginning um for mine so um those that's
 

305
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,110
