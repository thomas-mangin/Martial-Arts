00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,090
I am very pleased with the success of this 51st All Japan Aikido Demonstration.

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,780
Last year was the miletsone event of the 50th All Japan Aikido Demonstration.

3
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,000
This wonderful art created by Aikido founder,

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,310
and transmitted by the 2nd Doshu Kisshomaru and the pioneers of the art,

5
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,230
has evolved and thanks to you, thanks to all Aikidoka,

6
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:39,570
it now forms circle larger than ever.

7
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,910
This year, it is with a new momentum,

8
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:52,020
aand a renewed passion, that you have come to practice, honoring the circle.

9
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,490
With respect to its history and evolution,

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,040
we have a duty to transmit Aikido, and continue to expand this circle.

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,210
I will now offer a demonstration to close the event.
