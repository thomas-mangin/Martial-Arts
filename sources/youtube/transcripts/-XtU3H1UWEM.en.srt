so we doing EVP nuggets and we're
 

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:14,120
so we doing EVP nuggets and we're
getting rid of and now I remember that

00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,130
getting rid of and now I remember that

upper-level so solar plexus ah so this

16
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:40,440
upper-level so solar plexus ah so this
 

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,799
upper-level so solar plexus ah so this
would be a straight punch it could be a

18
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:45,809
would be a straight punch it could be a
 

19
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,830

26
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:03,570
get it out it's not possible and then
 

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,810

you're gonna do this one but this is

you're gonna do this one but this is
 

29
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,679
you're gonna do this one but this is

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,340
on him but if I stay in this perfect
thing there's enough friction of his key

330
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:10,350
thing there's enough friction of his key
 

331
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,140
thing there's enough friction of his key
for me to for me the two things I don't

332
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,150
for me to for me the two things I don't
 

333
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,420
for me to for me the two things I don't
need to have superpowers I just need

334
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:17,430
need to have superpowers I just need
 

335
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,130
need to have superpowers I just need
that extra quarter inch

336
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:19,140
that extra quarter inch
 

337
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,740
that extra quarter inch
after finishing you see so you can't

338
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:21,750
after finishing you see so you can't
 

339
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,090
after finishing you see so you can't
push into him past that and I need that

340
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,100
push into him past that and I need that
 

341
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,060
push into him past that and I need that
relaxation so he absorbs into me

342
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,070
relaxation so he absorbs into me
 

343
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,410
relaxation so he absorbs into me
okay but I can't have it be where I'm

344
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:33,420
okay but I can't have it be where I'm
 

345
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,920
okay but I can't have it be where I'm
here like this and you're like relax you

346
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:36,930
here like this and you're like relax you
 

347
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:42,340
here like this and you're like relax you
see there's no structural integrity here

348
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:42,350

 

349
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:47,450

so internally I am relaxing but right

350
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:47,460
so internally I am relaxing but right
 

351
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,750
so internally I am relaxing but right
here I have the same thing you see you

352
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:50,760
here I have the same thing you see you
 

353
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,450
here I have the same thing you see you
can push into him so when I move around

354
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:55,460
can push into him so when I move around
 

355
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,090
can push into him so when I move around
do you see how it's doing this so again

356
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,100
do you see how it's doing this so again
 

357
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,570
do you see how it's doing this so again
to say thing if I extend it it's fine if

358
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:02,580
to say thing if I extend it it's fine if
 

359
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,860
to say thing if I extend it it's fine if
I extend it off it is Center but I'm not

360
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:06,870
I extend it off it is Center but I'm not
 

361
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,440
I extend it off it is Center but I'm not
putting the extended I'm going to keep

362
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:09,450
putting the extended I'm going to keep
 

363
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:15,500
putting the extended I'm going to keep
the friction by turning so I load up

364
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:15,510
the friction by turning so I load up
 

365
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:20,320
the friction by turning so I load up
that arm and when I turn look what I see

366
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,330
that arm and when I turn look what I see
 

367
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,199
that arm and when I turn look what I see
you see

368
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:24,209

 

369
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:28,620

so just like the plot said you're not

370
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:28,630
so just like the plot said you're not
 

371
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:34,639
so just like the plot said you're not
relying on that turning of his arm

372
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:34,649
relying on that turning of his arm
 

373
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:37,050
relying on that turning of his arm
because that would not protect the

374
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,060
because that would not protect the
 

375
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,300
because that would not protect the
integrity of the radius so you set up

376
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:41,310
integrity of the radius so you set up
 

377
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,639
integrity of the radius so you set up
the other arm you create the internal

378
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:44,649
the other arm you create the internal
 

379
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:48,509
the other arm you create the internal
and Eva and he's pushing on me he's

380
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:48,519
and Eva and he's pushing on me he's
 

381
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,629
and Eva and he's pushing on me he's
actually UCB for violence and it's when

382
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:51,639
actually UCB for violence and it's when
 

383
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,730
actually UCB for violence and it's when
I take it away

384
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:55,740

 

385
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,970

so again boom wall there it is right

386
00:16:59,970 --> 00:16:59,980
so again boom wall there it is right
 

387
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,540
so again boom wall there it is right
there

388
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:00,550
there
 

389
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,079
there
I move around it and he falls on much I

390
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,089
I move around it and he falls on much I
 

391
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,409
I move around it and he falls on much I
take it away so it's a mixture of them

392
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:07,419
take it away so it's a mixture of them
 

393
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:10,770
take it away so it's a mixture of them
falling on it and him having just enough

394
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:10,780
falling on it and him having just enough
 

395
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,000
falling on it and him having just enough
friction that I keep them in it okay

396
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,010
friction that I keep them in it okay
 

397
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,199
friction that I keep them in it okay
so what I see now is your into your

398
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:19,209
so what I see now is your into your
 

399
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:21,960
so what I see now is your into your

407
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:53,730

that's your side take the pressure out

408
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:53,740
that's your side take the pressure out

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:29,070
engage in game there you go
engage two more engaged go and then you

416
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,080
engage two more engaged go and then you
 

417
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,530
engage two more engaged go and then you
got to do the same thing you engage you

418

got to do the same thing you engage you
 

419
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:41,130
