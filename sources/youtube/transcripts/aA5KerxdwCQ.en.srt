shomonucci position actually let's go to
this side the shomonuchi position is a

110
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
this side the shomonuchi position is a
 

111
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,030

117
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,109
positions okay now that's super
utilitarian position because if this guy

118
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
utilitarian position because if this guy
 

119
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,710
utilitarian position because if this guy

125
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,949
bang like that okay and i did this we
are now in the shomanucci position this

126
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
are now in the shomanucci position this
 

127
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,110
are now in the shomanucci position this
is a super common thing to happen let's

128
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
is a super common thing to happen let's
 

129
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,350
is a super common thing to happen let's
say i need to use a knife on this guy

130
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360

132
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
when i come down and he defends we are
 

133
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,110
when i come down and he defends we are
in the shomonuchi position so the

134
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
in the shomonuchi position so the
 

135
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,510
in the shomonuchi position so the
shomonucci position is a position seen a

136
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
shomonucci position is a position seen a
 

137
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,350
shomonucci position is a position seen a
lot nike though because when you have a

138
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
lot nike though because when you have a
 

139
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,630
lot nike though because when you have a
small thing in your hand that you're

140
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
small thing in your hand that you're
 

141
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,229
small thing in your hand that you're
coming down at them with right and that

142
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
coming down at them with right and that
 

143
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,229
coming down at them with right and that
of course could be anything but a knife

144
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
of course could be anything but a knife
 

145
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,869
of course could be anything but a knife
is is is like the ultimate small thing

146
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
is is is like the ultimate small thing
 

147
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,030
is is is like the ultimate small thing
right so it's it's better than a rock or

148
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
right so it's it's better than a rock or
 

149
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,670
right so it's it's better than a rock or
a little stick because it does more work

150
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
a little stick because it does more work
 

151
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,070
a little stick because it does more work
than those things so the ultimate small

152
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
than those things so the ultimate small
 

153
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,070
than those things so the ultimate small
object is definitely dealt with in that

154
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
object is definitely dealt with in that
 

155
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,509
object is definitely dealt with in that
shomanucci fashion okay now what about

156
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:46,519
shomanucci fashion okay now what about
 

157
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:48,630
shomanucci fashion okay now what about
yokomanuchi now when we see it unarmed

158
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
yokomanuchi now when we see it unarmed
 

159
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,949
yokomanuchi now when we see it unarmed
of course this looks kind of dumb to us

160
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
of course this looks kind of dumb to us
 

161
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,550
of course this looks kind of dumb to us
but when you realize if i'm going like

162
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
but when you realize if i'm going like
 

163
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,150
but when you realize if i'm going like
this and cutting that carotid that's all

164
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
this and cutting that carotid that's all
 

165
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,150
this and cutting that carotid that's all
of a sudden a very sensible technique

166
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
of a sudden a very sensible technique
 

167
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,309
of a sudden a very sensible technique
right so when he comes in with that what

168
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
right so when he comes in with that what
 

169
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,949
right so when he comes in with that what
do i do i do this which really is just

170
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
do i do i do this which really is just
 

171
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,830
do i do i do this which really is just
an inside variation of this so if he's

172
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
an inside variation of this so if he's
 

173
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,990
an inside variation of this so if he's
coming outside like that we look like

174
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
coming outside like that we look like
 

175
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,470
coming outside like that we look like
this if he's coming inside we look like

176
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
this if he's coming inside we look like
 

177
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,309
this if he's coming inside we look like
this so look at these positions right

178
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
this so look at these positions right
 

179
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,550
this so look at these positions right
this is also why we don't formally talk

180
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
this is also why we don't formally talk
 

181
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,509
this is also why we don't formally talk
about yaku yokomin so regular yokemen's

182
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
about yaku yokomin so regular yokemen's
 

183
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,550
about yaku yokomin so regular yokemen's
this boom gyaku yokemen's this but gyaku

184
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
this boom gyaku yokemen's this but gyaku
 

185
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,030
this boom gyaku yokemen's this but gyaku
yokemen when i defend that is a showman

186
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
yokemen when i defend that is a showman
 

187
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,390
yokemen when i defend that is a showman
position

188
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
position
 

189
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,470
position
versus if it's a regular yokelman it's a

190
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
versus if it's a regular yokelman it's a
 

191
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,990
versus if it's a regular yokelman it's a
new position it's a slightly different

192
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
new position it's a slightly different
 

193
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,990
new position it's a slightly different
position we see from this right so this

194
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
position we see from this right so this
 

195
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,149
position we see from this right so this
is again a weapon technique all right

196
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
is again a weapon technique all right
 

197
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,110
is again a weapon technique all right
now what about ski so ski it's okay ski

198
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
now what about ski so ski it's okay ski
 

199
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,430
now what about ski so ski it's okay ski
is a big dumb punch right so so who

200
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
is a big dumb punch right so so who
 

201
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,589
is a big dumb punch right so so who
punches like that no one but understand

202
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
punches like that no one but understand
 

203
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,670
punches like that no one but understand
in the aikido syllabus i'm always trying

204
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
in the aikido syllabus i'm always trying
 

205
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,190
in the aikido syllabus i'm always trying
to switch the other hand for me i'm

206
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
to switch the other hand for me i'm
 

207
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,430
to switch the other hand for me i'm
always trying to stay away from this guy

208
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
always trying to stay away from this guy
 

209
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,110
always trying to stay away from this guy
and so ideally he's getting super

210
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
and so ideally he's getting super
 

211
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,350
and so ideally he's getting super
frustrated and he'll lunge in and that

212
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
frustrated and he'll lunge in and that
 

213
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,509
frustrated and he'll lunge in and that
lunge in is what sets up all of those

214
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
lunge in is what sets up all of those
 

215
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,430
lunge in is what sets up all of those
kinds of techniques from ski so our

216
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
kinds of techniques from ski so our
 

217
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,750
kinds of techniques from ski so our
three strikes are weapon strikes they're

218
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
three strikes are weapon strikes they're
 

219
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,949
three strikes are weapon strikes they're
tonto strikes small arms strikes showman

220
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
tonto strikes small arms strikes showman
 

221
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,030
tonto strikes small arms strikes showman
yokomin and ski and that's why we have

222
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
yokomin and ski and that's why we have
 

223
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,110
yokomin and ski and that's why we have
that set up for techniques okay now

224
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
that set up for techniques okay now
 

225
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,470
that set up for techniques okay now
let's look at all the wrist grabbing

226
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
let's look at all the wrist grabbing
 

227
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,949
let's look at all the wrist grabbing
stuff right so if uh actually yeah we'll

228
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
stuff right so if uh actually yeah we'll
 

229
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,350
stuff right so if uh actually yeah we'll
have him so josh is gonna be uh the nage

230
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
have him so josh is gonna be uh the nage
 

231
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,630
have him so josh is gonna be uh the nage
so in this if i grab this guy like this

232
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
so in this if i grab this guy like this
 

233
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,229
so in this if i grab this guy like this
because he's gonna stab me there's our

234
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
because he's gonna stab me there's our
 

235
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,470
because he's gonna stab me there's our
katate dory if he switched and i

236
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
katate dory if he switched and i
 

237
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,870
katate dory if he switched and i
switched there's our yakute dory if i

238
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
switched there's our yakute dory if i
 

239
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,469
switched there's our yakute dory if i
tried to take advantage of this and go

240
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
tried to take advantage of this and go
 

241
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,629
tried to take advantage of this and go
two on one there's our morote door if he

242
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
two on one there's our morote door if he
 

243
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,230
two on one there's our morote door if he
switched again i go over and i don't

244
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
switched again i go over and i don't
 

245
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,510
switched again i go over and i don't
want him to keep switching there's a

246
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
want him to keep switching there's a
 

247
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,629
want him to keep switching there's a
ryote door and you can see the

248
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
ryote door and you can see the
 

249
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,390
ryote door and you can see the
progression and i've made videos on this

250
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
progression and i've made videos on this
 

251
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,469
progression and i've made videos on this
before so i want you to see that those

252
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
before so i want you to see that those
 

253
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,550
before so i want you to see that those
attacks all exist because there's a

254
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
attacks all exist because there's a
 

255
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,510
attacks all exist because there's a
small arm in play so all of the aikido

256
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
small arm in play so all of the aikido
 

257
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,070
small arm in play so all of the aikido
attacks come from small arms now what

258
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
attacks come from small arms now what
 

259
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,550
attacks come from small arms now what
about the actual techniques themselves

260
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
about the actual techniques themselves
 

261
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,990
about the actual techniques themselves
right so let's get into a technique

262
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
right so let's get into a technique
 

263
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,270
right so let's get into a technique
let's look at the technique for

264
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
let's look at the technique for
 

265
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,270
let's look at the technique for
shomonucci ikiyo

266
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
shomonucci ikiyo
 

267
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,749
shomonucci ikiyo
tewaza all right now if this guy's got

268
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
tewaza all right now if this guy's got
 

269
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,909
tewaza all right now if this guy's got
the knife and he comes in here what do i

270
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
the knife and he comes in here what do i
 

271
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,670
the knife and he comes in here what do i
want to do well i would like to get this

272
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
want to do well i would like to get this
 

273
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,670
want to do well i would like to get this
guy away if i have a superior weapon so

274
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
guy away if i have a superior weapon so
 

275
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,670
guy away if i have a superior weapon so
if i bump him here and can draw my

276
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
if i bump him here and can draw my
 

277
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,909
if i bump him here and can draw my
weapon there we see how the technique of

278
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
weapon there we see how the technique of
 

279
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,189
weapon there we see how the technique of
ikyo multi is immediately used for this

280
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
ikyo multi is immediately used for this
 

281
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,350
ikyo multi is immediately used for this
knife what about ikyoura we come in and

282
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
knife what about ikyoura we come in and
 

283
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,270
knife what about ikyoura we come in and
i try to bump him and he's too strong so

284
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
i try to bump him and he's too strong so
 

285
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,350
i try to bump him and he's too strong so
i go behind him in order to draw my

286
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
i go behind him in order to draw my
 

287
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,590
i go behind him in order to draw my
weapon and use my weapon so there again

288
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
weapon and use my weapon so there again
 

289
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,830
weapon and use my weapon so there again
we're seeing small arms used there are

290
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
we're seeing small arms used there are
 

291
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,350
we're seeing small arms used there are
two of the classic techniques we see in

292
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
two of the classic techniques we see in
 

293
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,390
two of the classic techniques we see in
aikido that come from that okay now what
