1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,829

we we have many videos on the

2
00:00:03,829 --> 00:00:03,839
we we have many videos on the
 

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,230
we we have many videos on the
end uh but still it eludes us okay his

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
end uh but still it eludes us okay his
 

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,190
end uh but still it eludes us okay his
elbow has to be on the front side of my

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
elbow has to be on the front side of my
 

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,390
elbow has to be on the front side of my
spine so here's my spine line okay his

8
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
spine so here's my spine line okay his
 

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,070
spine so here's my spine line okay his
elbow can't be on

10
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,080
elbow can't be on
 

11
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,349
elbow can't be on
the spine definitely not on the other

12
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:20,359
the spine definitely not on the other
 

13
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,630
the spine definitely not on the other
side you won't have the

14
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
side you won't have the
 

15
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,189
side you won't have the
engine capable of dealing with the

16
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
engine capable of dealing with the
 

17
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,470
engine capable of dealing with the
pin his elbows on the front side

18
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:31,480
pin his elbows on the front side
 

19
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,709
pin his elbows on the front side
and then the pin is not in my waist cuz

20
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:33,719
and then the pin is not in my waist cuz
 

21
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,590
and then the pin is not in my waist cuz
nothing's in my waist it's not in my

22
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
nothing's in my waist it's not in my
 

23
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,910
nothing's in my waist it's not in my
arms because nothing should be in my

24
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
arms because nothing should be in my
 

25
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,549
arms because nothing should be in my
arms so I'll do my

26
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:41,559
arms so I'll do my
 

27
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:46,630
arms so I'll do my
qua and then I'll turn my tonden forward

28
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
qua and then I'll turn my tonden forward
 

29
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,389
qua and then I'll turn my tonden forward
down because it's K hole here which is

30
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:49,399
down because it's K hole here which is
 

31
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,069
down because it's K hole here which is
what it is it's K hole it's not a pin

32
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:53,079
what it is it's K hole it's not a pin
 

33
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,229
what it is it's K hole it's not a pin
because here in

34
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:55,239
because here in
 

35
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:57,430
because here in
modern this is nothing more than the

36
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
modern this is nothing more than the
 

37
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,630
modern this is nothing more than the
Kimura and nothing stopping

38
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640
Kimura and nothing stopping
 

39
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,590
Kimura and nothing stopping
the forward

40
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:02,600
the forward
 

41
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,429
the forward
roll

42
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:06,439

 

43
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,830

okay so for

44
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:08,840
okay so for
 

45
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,550
okay so for
example if I was doing the omop Plata

46
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
example if I was doing the omop Plata
 

47
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,070
example if I was doing the omop Plata
which is the same thing I got to stop

48
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,080
which is the same thing I got to stop
 

49
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:21,109
which is the same thing I got to stop
that ability to roll then I get the

50
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119

 

51
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,870

LW this is koku

52
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:23,880
LW this is koku
 

53
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,190
LW this is koku
hul this is where I turn the

54
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
hul this is where I turn the
 

55
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,510
hul this is where I turn the
tonden into this forward cycle

56
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:32,520

 

57
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,990

down okay so I turn the quaw and then I

58
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,000
down okay so I turn the quaw and then I
 

59
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,789
down okay so I turn the quaw and then I
drop

60
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
drop
 

61
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,270
drop
it got it that's what I'm doing it's

62
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:44,280

 

63
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,789

cul because it's

64
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
cul because it's
 

65
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,469
cul because it's
concentric the the art is

66
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:49,479
concentric the the art is
 

67
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,870
concentric the the art is
concentric it is how to do a lock on the

68
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
concentric it is how to do a lock on the
 

69
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,109
concentric it is how to do a lock on the
shoulder mechanism so what I'm doing

70
00:01:58,109 --> 00:01:58,119
shoulder mechanism so what I'm doing
 

71
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,749
shoulder mechanism so what I'm doing
here is not an elbow

72
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
here is not an elbow
 

73
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,590
here is not an elbow
elbow but I'm going to take this scapula

74
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
elbow but I'm going to take this scapula
 

75
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,589
elbow but I'm going to take this scapula
mechanism move it

76
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:07,599
mechanism move it
 

77
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,150
mechanism move it
forward and

78
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,160

 

79
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,229

down okay so if I'm if I'm here like

80
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:15,239
down okay so if I'm if I'm here like
 

81
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,790
down okay so if I'm if I'm here like
this and I'm moving it forward and down

82
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:17,800
this and I'm moving it forward and down
 

83
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,910
this and I'm moving it forward and down
and I get another lock

84
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
and I get another lock
 

85
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,350
and I get another lock
going then I'll have a pin try to roll I

86
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:24,360
going then I'll have a pin try to roll I
 

87
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,830
going then I'll have a pin try to roll I
can't

88
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840

 

89
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,589

okay so I am doing a shoulder lock is

90
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
okay so I am doing a shoulder lock is
 

91
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,790
okay so I am doing a shoulder lock is
just this is not a pin like you use a

92
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
just this is not a pin like you use a
 

93
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,509
just this is not a pin like you use a
shoulder lock and use cou hole

94
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:42,519

 

95
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,390

okay so get it in the right place let's

96
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
okay so get it in the right place let's
 

97
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,630
okay so get it in the right place let's
turn this

98
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
turn this
 

99
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,270
turn this
way to free your

100
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,280

 

101
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,830

mind because it's not a

102
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
mind because it's not a
 

103
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,430
mind because it's not a
pin and it's K hole

104
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:00,440
pin and it's K hole
 

105
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,309
pin and it's K hole
I'm not going to turn my waist I'm not

106
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
I'm not going to turn my waist I'm not
 

107
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,350
I'm not going to turn my waist I'm not
going to use my

108
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:04,360
going to use my
 

109
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,789
going to use my
arms I understand what I'm trying to do

110

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
to the shoulder
 

113
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,710
to the shoulder
mechanism only this knee is

114
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:11,720
mechanism only this knee is
 

115
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,190
mechanism only this knee is
important this knee is not

116
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
important this knee is not
 

117
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,110
important this knee is not
important meaning it does not have to

118
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
important meaning it does not have to
 

119
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,630
important meaning it does not have to
be pinching his

120
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:21,640
be pinching his
 

121
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,949

127
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,710
am the elbows on my center line or even
over I have my magic hands and I'm

128
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
over I have my magic hands and I'm
 

129
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,309

does it does not need the other knee for
is it stops him going for

138
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519

 

139
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,350

forward so that KNE is there elbows in

140
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
forward so that KNE is there elbows in
 

141
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,910
forward so that KNE is there elbows in
front turn the qua and then rotate the

142
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:12,920
front turn the qua and then rotate the
 

143
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,830
front turn the qua and then rotate the
tanden

144
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:16,840

 

145
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,629

forward and you'll get the pin okay all

146
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:21,639
forward and you'll get the pin okay all
 

147
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,030
forward and you'll get the pin okay all
right let's try

148
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,040
right let's try
 

149
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,390
right let's try
it so the whole time you're training you

150
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:27,400
it so the whole time you're training you
 

151
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,590
it so the whole time you're training you
have releasing they're they're just

152
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
have releasing they're they're just
 

153
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,029
have releasing they're they're just
releasing drills really but especially

154
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:32,039
releasing drills really but especially
 

155
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:38,390
releasing drills really but especially
on the UK side okay um so as as I go do

156
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
on the UK side okay um so as as I go do
 

157
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,550
on the UK side okay um so as as I go do
you see me

158
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:39,560
you see me
 

159
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,150
you see me
here okay I'm going to one stay there

160
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
here okay I'm going to one stay there
 

161
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,230
here okay I'm going to one stay there
once I press I felt my own tomen form

162
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,240
once I press I felt my own tomen form
 

163
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,909
once I press I felt my own tomen form
you see as the two y energies are

164
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
you see as the two y energies are
 

165
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,350
you see as the two y energies are
hitting each other so now I keep that

166
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:52,360
hitting each other so now I keep that
 

167
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,110
hitting each other so now I keep that
feeling in my

168
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:56,120

 

169
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,469

body and I don't lose it

170
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
body and I don't lose it
