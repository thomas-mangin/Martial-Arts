00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,630

yours are several of that fine yours

10
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:13,640
yours are several of that fine yours
 

11
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,630
yours are several of that fine yours
aren't

12
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
aren't
 

13
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,229
aren't
there um so let's again Define it I

14
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:19,239
there um so let's again Define it I
 

15
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,789
there um so let's again Define it I
think you were here maybe okay you have

16
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:22,799
think you were here maybe okay you have
 

17
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,110
think you were here maybe okay you have
the IM spiral and you have the outward

18
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,120
the IM spiral and you have the outward
 

19
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,229
the IM spiral and you have the outward
spiral and really if you were to Define

20
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:29,239
spiral and really if you were to Define
 

21
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,630
spiral and really if you were to Define
them struct

22
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:31,640
them struct
 

23
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,309
them struct
on the inward spiral the relationship

24
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
on the inward spiral the relationship
 

25
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,670
on the inward spiral the relationship
between the elbow and the wrist is what

26
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:36,680
between the elbow and the wrist is what
 

27
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,190
between the elbow and the wrist is what
you is what defines it so on the inward

28
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
you is what defines it so on the inward
 

29
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,830
you is what defines it so on the inward
spiral the wrist goes in and the elbow

30
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
spiral the wrist goes in and the elbow
 

31
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,750
spiral the wrist goes in and the elbow
goes out on the outward spiral is the

32
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
goes out on the outward spiral is the
 

33
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,509
goes out on the outward spiral is the
reverse the elbow goes in and the wrist

34
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:48,519
reverse the elbow goes in and the wrist
 

35
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,270
reverse the elbow goes in and the wrist
goes out okay it doesn't have to be that

36
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,280
goes out okay it doesn't have to be that
 

37
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,869
goes out okay it doesn't have to be that
this all the time okay doesn't have to

38
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
this all the time okay doesn't have to
 

39
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,710
this all the time okay doesn't have to
be that all the time so you want want

40
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
be that all the time so you want want
 

41
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,789
be that all the time so you want want
that the coiling energy which is

42
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:03,799
that the coiling energy which is
 

43
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,110
that the coiling energy which is
generated from the wrist and the elbow

44
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
generated from the wrist and the elbow
 

45
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,630
generated from the wrist and the elbow
rotating around themselves okay so I

46
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
rotating around themselves okay so I
 

47
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,030
rotating around themselves okay so I
don't want to have straight

48
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
don't want to have straight
 

49
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,229
don't want to have straight
arms like this you see so the wrist and

50
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
arms like this you see so the wrist and
 

51
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,469
arms like this you see so the wrist and
the elbow don't really

52
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:19,479
the elbow don't really
 

53
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:22,310
the elbow don't really
change relationship you see that they

54
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
change relationship you see that they
 

55
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,350
change relationship you see that they
stay in the alignment and they

56
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
stay in the alignment and they
 

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,710
stay in the alignment and they
go they stay in the

58
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:27,720
go they stay in the
 

59
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,990
go they stay in the
alignment okay uh here's the

60
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
alignment okay uh here's the
 

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,189
alignment okay uh here's the
outward the elbow came in again I'll do

62
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
outward the elbow came in again I'll do
 

63
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,950
outward the elbow came in again I'll do
it

64
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960

 

65
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,469

again and the inward the elbow goes out

66
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:43,479
again and the inward the elbow goes out
 

67
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,510
again and the inward the elbow goes out
the wrist comes in and it can be very

68
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
the wrist comes in and it can be very
 

69
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,870
the wrist comes in and it can be very
small just like you did it so it kind of

70
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:51,880
small just like you did it so it kind of
 

71
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,230
small just like you did it so it kind of
looks like the other

72
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,240

 

73
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,790

one but it's not

74
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:01,800

 

75
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:21,150

okay you have

76
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,160

 

77
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,510

to okay you have to do the shapes so

78
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:24,520
to okay you have to do the shapes so
 

79
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,629
to okay you have to do the shapes so
when whatever whatever it is so even if

80
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
when whatever whatever it is so even if
 

81
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,350
when whatever whatever it is so even if
you you see this like sometimes you'll

82
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
you you see this like sometimes you'll
 

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,189
you you see this like sometimes you'll
see me do that a lot but the elbow's

84
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:34,199
see me do that a lot but the elbow's
 

85
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,309
see me do that a lot but the elbow's
going to come in you see it came in just

86
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:37,319
going to come in you see it came in just
 

87
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,790
going to come in you see it came in just
ever so

88
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
ever so
 

89
00:05:38,800 --> 00:06:05,710
ever so
slightly ever so slightly

90
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:05,720

 

91
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,150

so it's coil it's coiling around itself

92
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,160
so it's coil it's coiling around itself
 

93
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,990
so it's coil it's coiling around itself
uh careful with

94
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,000
uh careful with
 

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,189
uh careful with
this here here here no they coil around

96
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
this here here here no they coil around
 

97
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,510
this here here here no they coil around
they coil around coil around coil around

98
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:20,520
they coil around coil around coil around
 

99
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,870
they coil around coil around coil around
coil around coil around so here not here

100
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
coil around coil around so here not here
 

101
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,469
coil around coil around so here not here
they didn't coil coil here you see

102
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:31,479

 

103
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,469

not

104
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
not
 

105
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,070
not
here right

106
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,080
here right
 

107
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,870
here right
here or

108
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:39,880
here or
 

109
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,990
here or
here okay

110
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,000

 

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,830

um so let's try to tr get the arm

112
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
um so let's try to tr get the arm
 

113
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,990
um so let's try to tr get the arm
patterns going okay and understand it

114
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
patterns going okay and understand it
 

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,520
patterns going okay and understand it
more accurately
