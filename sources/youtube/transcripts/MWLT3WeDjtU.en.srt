1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,830

okay so

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,840
okay so
 

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,470
okay so
uh the drill we started with is you can

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,480
uh the drill we started with is you can
 

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,829
uh the drill we started with is you can
move out of the way

6
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:07,839
move out of the way
 

7
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,790
move out of the way
uh

8
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:08,800
uh
 

9
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,629
uh
the drill you started with

10
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
the drill you started with
 

11
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:22,870
the drill you started with
is just this

12
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:22,880

 

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,830

okay

14
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
okay
 

15
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,750
okay
let's see kitty guys just change the

16
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
let's see kitty guys just change the
 

17
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,509
let's see kitty guys just change the
stances

18
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:29,519

 

19
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,389

but to go into more detail

20
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
but to go into more detail
 

21
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,590
but to go into more detail
is

22
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
is
 

23
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,470
is
just generally for slow training you

24
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
just generally for slow training you
 

25
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,310
just generally for slow training you
want to

26
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
want to
 

27
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,750
want to
not

28
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
not
 

29
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,830
not
push into them

30
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840

 

31
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,830

instead the

32
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
instead the
 

33
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,229
instead the
way you can imagine it is that there's a

34
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
way you can imagine it is that there's a
 

35
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,750
way you can imagine it is that there's a
hook

36
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
hook
 

37
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,630
hook
on the top crown of your head so not the

38
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
on the top crown of your head so not the
 

39
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,069
on the top crown of your head so not the
top of your head because that would

40
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
top of your head because that would
 

41
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:10,950
top of your head because that would
violate the chin position

42
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960

 

43
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,230

you get the

44
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
you get the
 

45
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,710
you get the
chin positioning the crown positioning

46
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
chin positioning the crown positioning
 

47
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,990
chin positioning the crown positioning
and then

48
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
and then
 

49
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,230
and then
everything hangs from that and you start

50
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
everything hangs from that and you start
 

51
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,550
everything hangs from that and you start
to sink into the mat okay

52
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
to sink into the mat okay
 

53
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,749
to sink into the mat okay
so this ability to relax and not press

54
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
so this ability to relax and not press
 

55
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,670
so this ability to relax and not press
into the

56
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
into the
 

57
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,109
into the
a precursor to not bracing

58
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
a precursor to not bracing
 

59
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,069
a precursor to not bracing
what you tend to do brace under the mat

60
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
what you tend to do brace under the mat
 

61
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,590
what you tend to do brace under the mat
as opposed to

62
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
as opposed to
 

63
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,910
as opposed to
letting their energy through you to the

64
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
letting their energy through you to the
 

65
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,469
letting their energy through you to the
mat letting it back through you out to

66
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
mat letting it back through you out to
 

67
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,630
mat letting it back through you out to
them if you were doing culture or

68
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
them if you were doing culture or
 

69
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,950
them if you were doing culture or
letting it in through you

70
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
letting it in through you
 

71
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,510
letting it in through you
coming back out and matching their level

72
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
coming back out and matching their level
 

73
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,749
coming back out and matching their level
of energy for the ik adhesion but in

74
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
of energy for the ik adhesion but in
 

75
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,109
of energy for the ik adhesion but in
either case

76
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
either case
 

77
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,990
either case
i'm very relaxed and

78
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
i'm very relaxed and
 

79
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,469
i'm very relaxed and
kind of hanging

80
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
kind of hanging
 

81
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,630
kind of hanging
and sinking into the mat from that as

82
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
and sinking into the mat from that as
 

83
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,270
and sinking into the mat from that as
opposed to push pushing on the mat which

84
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
opposed to push pushing on the mat which
 

85
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,350
opposed to push pushing on the mat which
will only happen

86
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
will only happen
 

87
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,149
will only happen
or has to happen with lower leg tension

88
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
or has to happen with lower leg tension
 

89
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,830
or has to happen with lower leg tension
now even if you

90
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840
now even if you
 

91
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,670
now even if you
tense your shoulders you might feel like

92
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
tense your shoulders you might feel like
 

93
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,350
tense your shoulders you might feel like
oh i'm really tense there but you're

94
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
oh i'm really tense there but you're
 

95
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,430
oh i'm really tense there but you're
tense in your lower legs too

96
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
tense in your lower legs too
 

97
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,630
tense in your lower legs too
okay

98
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
okay
 

99
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,110
okay
and you're pushing into the mat so you

100
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
and you're pushing into the mat so you
 

101
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,510
and you're pushing into the mat so you
can't do the internal aspects of the arm

102
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
can't do the internal aspects of the arm
 

103
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,750
can't do the internal aspects of the arm
so slow training or static training

104
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
so slow training or static training
 

105
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,949
so slow training or static training
should have this hanging relaxing

106
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959
should have this hanging relaxing
 

107
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,790
should have this hanging relaxing
feeling okay

108
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
feeling okay
 

109
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,150
feeling okay
so that you can get it

110
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160

 

111
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,949

you still have the kitty to do

112
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
you still have the kitty to do
 

113
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,790
you still have the kitty to do
all right so some things to pay

114
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
all right so some things to pay
 

115
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,730
all right so some things to pay
attention to

116
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:36,740
attention to
 

117
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,150
attention to
[Music]

118
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
[Music]
 

119
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,589
[Music]
as i move into this

120
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
as i move into this
 

121
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,830
as i move into this
stance

122
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
stance
 

123
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,030
stance
if my

124
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
if my
 

125
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,309
if my
foot goes wide into this kind of kama

126
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
foot goes wide into this kind of kama
 

127
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,190
foot goes wide into this kind of kama
head

128
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
head
 

129
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,670
head
the only way you did that is you pushed

130
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
the only way you did that is you pushed
 

131
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,430
the only way you did that is you pushed
with the left foot

132
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
with the left foot
 

133
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,309
with the left foot
so

134
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
so
 

135
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,470
so
if i had the hanging principle

136
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
if i had the hanging principle
 

137
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,350
if i had the hanging principle
that's about how deep i can be

138
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
that's about how deep i can be
 

139
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,830
that's about how deep i can be
and let that foot hang

140
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
and let that foot hang
 

141
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,149
and let that foot hang
in order to go past

142
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
in order to go past
 

143
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,550
in order to go past
further out from my hips

144
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
further out from my hips
 

145
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,270
further out from my hips
you had to push with that foot to do

146
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
you had to push with that foot to do
 

147
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,630
you had to push with that foot to do
that you see

148
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
that you see
 

149
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,830
that you see
and so now you're going to push again

150
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
and so now you're going to push again
 

151
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,750
and so now you're going to push again
turn push again

152
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
turn push again
 

153
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,430
turn push again
to get that distance

154
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
to get that distance
 

155
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,990
to get that distance
instead let it be a hanging drill

156
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
instead let it be a hanging drill
 

157
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,509
instead let it be a hanging drill

we already told you where to focus lower

166
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
we already told you where to focus lower
 

167
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,190
we already told you where to focus lower
legs pay attention to your lower legs

168
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
legs pay attention to your lower legs
 

169
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,229
legs pay attention to your lower legs
release the lower legs we gave you an

170
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
release the lower legs we gave you an
 

171
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,830
release the lower legs we gave you an
attention tool hanging

173
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,949

next thing

next thing
 

175
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,110
next thing
there is a rotation

176
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
there is a rotation
 

177
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,589
there is a rotation
this this rotation that you're doing

178
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
this this rotation that you're doing
 

179
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,710
this this rotation that you're doing
this imaginary point you

180
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,310
rotate somewhere back here
okay

694
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320
okay
 

695
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,710
okay
i want i want to immediately

696
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720
i want i want to immediately
 

697
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,350
i want i want to immediately
rotate off of that thing okay

698
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
rotate off of that thing okay
 

699
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,310
rotate off of that thing okay
so you could be straight to the front

700
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
so you could be straight to the front
 

701
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,230
so you could be straight to the front
he's pushing on me and i'm going to

702
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
he's pushing on me and i'm going to
 

703
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,829
he's pushing on me and i'm going to
rotate

704

rotate
 

705
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,230
rotate
here

706
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240

 

707
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,269

okay that's my that's my
 

709
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,389
okay that's my that's my
job

710
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
job
 

711
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,949
job
so watch it here

712
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959
so watch it here
 

713
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,550
so watch it here
whoa

714
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
whoa
 

715
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,550
whoa
whoa that's not it

716
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
whoa that's not it
 

717
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,590
whoa that's not it
okay you're here

718
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600

 

719
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,870

okay try it again

720
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
okay try it again
 

721
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,670
okay try it again
so it's it's it's deceptive just like

722
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
so it's it's it's deceptive just like
 

723
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,030
so it's it's it's deceptive just like
when you're trying to do the the kitty

724
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
when you're trying to do the the kitty
 

725
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,430
when you're trying to do the the kitty
it's deceptive it's deceptive on what

726
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
it's deceptive it's deceptive on what
 

727
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,829
it's deceptive it's deceptive on what
you're doing okay and this looks like

728
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
you're doing okay and this looks like
 

729
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,670
you're doing okay and this looks like
you're like

730
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
you're like
 

731
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,110
you're like
trying to do something like that so um

732
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
trying to do something like that so um
 

733
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,389
trying to do something like that so um
the

734
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
the
 

735
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,110
the
the problem of the of the pressure you

736
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
the problem of the of the pressure you
 

737
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,230
the problem of the of the pressure you
can see okay now he braced on the floor

738
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
can see okay now he braced on the floor
 

739
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,350
can see okay now he braced on the floor
you see and now once he the energy did

740
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
you see and now once he the energy did
 

741
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,150
you see and now once he the energy did
not go through him and now

742
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
not go through him and now
 

743
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,030
not go through him and now
he is uh

744
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
he is uh
 

745
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,710
he is uh
you're going to have the problem of the

746
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
you're going to have the problem of the
 

747
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,110
you're going to have the problem of the
of the bracing so i'm just holding this

748
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,120
of the bracing so i'm just holding this
 

749
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,430
of the bracing so i'm just holding this
this penetration point

750
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
this penetration point
 

751
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,350
this penetration point
and then he's going you can go kind of

752
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
and then he's going you can go kind of
 

753
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,670
and then he's going you can go kind of
slow and you see that it's as he starts

754
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
slow and you see that it's as he starts
 

755
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,870
slow and you see that it's as he starts
to move out of the brace it compromises

756
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880
to move out of the brace it compromises
 

757
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,110
to move out of the brace it compromises
balance do you see that

758
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
balance do you see that
 

759
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,230
balance do you see that
so that was him trying to

760
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,240
so that was him trying to
 

761
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,550
so that was him trying to
push in

762
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
push in
 

763
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,629
push in
maintain the brace but move and you

764
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
maintain the brace but move and you
 

765
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,350
maintain the brace but move and you
can't you cannot do that which is why

766
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
can't you cannot do that which is why
 

767
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,870
can't you cannot do that which is why
you often see

768
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
you often see
 

769
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,269
you often see
navis

770
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:37,279
navis
 

771
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,069
navis
takes pauses in there in the sequence of

772
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
takes pauses in there in the sequence of
 

773
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,389
takes pauses in there in the sequence of
their nage mazda because they were

774
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399
their nage mazda because they were
 

775
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,749
their nage mazda because they were
bracing

776
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
bracing
 

777
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,430
bracing
and uh

778
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:45,440
and uh
 

779
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,749
and uh
now stops right and the only time they

780
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
now stops right and the only time they
 

781
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,230
now stops right and the only time they
don't stop is when the choreographed uk

782
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
don't stop is when the choreographed uk
 

783
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,749
don't stop is when the choreographed uk
was never

784
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
was never
 

785
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,590
was never
providing any kind of actual

786
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
providing any kind of actual
 

787
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,670
providing any kind of actual
problem for them you see so this is like

788
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680
problem for them you see so this is like
 

789
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,350
problem for them you see so this is like
a problem okay

790
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
a problem okay
 

791
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,389
a problem okay
so

792
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
so
 

793
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,949
so
i just want you to feel

794
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
i just want you to feel
 

795
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,510
i just want you to feel
it and so he he did it again

796
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
it and so he he did it again
 

797
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,750
it and so he he did it again
um i don't can you see it or no you

798
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
um i don't can you see it or no you
 

799
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,189
um i don't can you see it or no you
can't see it okay so uh

800
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
can't see it okay so uh
 

801
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,270
can't see it okay so uh
you see though so already it's it

802
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
you see though so already it's it
 

803
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,270
you see though so already it's it
because the initial energy can't go

804
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
because the initial energy can't go
 

805
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,309
because the initial energy can't go
through you

806
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319
through you
 

807
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,110
through you
um i'll demonstrate it okay so when

808
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
um i'll demonstrate it okay so when
 

809
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,189
um i'll demonstrate it okay so when
taylor is trying to push me and i can go

810
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
taylor is trying to push me and i can go
 

811
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,990
taylor is trying to push me and i can go
on one foot it doesn't doesn't matter

812
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,000
on one foot it doesn't doesn't matter
 

813
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,230
on one foot it doesn't doesn't matter
okay uh because the energy is going

814
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
okay uh because the energy is going
 

815
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,230
okay uh because the energy is going
through me down on the ground so uh

816
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240
through me down on the ground so uh
 

817
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,470
through me down on the ground so uh
there's a very finite limit and it's

818
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
there's a very finite limit and it's
 

819
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,870
there's a very finite limit and it's
quite low marginally speaking on how

820
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
quite low marginally speaking on how
 

821
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,990
quite low marginally speaking on how
much energy you could take so as i just

822
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
much energy you could take so as i just
 

823
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,070
much energy you could take so as i just
pushed a little you see

824
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,080
pushed a little you see
 

825
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,630
pushed a little you see
he would lose that bracing angle war

826
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
he would lose that bracing angle war
 

827
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,070
he would lose that bracing angle war
okay

828
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080
okay
 

829
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,870
okay
so

830
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
so
 

831
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,789
so
that's the first thing and that is why

832
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
that's the first thing and that is why
 

833
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,590
that's the first thing and that is why
all true non-contestation is only

834
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
all true non-contestation is only
 

835
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,029
all true non-contestation is only
possible internally if you cannot

836
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:51,039
possible internally if you cannot
 

837
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,470
possible internally if you cannot
non-contest

838
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
non-contest
 

839
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,909
non-contest
by moving around externally it's not

840
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
by moving around externally it's not
 

841
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,549
by moving around externally it's not
possible you you are doing these little

842
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
possible you you are doing these little
 

843
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,110
possible you you are doing these little
micro bracing you're just not aware of

844
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,120
micro bracing you're just not aware of
 

845
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,310
micro bracing you're just not aware of
it okay

846
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
it okay
 

847
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,710
it okay
so uh we'll i'm gonna ease up the

848
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
so uh we'll i'm gonna ease up the
 

849
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,549
so uh we'll i'm gonna ease up the
tension did you feel me ease up the

850
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
tension did you feel me ease up the
 

851
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,029
tension did you feel me ease up the
tension so we don't get that i'm gonna

852
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
tension so we don't get that i'm gonna
 

853
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,510
tension so we don't get that i'm gonna
operate at outside where he wants to

854
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
operate at outside where he wants to
 

855
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,830
operate at outside where he wants to
brace okay so i'm not triggering his

856
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:13,840
brace okay so i'm not triggering his
 

857
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,950
brace okay so i'm not triggering his
bracing but as he goes to move now there

858
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
bracing but as he goes to move now there
 

859
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,029
bracing but as he goes to move now there
it is again did you see that you did it

i'm not doing spinal displacement so

880
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,120
i'm not doing spinal displacement so
 

881
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,909
i'm not doing spinal displacement so
that he has to ground that energy so i'm

882
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
that he has to ground that energy so i'm
 

883
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,549
that he has to ground that energy so i'm
just here i'm going to ease up there

884
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
just here i'm going to ease up there
 

885
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,110
just here i'm going to ease up there
and then i come over here

886

what we all think is

898
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
what we all think is
 

899
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,549
what we all think is
is what you saw but it's not what you

900
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
is what you saw but it's not what you
 

901
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,190
is what you saw but it's not what you
saw okay it's not what you saw he's a

big strong guy and he's pushing there's

904
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
big strong guy and he's pushing there's
 

905
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,350
big strong guy and he's pushing there's
a lot of energy there okay

906
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
a lot of energy there okay
 

907
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,230
a lot of energy there okay
um so this again goes back to the

908
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,240
um so this again goes back to the
 

909
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,990
um so this again goes back to the
choreographed ukia so the coriander

910
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
