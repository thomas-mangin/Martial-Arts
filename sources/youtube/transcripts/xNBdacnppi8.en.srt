can be no slack in here okay so as you
 

213
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,189
can be no slack in here okay so as you
do the throw that has you have to be in

do the throw that has you have to be in
 

215
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,390
do the throw that has you have to be in
his body

216
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:53,400
his body
 

217
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,350
his body
okay

218
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360

 

219
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:15,010

boom like his body

220
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,020

 

221
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:25,790

this one

222
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:25,800

 

223
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,010

okay we'll try it and I don't want to

224
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,020
okay we'll try it and I don't want to
 

225
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,870
okay we'll try it and I don't want to
cover it so much but those three

226
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:29,880
cover it so much but those three
 

227
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,870
cover it so much but those three
principles all right try

228
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
principles all right try
 

229
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,469
principles all right try
here we go

230
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:35,479

 

231
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:41,390

I I in order to address him coming up he

232
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,400
I I in order to address him coming up he
 

233
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,629
I I in order to address him coming up he
has to go forward just like uh

234
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
has to go forward just like uh
 

235
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,730
has to go forward just like uh
uh

236
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:48,740

 

237
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,950

so when he comes up it's not that I'm

238
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:51,960
so when he comes up it's not that I'm
 

239
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,450
so when he comes up it's not that I'm
cranking

240
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:53,460
cranking
 

241
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,249
cranking
he comes up and I bring It Forward

242
00:07:58,249 --> 00:07:58,259

 

243
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,770

otherwise don't and he will regain his

244
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:00,780
otherwise don't and he will regain his
 

245
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,969
otherwise don't and he will regain his
balance okay so here it comes up I think

246
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:04,979
balance okay so here it comes up I think
 

247
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,550
balance okay so here it comes up I think
I go forward okay now what I want you to

248
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:07,560
I go forward okay now what I want you to
 

249

00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:11,400
look for go back one there you go okay
 

251
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,309
look for go back one there you go okay
it's this angle

252
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:13,319
it's this angle
 

253
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,010
it's this angle
this is the angle I want because when we

254
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,020
this is the angle I want because when we
 

255
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,230
this is the angle I want because when we
when our style we take when we do the

256
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
when our style we take when we do the
 

257
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,350
when our style we take when we do the
throw we're going to take the bass

258
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360

 

259
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,390

okay I don't need to take the base off

260
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:23,400
okay I don't need to take the base off

but I'm in the back
 

269
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,430
but I'm in the back
so when I when I do the code that I ask

270
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
so when I when I do the code that I ask
 

271
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:45,050
so when I when I do the code that I ask
with his arm my leg comes in here boom

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,060

 

273
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,630

so we're gonna change the ending

278
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:54,660
so we're gonna change the ending
 

279
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,050

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:37,620
visible when on the last
 

313
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,650
visible when on the last
instruction but we're going to point it

314
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:39,660
instruction but we're going to point it
 

315
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,110
instruction but we're going to point it
out okay so

316
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,120
out okay so
 

317
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,670

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:46,620
here and bring him forward
 

321
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,370
here and bring him forward
I don't want his elbow to go from my

322
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:49,380
I don't want his elbow to go from my
 

323
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,990
I don't want his elbow to go from my
right to my left

324
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,000
right to my left
 

325
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,650
right to my left
his elbow is going to stay

326
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:54,660
his elbow is going to stay
 

327
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,889
his elbow is going to stay
pretty much on my Center Line okay and

328
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:57,899
pretty much on my Center Line okay and
 

329
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,810
pretty much on my Center Line okay and
as I move

330
00:10:59,810 --> 00:10:59,820
as I move
 

331
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,190
as I move
it moves on that sentiment

332
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,200
it moves on that sentiment
 

333
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,470
it moves on that sentiment
so if you come over there I'll do that

334
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
so if you come over there I'll do that
 

335
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,910
so if you come over there I'll do that
again

336
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:07,920
again
 

337
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,410
again
right I don't want to go here and go and

338
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:12,420
right I don't want to go here and go and
 

339
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,630
right I don't want to go here and go and
come left to right okay that doesn't

340
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
come left to right okay that doesn't
 

341
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,850
come left to right okay that doesn't
work

342
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:15,860
work
 

343
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,150
work
instead his elbow might even come on my

344
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,509
leave the leg check out
rule number two was no slack no no rule

416
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:26,519
rule number two was no slack no no rule
 

417
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,550

and you uh move the arm left to right
that's that's a lot of slack you can do

426
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,000
that's that's a lot of slack you can do
 

427
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,590
that's that's a lot of slack you can do
some things but this this way it stays

428
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:42,600
some things but this this way it stays
 

429

that so
 

445
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,090

okay so if you pay attention how many
right angles do I have come back up

458
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:34,440
right angles do I have come back up
 

459
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,170
right angles do I have come back up
right angle

460
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:36,180
right angle
 

461
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,829
right angle

465
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,389

and that's only because we want uh the

466
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:47,399
and that's only because we want uh the
