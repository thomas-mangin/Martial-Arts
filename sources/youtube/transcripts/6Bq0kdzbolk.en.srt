years

96
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,140
years
 

97
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,749
years
um so yeah so starting negative 15 14

98

99
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,969
um so yeah so starting negative 15 14
years of data you so I'm at a stage

100
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:10,979
years of data you so I'm at a stage
 

101
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,150
years of data you so I'm at a stage
where uh both those disciplines are as

102

where uh both those disciplines are as
much uh part of my identity uh I guess

104
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
much uh part of my identity uh I guess
 

105
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,290
much uh part of my identity uh I guess
um at this stage and and I find this

106
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:21,300
um at this stage and and I find this
 

107
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,729
um at this stage and and I find this
interesting because I think this is

108
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:22,739
interesting because I think this is
 

109
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,610
interesting because I think this is
really what ideally uh it should be what

110
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:25,620
really what ideally uh it should be what
 

111
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,869
really what ideally uh it should be what
you do should be part of you it

112
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
you do should be part of you it
 

113
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,729
you do should be part of you it
shouldn't be you so in other words you

114
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:28,739
shouldn't be you so in other words you
 

115
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,830
shouldn't be you so in other words you
know if for whatever reason you have to

stop at kilo because you get injured it
 

119
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,910
stop at kilo because you get injured it
should not destroy you personally right

120
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:34,920
should not destroy you personally right
 

121
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,710

could allocate that time and energy to
 

127
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,930
could allocate that time and energy to
something else which uh if this happened

128
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:41,940
something else which uh if this happened
 

129
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,970

496
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:14,220
necessarily find a satisfying answer
 

497
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,730
necessarily find a satisfying answer
after all these years looking into it

498
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:16,740
after all these years looking into it
 

499
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,970
after all these years looking into it
what I can tell you is um

500
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:19,980
what I can tell you is um
 

501
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,310
what I can tell you is um
I think he just probably didn't really

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
I think he just probably didn't really
 

503
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,889
I think he just probably didn't really

mind
 

505
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,590
mind
uh what would happen afterwards because

506
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
uh what would happen afterwards because
 

507
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,690
uh what would happen afterwards because
if we just look at his life

508
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:29,700
if we just look at his life
 

509
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,190
if we just look at his life
and that the various things that people

510
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
and that the various things that people
 

511
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,769
and that the various things that people
did in his school

512
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:33,779
did in his school
 

513
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,190
did in his school
uh I can't recall any incidents of him

514
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
uh I can't recall any incidents of him
 

515
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,829
uh I can't recall any incidents of him
telling you are not doing it right stop

516
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:39,839
telling you are not doing it right stop
 

517
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,470
telling you are not doing it right stop
doing that or or you'll become you know

518
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
doing that or or you'll become you know
 

519
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,870
doing that or or you'll become you know
hormone you'll be kicked out

520
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
hormone you'll be kicked out
 

521
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,710
hormone you'll be kicked out
that would happen uh very easily in in

522
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
that would happen uh very easily in in
 

523
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,750
that would happen uh very easily in in
so-called traditional schools

524
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:50,760
so-called traditional schools
 

525
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,410
so-called traditional schools
uh but that did not happen in Aikido

526
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:53,420
uh but that did not happen in Aikido
 

527
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,449
uh but that did not happen in Aikido
neither did he actually filter in the

528
00:09:56,449 --> 00:09:56,459
neither did he actually filter in the
 

529
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,610
neither did he actually filter in the
people who came you know they said okay

530
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:58,620
people who came you know they said okay
 

531
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,250
people who came you know they said okay
anybody here can come and he didn't kick

532
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,260
anybody here can come and he didn't kick
 

533
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,990
anybody here can come and he didn't kick
out anyone

534
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,000
out anyone
 

535
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,210
out anyone
so I think if you just look at that

536
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,220
so I think if you just look at that
 

537
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,550
so I think if you just look at that
which is I think undeniable regardless

538
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:07,560
which is I think undeniable regardless
 

539
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,930
which is I think undeniable regardless
of what you might have written and said

540
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:08,940
of what you might have written and said
 

541
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,269
of what you might have written and said
it's what he did that leaves a lot of

542
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
it's what he did that leaves a lot of
 

543
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,210
it's what he did that leaves a lot of
wiggle room I think

544
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,220
wiggle room I think
 

545
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,930
wiggle room I think
um

546
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:14,940
um
 

547
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,449
um
for me Aikido being like part of that

548
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:17,459
for me Aikido being like part of that
 

549
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,030
for me Aikido being like part of that

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,009
um it is by nature uh something that
that's gonna have to uh to change to

00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:25,019
that's gonna have to uh to change to
 

555
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,030
that's gonna have to uh to change to
evolve

556
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,040

um now where are the boundaries

560
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,100
um now where are the boundaries
 

561
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,710

is uh partly why I want to study the IW

566
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:40,140

um I didn't study dietary you because I

568
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:42,540
um I didn't study dietary you because I

wanted to well yes of course at the
 

571
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,910
wanted to well yes of course at the
beginning you want to know the real way

572
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:46,920
beginning you want to know the real way
 

573

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,690
to do criticism and you know the real
way to do shiron again but then you

576
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:50,700
way to do shiron again but then you
 

577
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,949
way to do shiron again but then you
found out that there's so many ways to

578
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:51,959
found out that there's so many ways to
 

579
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,630
found out that there's so many ways to
do even within dietary school which is

580

do even within dietary school which is
 

581
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,949
do even within dietary school which is
not that monolithic thing there are many

not that monolithic thing there are many
 

583
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,449
not that monolithic thing there are many
ways to do I mean my own school we do

ways to do I mean my own school we do
 

585
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,670

but at least first it opens your mind

594
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:11,480
but at least first it opens your mind

so immediately you change your point of

600
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,180
so immediately you change your point of
 

601
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,910
so immediately you change your point of
view in thinking whether somebody from

something wrong to you it's not
 

607
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,509
something wrong to you it's not
necessarily wrong it's just we've done

00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:26,519
necessarily wrong it's just we've done
 

609
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,610
necessarily wrong it's just we've done
differently and if you've studied enough

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:28,620
differently and if you've studied enough
 

611
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,750
differently and if you've studied enough
and if you know enough and you've got

I think it's a dodgy word it's too wide

620
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:37,740
I think it's a dodgy word it's too wide
 

621
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,550
I think it's a dodgy word it's too wide
it's like Keys it doesn't mean anything

622
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
it's like Keys it doesn't mean anything
 

623
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,170
it's like Keys it doesn't mean anything
um but the point in the technique if you

624
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:42,180
um but the point in the technique if you
 

625
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,550
um but the point in the technique if you
can see the point somebody's technique

626
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:43,560
can see the point somebody's technique
 

627
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,230
can see the point somebody's technique
even if it's not the way you do it in in

628
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,240
even if it's not the way you do it in in
 

629
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,150
even if it's not the way you do it in in
the Qatar in your school you say oh yeah

630
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,160
the Qatar in your school you say oh yeah
 

631
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,949
the Qatar in your school you say oh yeah
they are putting in action those points

632
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
they are putting in action those points
 

633
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,629
they are putting in action those points
and that makes sense and perhaps that's

634
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
and that makes sense and perhaps that's
 

635
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,550
and that makes sense and perhaps that's
not my choice but at least I can see

636
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
not my choice but at least I can see
 

637
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,170
not my choice but at least I can see
where that's coming from and why they're

638
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:54,180
where that's coming from and why they're

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,030
where that's coming from and why they're
doing it that developing that

00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:05,700
because first you admit that you don't
 

649
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,250
because first you admit that you don't
know everything and then you can see the

650
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:07,260
know everything and then you can see the
 

651
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,829
know everything and then you can see the
qualities rather than the difference in

652
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839
qualities rather than the difference in
 

653

other people's technique now what what

uh that's very interesting something
 

677
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,009
uh that's very interesting something
about the human brain um but if you get

678
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:37,019
about the human brain um but if you get
 

679
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,569
about the human brain um but if you get
enough knowledge you don't you no longer

differences you know something that

722
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:22,740
differences you know something that
 

723
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,009
differences you know something that
you you practice the technique you go in

724
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:25,019
you you practice the technique you go in
 

725
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,970
you you practice the technique you go in
a school and that feeling of this where

726
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:28,980
a school and that feeling of this where
 

727
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,030
a school and that feeling of this where
the technique is done like

728
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,040
the technique is done like
 

729
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,509
the technique is done like
hurts you almost in your identity or in

730
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
hurts you almost in your identity or in
 

731
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,910
hurts you almost in your identity or in
your conception of what it should be

732
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
your conception of what it should be
 

733
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,189
your conception of what it should be
and I think until you learn to let go of

734
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:40,199
and I think until you learn to let go of
 

735
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:43,069
and I think until you learn to let go of
that so the only way to do that is to to

736
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:43,079
that so the only way to do that is to to
 

737
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,870
that so the only way to do that is to to
do it more rather than less right right

738
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
do it more rather than less right right
 

739
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,150
do it more rather than less right right
and anybody who's you know done that

740
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,160
and anybody who's you know done that
 

741
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,250
and anybody who's you know done that
seriously enough and crosstrained enough

seriously enough and crosstrained enough
 

743
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,790
seriously enough and crosstrained enough
as as as understood that but there are

744

as as as understood that but there are
 

745
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,790
as as as understood that but there are
still a lot of people who are somehow

746
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:55,800
still a lot of people who are somehow
 

747

don't want to do it we have to find a
 

759
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,530

seminar class and somebody asked me why

808
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:06,839
seminar class and somebody asked me why

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:11,940
and I feel this is the essential thing
 

813
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,290
and I feel this is the essential thing
that the teacher needs to be able to do

814
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:14,300
that the teacher needs to be able to do

00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:37,139
changing the cursor depending on who
 

833
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,509
changing the cursor depending on who
I've got in front of me what I want you

834
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:38,519
I've got in front of me what I want you
 

835
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,850
I've got in front of me what I want you
to teach on that day but it's always the

836
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:40,860
to teach on that day but it's always the
 

837
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,710
to teach on that day but it's always the
purpose the the product of a choice you

838
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
purpose the the product of a choice you
 

839
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,629
purpose the the product of a choice you
see I have chosen to put the cursor here

840
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
see I have chosen to put the cursor here
 

841
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,030
see I have chosen to put the cursor here
in that circumstances right and that

842
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
in that circumstances right and that
 

843
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,949
in that circumstances right and that
that's the way it should be now whether

844
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:48,959
that's the way it should be now whether
 

845
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,509
that's the way it should be now whether
your range is like this or like this

846
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:50,519
your range is like this or like this
 

847
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,069
your range is like this or like this
well it depends on how much training

848
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
well it depends on how much training
 

849
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,769
well it depends on how much training
you've done uh but within that range you

850
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:54,779
you've done uh but within that range you
 

851
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,470
you've done uh but within that range you
should be free to to do that uh because

852
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:57,480
should be free to to do that uh because
 

853
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,050
should be free to to do that uh because
if you only do something

854
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,060
if you only do something
 

855
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,730
if you only do something
not because you choose to do it but

856
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:01,740
not because you choose to do it but
 

857
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,230
not because you choose to do it but
because if you haven't studied the rest

858
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:03,240
because if you haven't studied the rest
 

859
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,910
because if you haven't studied the rest
then this is not a choice it's a product

860
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:04,920
then this is not a choice it's a product
 

861
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,310
then this is not a choice it's a product
of a limitation

862
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
of a limitation
 

863
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,050
of a limitation
uh so it's for me it's potential knowing

864
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,060
uh so it's for me it's potential knowing
 

865
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,790
uh so it's for me it's potential knowing
as much as possible and then I can

866
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
as much as possible and then I can
 

867
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,030
as much as possible and then I can
choose where I put the cursor

868
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,040
choose where I put the cursor
 

869
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,550
choose where I put the cursor
um and again as expected before it also

870
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
um and again as expected before it also
 

871
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,170
um and again as expected before it also
allows me to see the qualities in other

872
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,180
allows me to see the qualities in other
 

873
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,310
allows me to see the qualities in other
people like you know and that that

874
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:19,320
people like you know and that that
 

875
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,310
people like you know and that that
changes your life as well this is great

876
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
changes your life as well this is great
 

877
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,769
changes your life as well this is great
so that's that's what I could do is to

878
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:24,779
so that's that's what I could do is to
 

879
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:25,550
so that's that's what I could do is to
me

880
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:25,560
me
 

881
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,550
me
um

882
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:27,560
um
 

883
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,350
um
then knowing the historical technique I

884
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:30,360
then knowing the historical technique I
 

885
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,110
then knowing the historical technique I
can also say

886
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:32,120
can also say
 

887
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,670
can also say
uh and again you have to take that with

888
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:34,680
uh and again you have to take that with
 

889
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,170
uh and again you have to take that with
a pinch of salt because not all the

890
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:36,180
a pinch of salt because not all the
 

891
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,269
a pinch of salt because not all the
dietary School necessarily use the same

892
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:38,279
dietary School necessarily use the same
 

893
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,430
dietary School necessarily use the same
mechanics but I can tell you when

894
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:40,440
mechanics but I can tell you when
 

895
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,249
mechanics but I can tell you when
something goes against an essential

896
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:43,259
something goes against an essential
 

897
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:46,730
something goes against an essential
aspect mechanical aspect of what I told

898
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:46,740
aspect mechanical aspect of what I told
 

899
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,370
aspect mechanical aspect of what I told
you the way dietary works I can also see

900
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:49,380
you the way dietary works I can also see
 

901
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,610
you the way dietary works I can also see
it so I can tell you're making that up

902
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:52,620
it so I can tell you're making that up
 

903

it so I can tell you're making that up
because you know this is not really

904
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:55,399
because you know this is not really
 

905
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,470
because you know this is not really
fitting within the way it's done there

00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:52,549
hero but we need to uh recognize uh when
it's there

1128
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:52,559
it's there
 

1129
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,909
it's there
uh but but this goes Way Beyond uh

1130
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:55,919
uh but but this goes Way Beyond uh

Aikido but it's quite a destructive

1132
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:58,500
Aikido but it's quite a destructive
 

1133
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,669
Aikido but it's quite a destructive
force I think in in Aikido uh we have to

1134
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:01,679
force I think in in Aikido uh we have to
 

1135
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,350
force I think in in Aikido uh we have to
get rid of that and and find out that

1136
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
get rid of that and and find out that
 

1137
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,450
get rid of that and and find out that
you know it's a collaborative process

1138
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:05,460
you know it's a collaborative process
 

1139
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,169
you know it's a collaborative process
and it's a thing of self-growth uh what

1140
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:09,179
and it's a thing of self-growth uh what
 

1141
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,270
and it's a thing of self-growth uh what
does it matter you know to to be uh

1142
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,280
does it matter you know to to be uh
 

1143
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,149
does it matter you know to to be uh
better than the other and so on and

better than the other and so on and
 

1145
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,130
better than the other and so on and
that's one of the relevance for me of

1146
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:16,140
that's one of the relevance for me of
 

1147
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,350
that's one of the relevance for me of
Aikido and in other words what makes in

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,310
because what what's a winner
a winner is somebody who manufactures

it's not my quote okay it's something
 

1189
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,430
it's not my quote okay it's something
from a French scientist but I really

1190
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
from a French scientist but I really
 

1191
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,010
from a French scientist but I really
agree with that is it really the

1192
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:16,020
agree with that is it really the
 

1193
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,390
agree with that is it really the
relationship that we want to have with

1194
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,400
relationship that we want to have with
 

1195
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,850
relationship that we want to have with
each other

1196
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:18,860
each other
 

1197
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,409
each other
uh and you can you can apply that you

1198
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:21,419
uh and you can you can apply that you
 

1199
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,510
uh and you can you can apply that you
know you really do you really need that

1200
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:23,520
know you really do you really need that
 

1201
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,390
know you really do you really need that
competitive aspect for in business or

1202
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
competitive aspect for in business or
 

1203
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,130
competitive aspect for in business or
could a business run

1204
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:28,140
could a business run
 

1205
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,830
could a business run
without that's the sort of you know a

1206
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:30,840
without that's the sort of you know a
 

1207
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,890
without that's the sort of you know a
shock sort of mentality you know the

1208
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:33,900
shock sort of mentality you know the
 

1209
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,590
shock sort of mentality you know the
idea is about is growth sustainable in

1210
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:36,600
idea is about is growth sustainable in
 

1211
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,590
idea is about is growth sustainable in
in an environment which is basically

1212
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:39,600
in an environment which is basically
 

1213
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,610
in an environment which is basically
physically finite okay uh the

1214
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:43,620
physically finite okay uh the
 

1215
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,230
physically finite okay uh the
competition breaks down in those

1216
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,240
competition breaks down in those
 

1217
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,149
competition breaks down in those
circumstances when resources are limited

1218
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:47,159
circumstances when resources are limited
 

1219
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,409
circumstances when resources are limited
and so on because uh it's it's a

1220
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:51,419
and so on because uh it's it's a
 

1221
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:52,549
and so on because uh it's it's a
zero-sum game

1222
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:52,559
zero-sum game
 

1223
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,310
zero-sum game
what people win the others will lose

1224
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:55,320
what people win the others will lose
 

1225
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,830
what people win the others will lose
and I think I feel that Aikido could be

1226
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:57,840
and I think I feel that Aikido could be
 

1227
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,770
and I think I feel that Aikido could be
a wonderful Vector for this and that's

1228
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:00,780
a wonderful Vector for this and that's
 

1229
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,169
a wonderful Vector for this and that's
why I'm talking about it though uh the

1230
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:03,179
why I'm talking about it though uh the
 

1231
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,090
why I'm talking about it though uh the
really that's the The Wish by thing in

1232
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:05,100
really that's the The Wish by thing in
 

1233
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,549
really that's the The Wish by thing in
my opinion I can't see Target soccer

1234
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:07,559
my opinion I can't see Target soccer
 

1235
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,870
my opinion I can't see Target soccer
could be in much content with those

1236
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,880
could be in much content with those
 

1237
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,029
could be in much content with those
ideas

1238
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,039
ideas
 

1239
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,149
ideas
um it's been uh suggested that he might

1240
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
um it's been uh suggested that he might
 

1241
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,950
um it's been uh suggested that he might
have been but I think that's which we're

1242
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:15,960
have been but I think that's which we're
 

1243
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,390
have been but I think that's which we're
thinking we don't really have evidence

1244
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:17,400
thinking we don't really have evidence
 

1245
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,010
thinking we don't really have evidence
of it

1246
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:19,020
of it
 

1247
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,230
of it
um so that for me that that would be uh

1248
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,240
um so that for me that that would be uh
 

1249
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,690
um so that for me that that would be uh
would be very very important and I think

1250
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:23,700
would be very very important and I think
 

1251
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,810
would be very very important and I think
Aikido has a place for that uh and also

1252
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:26,820
Aikido has a place for that uh and also
 

1253
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,909
Aikido has a place for that uh and also
the the other part of that and that goes

1254
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:28,919
the the other part of that and that goes
 

1255
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:29,750
the the other part of that and that goes
back to what you were saying about

1256
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
back to what you were saying about
 

1257
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,450
back to what you were saying about
admitting our own limitations

1258
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:32,460
admitting our own limitations
 

1259
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,310
admitting our own limitations
is that

1260
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
is that
 

1261
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,890
is that
um doing all the martial arts uh you've

1262
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:36,900
um doing all the martial arts uh you've
 

1263
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,930
um doing all the martial arts uh you've
done I know that uh you know you you've

1264
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:38,940
done I know that uh you know you you've
 

1265
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,810
done I know that uh you know you you've
crossed trained in a number of things

1266
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:40,820
crossed trained in a number of things
 

1267
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,750
crossed trained in a number of things
uh teachers screw up uh you know

1268
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:44,760
uh teachers screw up uh you know
 

1269
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,130
uh teachers screw up uh you know
especially you know when you when you

1270
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,140
especially you know when you when you
 

1271
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,490
especially you know when you when you
when you you you do uh how would you say

1272
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:49,500
when you you you do uh how would you say
 

1273
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,710
when you you you do uh how would you say
uh free fight and stuff like that so

1274
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:51,720
uh free fight and stuff like that so
 

1275
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,590
uh free fight and stuff like that so
it's boring yeah

1276
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:53,600
it's boring yeah
 

1277
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,690
it's boring yeah
in Aikido we don't have that opportunity

1278
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:56,700
in Aikido we don't have that opportunity
 

1279
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,049
in Aikido we don't have that opportunity
and uh I'm very suspicious of teachers

1280
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:00,059
and uh I'm very suspicious of teachers
 

1281
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,029
and uh I'm very suspicious of teachers
who never make a mistake

1282
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:02,039
who never make a mistake
 

1283
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,070
who never make a mistake
uh because that doesn't happen does it

1284
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,080
uh because that doesn't happen does it
 

1285
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,289
uh because that doesn't happen does it
yeah the only way that happens is if

1286
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:06,299
yeah the only way that happens is if
 

1287
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,510
yeah the only way that happens is if
you've stacked the chances and if you've

1288
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:08,520
you've stacked the chances and if you've
 

1289
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,090
you've stacked the chances and if you've
fired the game to your advantage

1290
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:11,100
fired the game to your advantage
 

1291

and this is what the nikeido seminar
 

1293
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,409
and this is what the nikeido seminar
looks like most of the time

1294
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:15,419
looks like most of the time

um and they should
 

1301
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,490
um and they should

uh and and sometimes I I screw with
 

1303
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,230

um I was showing a way to you know to

1306
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:29,100
um I was showing a way to you know to
 

1307
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,570
um I was showing a way to you know to
develop a bit of power on monetary

1308
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:32,580
develop a bit of power on monetary
 

1309
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,070
develop a bit of power on monetary
and it's something that is really

1310
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080
and it's something that is really
 

1311
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,750
and it's something that is really
helpful to developer but there's a

1312
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:35,760
helpful to developer but there's a
 

1313
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,149
helpful to developer but there's a
there's a limit to that and I was

1314
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
there's a limit to that and I was
 

1315
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,010
there's a limit to that and I was
showing that in Britain uh just a few

1316
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:40,020
showing that in Britain uh just a few
 

1317
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,890
showing that in Britain uh just a few
weeks ago and I wanted to make a point

1318
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:42,900
weeks ago and I wanted to make a point
 

1319
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,590
weeks ago and I wanted to make a point
uh that you know this is not a

1320
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
uh that you know this is not a
 

1321
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,409
uh that you know this is not a
superpower so and I was very lucky there

1322
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:48,419
superpower so and I was very lucky there
 

1323
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,630
superpower so and I was very lucky there
was a wonderful gentleman

1330
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:56,700
keikogee and he just turned up and he
 

1331
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,090
keikogee and he just turned up and he
said I try and answer of course you can

1332
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,100
said I try and answer of course you can
 

1333
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,830
said I try and answer of course you can
and then I called that guy

1334
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:00,840
and then I called that guy
 

1335
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,350
and then I called that guy
and then I tried to do it and I can't do

1336
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,360
and then I tried to do it and I can't do
 

1337
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,590
and then I tried to do it and I can't do
it it's too strong it's not magic there

1338
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:06,600
it it's too strong it's not magic there
 

1339
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,149
it it's too strong it's not magic there
is a point where a technique is not

1340
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
is a point where a technique is not
 

1341
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,970
is a point where a technique is not
gonna work uh so first of all the

1342
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:10,980
gonna work uh so first of all the
 

1343
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,409
gonna work uh so first of all the
technique is absolutely not supposed to

1344
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:12,419
technique is absolutely not supposed to
 

1345
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,870
technique is absolutely not supposed to
work on everybody for sure and there's a

1346
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880
work on everybody for sure and there's a
 

1347
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,470
work on everybody for sure and there's a
limit to physics yes okay obviously was

1348
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,480
limit to physics yes okay obviously was
 

1349
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,909
limit to physics yes okay obviously was
way more powerful plus you were smart

1350
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
way more powerful plus you were smart
 

1351
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,890
way more powerful plus you were smart
about it okay you could he knew how to

1352
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:21,900
about it okay you could he knew how to
 

1353
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,570
about it okay you could he knew how to
redirect his his body weight and so on

1354
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:23,580
redirect his his body weight and so on
 

1355
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,130
redirect his his body weight and so on
and that didn't work you should have

1356
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:25,140
and that didn't work you should have
 

1357
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,110
and that didn't work you should have
seen the the the the the the the shock

1358
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,120
seen the the the the the the the shock
 

1359
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,029
seen the the the the the the the shock
on people's eyes

daiquiryo for instance
 

1403
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,250

uh this is why also takarasoka could

1404
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:19,260
uh this is why also takarasoka could
 

1405
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,450
uh this is why also takarasoka could
never show the same technique twice

and vulnerability and I think in Aikido

1610
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:07,799
and vulnerability and I think in Aikido
 

1611
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,230
and vulnerability and I think in Aikido
particularly it's a hard thing to have

1612
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:09,240
particularly it's a hard thing to have
 

1613

particularly it's a hard thing to have
because as you said when you show

1614
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:11,100
because as you said when you show
 

1615
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,889
because as you said when you show
vulnerability in Aikido everyone tends

1616
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:12,899
vulnerability in Aikido everyone tends
 

1617
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:14,750
vulnerability in Aikido everyone tends
to go oh well they just don't know the

1618
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:14,760
to go oh well they just don't know the

thank you well I mean
um I've you know I've seen a lot of very

1634
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:32,100
um I've you know I've seen a lot of very
 

1635
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,570
um I've you know I've seen a lot of very
very very good uh teachers some of the

1636
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:35,580
very very good uh teachers some of the
 

1637
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,889
very very good uh teachers some of the
best in the world

1638
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:36,899
best in the world
 

1639
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:39,950
best in the world
uh so I think even though I myself may

1640
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:39,960
uh so I think even though I myself may
 

1641
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,990
uh so I think even though I myself may
not be able to do

1642
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,000
not be able to do
 

1643
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,789
not be able to do
many things

1644
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:43,799
many things
 

1645
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:47,930
many things
I probably have a good sense of what you

1646
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:47,940
I probably have a good sense of what you
 

1647
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,510
I probably have a good sense of what you
can expect to achieve in one or the

1648
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:50,520
can expect to achieve in one or the
 

1649
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,730
can expect to achieve in one or the
other sort of interpretation of Aikido

1650
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:52,740
other sort of interpretation of Aikido
 

1651
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,010
other sort of interpretation of Aikido
and I think if you if there is one thing

1652
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,020
and I think if you if there is one thing
 

1653
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,730
and I think if you if there is one thing
I can you know I I can claim from my uh

1654
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:58,740
I can you know I I can claim from my uh
 

1655
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,289
I can you know I I can claim from my uh

High ranked in numerous disciplines so I

1662
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:06,600
High ranked in numerous disciplines so I
 

1663
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,029
High ranked in numerous disciplines so I
think I've got a sense of what what

think I've got a sense of what what
 

1665
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:11,090
think I've got a sense of what what
potential there is uh and uh you know

1666
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,100
potential there is uh and uh you know
 

1667
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,889
potential there is uh and uh you know
the the benefit and the cost sometimes

1668
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:12,899
the the benefit and the cost sometimes
 

1669
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:17,630
the the benefit and the cost sometimes
of doing this or that I mean I know uh

1683
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,230
it's good uh but do I want to spend a
seminar uh doing it again and doing this

1684
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,240
seminar uh doing it again and doing this
 

1685
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,750
seminar uh doing it again and doing this
for two hours no it's not me it's not me

for two hours no it's not me it's not me
and and you know is is spending all that

1688
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:41,340
and and you know is is spending all that
 

1689
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,250
and and you know is is spending all that
time something that's to develop those

1690
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:43,260
time something that's to develop those
 

1691
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,889
time something that's to develop those
qualities something that's really uh I

1692
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:45,899
qualities something that's really uh I
 

1693
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:48,590
qualities something that's really uh I
find interesting as a whole no there are

1694
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:48,600
find interesting as a whole no there are
 

1695
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,009
find interesting as a whole no there are
so many other aspects in the mind is the

1696
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:52,019
so many other aspects in the mind is the
 

1697
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:54,649
so many other aspects in the mind is the
timing there's so many other aspects I

1698
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:54,659
timing there's so many other aspects I
 

1699
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:58,250
timing there's so many other aspects I
try to Encompass uh all of it and also

1700
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:58,260
try to Encompass uh all of it and also
 

1701
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,110
try to Encompass uh all of it and also
uh you have to look at the cost of of

1702
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,120
uh you have to look at the cost of of
 

1703
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,330
uh you have to look at the cost of of
something you do I mean it's it's really

1704
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:02,340
something you do I mean it's it's really
 

1705
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,130
something you do I mean it's it's really
interesting that some of the

1706
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,140
interesting that some of the
 

1707
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,450
interesting that some of the
practitioners which were the most

1708
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:05,460
practitioners which were the most
 

1709
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,669
practitioners which were the most
talented which are the most talented in

talented which are the most talented in
 

1711
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,590
talented which are the most talented in
developing insane amount of

1712
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,600
developing insane amount of

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,330
developing insane amount of

1714
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:11,340
they refer to it as internal products
 

1715
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,889
they refer to it as internal products
well I'll use it even though I don't

1716
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:12,899
well I'll use it even though I don't
 

1717
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:14,570
well I'll use it even though I don't
really use the time myself

1718
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:14,580
really use the time myself
 

1719
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,509
really use the time myself
but you know the physics is is you know

1720
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:17,519
but you know the physics is is you know
 

1721
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,110
but you know the physics is is you know
is a if you generate power insane

1722
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,120
is a if you generate power insane
 

1723

is a if you generate power insane
amount of power physics says so that

right and a lot of people who are
working on onslow's line don't

1734
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:33,059
working on onslow's line don't
 

1735
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:35,870
working on onslow's line don't
necessarily consider that fact

1736
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:35,880
necessarily consider that fact
 

1737
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,930
necessarily consider that fact
until they injure themselves they don't

1738

considered what to do with it
 

1751
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,389
considered what to do with it
and you've damaged somewhere in your

00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,350
body and I've seen that many many times
you see that in weapons as well because

1756
