don't get it with the first two
movements you might think I'll do four

328
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
movements you might think I'll do four
 

329

because perhaps that'll feel better than
 

331
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:35,430
because perhaps that'll feel better than
the two or or I do I do um six because

I'll do the
 

337
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,670
I'll do the
eight well you can do you can do 16 if

I've seen so many students I've helped
 

357
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,710
I've seen so many students I've helped
over the years who try to think that the

and look to improve the two cuts either

368
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
and look to improve the two cuts either
 

369
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,630
and look to improve the two cuts either
way than it is to go on to the four cuts

370
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:29,640
way than it is to go on to the four cuts

I might get

380
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:43,560
I might get
 

381
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,150
I might get
it um and I'm smiling to myself because

382
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,160
it um and I'm smiling to myself because

directions in
 

401
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,069
directions in
haoi and you can get in each Direction

402
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:23,079
haoi and you can get in each Direction
 

403
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:25,150

three feeling the

404
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,160
three feeling the
 

405
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,350
three feeling the
same then you've got multiples of three

406
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:28,360
same then you've got multiples of three
 

407
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,990
same then you've got multiples of three
haven't you cuz because on the first one

408
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
haven't you cuz because on the first one
 

409
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,350
haven't you cuz because on the first one
forward one back you get three and then

410
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
forward one back you get three and then
 

411
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,310
forward one back you get three and then
the you're going to multiply that into

412
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:37,320
the you're going to multiply that into
 

413
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,910
the you're going to multiply that into
four uh directional cuts and once you

414
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:40,920
four uh directional cuts and once you
 

415
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,550
four uh directional cuts and once you
get the first three feeling

416
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:43,560
get the first three feeling
 

417
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,190
get the first three feeling
smooth if they don't feel smooth don't

418
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,200
smooth if they don't feel smooth don't
 

419
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,230
smooth if they don't feel smooth don't
go onto the fourth four movements even

420
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
go onto the fourth four movements even
 

421
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,790
go onto the fourth four movements even
if you've already started the four

422
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
if you've already started the four
 

423
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,550
if you've already started the four
movements it means they're not deep in

424
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:55,560
movements it means they're not deep in
 

425
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,750
movements it means they're not deep in
your body the first

426

your body the first
 

427
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,910
your body the first
two it's hard for me to say this because

428
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:00,920
two it's hard for me to say this because
 

429
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,269
two it's hard for me to say this because
I know you'll want to think well I've

430
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
I know you'll want to think well I've
 

431
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,750
I know you'll want to think well I've
done the three I've got on the first two

432
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:06,760
done the three I've got on the first two
 

433
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,790
done the three I've got on the first two
strikes backwards and forwards I want to

434
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:09,800
strikes backwards and forwards I want to
 

435
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,870
strikes backwards and forwards I want to
I've started the four I'm going to keep

436
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:11,880
I've started the four I'm going to keep
 

437
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,670
I've started the four I'm going to keep
trying on the four and make the

438
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:14,680
trying on the four and make the
 

439
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,350
trying on the four and make the
four uh

440
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:16,360
four uh
 

441
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,069
four uh
movements somehow feel that I can have

442
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
movements somehow feel that I can have
 

443
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,629
movements somehow feel that I can have
the five times I'm going to attempt

444
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:23,639
the five times I'm going to attempt
 

445
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,509
the five times I'm going to attempt
it I'm going to try and get to the three

446
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:26,519
it I'm going to try and get to the three
 

447
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,389
it I'm going to try and get to the three
feeling smoother on the new

448
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
feeling smoother on the new
 

449
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,389
feeling smoother on the new
two that I've added to it I hope you're

450
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
two that I've added to it I hope you're
 

451
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,509
two that I've added to it I hope you're
understanding what I'm saying and it's

452
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:36,519
understanding what I'm saying and it's
 

453
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,110
understanding what I'm saying and it's
not

454
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,120
not
 

455
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,670
not
confusing so first two movements forward

456
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
confusing so first two movements forward
 

457
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,230
confusing so first two movements forward
and back second two movements you go

458
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
and back second two movements you go
 

459
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,150
and back second two movements you go
uh different so first two

460
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,160
uh different so first two
 

461
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:56,430
uh different so first two
movements is forward turn back next one

462
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:56,440
movements is forward turn back next one
 

463
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,470
movements is forward turn back next one
is opposite so it's like a

464
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:01,480

 

465
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,790

across and then you have it again and

466
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
across and then you have it again and
 

467
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,829
across and then you have it again and
have it again and then you come back to

468
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
have it again and then you come back to
 

469
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,829
have it again and then you come back to
square

470
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839
square
 

471
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,629

again uh a small breather a small Gap So

474
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:16,360
again uh a small breather a small Gap So
 

475
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,470
again uh a small breather a small Gap So
