he's doing like an inward hand sort

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:05,220
he's doing like an inward hand sort
 

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,620
he's doing like an inward hand sort
right right in there okay so we're just

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:08,630
right right in there okay so we're just
 

5
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:15,650
right right in there okay so we're just
starting there but even when I do it if

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:15,660
starting there but even when I do it if
 

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,260
starting there but even when I do it if
you watch my hands right forearm out you

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:21,270
you watch my hands right forearm out you
 

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,849
you watch my hands right forearm out you
don't have to do a strike you're just

10
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:22,859
don't have to do a strike you're just
 

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,140
don't have to do a strike you're just
gonna you're just gonna put your hand

12
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:24,150
gonna you're just gonna put your hand
 

13
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,470
gonna you're just gonna put your hand
there

14
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
there
 

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,080
there
even when I do it do you see how I have

16
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,090
even when I do it do you see how I have
 

17
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,060
even when I do it do you see how I have
that blend so I'm gonna reach out

18
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,070
that blend so I'm gonna reach out
 

19
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,310
that blend so I'm gonna reach out
towards him and then I was letting it

20
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
towards him and then I was letting it
 

21
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,510
towards him and then I was letting it
come back towards me

22
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
come back towards me
 

23
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,790
come back towards me
reach out extension the in space is here

24
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800

 

25
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,830

okay and then when we get to the contact

26
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
okay and then when we get to the contact
 

27
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,940
okay and then when we get to the contact
point I am not using my deltoids I've

28
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:49,950
point I am not using my deltoids I've
 

29
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,779
point I am not using my deltoids I've
pulled my scapula down right and I don't

30
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:53,789
pulled my scapula down right and I don't
 

31
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,270
pulled my scapula down right and I don't
want that deltoids and I'm not I'm now

32
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:56,280
want that deltoids and I'm not I'm now
 

33
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,939
want that deltoids and I'm not I'm now
not working with your linear grounding

34
00:00:58,939 --> 00:00:58,949
not working with your linear grounding
 

35
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,920
not working with your linear grounding
which is the easier one that's why we

36
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:00,930
which is the easier one that's why we
 

37
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,119
which is the easier one that's why we
start there so we go again right and I'm

38
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:05,129
start there so we go again right and I'm
 

39
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,030
start there so we go again right and I'm
just here and he goes really hard and I

40
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,040
just here and he goes really hard and I
 

41
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,719
just here and he goes really hard and I
I sent it down without activating and go

42
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:11,729
I sent it down without activating and go
 

43
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,730
I sent it down without activating and go
really hard there you go you can see

44
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:13,740
really hard there you go you can see
 

45
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,850
really hard there you go you can see
that I end up lifting him because it's

46
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:16,860
that I end up lifting him because it's
 

47
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,350
that I end up lifting him because it's
going on the ground let's come back up

48
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:18,360
going on the ground let's come back up
 

49
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,990
going on the ground let's come back up
so I do the other side thanks the

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,000
so I do the other side thanks the
 

51
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,620
so I do the other side thanks the
blending part I want home I lock the

52
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:24,630
blending part I want home I lock the
 

53
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,010
blending part I want home I lock the

goes up and I would be here right he
 

101
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,890
goes up and I would be here right he
goes around it right I had the center

102
00:02:59,890 --> 00:02:59,900
goes around it right I had the center
 

103
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,949
goes around it right I had the center
line you see my intention has got to be

104
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
line you see my intention has got to be
 

105
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,059
line you see my intention has got to be
warm up and of the center line what I'm

106
00:03:07,059 --> 00:03:07,069
warm up and of the center line what I'm
 

107
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:10,360
warm up and of the center line what I'm
seeing is this you see that or I'm

extension is up on the center line so
 

113
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,020
extension is up on the center line so
you can chill out and you're just gonna

you can chill out and you're just gonna
give me the fluidity up to TRO mom okay

116
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:26,900
give me the fluidity up to TRO mom okay
 

117
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,920
give me the fluidity up to TRO mom okay
again oh just do the string

118
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:32,930
again oh just do the string
 

119
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,460

are you ever going to get to the outside

122
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:39,770
are you ever going to get to the outside
 

123
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,260
are you ever going to get to the outside
no you're never gonna get to the other

124
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:42,270
no you're never gonna get to the other
 

125
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,480
no you're never gonna get to the other
side so what's happening is you're

126
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:44,490
side so what's happening is you're
 

127
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,610
side so what's happening is you're
coming over to here do you see that so

128
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:46,620
coming over to here do you see that so
 

129
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,670
coming over to here do you see that so
my elbow is not going to be as if I'm

130
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
my elbow is not going to be as if I'm
 

131
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,020
my elbow is not going to be as if I'm
doing shomenuchi there's a slight

132
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,030
doing shomenuchi there's a slight
 

133
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,570
doing shomenuchi there's a slight
lateral there you go okay and calm down

134
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:56,580
lateral there you go okay and calm down
 

135
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,880
lateral there you go okay and calm down
because no one's hitting anyone that's

it
 

139
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,010
it
calm down centerline centerline so

140
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,020
calm down centerline centerline so
 

141
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,720
calm down centerline centerline so
you're afraid of getting hit but I'm not

142

gonna hit you I already told you that
 

145
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,580
gonna hit you I already told you that
hey that's it you're gonna slow down

146
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:09,590
hey that's it you're gonna slow down
 

147
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:16,130
hey that's it you're gonna slow down
good again that's it um stick to your

148
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,140
good again that's it um stick to your
 

149
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,960
good again that's it um stick to your
mission and you'll do it right you're

150
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:17,970
mission and you'll do it right you're
 

151
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,780
mission and you'll do it right you're
defending yourself right now you want to

152
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:20,790
defending yourself right now you want to
 

153
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,150
defending yourself right now you want to
do this do you understand

154
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,160
do this do you understand
 

155
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,960
do this do you understand
so there you go okay so down though oh

156
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:28,970
so there you go okay so down though oh
 

157
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:35,810
so there you go okay so down though oh
that's where I am home centerline you're

158
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:35,820
that's where I am home centerline you're
 

159
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,619
that's where I am home centerline you're
defending yourself again no

160
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:40,629

 

161
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:43,809

so I'm gonna do that I supposed to end
