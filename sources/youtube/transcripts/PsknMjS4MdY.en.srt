you provide energy

200
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
you provide energy
 

201
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,469
you provide energy
because no energy

202
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
because no energy
 

203
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,189
because no energy
is defensive

204
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
is defensive

i have to establish that organization
 

223
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,070
i have to establish that organization
but there's a larger organization that i

224
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
but there's a larger organization that i
 

225
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,550
but there's a larger organization that i
have to stage and it still works off of

226
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
have to stage and it still works off of
 

227
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,390
have to stage and it still works off of
the center of periphery and silver i'm

228
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
the center of periphery and silver i'm
 

229
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,309
the center of periphery and silver i'm
so also

230
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
so also
 

231
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,309

233
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,469
it still works off the light and dark it
still works off the light of defense and

i have that center connection

240
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
i have that center connection
 

241
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,870
i have that center connection
in my hands

242
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
in my hands
 

243
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,350
in my hands
so when i come through don't move

244
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
so when i come through don't move
 

245
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,230
so when i come through don't move
and i do my technique

246
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
and i do my technique
 

247
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,750
and i do my technique
i have i touch that spinal displacement

248
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
i have i touch that spinal displacement
 

249
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,829
i have i touch that spinal displacement
okay

250
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
okay
 

251

254
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279
doing it
 

255
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,949
doing it
well my house touched

256
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
well my house touched
 

257
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,630
well my house touched
my hands touch goes right into the

258
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
my hands touch goes right into the
 

259
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,470
my hands touch goes right into the
center

260
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
center
 

261
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,110
center
because it's in my center okay because

262
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
because it's in my center okay because
 

263
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,070
because it's in my center okay because
my

264
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
my
 

265
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,110
my
weight

266
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
weight
 

267
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,630

the energy is on my foot vector

268
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
the energy is on my foot vector
 

269
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,430
the energy is on my foot vector
which is in his foot vector okay

270
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
which is in his foot vector okay
 

271
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,550
which is in his foot vector okay
so

272
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
so
 

273
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,710
so
uh

274
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
uh
 

275
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,430
uh
how can he come in and strike when i'm

276
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
how can he come in and strike when i'm
 

277
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,710
how can he come in and strike when i'm
touching him like that do you see so

278
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
touching him like that do you see so
 

279
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,710
touching him like that do you see so
like he can't so let's say he makes his

280
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
like he can't so let's say he makes his
 

281
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,949
like he can't so let's say he makes his
arm really relaxed it doesn't matter

282
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959

 

283
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,430

so he feels that

284
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
so he feels that
 

285
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,470
so he feels that
so you can't just kick or hit

286
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
so you can't just kick or hit
 

287
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,590
so you can't just kick or hit
he's gonna

288
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
he's gonna
 

289
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,389
he's gonna
uh

290
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
uh
 

291
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,990
uh
use that energy against me okay got it

292
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
use that energy against me okay got it
 

293
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,710
use that energy against me okay got it
so when he feels the projection that's

294
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
so when he feels the projection that's
 

295
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,990
so when he feels the projection that's
where his yield goes right but i'm back

296
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
where his yield goes right but i'm back
 

297
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:59,890
where his yield goes right but i'm back
in his feet

298
00:09:59,890 --> 00:09:59,900

i'm in his body

304
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
i'm in his body
 

305
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,389
i'm in his body
right from this touch

306
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
right from this touch
 

307
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,949

this touch is in his body
 

309
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,910
this touch is in his body
well it's not that i'm leaning on him

310
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
well it's not that i'm leaning on him
 

311
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,630
well it's not that i'm leaning on him
it's just at this point where i touch

312
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
it's just at this point where i touch
 

313
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,389
it's just at this point where i touch
is in his body okay so if he goes to

314
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
is in his body okay so if he goes to
 

315
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,750
is in his body okay so if he goes to
strike

316
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
strike
 

317
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,790
strike
right he can't come forward right

318
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
right he can't come forward right
 

319
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,990
right he can't come forward right
he goes to strike i'll feel the energy

320
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
he goes to strike i'll feel the energy
 

321
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,389
he goes to strike i'll feel the energy
i'll feel that in space go to stride and

322
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
i'll feel that in space go to stride and
 

323
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,069
i'll feel that in space go to stride and
i feel the space

324
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
i feel the space
 

325
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:38,550
i feel the space
you see and then i'm in

326
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560

 

327
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,630

he'll feel preoccupied

328
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640

 

329
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,470

so he has to carry the energy around oh

330
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
so he has to carry the energy around oh
 

331
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,230
so he has to carry the energy around oh
you see stay there

332
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
you see stay there
 

333
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,590
you see stay there
but if i again go weak

334
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
but if i again go weak
 

335
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,110
but if i again go weak
right which is

336
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
right which is
 

337
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,509
right which is
maximized by letting go you're free

338
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
maximized by letting go you're free
 

339
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,710
maximized by letting go you're free
again do you feel that

340
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720

 

341
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,470

do me your hands

342
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
do me your hands
 

343
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,670
do me your hands
right

344
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
right
 

345
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,230
right
and my center is in my hands it's in his

346
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
and my center is in my hands it's in his
 

347
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,790
and my center is in my hands it's in his
ground power again so if he goes to

348
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
ground power again so if he goes to
 

349
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,269
ground power again so if he goes to
strike i'll feel it again

350
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
strike i'll feel it again
 

351
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,590
strike i'll feel it again
i'll feel it again

352
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
i'll feel it again
 

353
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,430
i'll feel it again
okay

354
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440

 

355
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,550

so i preoccupied him and hence

356
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
so i preoccupied him and hence
 

357
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,910
so i preoccupied him and hence
he has

358
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
he has
 

359
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:31,910
he has
his throat

360
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920

 

361
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,630

which is different from this

362
