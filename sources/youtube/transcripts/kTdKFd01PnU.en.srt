arch kick in
 

147
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,030
arch kick in
okay now we'll do it with the grip with

148
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
okay now we'll do it with the grip with
 

149
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,869
okay now we'll do it with the grip with
a little less pressure

150
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
a little less pressure
 

151
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,390

okay
let's pay attention to that lead

390
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,440
let's pay attention to that lead
 

391
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,790
let's pay attention to that lead
shoulder go

392
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
shoulder go
 

393
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,870
shoulder go
so we know

394
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
so we know
 

395
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,710
so we know
bring them past you

396
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:32,720
bring them past you
 

397
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,750
bring them past you
and then

398
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
and then
 

399
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,910
and then
enter on the turn so your shoulder

400
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
enter on the turn so your shoulder
 

401
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,070
enter on the turn so your shoulder
starts to get here

402
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
starts to get here
 

403
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,030
starts to get here
right

404
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
right
 

405
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,829
right
and

406
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:39,839
and
 

407
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,590
and
first i'm going to do the pull so you

408
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600
first i'm going to do the pull so you
 

409
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,269
first i'm going to do the pull so you
understand what i'm doing feel it in

410
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
understand what i'm doing feel it in
 

411
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,870

your fingertips okay

412
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880

 

413
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,990

you feel that pull okay

414
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
you feel that pull okay
 

415
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,790
you feel that pull okay
and then next i'm going to do the twist

416
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
and then next i'm going to do the twist
 

417
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,710
and then next i'm going to do the twist
that some of you are doing

418
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720

 

419
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,070

you see that and then

420
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
you see that and then
 

421
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,269
you see that and then
okay

422
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
okay
 

423
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,030
okay
that means your four corners are not

424
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
that means your four corners are not
 

425
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,269
that means your four corners are not
organized okay

426
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
organized okay
 

427
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,550
organized okay
so

428
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
so
 

429
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,150
so
why does it happen

430
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
why does it happen
 

431
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,350
why does it happen
okay let me use tristan so you can watch

432
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
okay let me use tristan so you can watch
 

433
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,910
okay let me use tristan so you can watch
it

434
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920

 

435
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,670

did you all feel it

436
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
did you all feel it
 

437
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,389
did you all feel it
it happens because

438
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
it happens because
 

439
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,430
it happens because
when you're entering

440
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
when you're entering
 

441
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,949
when you're entering
you are double pivoting when you turn

442
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
you are double pivoting when you turn
 

443
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,350
you are double pivoting when you turn
or you're putting your foot here

444
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
or you're putting your foot here
 

445
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,230
or you're putting your foot here
and your two feet are turning

446
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
and your two feet are turning
 

447
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,430
and your two feet are turning
like this

448
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
like this
 

449
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,630
like this
you see

450
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
you see
 

451
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,069
you see
and now

452
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
and now
 

453
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,389
and now
your axis of rotation

454
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
your axis of rotation
 

455
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,710
your axis of rotation
is actually over here

456
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
is actually over here
 

457
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,350
is actually over here
and it's not where the shoulder is so

458
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
and it's not where the shoulder is so
 

459
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,310
and it's not where the shoulder is so
your axis of rotation is actually in

460
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
your axis of rotation is actually in
 

461
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,590
your axis of rotation is actually in
front of him

462
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
front of him
 

463
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,670
front of him
do you understand that

464
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
do you understand that
 

465
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,630
do you understand that

469
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,310

and that would have been like not in

470
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
and that would have been like not in
 

471

enter you won't notice it but when you
 

477
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,990
enter you won't notice it but when you
start turning it starts falling apart

478
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
start turning it starts falling apart
 

479
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,190

so
 

483
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,030
so
we'll go at this angle please over here

484
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
we'll go at this angle please over here
 

485
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,389
we'll go at this angle please over here
he comes in i go to my yawn state in the

486
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
he comes in i go to my yawn state in the
 

487
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,990
he comes in i go to my yawn state in the
rotation

488
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
rotation
 

489
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,949
rotation
and it's from that young state

490
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
and it's from that young state
 

491
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,190
and it's from that young state
that this foot is not uh double weighted

492
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
that this foot is not uh double weighted
 

493
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,509
that this foot is not uh double weighted
it's a single weighted foot until i come

494
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
it's a single weighted foot until i come
 

495
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,590
it's a single weighted foot until i come
back onto it and go to a young state in

496
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
back onto it and go to a young state in
 

497
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,990
back onto it and go to a young state in
this foot this means my knees are over

498
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
this foot this means my knees are over
 

499
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,509
this foot this means my knees are over
my toes you see so we'll just stay there

500
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
my toes you see so we'll just stay there
 

501
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,949
my toes you see so we'll just stay there
i'm going to go

502
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
i'm going to go
 

503
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,470
i'm going to go
one

504
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
one
 

505
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,150
one
and two and the rotation is on that foot

506
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
and two and the rotation is on that foot
 

507
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,710
and two and the rotation is on that foot
now not between the two feet okay

508
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720

 

509
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,990

so

510
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
so
 

511
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,550
so
yawn

512
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
yawn
 

513
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,150
yawn
insert

514
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
insert
 

515
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:58,949
insert
and yawn again on that one foot

516
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959

 

517
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,389

enter

518
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
enter
 

519
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,590
enter
and yawn all the way onto that foot so

520
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
and yawn all the way onto that foot so
 

521
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,230
and yawn all the way onto that foot so
you have a single pivot point on that

522
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
you have a single pivot point on that
 

523
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:17,990
you have a single pivot point on that
