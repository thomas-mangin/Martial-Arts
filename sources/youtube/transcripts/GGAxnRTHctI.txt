is on your shoulder

this
[Music]
relax
okay get it in the right place
hug yourself
and bow
put my hand against your head okay
here here right
here
there it is
move your body that way if you want your
hands to face put your body
there it is don't push on me because i'm
stronger than you
stay outside stay outside at the
energetic
limits and guide that limit
down that's it around here i go down
in place time time see how it's not
tight
tight to you type to you
no get your posture
get your posture put my elbow on the
front hemisphere
stop i'm gonna move i'm gonna help you
please over here keep this up
to you you moved yourself back
all right let's try your way go so
what's happening not enough leverage
so stay still i'm going to move myself
into the right place here
see my elbow there cut it elbow
there now get your posture so my hand is
off my back
don't pull me up just hug it to your
posture
my elbows against your body now move my
elbow
so my shoulder mechanism goes down into
the mat not around my shoulders
there you go
what was that
okay so you have the guy down
and you're not you're not trying to uh
dislocate his arm
you're trying to pin this corner trying
to put
pressure weight energy there
so when you get here
don't try to turn his arm he's he's much
stronger than me
don't let me turn your arm
it's not going to happen okay just
straighten your arm if you want
straighten it
straighten it up do you see okay
also my
[Music]
tai sabaki my body work should be
redundant with my tessabaki
which means i can take one away and
still have the same
outcome if i if i'm here like this
and i take away my tesabaki you don't
have the same outcome
okay so this elbow goes here
in front of my hemisphere my front
hemisphere
to the left in this case of my spine
and i'm not trying to bend his arm i'm
trying to use
we didn't get on me you can tap when you
want
to push this whole shoulder mechanism
down into the mat the reason i'm holding
his arms is
so that the body can do its job okay
it's redundant with what the body
is doing but you can see you don't need
you don't need that okay
but over here you do need it over here
you're very arm dependent
in a in a place from which your arms are
very
much at a mechanical disadvantage okay
so the elbow goes on the front
and my goal is through this leverage
system
to push the whole shoulder mechanism
down boom okay
not to turn him don't lower the hand
because that's the opposite
there's less pressure on your shoulder
isn't it you got to keep the hand where
it is
oh if you lower the hand again you see i
don't have it i don't have it
the hand has to be at this angle so that
my body could have done it by itself
and i'm here
so the goal is shoulder mechanism be
pressed into the mat
not trying to do some sort of
elbow lock or some sort of pain
compliance okay
