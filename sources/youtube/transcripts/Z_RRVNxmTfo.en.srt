1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,309

so we had a question on we will use it

2
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
so we had a question on we will use it
 

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,150
so we had a question on we will use it
to explain more to you from Five Points

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
to explain more to you from Five Points
 

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,890
to explain more to you from Five Points
of

6
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:09,900
of
 

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,850
of
the tactics involved in Ikea's growth

8
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:13,860
the tactics involved in Ikea's growth
 

9
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,990
the tactics involved in Ikea's growth
okay

10
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,000
okay
 

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,490
okay
so you have what we would do as chemo

12
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:19,500
so you have what we would do as chemo
 

13
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,470
so you have what we would do as chemo
okay

14
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480

 

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,470

and it kind of misleads you

16
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:27,480
and it kind of misleads you
 

17
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,929
and it kind of misleads you
if you make the mistake that that's how

18
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:29,939
if you make the mistake that that's how
 

19
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,630
if you make the mistake that that's how
the technique shows up tastic that's a

20
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,640
the technique shows up tastic that's a
 

21
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,810
the technique shows up tastic that's a
kihon Wasa okay it's like a coded

22
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:35,820
kihon Wasa okay it's like a coded
 

23
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,049
kihon Wasa okay it's like a coded
message for all kinds of things

24
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:39,059
message for all kinds of things
 

25
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,630
message for all kinds of things
um but it's taxable application is not

26
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
um but it's taxable application is not
 

27
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,110
um but it's taxable application is not
a one-to-one code you gotta look deeper

28
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,120
a one-to-one code you gotta look deeper
 

29
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,389
a one-to-one code you gotta look deeper
than that okay

30
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
than that okay
 

31
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,650
than that okay
um

32
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:51,660
um
 

33
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,630
um
so where does it show up uh we'll do it

34
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
so where does it show up uh we'll do it
 

35
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,910
so where does it show up uh we'll do it
first from

36
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
first from
 

37
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,010
first from
uh real estate Duty okay so let's say

38
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:01,020
uh real estate Duty okay so let's say
 

39
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,070
uh real estate Duty okay so let's say
I'm going to throw into the front

40
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
I'm going to throw into the front
 

41
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,390
I'm going to throw into the front
kazushi the front inward kazushi okay

42
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
kazushi the front inward kazushi okay
 

43
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,590
kazushi the front inward kazushi okay
and the guy

44
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
and the guy
 

45
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,929
and the guy
really hangs on to his balance okay now

46
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:14,939
really hangs on to his balance okay now
 

47
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,310
really hangs on to his balance okay now
stay there

48
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
stay there
 

49
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,429
stay there
the the energy of the throw is going

50
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
the the energy of the throw is going
 

51
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,870
the the energy of the throw is going
this way

52
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
this way
 

53
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,310
this way
okay

54
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
okay
 

55
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,570
okay
and what ends up happening and we not

56
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:26,580
and what ends up happening and we not
 

57
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,330
and what ends up happening and we not
only does his body

58
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:28,340
only does his body
 

59
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,850
only does his body
uh is going to spin on that centrifugal

60
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:31,860
uh is going to spin on that centrifugal
 

61
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,630
uh is going to spin on that centrifugal
energy

62
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
energy
 

63
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,770
energy
but just his body alone the way that his

64
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:36,780
but just his body alone the way that his
 

65
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,830
but just his body alone the way that his
mass is set up if he takes that hand off

66
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
mass is set up if he takes that hand off
 

67
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,830
mass is set up if he takes that hand off
the ground uh don't try not to roll try

68
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:42,840
the ground uh don't try not to roll try
 

69
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,770
the ground uh don't try not to roll try
to stay in place and leave your leg high

70
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:45,780
to stay in place and leave your leg high
 

71
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,249
to stay in place and leave your leg high
and you'll see don't follow what you'll

72
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:49,259
and you'll see don't follow what you'll
 

73
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,289
and you'll see don't follow what you'll
see that that leg is gonna is gonna

74
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:51,299
see that that leg is gonna is gonna
 

75
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,270
see that that leg is gonna is gonna
start to eventually spin out if you need

76
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
start to eventually spin out if you need
 

77
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,609
start to eventually spin out if you need
to use me for some base but don't hold

78
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:55,619
to use me for some base but don't hold
 

79
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,310
to use me for some base but don't hold
on yeah you see that leg starts to go

80
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
on yeah you see that leg starts to go
 

81
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,010
on yeah you see that leg starts to go
that way okay and you can run that

82
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,020
that way okay and you can run that
 

83
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,410
that way okay and you can run that
experiment on your own you just you just

84
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:03,420
experiment on your own you just you just
 

85
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,630
experiment on your own you just you just
gets here and eventually that leg will

86
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,640
gets here and eventually that leg will
 

87
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,910
gets here and eventually that leg will
go down to the outside okay the way your

88
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
go down to the outside okay the way your
 

89
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,990
go down to the outside okay the way your
your mask is is in relation to its line

90
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,000
your mask is is in relation to its line
 

91
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,010
your mask is is in relation to its line
of gravity okay so uh a guy that is

92
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,020
of gravity okay so uh a guy that is
 

93
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,890
of gravity okay so uh a guy that is
trying to pull eventually that leg will

94
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:18,900
trying to pull eventually that leg will
 

95
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,550
trying to pull eventually that leg will
go out and it's gonna be kind of hard uh

96
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
go out and it's gonna be kind of hard uh
 

97
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,130
go out and it's gonna be kind of hard uh
to demonstrate but let's see what

98
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:25,140
to demonstrate but let's see what
 

99
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,890
to demonstrate but let's see what
happens in there so trying to resist to

100
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:27,900
happens in there so trying to resist to
 

101
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,390
happens in there so trying to resist to
throw as much as off that step okay

102
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
throw as much as off that step okay
 

103
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,630
throw as much as off that step okay
again

104
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:35,640

 

105
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,570

okay that's fine if you fall you fall

106
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:41,580

 

107
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,610

a little spin that he's doing you guys

108
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:43,620
a little spin that he's doing you guys
 

109
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,630
a little spin that he's doing you guys
see that okay

110
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
see that okay
 

111
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,150
see that okay
uh so imagine we'll slow down and we'll

112
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
uh so imagine we'll slow down and we'll
 

113
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,229
uh so imagine we'll slow down and we'll
start to see that so that when that leg

114
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
start to see that so that when that leg
 

115
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,630
start to see that so that when that leg
is gonna get around

116
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
is gonna get around
 

117
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,589
is gonna get around
so yeah it'll be like that okay it's not

118
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:00,599
so yeah it'll be like that okay it's not
 

119
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,390
so yeah it'll be like that okay it's not
going to be

120
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
going to be
 

121
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,210
going to be
in the front inward kazishi so I'll show

122
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:05,220
in the front inward kazishi so I'll show
 

123
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,630
in the front inward kazishi so I'll show
you if you pay attention it's going to

124
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
you if you pay attention it's going to
 

125
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,930
you if you pay attention it's going to
be on the back side

126
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:11,940
be on the back side
 

127
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,610
be on the back side
of that leg okay you understand and all

128
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:16,620
of that leg okay you understand and all
 

129
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,610
of that leg okay you understand and all
you got to do is Chuck someone and there

130
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:19,620
you got to do is Chuck someone and there
 

131
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,670
you got to do is Chuck someone and there
it is every time so it's where for

132
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:22,680
it is every time so it's where for
 

133
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,190
it is every time so it's where for
example

134
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200

 

135
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,670

we're in that same place okay

136
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:28,680
we're in that same place okay
 

137
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,750
we're in that same place okay
um

138
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
um
 

139
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,729
um
huh

140
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:31,739
huh
 

141
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,490
huh
all right let's let's get there all

142
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:34,500
all right let's let's get there all
 

143
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:41,170
all right let's let's get there all
right

144
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:41,180

 

145
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,229

I don't understand let's look at it just

146
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:45,239
I don't understand let's look at it just
 

147
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,729
I don't understand let's look at it just
G uh geometrically so uh the guys coming

148
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:49,739
G uh geometrically so uh the guys coming
 

149
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,610
G uh geometrically so uh the guys coming
in and then we're trying for that and

150
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:52,620
in and then we're trying for that and
 

151
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,630
in and then we're trying for that and
then what he does is he goes ahead and

152
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:55,640
then what he does is he goes ahead and
 

153
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,869
then what he does is he goes ahead and
sacrifices this balance position okay he

154
00:03:59,869 --> 00:03:59,879
sacrifices this balance position okay he
 

155
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,410
sacrifices this balance position okay he
in essence he's going with the energy

156
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:03,420
in essence he's going with the energy
 

157
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,070
in essence he's going with the energy
you see that's what he's doing and so if

158
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,080
you see that's what he's doing and so if
 

159
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,030
you see that's what he's doing and so if
you look for uh where it tends to come

160
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
you look for uh where it tends to come
 

161
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,030
you look for uh where it tends to come
off is uh you were trying to do a

162
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,040
off is uh you were trying to do a
 

163
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,490
off is uh you were trying to do a
momentum throw

164
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:15,500
momentum throw
 

165
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,189
momentum throw
and the guy does not fall off they

166
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
and the guy does not fall off they
 

167
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,349
and the guy does not fall off they
regain their balance okay and you you

168
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
regain their balance okay and you you
 

169
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,969
regain their balance okay and you you
held on to their arm or something like

170
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:22,979
held on to their arm or something like
 

171
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,730
held on to their arm or something like
that so if you pay attention like in in

172
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:25,740
that so if you pay attention like in in
 

173
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,670
that so if you pay attention like in in
this version we come around here

174
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:28,680
this version we come around here
 

175
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,070
this version we come around here
he's doing the same thing

176
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,080
he's doing the same thing
 

177
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,129
he's doing the same thing
you're in that key moment okay or even

178
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:34,139
you're in that key moment okay or even
 

179
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,850
you're in that key moment okay or even
in the basic he hon when when you come

180
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:37,860
in the basic he hon when when you come
 

181
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,870
in the basic he hon when when you come
around like that right uh from where I'm

182
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:41,880
around like that right uh from where I'm
 

183
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,650
around like that right uh from where I'm
at he's it say then his stance is in

184
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:45,660
at he's it say then his stance is in
 

185
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,670
at he's it say then his stance is in
that same thing that leg is behind the

186
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
that same thing that leg is behind the
 

187
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,070
that same thing that leg is behind the
front leg and you see the sweep is

188
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,080

 

189
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,810

stay home
that leg is it that back leg is in front

192
00:04:59,629 --> 00:04:59,639
that leg is it that back leg is in front
 

193
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,890
that leg is it that back leg is in front
of his leg

194
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:00,900
of his leg
 

195
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,990
of his leg
can you see that

196
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,000
can you see that
 

197
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,749
can you see that
can you see it all right okay but as

198
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
can you see it all right okay but as
 

199
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,810
can you see it all right okay but as
soon as I go like that there it is

200
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:08,820
soon as I go like that there it is
 

201
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,050
soon as I go like that there it is
so I'll show just to show you uh I'm

202
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,060
so I'll show just to show you uh I'm
 

203
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,150
so I'll show just to show you uh I'm
gonna move that leg back

204
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
gonna move that leg back
 

205
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,490
gonna move that leg back
okay and I slide them around and I

206
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:16,500
okay and I slide them around and I
 

207
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,469
okay and I slide them around and I
thought behind them do you see it moved

208
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
thought behind them do you see it moved
 

209
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,170
thought behind them do you see it moved
that way the keyhole is is doing that

210
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:21,180
that way the keyhole is is doing that
 

211
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,129
that way the keyhole is is doing that
same thing right from where I'm at

212
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:25,139
same thing right from where I'm at
 

213
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,310
same thing right from where I'm at
but what you want to know is when you're

214
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
but what you want to know is when you're
 

215
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,749
but what you want to know is when you're
doing front inward kazuki's a guy can

216
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:32,759
doing front inward kazuki's a guy can
 

217
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,189
doing front inward kazuki's a guy can
sacrifice

218
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:34,199
sacrifice
 

219
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,330
sacrifice
his orientation towards you and put get

that foot there
 

223
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,189
that foot there
okay you got it and it will come up more

224
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
okay you got it and it will come up more
 

225
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,990
okay you got it and it will come up more
than not in live situations where you

226
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
than not in live situations where you
 

227
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,950
than not in live situations where you
did a momentum from okay the way you get

228
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:51,960
did a momentum from okay the way you get

projection that foot does not get to

232
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,300
projection that foot does not get to
 

233
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,689
projection that foot does not get to
stay there you see that but in a

234
00:05:59,689 --> 00:05:59,699
stay there you see that but in a
 

235
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,210
stay there you see that but in a
momentum throat you go to do it and he

236
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:02,220
momentum throat you go to do it and he
 

237
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,290
momentum throat you go to do it and he
can do it

238
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:03,300
can do it
 

239
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,550
can do it
okay

240
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
okay
 

241
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,550
okay
in the projection throw that foot does

242
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:07,560
in the projection throw that foot does
 

243
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,890
in the projection throw that foot does
not

244
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:09,900

 

245
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,050

and that's why he can't counter that

246
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,060
and that's why he can't counter that
 

247
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,770
and that's why he can't counter that
throw okay but it happens a lot in live

248
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:15,780
throw okay but it happens a lot in live
 

249
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,770
throw okay but it happens a lot in live
situations uh especially if you don't

250
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:18,780
situations uh especially if you don't
 

251
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,450
situations uh especially if you don't
have the projection skills okay so uh

252
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:23,460
have the projection skills okay so uh
 

253
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,570
have the projection skills okay so uh
we're going here we'll do that momentum

254
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:26,580
we're going here we'll do that momentum
 

255
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,730
we're going here we'll do that momentum
throw and that's where it is

256
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:28,740
throw and that's where it is
 

257
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,450
throw and that's where it is
okay that's where your shimogan is

258
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:32,460
okay that's where your shimogan is
 

259
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,330
okay that's where your shimogan is
there's something to note though

260
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,340
there's something to note though
 

261
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,330
there's something to note though
uh in the keyhon

262
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:38,340
uh in the keyhon
 

263
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,390
uh in the keyhon
he's allowed to stay straight you see he

264
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:41,400
he's allowed to stay straight you see he
 

265
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,990
he's allowed to stay straight you see he
even if he turns a little he's pretty up

266
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000

 

267
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,730

um back here so we can keep the

268
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:49,740
um back here so we can keep the
 

269
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,409
um back here so we can keep the
orientation

270
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:51,419
orientation
 

271
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,189
orientation
if this stuff the more he tries to stay

272
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
if this stuff the more he tries to stay
 

273
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,390
if this stuff the more he tries to stay
up uh the harder he it would be able for

274
00:06:59,390 --> 00:06:59,400
up uh the harder he it would be able for
 

275
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,029
up uh the harder he it would be able for
him to do that

276
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:02,039
him to do that
 

277
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,490
him to do that
it's because this hand tends to cut down

278
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:04,500
it's because this hand tends to cut down
 

279
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,070
it's because this hand tends to cut down
so you're going and you're going to see

280
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,080
so you're going and you're going to see
 

281
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,050
so you're going and you're going to see
that his head is down when he does that

282
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:09,060
that his head is down when he does that
 

283
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,809
that his head is down when he does that
you see now it makes no sense and this

284
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:11,819
you see now it makes no sense and this
 

285
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,270
you see now it makes no sense and this
is the second thing it makes no sense to

286
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,280
is the second thing it makes no sense to
 

287
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,770
is the second thing it makes no sense to
bring them back up

288
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:15,780
bring them back up
 

289
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,730
bring them back up
okay

290
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:19,740

 

291
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,969

so we'll do the keyhon

292
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:22,979
so we'll do the keyhon
 

293
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,790
so we'll do the keyhon
and I'm going to set up that stance

294
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:25,800
and I'm going to set up that stance
 

295
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,070
and I'm going to set up that stance
there it is okay

296
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
there it is okay
 

297
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,650
there it is okay
and in the keyhorn you kind of do bring

298
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:30,660
and in the keyhorn you kind of do bring
 

299
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,930
and in the keyhorn you kind of do bring
him up

300
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:32,940
him up
 

301
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,330
him up
but we want to pay attention to

302
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,340
but we want to pay attention to
 

303
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,230
but we want to pay attention to
something in the keyhon that helps

304
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:39,240
something in the keyhon that helps
 

305
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,330
something in the keyhon that helps
a little bit more

306
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:41,340
a little bit more
 

307
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,350
a little bit more
okay I am going to not

308
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
okay I am going to not
 

309
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:52,490
okay I am going to not
turn

310
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:52,500

 

311
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,730

I'm going to come across

312
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:58,740

 

313
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,129

I'll do those two versions

314
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:01,139
I'll do those two versions
 

315
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,290
I'll do those two versions
okay

316
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:03,300
okay
 

317
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,350
okay
I'll just keep it with the motel so mote

318
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:06,360
I'll just keep it with the motel so mote
 

319
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,589
I'll just keep it with the motel so mote
I go in then I turn

320
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
I go in then I turn
 

321
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,170
I go in then I turn
and then I enter again

322
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:12,180
and then I enter again
 

323
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,450
and then I enter again
when I want you to understand

324
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:14,460
when I want you to understand
 

325
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,189
when I want you to understand
is where

326
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:16,199
is where
 

327
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,689
is where
I keep my Center this way I step across

328
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:20,699
I keep my Center this way I step across
 

329
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,189
I keep my Center this way I step across
there it is

330
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199

 

331
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,309

same beginning but I step across there

332
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
same beginning but I step across there
 

333
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,409
same beginning but I step across there
it is

334
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:30,419
it is
 

335
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,870
it is
there's no turn can you see that I'll do

336
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
there's no turn can you see that I'll do
 

337
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,370
there's no turn can you see that I'll do
the other one

338
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:34,380
the other one
 

339
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,269
the other one
enter turn there's none of that

340
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:38,279
enter turn there's none of that
 

341
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,449
enter turn there's none of that
in case I have in front of you boom it's

342
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:41,459
in case I have in front of you boom it's
 

343
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:43,490
in case I have in front of you boom it's
right there

344
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:43,500
right there
 

345
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,190
right there
okay let's get there so we have all

346
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,200
okay let's get there so we have all
 

347
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,650
okay let's get there so we have all
those other videos I'm not gonna go into

348
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:48,660
those other videos I'm not gonna go into
 

349
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,590
those other videos I'm not gonna go into
the like the grip game okay I'll just

350
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
the like the grip game okay I'll just
 

351
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,350
the like the grip game okay I'll just
quickly say here Yoshino Naga is not on

352
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:54,360
quickly say here Yoshino Naga is not on
 

353
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,990
quickly say here Yoshino Naga is not on
the forearm it doesn't work because you

354
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,000
the forearm it doesn't work because you
 

355
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,449
the forearm it doesn't work because you
do not have the mechanical advantage

356
00:08:59,449 --> 00:08:59,459
do not have the mechanical advantage
 

357
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,509
do not have the mechanical advantage
don't hurt me uh he has the mechanical

358
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:02,519
don't hurt me uh he has the mechanical
 

359
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,730
don't hurt me uh he has the mechanical
advantage okay

360
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:04,740
advantage okay
 

361
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,550
advantage okay
um he can just pull down on his elbow

362
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:07,560
um he can just pull down on his elbow
 

363
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,090
um he can just pull down on his elbow
and I can never hold that okay but once

364
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:11,100
and I can never hold that okay but once
 

365
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,329
and I can never hold that okay but once
I get to the wrist do you see and I turn

366
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:14,339
I get to the wrist do you see and I turn
 

367
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,389
I get to the wrist do you see and I turn
that more and now he does not have a

368
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:17,399
that more and now he does not have a
 

369
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,250
that more and now he does not have a
mechanical advantage because the smaller

370
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:19,260
mechanical advantage because the smaller
 

371
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,790
mechanical advantage because the smaller
joint is working against him so uh if we

372
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
joint is working against him so uh if we
 

373
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,430
joint is working against him so uh if we
you could even have them higher as he

374
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
you could even have them higher as he
 

375
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,110
you could even have them higher as he
tries to pull his elbow it makes his

376
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
tries to pull his elbow it makes his
 

377
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,610
tries to pull his elbow it makes his
balance go because it goes into his

378
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:28,620
balance go because it goes into his
 

379
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,130
balance go because it goes into his
wrist so you cannot do it here you

380
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,140
wrist so you cannot do it here you
 

381
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,870
wrist so you cannot do it here you
should never do it here this is you're

382
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
should never do it here this is you're
 

383
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,090
should never do it here this is you're
you're fooling yourself okay I don't

384
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:35,100
you're fooling yourself okay I don't
 

385
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,250
you're fooling yourself okay I don't
care how high it is put your elbow

386
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:37,260
care how high it is put your elbow
 

387
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,530
care how high it is put your elbow
really high it's you don't have the

388
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:39,540
really high it's you don't have the
 

389
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,329
really high it's you don't have the
leverager he's basically doing a thumb

390
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:41,339
leverager he's basically doing a thumb
 

391
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,030
leverager he's basically doing a thumb
lock on you which is why in similar

392
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,040
lock on you which is why in similar
 

393
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,370
lock on you which is why in similar
situations in your nawaza this would be

394
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:46,380
situations in your nawaza this would be
 

395
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,410
situations in your nawaza this would be
thumbless grip so you don't expose the

396
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:48,420
thumbless grip so you don't expose the
 

397
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,630
thumbless grip so you don't expose the
thumb to it okay

398
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
thumb to it okay
 

399
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,470

um

400
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480

 

401
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,930

going on

402
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:56,940
going on
 

403
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,449
going on
why

404
00:09:59,449 --> 00:09:59,459
why
 

405
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,930
why
don't we want him standing like that

406
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:02,940
don't we want him standing like that
 

407
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,769
don't we want him standing like that
you see this is upright or I get in

408
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:06,779
you see this is upright or I get in
 

409
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,370
you see this is upright or I get in
slightly tilted and then I come around

410
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:10,380
slightly tilted and then I come around
 

411
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,870
slightly tilted and then I come around
and he stands up again there do you see

412
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
and he stands up again there do you see
 

413
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,769
and he stands up again there do you see
do you see that okay

414
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:18,779

 

415
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,949

um well let's go back to where it tends

416
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:21,959
um well let's go back to where it tends
 

417
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,170
um well let's go back to where it tends
to open up you tried the front inward

418
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:24,180
to open up you tried the front inward
 

419
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,310
to open up you tried the front inward
because you see is not in that position

420
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320

off do it do you see and he would have

474
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:45,300
off do it do you see and he would have
 

475
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,710
off do it do you see and he would have
to turn to put it back on

to turn to put it back on
 

477
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,530
to turn to put it back on
he'll put it back on you see

he'll put it back on you see
 

479
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,650
he'll put it back on you see
but what can I do so he tries to put it

481
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,590

00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:25,079
inertial path you can't reverse it do
 

499
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,310
inertial path you can't reverse it do
you get that okay so

500
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
you get that okay so
 

501
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,710
you get that okay so
the only way I keep them tracking the

502
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
the only way I keep them tracking the
 

503
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,389
the only way I keep them tracking the
inertial path is not let them Bop off

504
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:35,399
inertial path is not let them Bop off
 

505
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,490
inertial path is not let them Bop off
that's taking them out of the inertial

506
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:37,500
that's taking them out of the inertial
 

507
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,269
that's taking them out of the inertial
path and now he has full mobility and

508
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
path and now he has full mobility and
 

509
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,550
path and now he has full mobility and
the joint The Joint lock or the joint

510
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:43,560
the joint The Joint lock or the joint
 

511
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,690
the joint The Joint lock or the joint
manipulation will not work so we go and

512
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:47,700
manipulation will not work so we go and
 

513
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,449
manipulation will not work so we go and
as long as I keep my feet here go and he

514
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:50,459
as long as I keep my feet here go and he
 

515
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,310
as long as I keep my feet here go and he
does she who knock it it is going to

516
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
does she who knock it it is going to
 

517
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,170
does she who knock it it is going to
work that leverage thing that I just

518
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:54,180
work that leverage thing that I just
 

519
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,210
work that leverage thing that I just
told you is going to work okay

520
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,220

 

521
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,389

but if I move my feet

522
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
but if I move my feet
 

523
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,990
but if I move my feet
even when he's here you see and I moved

524
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
even when he's here you see and I moved
 

525
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,170
even when he's here you see and I moved
to here it's not going to work now so

526
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:09,180
to here it's not going to work now so
 

527
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,210
to here it's not going to work now so
even that handle hand leverage thing

528
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:11,220
even that handle hand leverage thing
 

529
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,090
even that handle hand leverage thing
right if I just keep moving my feet it

530
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,100
right if I just keep moving my feet it
 

531
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,530
right if I just keep moving my feet it
won't work

532
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:15,540
won't work
 

533
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,370
won't work
so my body has to be preoccupied

534
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:19,380
so my body has to be preoccupied
 

535
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,310
so my body has to be preoccupied
and it can't be straight up because then

536
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
and it can't be straight up because then
 

537
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,710
and it can't be straight up because then
it is Back in Balance it now has

538
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
it is Back in Balance it now has
 

539
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,949
it is Back in Balance it now has
Mobility do you get that and the

540
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:27,959
Mobility do you get that and the
 

541
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,710
Mobility do you get that and the
resisting person will not be there okay

542
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
resisting person will not be there okay
 

543
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,750
resisting person will not be there okay
so

544
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:32,760
so
 

545
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,269
so
when you come into this technique this

546
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
when you come into this technique this
 

547
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,910
when you come into this technique this
little tilt that I have in the keyhorn I

548
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
little tilt that I have in the keyhorn I
 

549
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,710
little tilt that I have in the keyhorn I
am going to keep

550
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:39,720
am going to keep
 

551
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,470
am going to keep
like when you keep that tilt look try to

552
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
like when you keep that tilt look try to
 

553
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,389
like when you keep that tilt look try to
see where his body is

554
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
see where his body is
 

555
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,470
see where his body is
his body's going this way

556
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480

 

557
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,129

okay so I'm gonna move myself

558
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:52,139
okay so I'm gonna move myself
 

559
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,310
okay so I'm gonna move myself
so that it will will make okay keep

560
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:55,320
so that it will will make okay keep
 

561
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,710
so that it will will make okay keep
going that way I'm gonna move myself so

562
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:57,720
going that way I'm gonna move myself so
 

563
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,870
going that way I'm gonna move myself so
that I catch

564
00:13:59,870 --> 00:13:59,880
that I catch
 

565
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,949
that I catch
there okay where is there

566
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:03,959
there okay where is there
 

567
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:08,150
there okay where is there
there is that sweet spot he goes

568
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
there is that sweet spot he goes
 

569
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,730
there is that sweet spot he goes
where your compliant UK did not move

570
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:10,740
where your compliant UK did not move
 

571
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,650
where your compliant UK did not move
their feet do you see that if you get

572
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:12,660
their feet do you see that if you get
 

573
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,769
their feet do you see that if you get
shihonage and I don't move my feet he's

574
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:15,779
shihonage and I don't move my feet he's
 

575
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,910
shihonage and I don't move my feet he's
got you okay butterfly he doesn't have

576
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
got you okay butterfly he doesn't have
 

577
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,370
got you okay butterfly he doesn't have
me anymore so you have to replicate that

578
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:22,380
me anymore so you have to replicate that
 

579
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,310
me anymore so you have to replicate that
but now in motion so you have to kind of

580
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:25,320
but now in motion so you have to kind of
 

581
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,569
but now in motion so you have to kind of
think

582
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:26,579
think
 

583
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,850
think
he's going this way

584
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:28,860
he's going this way
 

585
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,250
he's going this way
he's gonna round me

586
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:31,260
he's gonna round me
 

587
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,410
he's gonna round me
so I move

588
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:33,420
so I move
 

589
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,370
so I move
so I catch him there

590
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:36,380
so I catch him there
 

591
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,389
so I catch him there
[Music]

592
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399

 

593
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,430

and roll

594
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:46,440

 

595
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,030

another way of looking at it

596
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,040
another way of looking at it
 

597
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,930
another way of looking at it
he stays in that tilt

598
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:53,940
he stays in that tilt
 

599
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,569
he stays in that tilt
I don't stand back around

600
00:14:59,569 --> 00:14:59,579

 

601
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:03,350

he's going to stay in the time

602
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
he's going to stay in the time
 

603
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,610
he's going to stay in the time
okay

604
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:04,620
okay
 

605
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,069
okay
let's try

606
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:07,079
let's try
 

607
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,150
let's try
some other things so beginner mistake is

608
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,160
some other things so beginner mistake is
 

609
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,810
some other things so beginner mistake is
you pick him up

610
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:14,820

 

611
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,970

beginner mistake

612
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:16,980
beginner mistake
 

613
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,490
beginner mistake
you're on this forearm beginner's that

614
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:19,500
you're on this forearm beginner's that
 

615
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,250
you're on this forearm beginner's that
doesn't work okay another beginner

616
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:22,260
doesn't work okay another beginner
 

617
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,250
doesn't work okay another beginner
mistake is uh his elbow is down

618
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:27,260
mistake is uh his elbow is down
 

619
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,210
mistake is uh his elbow is down
anywhere his elbow is not up okay

620
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:32,220
anywhere his elbow is not up okay
 

621
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,810
anywhere his elbow is not up okay
he has too much Leverage

622
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:35,820
he has too much Leverage
 

623
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,629
he has too much Leverage
I don't have any leverage even even if

624
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
I don't have any leverage even even if
 

625
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,810
I don't have any leverage even even if
I'm on the hand it's very difficult to

626
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:41,820
I'm on the hand it's very difficult to
 

627
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,829
I'm on the hand it's very difficult to
keep this leverage okay which is why if

628
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
keep this leverage okay which is why if
 

629
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,509
keep this leverage okay which is why if
he steps back

630
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
he steps back
 

631
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,210
he steps back
He's Able more to lower his elbow do you

632
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:50,220
He's Able more to lower his elbow do you
 

633
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,170
He's Able more to lower his elbow do you
see and I lose leverage as we go okay

634
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:54,180
see and I lose leverage as we go okay
 

635
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,990
see and I lose leverage as we go okay
it doesn't change if you put his elbow

636
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,000
it doesn't change if you put his elbow
 

637
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,069
it doesn't change if you put his elbow
here

638
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
here
 

639
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,930
here
you see you're on the side and you've

640
00:15:59,930 --> 00:15:59,940
you see you're on the side and you've
 

641
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,970
you see you're on the side and you've
had like some kind of shoulder elbow

642
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:01,980
had like some kind of shoulder elbow
 

643
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,370
had like some kind of shoulder elbow
lock it doesn't take much for him to

644
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:04,380
lock it doesn't take much for him to
 

645
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,189
lock it doesn't take much for him to
pull that don't hurt me again just

646
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199

his body has to be up the elbow has to

652
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:15,720
his body has to be up the elbow has to
 

653
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,170
his body has to be up the elbow has to
be up which means his Center has to be

654
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,180
be up which means his Center has to be
 

655
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,490
be up which means his Center has to be
forward okay you can't get his elbow up

656

forward okay you can't get his elbow up
 

657
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,310
forward okay you can't get his elbow up
with his centered knot forward which

658
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:25,320
with his centered knot forward which
 

659
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,650
with his centered knot forward which
won't happen when he's straight it's

660
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:27,660
won't happen when he's straight it's
 

661
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,170
won't happen when he's straight it's
parallel pretty much and it's very easy

662
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:30,180
parallel pretty much and it's very easy
 

663
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,970
parallel pretty much and it's very easy
for him to pull down you'll lose

664
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:31,980
for him to pull down you'll lose
 

665
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,370
for him to pull down you'll lose
leverage okay

666
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:34,380
leverage okay
 

667
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,370
leverage okay
so keep that all in mind as you're doing

668
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:37,380
so keep that all in mind as you're doing
 

669
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,509
so keep that all in mind as you're doing
the this again don't have his elbow look

670
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
the this again don't have his elbow look
 

671
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,790
the this again don't have his elbow look
it's parallel can you see from behind me

672
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:43,800
it's parallel can you see from behind me
 

673
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,590
it's parallel can you see from behind me
or no

674
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
or no
 

675
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,009
or no
no is it it's petalum that's not going

676
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:49,019
no is it it's petalum that's not going
 

677
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:52,910
no is it it's petalum that's not going
to work

678
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:52,920

 

679
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,910

so his elbow is gonna go up do you see

680
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
so his elbow is gonna go up do you see
 

681
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,769
so his elbow is gonna go up do you see
it going up

682
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:57,779
it going up
 

683
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,889
it going up
you see that

684
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:00,899

 

685
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,410

I I have the intention

686
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:03,420
I I have the intention
 

687
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:09,590
I I have the intention
of getting his elbow to go

688
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600

 

689
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,630

oh

690
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:11,640
oh
 

691
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,909
oh
okay

692
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:12,919
okay
 

693
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,030
okay
another beginner mistake is uh he's

694
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,040
another beginner mistake is uh he's
 

695
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,470
another beginner mistake is uh he's
gonna go

696
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
gonna go
 

697
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,189
gonna go
right and then yeah it's okay right and

698
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:22,199
right and then yeah it's okay right and
 

699
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,770
right and then yeah it's okay right and
then I turn I can turn like this you see

700
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:24,780
then I turn I can turn like this you see
 

701
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,449
then I turn I can turn like this you see
how my hips turn that way

702
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:26,459
how my hips turn that way
 

703
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,450
how my hips turn that way
you see that but in the technique is

704
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:29,460
you see that but in the technique is
 

705
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,030
you see that but in the technique is
which way were my hips going my hips

706
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,040
which way were my hips going my hips
 

707
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,010
which way were my hips going my hips
going this way do you understand

708
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,020

 

709
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,549

so usually the way that happens but you

710
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559
so usually the way that happens but you
 

711
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,390
so usually the way that happens but you
want to pay attention to it is uh you

712
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
want to pay attention to it is uh you
 

713
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,570
want to pay attention to it is uh you
are not controlling their center with it

714
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:47,580
are not controlling their center with it
 

715
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,750
are not controlling their center with it
being preoccupied on our inertial path

716
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
being preoccupied on our inertial path
 

717
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,990
being preoccupied on our inertial path
so uh maybe on your on your keyhan

718
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
so uh maybe on your on your keyhan
 

719
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,150
so uh maybe on your on your keyhan
they're just standing still do you see

720
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
they're just standing still do you see
 

721
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,010
they're just standing still do you see
and then you come around like that and

722
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,020
and then you come around like that and
 

723
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,570
and then you come around like that and
now he could turn into that and he could

724
00:17:59,570 --> 00:17:59,580
now he could turn into that and he could
 

725
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,549
now he could turn into that and he could
turn the hips into that technique and

726
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:01,559
turn the hips into that technique and
 

727
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,510
turn the hips into that technique and
take that front brake off or maybe you

728
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,520
take that front brake off or maybe you
 

729
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,510
take that front brake off or maybe you
did initially occupy their Center but

730
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:08,520
did initially occupy their Center but
 

731
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,789
did initially occupy their Center but
then you gave it back to him now you can

732
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799
then you gave it back to him now you can
 

733
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,529
then you gave it back to him now you can
turn into it you see so

734
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:14,539
turn into it you see so
 

735
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:17,870
turn into it you see so
his energy is going to be preoccupied

736
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:17,880
his energy is going to be preoccupied
 

737
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,970
his energy is going to be preoccupied
this way which would stop it from

738
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:19,980
this way which would stop it from
 

739
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,690
this way which would stop it from
turning this way okay but you can do

740
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:23,700
turning this way okay but you can do
 

741
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,850
turning this way okay but you can do
your lock in there in a way that you

742
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:25,860
your lock in there in a way that you
 

743
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,890
your lock in there in a way that you
actually have a lock this is where that

744
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:27,900
actually have a lock this is where that
 

745
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,470
actually have a lock this is where that
wrist comes in handy where the forearm

746
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
wrist comes in handy where the forearm
 

747
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,970
wrist comes in handy where the forearm
does not okay the the wrist stops him

748
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:34,980
does not okay the the wrist stops him
 

749
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,850
does not okay the the wrist stops him
from turning that way do you see that it

750
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:37,860
from turning that way do you see that it
 

751
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,350
from turning that way do you see that it
adds it adds a kind of contagiousness to

752
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:42,360
adds it adds a kind of contagiousness to
 

753
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,549
adds it adds a kind of contagiousness to
it okay and uh the more he tries to turn

754
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
it okay and uh the more he tries to turn
 

755
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,130
it okay and uh the more he tries to turn
his his that way it goes into the lock

756
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,140
his his that way it goes into the lock
 

757
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,110
his his that way it goes into the lock
okay

758
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
okay
 

759
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,169
okay
so as you're coming around again another

760
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:54,179
so as you're coming around again another
 

761
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:55,970
so as you're coming around again another
reason not to be on the forearm because

762
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:55,980
reason not to be on the forearm because
 

763
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,770
reason not to be on the forearm because
it won't allow you to control his hips

764
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:57,780
it won't allow you to control his hips
 

765
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,750
it won't allow you to control his hips
he can turn his hips and then he'll take

766
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
he can turn his hips and then he'll take
 

767
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,750
he can turn his hips and then he'll take
your beautiful front brake box

768
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:02,760
your beautiful front brake box
 

769
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,690
your beautiful front brake box
but the bad guy will escape the bad guy

770
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:05,700
but the bad guy will escape the bad guy
 

771
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,549
but the bad guy will escape the bad guy
will move their feet and pull their

772
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:07,559
will move their feet and pull their
 

773
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,710
will move their feet and pull their
elbow down and continue the attack okay

774
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:09,720
elbow down and continue the attack okay
 

775
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,870
elbow down and continue the attack okay
so you really want to right here you're

776
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:11,880
so you really want to right here you're
 

777
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,850
so you really want to right here you're
on the wrist already you already have a

778
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:13,860
on the wrist already you already have a
 

779
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,070
on the wrist already you already have a
photo as you see and that stops his

780
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
photo as you see and that stops his
 

781
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,710
photo as you see and that stops his
wrist from turning around from turning

782
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
wrist from turning around from turning
 

783
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,350
wrist from turning around from turning
his Center stop to the center

784
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
his Center stop to the center
 

785
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,870
his Center stop to the center
that gets that leg in the box and then

786
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:23,880
that gets that leg in the box and then
 

787
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,270
that gets that leg in the box and then
this this here stops in

788
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,280
this this here stops in
 

789
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:35,029
this this here stops in
uh turning in here

790
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039

 

791
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,750

okay so get on that risk another reason

792
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:37,760
okay so get on that risk another reason
 

793
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,770
okay so get on that risk another reason
I want to make sure that you understand

794
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:39,780
I want to make sure that you understand
 

795
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,730
I want to make sure that you understand
what happens if he does if he gives me

796
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:43,740
what happens if he does if he gives me
 

797
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,610
what happens if he does if he gives me
my center it's not occupied with the

798
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:46,620
my center it's not occupied with the
 

799
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,230
my center it's not occupied with the
inertial path going in the opposite

800
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
inertial path going in the opposite
 

801
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,789
inertial path going in the opposite
direction and if he does not have uh my

802
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
direction and if he does not have uh my
 

803
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,430
direction and if he does not have uh my
Center through where he's touching such

804
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,440
Center through where he's touching such
 

805
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,870
Center through where he's touching such
that

806
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880

 

807
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,409

I'm able to turn do you see for my nice

808
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:03,419
I'm able to turn do you see for my nice
 

809
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,070
I'm able to turn do you see for my nice
break fall of what when I said that the

810
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,080
break fall of what when I said that the
 

811
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,890
break fall of what when I said that the
bad guy would not be there what I mean

812
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:09,900
bad guy would not be there what I mean
 

813
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,350
bad guy would not be there what I mean
is since I have so much control in my

814
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:12,360
is since I have so much control in my
 

815
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,230
is since I have so much control in my
Center you see I could just continue my

816
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,240
Center you see I could just continue my
 

817
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,590
Center you see I could just continue my
attack because I'm gonna neutralize all

818
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:18,600
attack because I'm gonna neutralize all
 

819
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,650
attack because I'm gonna neutralize all
the joint control he has because I'm

820
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:21,660
the joint control he has because I'm
 

821
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,450
the joint control he has because I'm
moving those joints in space you

822
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:23,460
moving those joints in space you
 

823
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,310
moving those joints in space you
understand okay so let's go back uh to

824
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
understand okay so let's go back uh to
 

825
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,370
understand okay so let's go back uh to
generating that kind of new Cami you see

826
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:31,380
generating that kind of new Cami you see
