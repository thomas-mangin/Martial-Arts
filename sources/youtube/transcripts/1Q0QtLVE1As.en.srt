1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,829

all right uh I've been going on with the

2
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:04,839
all right uh I've been going on with the
 

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,789
all right uh I've been going on with the
the concept of anatomical positioning so

4
00:00:07,789 --> 00:00:07,799
the concept of anatomical positioning so
 

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,589
the concept of anatomical positioning so
and this is very important when I don't

6
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599
and this is very important when I don't
 

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,709
and this is very important when I don't
choreograph my UK then I have to make

8
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719
choreograph my UK then I have to make
 

9
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,230
choreograph my UK then I have to make
sure that I'm only moving them in a way

10
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
sure that I'm only moving them in a way
 

11
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,390
sure that I'm only moving them in a way
uh that is going to benefit my follow-up

12
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
uh that is going to benefit my follow-up
 

13
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,550
uh that is going to benefit my follow-up
movement to whatever movement I first

14
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
movement to whatever movement I first
 

15
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,070
movement to whatever movement I first
did okay I can't expect them to get uh

16
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080
did okay I can't expect them to get uh
 

17
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,589
did okay I can't expect them to get uh
into position for me uh so how I move

18
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
into position for me uh so how I move
 

19
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,470
into position for me uh so how I move
them is very very important um uh so

20
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
them is very very important um uh so
 

21
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,110
them is very very important um uh so
just to review yesterday I I watched the

22
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
just to review yesterday I I watched the
 

23
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,750
just to review yesterday I I watched the
video from last night it's not exactly

24
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
video from last night it's not exactly
 

25
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,270
video from last night it's not exactly
as clear as I was hoping it would be uh

26
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,280
as clear as I was hoping it would be uh
 

27
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,190
as clear as I was hoping it would be uh
we kind of did it at the tail end of

28
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,200
we kind of did it at the tail end of
 

29
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,350
we kind of did it at the tail end of
class uh but in short uh the concept

30
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:44,360
class uh but in short uh the concept
 

31
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,910
class uh but in short uh the concept
here is when I stay here with this

32
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
here is when I stay here with this
 

33
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,990
here is when I stay here with this
footwork and I come around for EO I'm

34
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000
footwork and I come around for EO I'm
 

35
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,830
footwork and I come around for EO I'm
not in the right place to get his body

36
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:56,840
not in the right place to get his body
 

37
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,990
not in the right place to get his body
into the positioning I'm too far

38
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,000
into the positioning I'm too far
 

39
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,910
into the positioning I'm too far
um

40
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:02,920
um
 

41
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,229
um
um how do I want to say it if the

42
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:05,239
um how do I want to say it if the
 

43
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,749
um how do I want to say it if the
technique kind of already passed me and

44
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:07,759
technique kind of already passed me and
 

45
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,429
technique kind of already passed me and
that's why he comes back to you so when

46
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
that's why he comes back to you so when
 

47
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,149
that's why he comes back to you so when
I step out to the side I start that the

48
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:17,159
I step out to the side I start that the
 

49
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,590
I step out to the side I start that the
inward spiral right as the shoulder

50
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:20,600
inward spiral right as the shoulder
 

51
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,950
inward spiral right as the shoulder
passes me not when it's already gone

52
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
passes me not when it's already gone
 

53
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,030
passes me not when it's already gone
past me so we'll kind of watch the

54
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
past me so we'll kind of watch the
 

55
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,030
past me so we'll kind of watch the
shoulder

56
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
shoulder
 

57
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,030
shoulder
uh would you get grab a Joe real quick

58
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
uh would you get grab a Joe real quick
 

59
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,469
uh would you get grab a Joe real quick
there's one right

60
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479

 

61
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,749

there okay so you're going to plot the

62
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
there okay so you're going to plot the
 

63
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,870
there okay so you're going to plot the
vertical plane of his shoulder okay so

64
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
vertical plane of his shoulder okay so
 

65
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,109
vertical plane of his shoulder okay so
when I bring him around this way and I

66
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
when I bring him around this way and I
 

67
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,709
when I bring him around this way and I
come over

68
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:48,719
come over
 

69
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,030
come over
here okay and here's where his shoulder

70
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,040
here okay and here's where his shoulder
 

71
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,550
here okay and here's where his shoulder
is it's way past me that vertical plane

72
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
is it's way past me that vertical plane
 

73
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,429
is it's way past me that vertical plane
so now when I bring this box this

74
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
so now when I bring this box this
 

75
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,830
so now when I bring this box this
shoulder has to come back towards me in

76
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
shoulder has to come back towards me in
 

77
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,709
shoulder has to come back towards me in
order for me to do

78
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:03,719
order for me to do
 

79
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,510
order for me to do
it that is all a result of me staying in

80
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:08,520
it that is all a result of me staying in
 

81
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,270
it that is all a result of me staying in
place if I move out and this fight now

82
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
place if I move out and this fight now
 

83
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,790
place if I move out and this fight now
begins to

84
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
begins to
 

85
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,990
begins to
rotate you'll see that his shoulder is

86
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,000
rotate you'll see that his shoulder is
 

87
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,229
rotate you'll see that his shoulder is
not yet past me use my spine as my

88
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:23,239
not yet past me use my spine as my
 

89
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:26,710
not yet past me use my spine as my
vertical plane but as his shoulder gets

90
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
vertical plane but as his shoulder gets
 

91
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,750
vertical plane but as his shoulder gets
to my spinal line that is where the

92
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:30,760
to my spinal line that is where the
 

93
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,990
to my spinal line that is where the
spiral takes over okay so because you're

94
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,000
spiral takes over okay so because you're
 

95
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,589
spiral takes over okay so because you're
in that place time you're in the wrong

96
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
in that place time you're in the wrong
 

97
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,229
in that place time you're in the wrong
place time for the inward spiral to give

98
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
place time for the inward spiral to give
 

99
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,949
place time for the inward spiral to give
you the opening for the EDI ASI okay

100
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:45,959
you the opening for the EDI ASI okay
 

101
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,630
you the opening for the EDI ASI okay
that's that's what we were trying to fix

102
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:47,640
that's that's what we were trying to fix
 

103
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,589
that's that's what we were trying to fix
yesterday and that you can do in the um

104
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
yesterday and that you can do in the um
 

105
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,589
yesterday and that you can do in the um
iito and the

106
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
iito and the
 

107
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,030
iito and the
iito is this part right here this part

108
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,040
iito is this part right here this part
 

109
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,630
iito is this part right here this part
right here that's it that's the IO but

110
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:01,640
right here that's it that's the IO but
 

111
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,309
right here that's it that's the IO but
the iy tyo is not eal that's very

112
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:05,319
the iy tyo is not eal that's very
 

113
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,509
the iy tyo is not eal that's very
important so as we go

114
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
important so as we go
 

115
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,830
important so as we go
on to take advantage of how small this

116
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
on to take advantage of how small this
 

117
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,110
on to take advantage of how small this
window of opportunity is you have to

118
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
window of opportunity is you have to
 

119
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,509
window of opportunity is you have to
have your ready okay you can't be

120
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:20,519
have your ready okay you can't be
 

121
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,509
have your ready okay you can't be
after the fact because if his shoulder

122
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:22,519
after the fact because if his shoulder
 

123
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,589
after the fact because if his shoulder
gets way past me the opening is gone so

124
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:26,599
gets way past me the opening is gone so
 

125
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,390
gets way past me the opening is gone so
my other

126
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
my other
 

127
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,670
my other
hand has to be ready to

128
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:32,680
hand has to be ready to
 

129
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,750
hand has to be ready to
catch the wrist when his shoulder gets

130
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:36,760
catch the wrist when his shoulder gets
 

131
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,470
catch the wrist when his shoulder gets
to my vertical plane so here was the

132
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
to my vertical plane so here was the
 

133
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,589
to my vertical plane so here was the
atmi the atmi is here boom and when I

134
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:46,599
atmi the atmi is here boom and when I
 

135
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,789
atmi the atmi is here boom and when I
leave that atmi there I'm going to bring

136
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:49,799
leave that atmi there I'm going to bring
 

137
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,270
leave that atmi there I'm going to bring
this hand to this hand as his shoulder

138
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
this hand to this hand as his shoulder
 

139
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,069
this hand to this hand as his shoulder
comes to my vertical plane and I catch

140
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,079
comes to my vertical plane and I catch
 

141
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,390
comes to my vertical plane and I catch
it right there catch it

142
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
it right there catch it
 

143
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,509
it right there catch it
what's happening on your timing aside

144
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
what's happening on your timing aside
 

145
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,589
what's happening on your timing aside
from you're already lay and already too

146
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:06,599
from you're already lay and already too
 

147
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,949
from you're already lay and already too
far away because we didn't move our feet

148
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:09,959
far away because we didn't move our feet
 

149
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,309
far away because we didn't move our feet
is you're doing the

150
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
is you're doing the
 

151
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,869
is you're doing the
io and then you're coming here and this

152
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
io and then you're coming here and this
 

153
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,030
io and then you're coming here and this
thing is

154
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,040

 

155
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,629

gone

156
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:19,639
gone
 

157
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,629
gone
so this this rule is the yinong grid my

158
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:25,639
so this this rule is the yinong grid my
 

159
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,310
so this this rule is the yinong grid my
hand on the cross lateral side cannot

160
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:29,320
hand on the cross lateral side cannot
 

161
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,950
hand on the cross lateral side cannot
take over the responsibilities of the

162
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
take over the responsibilities of the
 

163
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,430
take over the responsibilities of the

through I'm going to hit his head but

245
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
through I'm going to hit his head but
 

246
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,790
through I'm going to hit his head but
his elbow's back here so I do one more

247
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:03,800
his elbow's back here so I do one more
 

248
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,390
his elbow's back here so I do one more
loop around and that's where the ADI

249
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:07,400
loop around and that's where the ADI
 

250
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,510
loop around and that's where the ADI
pushes to the

251

elbows and usually you have to do that
 

254
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,350
elbows and usually you have to do that
if your UK like keeps their flow on

if your UK like keeps their flow on
 

256
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,390
if your UK like keeps their flow on
grip um you got to disarm the grip

257
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:21,400
grip um you got to disarm the grip
 

258
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,150

without breaking the rules of
 

260
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,029
without breaking the rules of
contestation and you have to hit the

261
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
contestation and you have to hit the
 

262
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,070
contestation and you have to hit the
elbow because the Keyon tells you to hit

elbow because the Keyon tells you to hit
 

264
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,270
elbow because the Keyon tells you to hit
the elbow and you can't pull this hand

more now all that
 

290
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,469
more now all that
said I

291
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:19,479
said I
 

292
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:22,710
said I
cannot um no and maybe you

293
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
cannot um no and maybe you
 

294
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,550
cannot um no and maybe you
can't if you're pinning

295
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:25,560
can't if you're pinning
 

296
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,189
can't if you're pinning
yourself then you will have to always

297
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:28,199
yourself then you will have to always

you and then it's too late you this
 

302
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,909
you and then it's too late you this
whole thing is the same thing as the

303
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:38,919
whole thing is the same thing as the
 

304
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,029
whole thing is the same thing as the
compression without being pinned the

305
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:42,039
compression without being pinned the
 

306
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,190
compression without being pinned the
same thing the same I'm not being pinned

307
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,200
same thing the same I'm not being pinned
 

308
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,470
same thing the same I'm not being pinned
so I still am ground V where I can walk

309
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:49,480
so I still am ground V where I can walk
 

310
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,310
so I still am ground V where I can walk
without being pinned okay um and that's

311
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:53,320
without being pinned okay um and that's
 

312
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,949
without being pinned okay um and that's
in EO so I do have stents like 10 right

313
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
in EO so I do have stents like 10 right
 

314
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,990
in EO so I do have stents like 10 right
and then he's too far ahead of me I

315
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,000
and then he's too far ahead of me I
 

316
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,870
and then he's too far ahead of me I
can't get the

317
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:03,880

 

318
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,670

Emi you have to be able to absorb his

319
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:08,680
Emi you have to be able to absorb his
 

320
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,990
Emi you have to be able to absorb his
energy so he doesn't move away from me

321
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
energy so he doesn't move away from me
 

322
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,630
energy so he doesn't move away from me
until I can attack the body okay and

323
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
until I can attack the body okay and
 

324
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,590
until I can attack the body okay and
that's where we're going to stop at that

325
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
