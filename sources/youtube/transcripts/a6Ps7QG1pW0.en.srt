power bound out here it doesn't work it
 

357
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,350
power bound out here it doesn't work it
actually the the oppositional energy

358
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
actually the the oppositional energy
 

359
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,910
actually the the oppositional energy
takes you off base okay this is why like

360
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:56,920
takes you off base okay this is why like
 

361
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,670
takes you off base okay this is why like
when you see people that do Cy hole

362
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
when you see people that do Cy hole
 

363
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,870
when you see people that do Cy hole
and they're going to rotate their

364
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:01,880
and they're going to rotate their
 

365
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,670
and they're going to rotate their
hips

366
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
hips
 

367
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,150
hips
they got to move their

368
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
they got to move their
 

369
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,269
they got to move their
feet okay in some way or

370
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
feet okay in some way or
 

371
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,790
feet okay in some way or
another come around

372
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
another come around
 

373
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,110
another come around
here you

374
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
here you
 

375
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,550
here you
see there that there's no power out

376
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:17,560
see there that there's no power out
 

377
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,110
see there that there's no power out
there it starts to negatively affect

378
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,120
there it starts to negatively affect
 

379
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,590
there it starts to negatively affect
your base okay especially uh when you're

380
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
your base okay especially uh when you're
 

381
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,949
your base okay especially uh when you're
working your internals you you you're

382
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:25,959
working your internals you you you're
 

383
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,069
working your internals you you you're
not turning your waist because you're

384
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
not turning your waist because you're
 

385
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,110
not turning your waist because you're
going to come you're going to squeeze

386
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,120
going to come you're going to squeeze
 

387
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,189
going to come you're going to squeeze
the tanden okay you you only have your

388
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:34,199
the tanden okay you you only have your
 

389
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,230
the tanden okay you you only have your
qua you only have your

390
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
qua you only have your
 

391
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,750
qua you only have your
qua

392
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:37,760
qua
 

393
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,829
qua
so sometimes as you're doing this

394
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:40,839
so sometimes as you're doing this
 

395
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:43,269
so sometimes as you're doing this
technique you want to

396
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:43,279
technique you want to
 

397
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,749
technique you want to
see a hip thrust this way like an

398
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:49,759

 

399
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,310

OTE

400
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:51,320
OTE
 

401
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,590
OTE
or sometimes you want to see a hip

402
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:56,600
or sometimes you want to see a hip
 

403
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,350
or sometimes you want to see a hip
rotation this way

404
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
rotation this way
 

405
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,949
rotation this way
but this technique like all these

406
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:01,959
but this technique like all these
 

407
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,829
but this technique like all these
lateral outward lateral techniques they

408
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:04,839
lateral outward lateral techniques they
 

409
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:06,590
lateral outward lateral techniques they
throw across my

410
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:06,600
throw across my
 

411
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,790
throw across my
Center I don't turn my

412
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:09,800
Center I don't turn my
 

413
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,430
Center I don't turn my
Center

415
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,189

okay so you're going to look for that as

416
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
okay so you're going to look for that as
 

417
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,670
okay so you're going to look for that as
we do this

418
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
we do this
 

419
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,990
we do this
now can you see

420
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,000
now can you see
 

421
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,829
now can you see
it I throw across my

422
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:26,839
it I throw across my
 

423
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:39,590
it I throw across my
sent here

425
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,550

now if you're thinking straight lines

426
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:41,560
now if you're thinking straight lines
 

427
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,870
now if you're thinking straight lines
usually what the straight line people do

428
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
usually what the straight line people do
 

429
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,189
usually what the straight line people do
is they're going to crowd this guy here

430
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:50,199
is they're going to crowd this guy here

the qua and and you're uh running the
 

479
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,870
the qua and and you're uh running the
internals is your feet okay so my

480
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
internals is your feet okay so my
 

481
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,590
internals is your feet okay so my
feet this what is now going to be the

482
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
feet this what is now going to be the
 

483
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,030
feet this what is now going to be the
back foot cannot be out because the quaw

484
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040
back foot cannot be out because the quaw
 

485
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,470
back foot cannot be out because the quaw
can't turn into it the knee is going to

486
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:33,480
can't turn into it the knee is going to
 

487
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,269
can't turn into it the knee is going to
get strained okay so the the maximum the

488
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:37,279
get strained okay so the the maximum the
 

489
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,309
get strained okay so the the maximum the
back foot can turn is 90° to the angle

490
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:40,319
back foot can turn is 90° to the angle
 

491
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:43,509
back foot can turn is 90° to the angle
of attack this my angle of attack I can

492
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
of attack this my angle of attack I can
 

493
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,710
of attack this my angle of attack I can
be 90° to it

494
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
be 90° to it
 

495
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,990
be 90° to it
okay so even here no it's going the

496
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,000
okay so even here no it's going the
 

497
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,590
okay so even here no it's going the
other way it's fighting your movement

498
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
other way it's fighting your movement
 

499
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,110
other way it's fighting your movement
and now you're heel weighted okay so if

500
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
and now you're heel weighted okay so if
 

501
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,550
and now you're heel weighted okay so if
I just relax your after a while with no

502
00:16:59,550 --> 00:16:59,560
I just relax your after a while with no
 

503
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,350
I just relax your after a while with no
micro flexion you'll see I'll lose my

504
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:02,360
micro flexion you'll see I'll lose my
 

505
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,910
micro flexion you'll see I'll lose my
balance there which means I'm not

506
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:03,920
balance there which means I'm not
 

507
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,069
balance there which means I'm not
midfoot so I'm not properly ground

508
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
midfoot so I'm not properly ground
 

509
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,870
midfoot so I'm not properly ground
vectoring so I don't have

510
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
vectoring so I don't have
 

511
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,949
vectoring so I don't have
Co so you have to watch that it's not a

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360

 

525
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,150

Okay boom boom it's going to turn but

526
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:39,160
Okay boom boom it's going to turn but
 

527
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,789
Okay boom boom it's going to turn but
it's not going to turn like this and nor

528
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:43,799
it's not going to turn like this and nor
 

529
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,590
it's not going to turn like this and nor
both feet going to turn and it's not

530
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:46,600
both feet going to turn and it's not
 

531
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,830
both feet going to turn and it's not
going to be my waist that turns the

532
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:48,840
going to be my waist that turns the
 

533
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,710
going to be my waist that turns the
pelvis

534
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:51,720

 

535
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,270

turns if he stands

536
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:54,280
turns if he stands
 

537
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,310
turns if he stands
up walk over here let me manipulate here

538
00:17:59,310 --> 00:17:59,320
up walk over here let me manipulate here
 

539
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,909
up walk over here let me manipulate here
you

540
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:00,919
you
 

541
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,830
you
see it's it's any any entering stance

542
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
see it's it's any any entering stance
 

543
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,350
see it's it's any any entering stance
you have is just in a different place so

544
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
you have is just in a different place so
 

545
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,510
you have is just in a different place so
I'm not in a horse Dan

546
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:12,520
I'm not in a horse Dan
 

547
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,230
I'm not in a horse Dan
either I'm not

548
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:15,240
either I'm not
 

549
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,630
either I'm not
5050 there energy goes here as the qual

550
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:19,640
5050 there energy goes here as the qual
 

551
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,350
5050 there energy goes here as the qual
turns weight's going to shift to the

552
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:22,360
turns weight's going to shift to the
 

553
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,029
turns weight's going to shift to the
front foot oh but I'm not going to keep

554
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:26,039
front foot oh but I'm not going to keep
 

555
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,669
front foot oh but I'm not going to keep
doing that okay try it

556
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
doing that okay try it
 

557
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,990
doing that okay try it
again there's a couple other

558
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
again there's a couple other
 

559
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,630
again there's a couple other
things okay so uh don't let me cut your

560
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
things okay so uh don't let me cut your
 

561
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,710
things okay so uh don't let me cut your
hand

562
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
hand
 

563
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,990
hand
down you see how easy it is okay um when

564
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
down you see how easy it is okay um when
 

565
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,590
down you see how easy it is okay um when
you turn his body it's not because you

566
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:50,600
you turn his body it's not because you
 

567
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,230
you turn his body it's not because you
are pulling his arm I don't I don't want

568
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:53,240
are pulling his arm I don't I don't want
 

569
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,990
are pulling his arm I don't I don't want
to use that his

570
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,000

 

571
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,110

fingers right there leave your fingers

572
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
fingers right there leave your fingers
 

573
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,149
fingers right there leave your fingers
there dude leave them there they're here

574
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:02,159
there dude leave them there they're here
 

575
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:05,350
there dude leave them there they're here
leave them there I'm not using a ledge

576
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360
leave them there I'm not using a ledge
 

577
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,710
leave them there I'm not using a ledge
here to pull

578
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:07,720
here to pull
 

579
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,630
here to pull
him that's where his grip is I'm not

580
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:11,640
him that's where his grip is I'm not
 

581
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,190
him that's where his grip is I'm not
using that what this does as I

582
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,200
using that what this does as I
 

583
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,789
using that what this does as I
step is it brings

584
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
step is it brings
 

585
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,549
step is it brings
here you

586
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559
here you
 

587
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,830
here you
see and as I use I use these two

588
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840
see and as I use I use these two
 

589
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,630
see and as I use I use these two
together go back

590
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:29,640
together go back
 

591
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,789
together go back
it's not that I go here keep me R please

592
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:32,799
it's not that I go here keep me R please
 

593
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,029
it's not that I go here keep me R please
and not I go here and I C that head he

594
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
and not I go here and I C that head he
 

595
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,230
and not I go here and I C that head he
already did the turn do you see

596
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:39,240

 

597
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,110

that you're you you do have some

598
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,120
that you're you you do have some
 

599
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,310
that you're you you do have some
external engines that you're using do

600
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:45,320
external engines that you're using do
 

601
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,430
external engines that you're using do
you

602
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:46,440
you
 

603
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,789
you
see one this is to touch to touch and

604
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:51,799
see one this is to touch to touch and
 

605
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:55,149
see one this is to touch to touch and
then I have a new adhesion point which

606
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:55,159
then I have a new adhesion point which
 

607
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,909
then I have a new adhesion point which
works together okay

608
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
works together okay
 

609
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,950
works together okay
so that I don't have to do this kind of

610
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:03,960
so that I don't have to do this kind of
 

611
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,070
so that I don't have to do this kind of
stuff you see because he can come into

612
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
stuff you see because he can come into
 

613
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:15,029
stuff you see because he can come into
me now

614
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039

 

615
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,590

again come into me you see this is an

616
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
again come into me you see this is an
 

617
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:26,909
again come into me you see this is an
adhesion not a pull an adhesion moves

618
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:26,919

 

619
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:30,669

him hand your hand has to be ready it's

620
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:30,679
him hand your hand has to be ready it's
 

621
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,190
him hand your hand has to be ready it's
you're you're not your hand's not ready

622
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,200
you're you're not your hand's not ready
 

623
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,310
you're you're not your hand's not ready
early enough it's ready I go to touch

624
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:37,320
early enough it's ready I go to touch
 

625
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:46,510
early enough it's ready I go to touch
then we move together

626
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:46,520

 

627
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,669

boom when you

628
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:49,679
boom when you
 

629
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,149
boom when you
adhere don't adhere on the turn your

630
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:54,159
adhere don't adhere on the turn your
 

631
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,310
adhere don't adhere on the turn your
seed I'm exaggerating that there's a

632
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,320
seed I'm exaggerating that there's a
 

633
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,029
seed I'm exaggerating that there's a
dual adhesion going on go

634
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039
dual adhesion going on go
 

635
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,750
dual adhesion going on go
back he's going to try to press

636
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
back he's going to try to press
 

637
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,750
back he's going to try to press
up you see just like any Ura technique

638
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:08,760
up you see just like any Ura technique
 

639
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,310
up you see just like any Ura technique
the guy's going to get up when he gets

640
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:11,320
the guy's going to get up when he gets
 

641
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:17,149
the guy's going to get up when he gets
up I bring it around bring the energy

642
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:17,159

 

643
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:19,710

around and as I bring it around just

644
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:19,720
around and as I bring it around just
 

645
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,510
around and as I bring it around just
like any Ura technique I bring it around

646
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:22,520
like any Ura technique I bring it around
 

647
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,669
like any Ura technique I bring it around
and

648
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:24,679
and
 

649
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:34,870
and
down do you see you feel that

650
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:34,880

 

651
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,710

so you can because CQ and ik are

652
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:37,720
so you can because CQ and ik are
 

653
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,750
so you can because CQ and ik are
redundant systems you can do it without

654
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:40,760
redundant systems you can do it without
 

655
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,110
redundant systems you can do it without
the C just keep lowering the iion so

656
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,120
the C just keep lowering the iion so
 

657
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,310
the C just keep lowering the iion so
let's try

658
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,320
let's try
 

659
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,110
let's try
that take the X out we're working one

660
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
that take the X out we're working one
 

661
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,549
that take the X out we're working one
line of the X go okay what what I'm

662
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:51,559
line of the X go okay what what I'm
 

663
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,830
line of the X go okay what what I'm
showing in these last few segments is

664
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
showing in these last few segments is
 

665
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,590
showing in these last few segments is
taking out the inertial engines which is

666
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:56,600
taking out the inertial engines which is
 

667
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,669
taking out the inertial engines which is
huge okay

668
00:21:58,669 --> 00:21:58,679
huge okay
 

669
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,990
huge okay
I don't do I CQ like you know in some of

670
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,000
I don't do I CQ like you know in some of
 

671
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,070
I don't do I CQ like you know in some of
the Chinese internal drill

672
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,080
the Chinese internal drill
 

673
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,590
the Chinese internal drill
developments they don't use the inertia

674
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
developments they don't use the inertia
 

675
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,390
developments they don't use the inertia
because they're trying to see your skill

676
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:10,400
because they're trying to see your skill
 

677
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,190
because they're trying to see your skill
without it okay no no not in iido we

678
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,200
without it okay no no not in iido we
 

679
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,269
without it okay no no not in iido we
going to use those inertial engines and

680
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:16,279
going to use those inertial engines and
 

681
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:19,310
going to use those inertial engines and
pair them with the internal engines okay

682
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:19,320
pair them with the internal engines okay
 

683
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,149
pair them with the internal engines okay
so when I come around on his head

684
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
so when I come around on his head
 

685
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,029
so when I come around on his head
there's going to be centrifugal energy

686
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
there's going to be centrifugal energy
 

687
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,990
there's going to be centrifugal energy
you see and it's not acting equ equally

688

out do you do you got that

696
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:43,640
out do you do you got that

X Vector so when you're doing when we're

706
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,080
X Vector so when you're doing when we're
 

707
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,909

711
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,750

something like that okay he should

712
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:12,760
something like that okay he should
 

713
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,830
something like that okay he should
just

you CQ okay all right let's see but this

728
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320
you CQ okay all right let's see but this

731
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,909
will give us our iy hand go once you're
doing that with your I hand then this is

732
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:49,919
doing that with your I hand then this is
 

733
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,870
doing that with your I hand then this is
easy there's less work for it to
