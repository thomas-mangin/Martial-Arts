1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,230

let's look at something so

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,240

 

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,509

his offense

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
his offense
 

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,110
his offense
defense depends upon

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,120
defense depends upon
 

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,150
defense depends upon
his mobility to a great deal

8
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
his mobility to a great deal
 

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,670
his mobility to a great deal
and his mobility depends upon

10
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
and his mobility depends upon
 

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,070
and his mobility depends upon
his organization so

12
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080
his organization so
 

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,310
his organization so
if this will consider he's standing with

14
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,320
if this will consider he's standing with
 

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,070
if this will consider he's standing with
a straight posture

16
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
a straight posture
 

17
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,790
a straight posture
neutral you can go backward forward

18
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
neutral you can go backward forward
 

19
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,830
neutral you can go backward forward
change angles and things like that

20
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
change angles and things like that
 

21
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,389
change angles and things like that
usually when he's aggressive you'll get

22
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
usually when he's aggressive you'll get
 

23
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,229
usually when he's aggressive you'll get
some sort of chance going

24
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
some sort of chance going
 

25
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,549
some sort of chance going
just like

26
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
just like
 

27
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,750
just like
certain organizations lead towards

28
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
certain organizations lead towards
 

29
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,229
certain organizations lead towards
certain tactical possibilities therefore

30
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
certain tactical possibilities therefore
 

31
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,430
certain tactical possibilities therefore
other organizations take away those

32
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
other organizations take away those
 

33
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,350
other organizations take away those
possibilities

34
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
possibilities
 

35
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,670
possibilities
kazushi is utilizing that premise

36
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
kazushi is utilizing that premise
 

37
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,670
kazushi is utilizing that premise
and we do it in a particular way in

38
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
and we do it in a particular way in
 

39
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,990
and we do it in a particular way in
aikido

40
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
aikido
 

41
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,950
aikido
we're going to cause a particular

42
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
we're going to cause a particular
 

43
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,310
we're going to cause a particular
disorganization

44
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,320
disorganization
 

45
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,990
disorganization
which is a tilting of the spine

46
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
which is a tilting of the spine
 

47
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,109
which is a tilting of the spine
a disorganization of the shoulders to

48
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
a disorganization of the shoulders to
 

49
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,149
a disorganization of the shoulders to
the hips

50
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
the hips
 

51
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,190
the hips
to the knees relationship reduces

52
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
to the knees relationship reduces
 

53
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,230
to the knees relationship reduces
mobility power

54
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
mobility power
 

55
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,910
mobility power
reduces offense and defense capacity

56
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
reduces offense and defense capacity
 

57
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,350
reduces offense and defense capacity
so anytime in your technique a guy is

58
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
so anytime in your technique a guy is
 

59
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,630
so anytime in your technique a guy is
in neutral you're

60
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
in neutral you're
 

61
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,870
in neutral you're
not doing kazushi so fix that

62
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
not doing kazushi so fix that
 

63
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,230
not doing kazushi so fix that
look for that so

64
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
look for that so
 

65
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,149
look for that so
we want to instead get that

66
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:47,159
we want to instead get that
 

67
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,310
we want to instead get that
disorganization

68
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
disorganization
 

69
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,429
disorganization
so if you look at the body

70
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
so if you look at the body
 

71
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,030
so if you look at the body
you can do like uh you'll have the eight

72
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
you can do like uh you'll have the eight
 

73
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,709
you can do like uh you'll have the eight
directional tilts

74
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
directional tilts
 

75
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,109
directional tilts
so nine o'clock three o'clock

76
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
so nine o'clock three o'clock
 

77
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,389
so nine o'clock three o'clock
four can you get the idea

78
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
four can you get the idea
 

79
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,389
four can you get the idea
i'm tilting in all the angles of the

80
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
i'm tilting in all the angles of the
 

81
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,309
i'm tilting in all the angles of the
clock

82
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319

 

83
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,430

but aikido generally only uses

84
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
but aikido generally only uses
 

85
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,790
but aikido generally only uses
four which are really just two which is

86
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
four which are really just two which is
 

87
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,589
four which are really just two which is
really just

88
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
really just
 

89
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,630
really just
one okay it's following

90
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
one okay it's following
 

91
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,350
one okay it's following
an ancient chinese

92
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,360

 

93
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,869

epistemology on the nature of the

94
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
epistemology on the nature of the
 

95
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,990
epistemology on the nature of the
universe

96
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
universe
 

97
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,390
universe
so you have these numeric values

98
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
so you have these numeric values
 

99
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,589
so you have these numeric values
one two four so

100
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
one two four so
 

101
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,630
one two four so
what are the four the four

102
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
what are the four the four
 

103
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,229
what are the four the four
are the corners tilt to four o'clock

104
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
are the corners tilt to four o'clock
 

105
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,030
are the corners tilt to four o'clock
till to eight o'clock till to ten

106
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
till to eight o'clock till to ten
 

107
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,070
till to eight o'clock till to ten
o'clock

108
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
o'clock
 

109
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,470
o'clock
till to two o'clock what are the two

110
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
till to two o'clock what are the two
 

111
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,309
till to two o'clock what are the two
it's always going to be a tilt um

112
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
it's always going to be a tilt um
 

113
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,910
it's always going to be a tilt um
either going in and forward you see

114
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920
either going in and forward you see
 

115
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,149
either going in and forward you see
in and forward that may be eight before

116
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
in and forward that may be eight before
 

117
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,509
in and forward that may be eight before
the same

118
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
the same
 

119
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,630
the same
or out and back out and back

120
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
or out and back out and back
 

121
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,470
or out and back out and back
are the two okay what is the one

122
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
are the two okay what is the one
 

123
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,589
are the two okay what is the one
they happen by the same exact means

124
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
they happen by the same exact means
 

125
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,710
they happen by the same exact means
okay so we have a drill and we're gonna

126
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
okay so we have a drill and we're gonna
 

127
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,309
okay so we have a drill and we're gonna
go over

128
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
go over
 

129
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,430
go over
those means all right first i'm going to

130
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
those means all right first i'm going to
 

131
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,270
those means all right first i'm going to
demonstrate the means

132
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
demonstrate the means
 

133
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,869
demonstrate the means
so our drill is this though and he comes

134
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
so our drill is this though and he comes
 

135
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,840
so our drill is this though and he comes
in

136
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,850
in
 

137
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,030

i get to work on those two kazushi

140
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
i get to work on those two kazushi
 

141
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,190
i get to work on those two kazushi
patterns

142
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
patterns
 

143
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,309
patterns
so you see i'm gonna take a one

144
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
so you see i'm gonna take a one
 

145
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,309
so you see i'm gonna take a one
frontward inward then

146
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
frontward inward then
 

147
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,990
frontward inward then
the outward backward you guys see that

148
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
the outward backward you guys see that
 

149
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,270
the outward backward you guys see that
so back to where we were standing i

150
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
so back to where we were standing i
 

151
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,710
so back to where we were standing i
took the four o'clock and

152
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
took the four o'clock and
 

153
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,309
took the four o'clock and
the two o'clock we got it

154
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
the two o'clock we got it
 

155
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,670
the two o'clock we got it
why are they one because it's the same

156
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
why are they one because it's the same
 

157
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,270
why are they one because it's the same
the means in which i generate it so

158
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
the means in which i generate it so
 

159
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,990
the means in which i generate it so
there's a kind of spiraling figure eight

160
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
there's a kind of spiraling figure eight
 

161
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,390
there's a kind of spiraling figure eight
that happens inside my body and i'm just

162
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
that happens inside my body and i'm just
 

163
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,869
that happens inside my body and i'm just
reversing it

164
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
reversing it
 

165
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,110
reversing it
i have the other one i don't have two

166
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
i have the other one i don't have two
 

167
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,910
i have the other one i don't have two
ways of doing it

168
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920

 

169
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,789

it's just going in so if you do it with

170
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
it's just going in so if you do it with
 

171
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,749
it's just going in so if you do it with
him

172
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
him
 

173
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,189
him
you watch my body

174
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199

 

175
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,550

so you watch my body and you'll see

176
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
so you watch my body and you'll see
 

177
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,870
so you watch my body and you'll see
that i'm doing the same thing over and

178
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
that i'm doing the same thing over and
 

179
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,430
that i'm doing the same thing over and
over

180
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440

 

181
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,350

you take away the arms you can barely

182
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
you take away the arms you can barely
 

183
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,790
you take away the arms you can barely
tell which

184
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
tell which
 

185
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,270
tell which
thing i'm doing okay such that

186
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
thing i'm doing okay such that
 

187
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,749
thing i'm doing okay such that
um if i stand in a different

188
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
um if i stand in a different
 

189
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,550
um if i stand in a different
relationship to him

190
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
relationship to him
 

191
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,749
relationship to him
i can do different things with both so i

192
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
i can do different things with both so i
 

193
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,270
i can do different things with both so i
can do

194
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280
can do
 

195
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,110
can do
what you thought was just the front

196
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
what you thought was just the front
 

197
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,550
what you thought was just the front
inward i can do to the out backward

198
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
inward i can do to the out backward
 

199
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,030
inward i can do to the out backward
with the same exact pattern so for

200
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
with the same exact pattern so for
 

201
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,710
with the same exact pattern so for
example if i'm going here

202
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
example if i'm going here
 

203
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,790
example if i'm going here
this is the front inward but it's to the

204
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
this is the front inward but it's to the
 

205
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,629
this is the front inward but it's to the
outback

206
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
outback
 

207
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,029
outback
you see or uh

208
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
you see or uh
 

209
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,710
you see or uh
i can be do the backward one but he will

210
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
i can be do the backward one but he will
 

211
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,350
i can be do the backward one but he will
do a front

212
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
do a front
 

213
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,670
do a front
a front inward ball

214
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
a front inward ball
 

215
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,070
a front inward ball
do you see do you get that he didn't go

216
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
do you see do you get that he didn't go
 

217
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,310
do you see do you get that he didn't go
backwards he went forward

218
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
backwards he went forward
 

219
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,629
backwards he went forward
but i did it with the out backward

220
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
but i did it with the out backward
 

221
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,070
but i did it with the out backward
kazushi pattern

222
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
kazushi pattern
 

223
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,909
kazushi pattern
but it really wasn't it was the front

224
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
but it really wasn't it was the front
 

225
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,670
but it really wasn't it was the front
inward position

226
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
inward position
 

227
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,710
inward position
okay you guys understand okay so

228
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720

 

229
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,350

those are going to be your geometry but

230
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
those are going to be your geometry but
 

231
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,629
those are going to be your geometry but
your

232
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
your
 

233
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,790
your
mechanisms or your modes of operation

234
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800

 

235
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,990

they're varied okay so

236
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
they're varied okay so
 

237
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,749
they're varied okay so
let's say

238
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
let's say
 

239
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,110
let's say
i have he

240
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
i have he
 

241
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,749
i have he
he's pushing in and i'm going to

242
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
he's pushing in and i'm going to
 

243
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,749
he's pushing in and i'm going to
do the yield i'm going to do a yield on

244
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
do the yield i'm going to do a yield on
 

245
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,189
do the yield i'm going to do a yield on
that

246
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
that
 

247
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,270
that
i can do my heels externally

248
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
i can do my heels externally
 

249
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,110
i can do my heels externally
which by which i mean i move in space

250
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
which by which i mean i move in space
 

251
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,150
which by which i mean i move in space
and i use my common everyday just

252
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
and i use my common everyday just
 

253
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,510
and i use my common everyday just
musculature

254
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
musculature
 

255
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,629
musculature
so he's pushing and i move

256
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
so he's pushing and i move
 

257
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,790
so he's pushing and i move
okay

258
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800

 

259
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,150

that's one way so how did he move i just

260
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
that's one way so how did he move i just
 

261
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,230
that's one way so how did he move i just
got out of the way and he fell into the

262
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
got out of the way and he fell into the
 

263
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,350
got out of the way and he fell into the
hole i created

264
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
hole i created
 

265
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,350
hole i created
okay another way is i

266
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360

 

267
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,270

pull him in same exact kind of thing

268
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
pull him in same exact kind of thing
 

269
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,309
pull him in same exact kind of thing
those ways are like beginner ways okay

270
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
those ways are like beginner ways okay
 

271
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,990
those ways are like beginner ways okay
if you're if you're not working on the

272
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
if you're if you're not working on the
 

273
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,550
if you're if you're not working on the
kazushi patterns you're not doing

274
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
kazushi patterns you're not doing
 

275
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,029
kazushi patterns you're not doing
the geometry of the art but now you are

276
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
the geometry of the art but now you are
 

277
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,029
the geometry of the art but now you are
working on it but now the question is

278
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
working on it but now the question is
 

279
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,790
working on it but now the question is
how do you do it

280
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
how do you do it
 

281
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,110
how do you do it
this is external strength based

282
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
this is external strength based
 

283
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,029
this is external strength based
it's beginner stuff okay what we want

284
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
it's beginner stuff okay what we want
 

285
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,189
it's beginner stuff okay what we want
to get to is two modes of or two

286
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
to get to is two modes of or two
 

287
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,629
to get to is two modes of or two
mechanisms

288
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
mechanisms
 

289
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,749
mechanisms
one is i take an energy that can come

290
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
one is i take an energy that can come
 

291
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,710
one is i take an energy that can come
inward come inward and take an energy

292
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:14,720
inward come inward and take an energy
 

293
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,230
inward come inward and take an energy
that can go outward

294
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
that can go outward
 

295
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,749
that can go outward
okay but i don't do it through

296
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
okay but i don't do it through
 

297
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,110
okay but i don't do it through
external lead through external muscle

298
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
external lead through external muscle
 

299
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,110
external lead through external muscle
okay so just stay still the coming in

300
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
okay so just stay still the coming in
 

301
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,390
okay so just stay still the coming in
is going to be that ik adhesion

302
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
is going to be that ik adhesion
 

303
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,469
is going to be that ik adhesion
and the projecting now is the cool cube

304
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
and the projecting now is the cool cube
 

305
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,830
and the projecting now is the cool cube
so i do the same drill

306
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:39,840

 

307
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,589

and i'm going to do a cochlear

308
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
and i'm going to do a cochlear
 

309
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,749
and i'm going to do a cochlear
projection on the first part

310
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
projection on the first part
 

311
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,869
projection on the first part
so he goes then

312
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
so he goes then
 

313
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,990
so he goes then
i'm not pulling him as an

314
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
i'm not pulling him as an
 

315
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,670
i'm not pulling him as an
ike adhesion on the second part

316
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
ike adhesion on the second part
 

317
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,309
ike adhesion on the second part
so i can be learning the geometries in

318
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
so i can be learning the geometries in
 

319
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,070
so i can be learning the geometries in
the drill

320
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080

 

321
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,550

but i'm not learning the modes of

322
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
but i'm not learning the modes of
 

323
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,510
but i'm not learning the modes of
operation

324
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
operation
 

325
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,950
operation
okay so he's going to push

326
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
okay so he's going to push
 

327
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,070
okay so he's going to push
i send the energy down to the ground and

328
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
i send the energy down to the ground and
 

329
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,950
i send the energy down to the ground and
then

330
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
then
 

331
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,990
then
sync with the rebound boom then

332
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
sync with the rebound boom then
 

333
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,469
sync with the rebound boom then
blend boom

334
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479

 

335
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,670

so there's it's going to look different

336
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
so there's it's going to look different
 

337
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,270
so there's it's going to look different
it's going to look different if i just

338
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
it's going to look different if i just
 

339
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,029
it's going to look different if i just
go like this

340
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039

 

341
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,430

what can i look for smaller movements

342
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
what can i look for smaller movements
 

343
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,269
what can i look for smaller movements
that he pushes boom

344
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
that he pushes boom
 

345
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,790
that he pushes boom
and then uh here i'm gonna find

346
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
and then uh here i'm gonna find
 

347
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,190
and then uh here i'm gonna find
this part is actually where i

348
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
this part is actually where i
 

349
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:52,829
this part is actually where i
sticking to him that i don't need the

350
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:52,839

 

351
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,430

arm

352
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
arm
 

353
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,550
arm
okay to get the most

354
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
okay to get the most
 

355
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,829
okay to get the most
operation in the beginning you have to

356
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
operation in the beginning you have to
 

357
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,829
operation in the beginning you have to
use your body

358
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
use your body
 

359
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,230
use your body
meaning your core meaning your torso it

360
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
meaning your core meaning your torso it
 

361
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,990
meaning your core meaning your torso it
it has to do the pattern you cannot do

362
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
it has to do the pattern you cannot do
 

363
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,350
it has to do the pattern you cannot do
the pattern from the shoulder

364
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
the pattern from the shoulder
 

365
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,910
the pattern from the shoulder
we cannot do the pattern and get either

366
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
we cannot do the pattern and get either
 

367
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,230
we cannot do the pattern and get either
one either one of those

368
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
one either one of those
 

369
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,350
one either one of those
my body has to move

370
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
my body has to move
 

371
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,950
my body has to move
boom

372
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:28,960

 

373
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,470

[Music]

374
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
[Music]
 

375
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,070
[Music]
so if you watch

376
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080

 

377
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,750

body body

378
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
body body
 

379
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,910
body body
just like when i was doing the drill you

380
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
just like when i was doing the drill you
 

381
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,710
just like when i was doing the drill you
you see it because my body's moved

382
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
you see it because my body's moved
 

383
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,630
you see it because my body's moved
if i did the technique like this

384
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640

 

385
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,710

and i now did that in the air but i took

386
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
and i now did that in the air but i took
 

387
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,310
and i now did that in the air but i took
my arm away you wouldn't see any

388
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
my arm away you wouldn't see any
 

389
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,350
my arm away you wouldn't see any
movement

390
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
movement
 

391
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,670
movement
but you did see movement because my body

392
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
but you did see movement because my body
 

393
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,790
but you did see movement because my body
is doing

394
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
is doing
 

395
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,949
is doing
okay so let's start there

396
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
okay so let's start there
 

397
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,910
okay so let's start there
let's go back to this drill and let's

398
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
let's go back to this drill and let's
 

399
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,150
let's go back to this drill and let's
see you

400
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
see you
 

401
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:15,350
see you
move your body

402
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360

 

403
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,949

and as we move our body i'm going to

404
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
and as we move our body i'm going to
 

405
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,230
and as we move our body i'm going to
feel the energy of the cocky

406
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
feel the energy of the cocky
 

407
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,550
feel the energy of the cocky
come in so if he pushes and i hold it

408
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
come in so if he pushes and i hold it
 

409
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,230
come in so if he pushes and i hold it
here i should feel

410
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
here i should feel
 

411
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,269
here i should feel
he's just he's pushing me down and i was

412
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
he's just he's pushing me down and i was
 

413
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:29,750
he's just he's pushing me down and i was
making

414
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
making
 

415
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,030
making
my feet feel like

416
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
my feet feel like
 

417
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,310
my feet feel like
okay we sit there all day

418
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
okay we sit there all day
 

419
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,230
okay we sit there all day
then i come around and when i come

420
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
then i come around and when i come
 

421
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,430
then i come around and when i come
around i

422
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
around i
 

423
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,230
around i
should feel his center

424
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240

 

425
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,230

in other words don't take off the

426
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
in other words don't take off the
 

427
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,150
in other words don't take off the
pressure

428
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
pressure
 

429
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,430
pressure
in front of his body through his body

430
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
in front of his body through his body
 

431
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,110
in front of his body through his body
how by moving my body then

432
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
how by moving my body then
 

433
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,430
how by moving my body then
up then here feel that

434
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
up then here feel that
 

435
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,470
up then here feel that
okay feel

436
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
okay feel
 

437
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,829
okay feel
this first adhesion going forward

438
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
this first adhesion going forward
 

439
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,110
this first adhesion going forward
then body okay

440
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
then body okay
 

441
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,150
then body okay
let's try that again

442
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
let's try that again
 

443
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,630
let's try that again
okay when you don't have the modes of

444
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
okay when you don't have the modes of
 

445
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,150
okay when you don't have the modes of
operation when i don't

446
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
operation when i don't
 

447
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,949
operation when i don't
have a project a projection capacity or

448
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
have a project a projection capacity or
 

449
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,069
have a project a projection capacity or
an adhesion

450
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,079
an adhesion
 

451
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,230
an adhesion
capacity you start to look for other

452
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
capacity you start to look for other
 

453
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,269
capacity you start to look for other
things

454
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
things
 

455
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,590
things
you'll utilize other things it's just

456
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
you'll utilize other things it's just
 

457
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,670
you'll utilize other things it's just
human nature

458
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
human nature
 

459
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,710
human nature
so then but then the technique doesn't

460
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
so then but then the technique doesn't
 

461
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,069
so then but then the technique doesn't
function

462
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
function
 

463
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,750
function
uh tactically it looks like it does but

464
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
uh tactically it looks like it does but
 

465
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,630
uh tactically it looks like it does but
it doesn't

466
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
it doesn't
 

467
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,750
it doesn't
okay and you have to do different things

468
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
okay and you have to do different things
 

469
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,550
okay and you have to do different things
okay so

470
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
okay so
 

471
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,550
okay so
uh in other words you have to do like

472
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
uh in other words you have to do like
 

473
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,150
uh in other words you have to do like
some tilts

474
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
some tilts
 

475
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,389
some tilts
stuff like this and you did get the tilt

476
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
stuff like this and you did get the tilt
 

477
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,550
stuff like this and you did get the tilt
but it's a yin yang world so if the

478
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
but it's a yin yang world so if the
 

479
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,069
but it's a yin yang world so if the
inward outward spiral

480
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
inward outward spiral
 

481
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,110
inward outward spiral
is one of those then the outward

482
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
is one of those then the outward
 

483
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,790
is one of those then the outward
backward spiral

484
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
backward spiral
 

485
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,910
backward spiral
is the other and both

486
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
is the other and both
 

487
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,710
is the other and both
actually happen in the aikido position

488
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
actually happen in the aikido position
 

489
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,509
actually happen in the aikido position
so it's not that i tilt him

490
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:09,519
so it's not that i tilt him
 

491
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,750
so it's not that i tilt him
as i demonstrated just giving you the

492
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
as i demonstrated just giving you the
 

493
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,629
as i demonstrated just giving you the
vector

494
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
vector
 

495
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,829
vector
but the second angle is going to come in

496
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
but the second angle is going to come in
 

497
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,590
but the second angle is going to come in
just so because of the vector that i

498
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
just so because of the vector that i
 

499
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,870
just so because of the vector that i
showed

500
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
showed
 

501
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,870
showed
and it's going to work on the other

502
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
and it's going to work on the other
 

503
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,990
and it's going to work on the other
corner so

504
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
corner so
 

505
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,350
corner so
it goes like this on the other corner

506
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
it goes like this on the other corner
 

507
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,829
it goes like this on the other corner
the two are hitting the body at the same

508
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
the two are hitting the body at the same
 

509
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,470
the two are hitting the body at the same
time

510
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
time
 

511
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,670
time
so i'm not tilting

512
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
so i'm not tilting
 

513
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,230
so i'm not tilting
i get a tilt and then his center gets

514
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
i get a tilt and then his center gets
 

515
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,190
i get a tilt and then his center gets
hit by the

516
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
hit by the
 

517
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,470
hit by the

the first inward kazushi
 

525
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,269
the first inward kazushi
then the second one is that part

526
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:55,279

 

527
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,310

happens where here

530
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
happens where here
 

531
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,550
happens where here
do you see it the only difference is my

532
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
do you see it the only difference is my
 

533
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,350
do you see it the only difference is my
arm is shared my arm was there

534
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
arm is shared my arm was there
 

535
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,470
arm is shared my arm was there
so boom i used it

536
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
so boom i used it
 

537
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,629
so boom i used it
in a coccu variant a young projection

538
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
in a coccu variant a young projection
 

539
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,269
in a coccu variant a young projection
but on the second part of the drill i

540
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
but on the second part of the drill i
 

541
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,629
but on the second part of the drill i
used it as a

542
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
used it as a
 

543
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,069
used it as a
yin adhesion so i'm going to make

544
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
yin adhesion so i'm going to make
 

545
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,590
yin adhesion so i'm going to make
contact with him

546
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
contact with him
 

547
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,389
contact with him
and when i make contact with him that's

548
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
and when i make contact with him that's
 

549
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,750
and when i make contact with him that's
where i turned him did you see it

550
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
where i turned him did you see it
 

551
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:43,800
where i turned him did you see it
i'm not going to go here and around

552
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:43,810

555
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:55,350

not my arm

556
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360

 

557
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,310

will go slow i bring my arm to here and

558
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320
will go slow i bring my arm to here and
 

559
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,750
will go slow i bring my arm to here and
then i do the

560
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
then i do the
 

561
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,110
then i do the
body um do you see then

562
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
body um do you see then
 

563
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,509
body um do you see then
the throw what changes when you do it

564
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
the throw what changes when you do it
 

565
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,110
the throw what changes when you do it
the other way well here you become

566
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
the other way well here you become
 

567
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,949
the other way well here you become
arm-dependent

arm-dependent
 

569
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,269
arm-dependent
okay and that's a goofy thing to be

570
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279

 

571
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,189

when you're armed dependent there's no

572
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
when you're armed dependent there's no
 

573
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,750
when you're armed dependent there's no
effect on his body

but when you go to the body

576
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,270

all you're going on the second part
 

589
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,069
all you're going on the second part
that's gonna require muscle

focus on the first part this part is
what i mean

596
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399

 

597
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:58,870

do you understand
 

599
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,069
do you understand
okay i i think uh

600
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079

 

601
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,269

your your perception of the world is

602
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279
your your perception of the world is
 

603
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,389
your your perception of the world is
is determined

604
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
is determined

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,590
is determined
or constructed through how you're

606

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,230
through your worldview and so if i don't
have

612
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
have
 

613
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,949
have
a projection or an adhesion mode of

614
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
a projection or an adhesion mode of

i not only go to cert other things other
mechanics but the patterns themselves

620
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,480
mechanics but the patterns themselves
 

621
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,069
mechanics but the patterns themselves
get warped i can't see why that

622
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
get warped i can't see why that
 

623
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,310
get warped i can't see why that
pattern would work or i can't even see

624
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
pattern would work or i can't even see
 

625
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,430

the pattern

626
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
the pattern

the pattern
i don't understand how i can get him to

628
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
i don't understand how i can get him to
 

629
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,870
i don't understand how i can get him to
go backwards by

630
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
go backwards by
 

631
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,470
go backwards by
by going forward is what is most common

632
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
by going forward is what is most common
 

633
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,269

00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:47,279
in aikido okay instead i know how to
 

635
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,870
in aikido okay instead i know how to
make someone go backwards by going

636

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,230
backwards
okay so if you watch my body

640
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
okay so if you watch my body
 

641
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,710
okay so if you watch my body
i'm just going to describe it generally

642
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
i'm just going to describe it generally
 

643
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,430
i'm just going to describe it generally

644
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
my body goes to the left
 

645
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,910
my body goes to the left
it comes back to the right and you all

646
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
it comes back to the right and you all
 

647
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,269
it comes back to the right and you all
look it makes sense

648
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:03,279
look it makes sense
 

649
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,310
look it makes sense
he went to the right south

650
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
he went to the right south
 

651
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,990
he went to the right south
and i turn south but in the yin yang

652
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
and i turn south but in the yin yang
 

653
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,710
and i turn south but in the yin yang

i should be able to have them go north

656
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
i should be able to have them go north
 

657
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,069
i should be able to have them go north
and turn

658
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
and turn
 

659
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,030
and turn
south again do you get it

660
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040

 

661
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,629

so that would be to my right here we go

662
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:22,639
so that would be to my right here we go
 

663
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,310
so that would be to my right here we go
i'm going to do it again

i'm going to do it again
 

665
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,030
i'm going to do it again
right again do you see body went to the

666
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
right again do you see body went to the
 

667
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,470
right again do you see body went to the
right

668
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480

what the beginner does is go well i

670
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:34,399
what the beginner does is go well i
 

671
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,550
what the beginner does is go well i
wanted it to go that way so we go that

672
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
wanted it to go that way so we go that
 

673
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,509
wanted it to go that way so we go that
way

674
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519

 

675
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,389

but i don't have kazushi you think you

but i don't have kazushi you think you
 

677
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,230
but i don't have kazushi you think you
have pollution you don't have kazushi

678
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
have pollution you don't have kazushi
 

679
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,389
have pollution you don't have kazushi
and it takes a lot of muscle and you're

680
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
and it takes a lot of muscle and you're
 

681
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,790
and it takes a lot of muscle and you're
going to redefine what the last move is

682
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
going to redefine what the last move is
 

683
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,870
going to redefine what the last move is
the last move is aiming

684
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
the last move is aiming
 

685
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,269

687
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,430

boom here and go right back to the right

688
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
boom here and go right back to the right
 

689
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,710
boom here and go right back to the right
then ball now somebody who got the right

690
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
then ball now somebody who got the right
 

691
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,789
then ball now somebody who got the right
part and you do realize that the body

692
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
part and you do realize that the body
 

693
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,309
part and you do realize that the body
did fall

694
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319
did fall
 

695
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,230
did fall
you come around here you go boom and you

696
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
you come around here you go boom and you
 

697
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,750
you come around here you go boom and you
realize that guy's falling

698

realize that guy's falling
and then you're over here with them okay

700
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
and then you're over here with them okay
 

701
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,909
and then you're over here with them okay
you still have the drill to complete so

702
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
you still have the drill to complete so
 

703
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,029
you still have the drill to complete so
for those people

704
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
for those people
 

705
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,470
for those people
i do go to the right boom like that

706
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
i do go to the right boom like that
 

707
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,990
i do go to the right boom like that
on my back into the technique don't get

708
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
on my back into the technique don't get
 

709
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,870
on my back into the technique don't get
don't go to sleep okay all right let's

710
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:24,880
don't go to sleep okay all right let's
 

711
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,549
don't go to sleep okay all right let's
try it again

712
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:26,559
try it again
 

713
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,470
try it again
i missed the motive operation

714
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
i missed the motive operation
 

715
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,270
i missed the motive operation
i come back and i have to go around and

716
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
i come back and i have to go around and
 

717
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,710
i come back and i have to go around and
now what did i do to my spine

718
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
now what did i do to my spine
 

719
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,430
now what did i do to my spine
i tilted it okay i did the very

720
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,440
i tilted it okay i did the very
 

721
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,029
i tilted it okay i did the very
disadvantage

722
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
disadvantage
 

723
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,390
disadvantage
that i was trying to do in him okay

724
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
that i was trying to do in him okay
 

725
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,590
that i was trying to do in him okay
and then he's he there was no effect on

726
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
and then he's he there was no effect on
 

727
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,230
and then he's he there was no effect on
him

728
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
him
 

729
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,710
him
so somewhere in the fight he got

730
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
so somewhere in the fight he got
 

731
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,390
so somewhere in the fight he got
stabilized

732
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
stabilized
 

733
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,190
stabilized
which is not good i broke the kazushi

734
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
which is not good i broke the kazushi
 

735
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,549
which is not good i broke the kazushi
timing

736
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
timing
 

737
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,430
timing
then the other mistake is now i have to

738
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
then the other mistake is now i have to
 

739
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,070
then the other mistake is now i have to
throw him

740
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
throw him
 

741
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,630
throw him
with this movement and this movement is

742
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
with this movement and this movement is
 

743
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,150
with this movement and this movement is
now outer deltoid

744
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160

 

745
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,310

be strong

746
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320

 

747
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,669

okay now i have a couple choices

748
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:13,679
okay now i have a couple choices
 

749
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,510
okay now i have a couple choices
could go well i'm going to have him i'm

750
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
could go well i'm going to have him i'm
 

751
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,669
could go well i'm going to have him i'm
going to have him closer to the outer

752
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
going to have him closer to the outer
 

753
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,470
going to have him closer to the outer
deltoid

754
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
deltoid
 

755
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,230
deltoid
but then there's no effect i just

756
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,240
but then there's no effect i just
 

757
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,070
but then there's no effect i just
prolonging the lack of effect as

758
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
prolonging the lack of effect as
 

759
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,750
prolonging the lack of effect as
he's inside the radius or he's outside

760
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
he's inside the radius or he's outside
 

761
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,669
he's inside the radius or he's outside
further out from dropping out further

762
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
further out from dropping out further
 

763
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,870
further out from dropping out further
out

764
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
out
 

765
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,110
out
out and now the distal end

766
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
out and now the distal end
 

767
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,350
out and now the distal end
lever concepts working against me he has

768
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
lever concepts working against me he has
 

769
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,870
lever concepts working against me he has
more leverage than i do

770
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
more leverage than i do
 

771
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,990
more leverage than i do
okay

772
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,000

 

773
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,029

so let's correct this

774
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
so let's correct this
 

775
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,110
so let's correct this
i go here and when i do the turn boom

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,000
i'm inside this space let's rewind
 

795
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,750
i'm inside this space let's rewind
step you're fine there and he's you go

796
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:23,760
step you're fine there and he's you go
 

797
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,870

go go into the fall i'm staying with him

798
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
go go into the fall i'm staying with him
 

799
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,510
go go into the fall i'm staying with him
you see do you see how i'm doing that

800
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
you see do you see how i'm doing that
 

801
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,909
you see do you see how i'm doing that
it's not it look it's not moving him

802
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:39,919

 

803
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,230

i'm blending with him boom

804
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,240
i'm blending with him boom

and in that way i get to complete the
 

809
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:51,990
and in that way i get to complete the
last portion

810
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
last portion
 

811
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,730

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
here
 

819
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,390
here
so one

820
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400
so one
 

821
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,830

you stop here you need to go here

822
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840

 

823
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,549

so body development requires full range

824
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:12,559
so body development requires full range
 

825
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,870
so body development requires full range
of motion

826
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:14,880
of motion
 

827
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,830
of motion
in the drill you see and i end up over

828
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
in the drill you see and i end up over
 

829
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:26,390
in the drill you see and i end up over
here

830
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400

 

831
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,510

okay try it again

832
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
okay try it again
 

833
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,110
okay try it again
okay what happens in real life

834
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
okay what happens in real life
 

835
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,029
okay what happens in real life
is happening here in training in real

836
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,039
is happening here in training in real
 

837
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:37,669
is happening here in training in real
life

838
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
life
 

839
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,789
life
in real fighting doesn't happen okay

840
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799

 

841
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,070

in real life people power and real

842
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,080
in real life people power and real
 

843
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,390
in real life people power and real
training left people cower

844
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
training left people cower
 

845
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,029
training left people cower
once they feel the kazushi pattern

846
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,039
once they feel the kazushi pattern
 

847
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:51,909
once they feel the kazushi pattern
working on them

848
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:51,919
working on them
 

849
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,830
working on them
it scares them and so they try to shut

850
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:55,840
it scares them and so they try to shut
 

851
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,230
it scares them and so they try to shut
off

852
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,240
off
 

853
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,270
off
the mode of operation okay

854
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
the mode of operation okay
 

855
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,390
the mode of operation okay
so a very simple example is

856
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
so a very simple example is
 

857
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,990
so a very simple example is
when he feels that the connection here

858
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,000
when he feels that the connection here
 

859
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,029
when he feels that the connection here
starts to push on his center he'll break

but when he keeps his connection it's
 

975
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,630

key okay so

994
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
key okay so
 

995
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,029
key okay so
um right now we're working on this part

996
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:09,039
um right now we're working on this part
 

997
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:09,750
um right now we're working on this part
here

998
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
here
 

999
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,789
here
boom here a lot of the who kids are

1000
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,799
boom here a lot of the who kids are
 

1001
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,710
boom here a lot of the who kids are
twisting in place

1002
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
twisting in place
 

1003
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,390
twisting in place
okay and then you can't do the technique

1004
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,400
okay and then you can't do the technique
 

1005
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,230
okay and then you can't do the technique
so even when i hit it's not just a smack

1006
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,240
so even when i hit it's not just a smack
 

1007
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,430
so even when i hit it's not just a smack
if you pay attention you see

1008
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,440
if you pay attention you see
 

1009
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,909
if you pay attention you see
it's the same pattern that i'm using on

1010
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:27,919
it's the same pattern that i'm using on
 

1011
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,830
it's the same pattern that i'm using on
the center

1012
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:30,840

 

1013
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,630

so

1014
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
so
 

1015
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,390
so
this goes here into the movement

1016
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,400
this goes here into the movement
 

1017
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,590
this goes here into the movement
into the drill okay because

1018
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:39,600
into the drill okay because
 

1019
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,630
into the drill okay because
i don't want the kazushi to stop yes he

1020
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:42,640
i don't want the kazushi to stop yes he
 

1021
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,430
i don't want the kazushi to stop yes he
is hittable

1022
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:43,440
is hittable
 

1023
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,190
is hittable
when he twists but i'm not

1024
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
when he twists but i'm not
 

1025
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,830

so i'm not employing kazushi i might get

1030
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:54,799
so i'm not employing kazushi i might get
 

1031
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,830
so i'm not employing kazushi i might get
one shot in

1032
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:55,840
one shot in
 

1033
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,750
one shot in
but we're not going to be exchanging

1034
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:57,760
but we're not going to be exchanging
 

1035

on so your attempt must
 

1039
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,710
on so your attempt must
follow the same kazushi rules

1053
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,110

now if you're training you're wasting 50

1054
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,120
now if you're training you're wasting 50
 

1055
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,110
now if you're training you're wasting 50
percent of your training time

1056
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,120
percent of your training time
 

1057
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,750
percent of your training time
every time you take away the drill

1058
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
every time you take away the drill
 

1059
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,029

mechanics
 

1061
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,269

so you can think of the drill as a bench

1062
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:33,279
so you can think of the drill as a bench
 

1063
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,789
so you can think of the drill as a bench
press

1065
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,190

and you're the barbell but you're a

1066
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
and you're the barbell but you're a
 

1067
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,070
and you're the barbell but you're a
piece of crap barbell that keeps

00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,080
piece of crap barbell that keeps
 

1069
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,549
piece of crap barbell that keeps
going into a chain link format okay

1070
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:44,559
going into a chain link format okay
 

1071
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,269
going into a chain link format okay
you're not a very good barbell and only

1072
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
you're not a very good barbell and only
 

1073
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,350
you're not a very good barbell and only
a very advanced person can learn from

1074
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,360
a very advanced person can learn from
 

1075
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,070
a very advanced person can learn from

the drill
 

1077
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,390

you're going to teach them a lot just

1078
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
you're going to teach them a lot just
 

1079
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,230
you're going to teach them a lot just
like people now lift

chains because yeah it will make you

1082
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,000
chains because yeah it will make you
 

1083
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,230
chains because yeah it will make you
stronger because a lot of stability is

1084
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
stronger because a lot of stability is
 

1085

i become the more i can't project
so if i do in my uk like this i don't

1124
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:47,840
so if i do in my uk like this i don't
 

1125

so if i do in my uk like this i don't
i'm not projectable

skilled people will project me but

1128
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:51,919
skilled people will project me but
 

1129
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,909
skilled people will project me but
beginners will not capitalize upon the

it's a little off isn't it we get a

1176
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:48,159
it's a little off isn't it we get a
 

1177
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,990
it's a little off isn't it we get a
little more penetration we'll do it

1178
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,000
little more penetration we'll do it
 

1179
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,549

boom

1200
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,000

 

1201
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,310

okay so stop twisting disengaging as you

1202
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,320
okay so stop twisting disengaging as you
 

1203
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,110
okay so stop twisting disengaging as you
get

1204

get
 

1205
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,750

your advantage to refine your skills
okay because your art is immature

1210
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:36,880
okay because your art is immature
 

1211
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,230
okay because your art is immature
you're spiritually immature so

1212
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,240
you're spiritually immature so
 

1213
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,110
you're spiritually immature so
you tend to focus on surface superficial

1214
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,120
you tend to focus on surface superficial
 

1215
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,389
you tend to focus on surface superficial
tactile visible things but

1216
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
tactile visible things but
 

1217
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,830
tactile visible things but
as i said this whole thing is happening

1218
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:51,840
as i said this whole thing is happening
 

1219
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,830
as i said this whole thing is happening
inside my body

1220
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:56,840

 

1221
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,149

um and it doesn't

1222
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:00,159
um and it doesn't
 

1223
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,870
um and it doesn't
have to be an actual movement

1224
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
have to be an actual movement
 

1225
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,870
have to be an actual movement
and so the harder he the harder he

1226
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:06,880
and so the harder he the harder he
 

1227
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,029
and so the harder he the harder he
pushes like he's really driving

1228
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:09,039
pushes like he's really driving
 

1229
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,149
pushes like he's really driving
you can get it without any apparent

1230
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:12,159
you can get it without any apparent
 

1231
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,269
you can get it without any apparent
movement do you understand

1232
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:15,279
movement do you understand
 

1233
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,470
movement do you understand
did you see okay it's not that i'm here

1234
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
did you see okay it's not that i'm here
 

1235
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,110
did you see okay it's not that i'm here
and i'm

1236
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,120
and i'm
 

1237
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,710
and i'm
imagining it i'm not imagining it i

1238
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:22,720
imagining it i'm not imagining it i
 

1239
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,750
imagining it i'm not imagining it i
i am doing it i am doing it okay

1240

i am doing it i am doing it okay
 

1241
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,430
i am doing it i am doing it okay
i am doing it doing it

1242
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440

 

1243
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,909

he's making up the energy equation that

1244
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:33,919
he's making up the energy equation that
 

1245
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,669
he's making up the energy equation that
side that's off at the beginning the

1246
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:35,679
side that's off at the beginning the
 

1247
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,630
side that's off at the beginning the
beginning

1248
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:36,640
beginning
 

1249
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,070
beginning
he's just providing

1250
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
he's just providing
 

1251
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,110
he's just providing
the required energy feed but aggression

1252
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,120
the required energy feed but aggression
 

1253
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,510
the required energy feed but aggression
makes

1254
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
makes
 

1255
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,710
makes
everything allowed to be smaller

1256
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:46,720
everything allowed to be smaller
 

1257
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,110
everything allowed to be smaller
becomes more effective but when i can't

1258
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,120
becomes more effective but when i can't
 

1259
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,389
becomes more effective but when i can't
do it

1260
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
do it
 

1261
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,110
do it
then aggression makes it all fall apart

1262
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,120
then aggression makes it all fall apart
 

1263
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,310
then aggression makes it all fall apart
faster easier

1264
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,320
faster easier
 

1265
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,750
faster easier
okay so uh

1266
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:57,760
okay so uh
 

1267
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,870
okay so uh
we're gonna do the same drill

1268
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:00,880
we're gonna do the same drill
 

1269
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,310
we're gonna do the same drill
he's he's gonna be striking he's gonna

1270
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,320
he's he's gonna be striking he's gonna
 

1271
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,230
he's he's gonna be striking he's gonna
give weight here

1272
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,240
give weight here
 

1273
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,190
give weight here
do you see and i'm going to do the same

1277
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,789

here we get even caught tighter

1278
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:22,799
here we get even caught tighter
 

1279
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,830
here we get even caught tighter
okay and you can see my body

1280
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:25,840
okay and you can see my body
 

1281
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:32,950
okay and you can see my body
is doing the same thing

1282
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:32,960

 

1283
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,830

it's not just laying he's not just uh

1284
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:35,840
it's not just laying he's not just uh
 

1285
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,909
it's not just laying he's not just uh
touching me

1286
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:37,919
touching me
 

1287
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,190
touching me
he's giving me pressure you see well i

1288
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,200
he's giving me pressure you see well i
 

1289
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,190
he's giving me pressure you see well i
take it into the ground and then do the

1290
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,200
take it into the ground and then do the
 

1291
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:57,750
take it into the ground and then do the
same movement in the same connection

1292
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:57,760

 

1293
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,990

make sure you're close enough because if

1294
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,000
make sure you're close enough because if
 

1295
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,509
make sure you're close enough because if
he's out more

1296
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:01,519
he's out more
 

1297
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,669
he's out more
then you as you can are still doing hand

1298
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:03,679
then you as you can are still doing hand
 

1299
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:04,630
then you as you can are still doing hand
stuff

1300
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:04,640
stuff
 

1301
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,830
stuff
they come in you get your whole body you

1302
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:07,840
they come in you get your whole body you
 

1303
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,669
they come in you get your whole body you
could you could just think of it as he's

1304
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:09,679
could you could just think of it as he's
 

1305
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,789
could you could just think of it as he's
he's grappling do you see he's grappling

1306
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:12,799
he's grappling do you see he's grappling
 

1307
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:21,590
he's grappling do you see he's grappling
and i'm gonna do the same

1308
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:21,600

 

1309
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,509

don't make the same confusion of trying

1310
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:23,519
don't make the same confusion of trying
 

1311
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,269
don't make the same confusion of trying
to move his arm that's not what i'm

1312
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:25,279
to move his arm that's not what i'm
 

1313
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:25,990
to move his arm that's not what i'm
doing

1314
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,000
doing
 

1315
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,110
doing
i'm going to move his body my body

1316
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,120
i'm going to move his body my body
 

1317
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:38,149
i'm going to move his body my body
goes into his body

1318
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:38,159

 

1319
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,310

and here you can see where the throw

1320
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,320
and here you can see where the throw
 

1321
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,430
and here you can see where the throw
actually happens

1322
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,440
actually happens
 

1323
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,549
actually happens
it happens on the going forward

1324
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:44,559
it happens on the going forward
 

1325
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,389
it happens on the going forward
so again close he's driving you're gonna

1326
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:48,399
so again close he's driving you're gonna
 

1327
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,310
so again close he's driving you're gonna
get tired okay especially if your

1328
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,320
get tired okay especially if your
 

1329
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:58,470
get tired okay especially if your
your dog is doing it at this slow pace

1330
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:58,480

 

1331
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,549

okay let's try it so we go back to this

1332
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:02,559
okay let's try it so we go back to this
 

1333
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,830
okay let's try it so we go back to this
this the two patterns are in the one

1334
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:05,840
this the two patterns are in the one
 

1335
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,430
this the two patterns are in the one
pattern okay so yes yes he's gone this

1336
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:09,440
pattern okay so yes yes he's gone this
 

1337
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:09,909
pattern okay so yes yes he's gone this
way

1338
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:09,919
way
 

1339
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,110
way
but as i said his hip is going

1340
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,120
but as i said his hip is going
 

1341
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,230
but as i said his hip is going
the other way okay

1342
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240
the other way okay
 

1343
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,230
the other way okay
you're not he's not doing a somersault

1344
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,240
you're not he's not doing a somersault
 

1345
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,830
you're not he's not doing a somersault
in my head

1346
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:19,840
in my head
 

1347
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,350
in my head
the hip's not going in the same

1348
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,360
the hip's not going in the same
 

1349
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,029
the hip's not going in the same
direction as the head

1350
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:23,039
direction as the head
 

1351
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,149
direction as the head
do you understand this is why this

1352
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:26,159
do you understand this is why this
 

1353
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:26,950
do you understand this is why this
center

1354
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:26,960
center
 

1355
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,430
center
uh doesn't just tilt it's not real

1356
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:29,440
uh doesn't just tilt it's not real
 

1357
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,710
uh doesn't just tilt it's not real
position

1358
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:30,720

his his center has to move you see

1370
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,360
his his center has to move you see
 

1371
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,230
his his center has to move you see
it comes back won't his center is

1372
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,240
it comes back won't his center is
 

1373

traversing
 

1375
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,350

can you see that

1376
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:55,360

 

1377
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,789

then he will just kill he'll just tilt

1380
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,200
then he will just kill he'll just tilt
 

1381
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,190
then he will just kill he'll just tilt
from kind of doing a turn and move like

1382
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,200
from kind of doing a turn and move like
 

1383
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,830
from kind of doing a turn and move like
that and then

1384
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:03,840
that and then
 

1385
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,750
that and then
come back okay uh you have to

1386
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:07,760
come back okay uh you have to
 

1387
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,470
come back okay uh you have to
uh measure for the center traversing you

1388
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:10,480
uh measure for the center traversing you
 

1389
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,430
uh measure for the center traversing you
cannot forget that same thing so

1390
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:13,440
cannot forget that same thing so
 

1391
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,630
cannot forget that same thing so
it has to project through boom it has to

1392

it has to project through boom it has to
 

1393
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,110
it has to project through boom it has to
project through do you get it it has to

00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,120
project through do you get it it has to
 

1395
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,950
project through do you get it it has to
traverse across space

1396

otherwise it's not real position okay

1398
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:26,559

 

1399
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,750

okay since one is two two is four four

how much so i'm here
 

1443
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,069
how much so i'm here
just enough to get his head to tilt that

1444
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:42,079
just enough to get his head to tilt that
 

1445
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:42,869
just enough to get his head to tilt that
was it

1446
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:42,879
was it
 

1447
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,109
was it
that's all i needed then the other

1448
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:45,119
that's all i needed then the other
 

1449
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,310
that's all i needed then the other
aspect

1450

aspect
 

1451
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,149
aspect
take over the same front inward position

1452
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
take over the same front inward position
 

1453
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,230
take over the same front inward position
so we're tighter here

1454
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,240
so we're tighter here
 

1455
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,829
so we're tighter here
i'm not impacting him

1456

1459
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,870

i'm not up here

the guy started out there and his hand
 

1471
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,550
the guy started out there and his hand
went up i'd kick him

1472
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:26,560
went up i'd kick him
 

1473
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,670

00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:29,680
he's got to be in that sweet spot where
 

1475
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,270
he's got to be in that sweet spot where
i won't create distance

1476
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:31,280
i won't create distance
 

1477
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,310
i won't create distance
i won't use a longer range weapon

i won't use a longer range weapon
 

1479
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,150
i won't use a longer range weapon
okay and that i have to go in and engage

00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,160
okay and that i have to go in and engage
 

1481
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,390
okay and that i have to go in and engage
and you should know that's the same

to get yourself
 

1495
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,470
to get yourself
and this is where the drill starts okay

1496
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:54,480
and this is where the drill starts okay
 

1497
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,950
and this is where the drill starts okay
he does the technique i'm here that was

so in the last drill

1504
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:03,440
so in the last drill
 

1505
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,829
so in the last drill
i was using it as a young

1506
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:07,839
i was using it as a young
 

1507
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,430

yawn you see projection

1508
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:11,440
yawn you see projection
 

1509
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,710
yawn you see projection
a coq projection start it again here

1510
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:14,720
a coq projection start it again here
 

1511
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,910
a coq projection start it again here
and boom in this one

1512
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:17,920
and boom in this one
 

1513
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,750
and boom in this one
i'm using it same pattern but in a yin

1514
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:21,760
i'm using it same pattern but in a yin
 

1515
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,750
i'm using it same pattern but in a yin
perspective

1516

1517
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,230

but you can see it's the same pattern

1518
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,240
but you can see it's the same pattern
 

1519
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,150
but you can see it's the same pattern
you see just i find the center

1520
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,160
you see just i find the center
 

1521
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,150
you see just i find the center
then i maintain zero pressure on the

1522
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,160
then i maintain zero pressure on the
 

1523
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,430
then i maintain zero pressure on the

can you see it can you see it okay
do you see so here is

1576
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:55,599

 

1577
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,710

the same pattern i'm in his center

1578
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:58,720
the same pattern i'm in his center
 

1579
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,750
the same pattern i'm in his center
in a young version okay i'm here

1580
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:05,760
in a young version okay i'm here
 

1581
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,430
in a young version okay i'm here
well i'm going to do it in the yin

1582
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:07,440
well i'm going to do it in the yin
 

1583
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,870
well i'm going to do it in the yin
version which means it is an adhesion

1584
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:10,880
version which means it is an adhesion
 

1585
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,270
version which means it is an adhesion
so as i do this do you see

1586
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:15,280

 

1587
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,030

his aggression i already started the

1588
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,040
his aggression i already started the
 

1589
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,150
his aggression i already started the
disorganization of his body do you see

1590
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160
disorganization of his body do you see
 

1591
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,990
disorganization of his body do you see
the tilt in his shoulder

1592
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,000
the tilt in his shoulder
 

1593
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,430
the tilt in his shoulder
that's going to make him fall into the

1594
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:25,440
that's going to make him fall into the
 

1595
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,870
that's going to make him fall into the
hole

1596
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:26,880
hole
 

1597
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,790
hole
that means his center is going to

1598
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:28,800
that means his center is going to
 

1599
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,710
that means his center is going to
traverse as well as his spine tilting

1600
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
traverse as well as his spine tilting
 

1601
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,829
traverse as well as his spine tilting
i'm not standing here and i do this

1602
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:35,839
i'm not standing here and i do this
 

1603
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:36,550
i'm not standing here and i do this
maneuver

1604
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:36,560
maneuver
 

1605
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,790

he's standing straight up and then all

1606
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:38,800
he's standing straight up and then all
 

1607
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,910
he's standing straight up and then all
of a sudden i have

1608
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:39,920
of a sudden i have
 

1609
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,349
of a sudden i have
super strength and i bend over a guy

1610
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:43,359
super strength and i bend over a guy
 

1611
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,790
super strength and i bend over a guy
okay so

1612
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:46,800
okay so
 

1613
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,829
okay so
let's slow it down again

1614
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:49,839
let's slow it down again
 

1615
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,589
let's slow it down again
and you're going to do it in a young

1616
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:51,599
and you're going to do it in a young
 

1617
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,829
and you're going to do it in a young
version so boom this is just like the

1618
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,839

1619
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,310

1621
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,630
standing version of the seated drill
but then after that you're going to do

1622
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:58,640
but then after that you're going to do
 

1623
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,710
but then after that you're going to do
it in the yin version so

1624
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:00,720
it in the yin version so
 

1625
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,910
it in the yin version so
it's it's this that i feel that's my

1626
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:03,920
it's it's this that i feel that's my
 

1627
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,030
it's it's this that i feel that's my
adhesion point

it's not me moving out of the way and he
 

1631
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,550
it's not me moving out of the way and he
falls in okay

1632
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:08,560
falls in okay
 

1633
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:21,910

can you see that if he hits there

1638
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,000
can you see that if he hits there
 

1639
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,550
can you see that if he hits there
go it does go that way but then what are

go it does go that way but then what are
 

1641

you noticing
 

1643
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,829
you noticing
it's going down

1645
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:46,310

00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:09,839

 

1693
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,510

and it happens in amidst the spiral

1694
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:13,520
and it happens in amidst the spiral
 

1695
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,790
and it happens in amidst the spiral
so if i'm doing this

1696
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:16,800
so if i'm doing this
 

1697
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,750
so if i'm doing this
wrong i'm going to have to take a big

1698
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:19,760
wrong i'm going to have to take a big
 

1699
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,030
wrong i'm going to have to take a big
step

1700
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,040
step
 

1701
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,349
step
so i go here and then i'm going to get a

1702
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:23,359
so i go here and then i'm going to get a
 

1703
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:28,390
so i go here and then i'm going to get a
big step to get in the back

1704
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:28,400

 

1705
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,430

but if i'm doing this right

1706
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:31,440
but if i'm doing this right
 

1707
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,230
but if i'm doing this right
you can think of it in two ways and i'm

1708
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,240
you can think of it in two ways and i'm
 

1709
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,829
you can think of it in two ways and i'm
mentioning these two ways you can

1710
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:35,839
mentioning these two ways you can
 

1711
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,069
mentioning these two ways you can
understand the distinction

1712
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:38,079
understand the distinction
 

1713
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,510
understand the distinction
he's gonna i'm gonna pass this strike

1714
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:41,520
he's gonna i'm gonna pass this strike
 

1715
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,030
he's gonna i'm gonna pass this strike
or his body through the strike into the

1716
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,040
or his body through the strike into the
 

1717
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,630
or his body through the strike into the
other hand so i'm doing the pattern

1718
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:48,640
other hand so i'm doing the pattern
 

1719
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,829
other hand so i'm doing the pattern
boom you see he's

1720
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:51,839
boom you see he's
 

1721
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,349
boom you see he's
he's hitting the other hand

1722
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:55,359
he's hitting the other hand
 

1723
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,270
he's hitting the other hand
and i'm here

1724
00:41:59,270 --> 00:41:59,280

 

1725
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,270

it's not me he's staying there and you

1726
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:01,280
it's not me he's staying there and you
 

1727
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,790
it's not me he's staying there and you
see i have to reach for it up

1728
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:02,800
see i have to reach for it up
 

1729
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,910
see i have to reach for it up
i have to reach for it

1730
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:05,920

 

1731
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,150

or i move out of the way and i have to

1732
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,160
or i move out of the way and i have to
 

1733
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,990
or i move out of the way and i have to
reach for it again

1734
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,000
reach for it again
 

1735
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,069
reach for it again
he's hitting the other hand so we're

1736
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:12,079
he's hitting the other hand so we're
 

1737
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,589
he's hitting the other hand so we're
engaged in here

1738
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
engaged in here
 

1739
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,390
engaged in here
and i'm hitting okay just like i wanted

1740
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:16,400
and i'm hitting okay just like i wanted
 

1741
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,829
and i'm hitting okay just like i wanted
to keep striking

1742
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:19,839

 

1743
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,309

so the other thing you'll see if i could

1744
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:22,319
so the other thing you'll see if i could
 

1745
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,790
so the other thing you'll see if i could
hit the head if i'm making him run into

1746
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:24,800
hit the head if i'm making him run into
 

1747
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,910
hit the head if i'm making him run into
me

1748
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:25,920
me
 

1749
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,510
me
whoa look i'm there

1750
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:29,520
whoa look i'm there
 

1751
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,990
whoa look i'm there
i got there so the other way to think of

1752
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,000
i got there so the other way to think of
 

1753
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,630
i got there so the other way to think of
it is

1754
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:32,640
it is
 

1755
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,589
it is
i'm not only passing his head to me i'm

1756
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:35,599
i'm not only passing his head to me i'm
 

1757
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,790
i'm not only passing his head to me i'm
passing his

1758
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:36,800
passing his
 

1759
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,870
passing his
shoulder right the shikaku

1760
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:40,880
shoulder right the shikaku
 

1761
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,550
shoulder right the shikaku
to me so i'm here like that

1762
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:44,560
to me so i'm here like that
 

1763
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,829
to me so i'm here like that
i do the drill oh and it's two to four

1764
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:47,839
i do the drill oh and it's two to four
 

1765
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:48,710
i do the drill oh and it's two to four
inches

1766
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:48,720
inches
 

1767
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,030
inches
and i'm where the other person had to

1768
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:51,040
and i'm where the other person had to
 

1769
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,910
and i'm where the other person had to
take

1770
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:51,920
take
 

1771
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,030
take
foot two feet step

1772
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:55,040
foot two feet step
 

1773
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,069
foot two feet step
so make that part of this drill where

1774
00:42:58,069 --> 00:42:58,079
so make that part of this drill where
 

1775
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,750
so make that part of this drill where
there's the pressure

1776
00:42:59,750 --> 00:42:59,760
there's the pressure
 

1777
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,670
there's the pressure
again the young version

1778
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:03,680
again the young version
 

1779
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,790
again the young version
the inversion and you're here

1780
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:06,800
the inversion and you're here
 

1781
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,390
the inversion and you're here
here get it there this is not it

1782
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:10,400
here get it there this is not it
 

1783
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,589
here get it there this is not it
it's there pass it to you

1784
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:13,599
it's there pass it to you
 

1785
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,630
it's there pass it to you
pass it pass it

1786
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:18,640

 

1787
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,829

past it

1788
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:21,839

 

1789
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:27,430

or hit or just do the technique

1790
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:27,440
or hit or just do the technique
 

1791
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,829
or hit or just do the technique
okay let's try it again if you don't

1792
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:29,839
okay let's try it again if you don't
 

1793
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,589
okay let's try it again if you don't
have the motor operation you have to

1794
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:31,599
have the motor operation you have to
 

1795
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,470
have the motor operation you have to
reinterpret

1796
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:32,480
reinterpret
 

1797
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,309
reinterpret
everything and you do something it

1798
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:34,319
everything and you do something it
 

1799
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,910
everything and you do something it
doesn't it doesn't work

1800
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:35,920
doesn't it doesn't work
 

1801
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,349
doesn't it doesn't work
so uh what you're doing is a call it a

1802
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:39,359
so uh what you're doing is a call it a
 

1803
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,309
so uh what you're doing is a call it a
yield it's a

1804
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:40,319
yield it's a
 

1805
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,030
yield it's a
lee based yield it's external so he goes

1806
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,040
lee based yield it's external so he goes
 

1807
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,030
lee based yield it's external so he goes
to strike and you go like that

1808
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
to strike and you go like that
 

1809
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,510
to strike and you go like that
you see but your posture is the one

1810
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520
you see but your posture is the one
 

1811
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,230
you see but your posture is the one
being compromised

1812
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:50,240
being compromised
 

1813
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,910
being compromised
you're getting that getting out of the

1814
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:51,920
you're getting that getting out of the
 

1815
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,309
you're getting that getting out of the
way i'm not fast enough

1816
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:54,319
way i'm not fast enough
 

1817
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,790
way i'm not fast enough
he hit it i made contact and now i'm

1818
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:56,800
he hit it i made contact and now i'm
 

1819
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,750
he hit it i made contact and now i'm
gonna do it so

1820
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:57,760
gonna do it so
 

1821
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,470
gonna do it so
i actually don't go that way do you see

1822
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:00,480
i actually don't go that way do you see
 

1823
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,990
i actually don't go that way do you see
that

1824
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,000
that
 

1825
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,950
that
that's that's not what we're doing look

1826
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:04,960
that's that's not what we're doing look
 

1827
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,470
that's that's not what we're doing look
at my body

1828
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:08,480
at my body
 

1829
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,550
at my body
and you guys see he can just walk in why

1830
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:10,560
and you guys see he can just walk in why
 

1831
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,910
and you guys see he can just walk in why
wouldn't he be able to walk in he's

1832
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:11,920
wouldn't he be able to walk in he's
 

1833
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,190
wouldn't he be able to walk in he's
athletic

1834
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:13,200
athletic
 

1835
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,430
athletic
he just walks in so maybe i got out of

1836
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:15,440
he just walks in so maybe i got out of
 

1837
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,589
he just walks in so maybe i got out of
the way that move but i'm no better off

1838
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:17,599
the way that move but i'm no better off
 

1839
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,150
the way that move but i'm no better off
i'm actually worse off

1840
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:20,160
i'm actually worse off
 

1841
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:29,589
i'm actually worse off
so watch that movement

1842
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:29,599

 

1843
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,790

huh

1844
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:32,800

 

1845
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,390

is that it no that's not it

1846
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:36,400
is that it no that's not it
 

1847
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:57,990
is that it no that's not it
this was it look at the pattern

1848
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:58,000

 

1849
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,110

not this way this way first

1850
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:01,120
not this way this way first
 

1851
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,829
not this way this way first
[Music]

1852
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:02,839
[Music]
 

1853
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:10,550
[Music]
but

1854
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:10,560

 

1855
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,829

so not this way

1856
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:13,839

 

1857
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:19,100

the other way so

1858
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:19,110
the other way so
 

1859
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:25,030
the other way so
[Music]

1860
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:25,040

 

1861
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:44,870

push hard hard hard yeah

1862
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:44,880

 

1863
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:52,710

there

1864
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:52,720

 

1865
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,790

okay let's go so we have the drill

1866
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:56,800
okay let's go so we have the drill
 

1867
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,710
okay let's go so we have the drill
on and we're outward backward

1868
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:02,720

 

1869
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,670

nothing changes inward

1870
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:07,680
nothing changes inward
 

1871
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,510
nothing changes inward
you know how backward is this one

1872
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:11,520
you know how backward is this one
 

1873
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,950
you know how backward is this one
on your yokomin uh

1874
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:14,960
on your yokomin uh
 

1875
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,829
on your yokomin uh
response can you see it okay we're just

1876
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:17,839
response can you see it okay we're just
 

1877
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,910
response can you see it okay we're just
working on the front inward

1878
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:19,920
working on the front inward
 

1879
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,030
working on the front inward
so the throw has to be coordinated with

1880
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,040
so the throw has to be coordinated with
 

1881
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,470
so the throw has to be coordinated with
the kazushi pattern that i'm generating

1882
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:26,480
the kazushi pattern that i'm generating
 

1883
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,109
the kazushi pattern that i'm generating
so as i pass pass

1884
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:31,119
so as i pass pass
 

1885
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,069
so as i pass pass
the head does not go here the head goes

1886
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:34,079
the head does not go here the head goes
 

1887
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,270
the head does not go here the head goes
here

1888
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:35,280
here
 

1889
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,510
here
so that my projection angle can cut

1890
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:37,520
so that my projection angle can cut
 

1891
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,190
so that my projection angle can cut
across the hip

1892
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,200
across the hip
 

1893
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,230
across the hip
so i'm not lowering him

1894
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:42,240
so i'm not lowering him
 

1895
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,790
so i'm not lowering him
and then he is accelerated and he

1896
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:44,800
and then he is accelerated and he
 

1897
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,190
and then he is accelerated and he
doesn't want to face plans so he rolls

1898
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:47,200
doesn't want to face plans so he rolls
 

1899
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,270
doesn't want to face plans so he rolls
that's not what we do here okay so

1900
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:51,280
that's not what we do here okay so
 

1901
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,150
that's not what we do here okay so
move this goes here his base gets

1902
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:56,160
move this goes here his base gets
 

1903
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,750
move this goes here his base gets
deconstructed

1904
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:57,760
deconstructed
 

1905
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,109
deconstructed
which means i have to bring the head

1906
00:46:59,109 --> 00:46:59,119
which means i have to bring the head
 

1907
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,550
which means i have to bring the head
around so he goes

1908
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:02,560
around so he goes
 

1909
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,230
around so he goes
up head comes around

1910
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:06,240
up head comes around
 

1911
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,270
up head comes around
okay let's go this

1912
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,280
okay let's go this
 

1913
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,349
okay let's go this
point is going to be very subtle

1914
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:13,359

 

1915
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,790

okay again if i don't understand the

1916
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:16,800
okay again if i don't understand the
 

1917
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,790
okay again if i don't understand the
modes of operation i don't understand

1918
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
modes of operation i don't understand
 

1919
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,950
modes of operation i don't understand
ikea i don't understand coke you i can't

1920
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:20,960
ikea i don't understand coke you i can't
 

1921
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,549
ikea i don't understand coke you i can't
hit here i can't project

1922
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:22,559
hit here i can't project
 

1923
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,589
hit here i can't project
i have to make up for that absence with

1924
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:25,599
i have to make up for that absence with
 

1925
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,510
i have to make up for that absence with
external things then tactics change

1926
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:29,520
external things then tactics change
 

1927
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,030
external things then tactics change
to fit that model okay

1928
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:33,040
to fit that model okay
 

1929
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,349
to fit that model okay
i want to show you what is different a

1930
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:35,359
i want to show you what is different a
 

1931
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,870
i want to show you what is different a
size from when you do

1932
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:36,880
size from when you do
 

1933
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,430
size from when you do
these external things you actually are

1934
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:39,440
these external things you actually are
 

1935
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,230
these external things you actually are
doing

1936
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:40,240
doing
 

1937
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,069
doing
the strategy that we're trying to do to

1938
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:42,079
the strategy that we're trying to do to
 

1939
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,790
the strategy that we're trying to do to
him if you disorganize yourself

1940
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:44,800
him if you disorganize yourself
 

1941
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,910
him if you disorganize yourself
okay but

1942
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:47,920
okay but
 

1943
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,150
okay but
you're doing a keyhole and so he has to

1944
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:50,160
you're doing a keyhole and so he has to
 

1945
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,069
you're doing a keyhole and so he has to
start with a prescription okay

1946
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:52,079
start with a prescription okay
 

1947
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,069
start with a prescription okay
obviously he doesn't he doesn't strike

1948
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:56,079
obviously he doesn't he doesn't strike
 

1949
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,790
obviously he doesn't he doesn't strike
it's the same thing okay but we slowed

1950
00:47:58,790 --> 00:47:58,800
it's the same thing okay but we slowed
 

1951
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,549
it's the same thing okay but we slowed
it down

1952
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:00,559
it down
 

1953
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,589
it down
with just a constant pressure okay

1954
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:03,599
with just a constant pressure okay
 

1955
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,109
with just a constant pressure okay
that's what we're doing all right so

1956
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:07,119
that's what we're doing all right so
 

1957
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,870
that's what we're doing all right so
once i do the movement i get here

1958
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:10,880
once i do the movement i get here
 

1959
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,910
once i do the movement i get here
do you see where i'm at okay

1960
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:13,920
do you see where i'm at okay
 

1961
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,549
do you see where i'm at okay
watch watch what i'm gonna ask again

1962
00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:16,559
watch watch what i'm gonna ask again
 

1963
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,309
watch watch what i'm gonna ask again
okay

1964
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:18,319
okay
 

1965
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,230
okay
uh can you go forward

1966
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:22,240

 

1967
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,109

do you think okay but now watch watch

1968
00:48:25,109 --> 00:48:25,119
do you think okay but now watch watch
 

1969
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,150
do you think okay but now watch watch
what happens

1970
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:26,160
what happens
 

1971
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,430
what happens
can you go backwards did you see his

1972
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:29,440
can you go backwards did you see his
 

1973
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,790
can you go backwards did you see his
balance got taken

1974
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:30,800
balance got taken
 

1975
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,630
balance got taken
okay so he can't

1976
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:34,640
okay so he can't
 

1977
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,510
okay so he can't
he can't go forward because i didn't do

1978
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:37,520
he can't go forward because i didn't do
 

1979
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:37,750
he can't go forward because i didn't do
a

1980
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:37,760
a
 

1981
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,990
a
yield like you guys an external leap

1982
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:40,000
yield like you guys an external leap
 

1983
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,030
yield like you guys an external leap
based heal

1984
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:41,040
based heal
 

1985
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,349
based heal
there's a ground vector here so he can't

1986
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:43,359
there's a ground vector here so he can't
 

1987
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,630
there's a ground vector here so he can't
go forward

1988
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:44,640
go forward
 

1989
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,750
go forward
okay so push forward and he'll be

1990
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:47,760
okay so push forward and he'll be
 

1991
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,870
okay so push forward and he'll be
projected out

1992
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:48,880
projected out
 

1993
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,109
projected out
he's pushed into the ground and there's

1994
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:51,119
he's pushed into the ground and there's
 

1995
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:51,990
he's pushed into the ground and there's
the kokyu

1996
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:52,000
the kokyu
 

1997
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,589
the kokyu
is inside the ikea adhesion so

1998
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:55,599
is inside the ikea adhesion so
 

1999
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,829
is inside the ikea adhesion so
he's going to push hard and he gets

2000
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:57,839
he's going to push hard and he gets
 

2001
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,910
he's going to push hard and he gets
displaced it's no different than we're

2002
00:48:59,910 --> 00:48:59,920
displaced it's no different than we're
 

2003
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,470
displaced it's no different than we're
here

2004
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:00,480
here
 

2005
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,950
here
and he pushes push hard and he gets

2006
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:02,960
and he pushes push hard and he gets
 

2007
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,870
and he pushes push hard and he gets
displaced do you understand

2008
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:04,880
displaced do you understand
 

2009
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,910
displaced do you understand
so he's here and

2010
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:07,920
so he's here and
 

2011
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,470
so he's here and
it's that cool cue inside the ik

2012
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:10,480
it's that cool cue inside the ik
 

2013
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,430
it's that cool cue inside the ik
adhesion

2014
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:11,440
adhesion
 

2015
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,870
adhesion
that starts the rotation okay

2016
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:14,880
that starts the rotation okay
 

2017
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,230
that starts the rotation okay
but at the same time if he pulls out

2018
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:18,240
but at the same time if he pulls out
 

2019
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,710
but at the same time if he pulls out
then the ik adhesion will take little

2020
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:20,720
then the ik adhesion will take little
 

2021
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,790
then the ik adhesion will take little
continuous disorganization

2022
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:22,800

okay it's not it's not
shove that down as at the contact point

2050
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:04,319
shove that down as at the contact point
 

2051
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:08,150
shove that down as at the contact point
i'm moving his body

2052
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:08,160

 

2053
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,589

with the adhesion with the adhesion so

2054
00:50:11,589 --> 00:50:11,599
with the adhesion with the adhesion so
 

2055
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,710
with the adhesion with the adhesion so
i do the whole thing with the adhesion

2056
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:14,720
i do the whole thing with the adhesion
 

2057

so as as he tries to regain his balance
 

2059
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,390
so as as he tries to regain his balance
it just takes his balance more away do

2060
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:20,400
it just takes his balance more away do
 

2061
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,430
it just takes his balance more away do
you see that

2062
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:21,440
you see that
 

2063
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,829
you see that
all right now here we are again same

thing
 

2067
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,030
thing
if you try i i have an adhesion here and

2068
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:29,040
if you try i i have an adhesion here and
 

2069
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,710

it looks like i'm pushing down
 

2071
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,430
it looks like i'm pushing down
but i have another adhesion here so as

2072
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:33,440
but i have another adhesion here so as
 

2073
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,750
