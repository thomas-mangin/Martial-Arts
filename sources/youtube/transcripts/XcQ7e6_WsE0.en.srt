on that side so there's a little body
 

109
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,789
on that side so there's a little body
you see and then this arm would already

110

you see and then this arm would already
 

111
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,990
you see and then this arm would already
be here you see how he's going that way

112
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
be here you see how he's going that way
 

113
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,229
be here you see how he's going that way
now you see that and that's where this

114
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
now you see that and that's where this

tonden field moves okay I don't just do
 

187
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,390
tonden field moves okay I don't just do

my arm about there do you

216
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
my arm about there do you
 

217
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,309
my arm about there do you
see but it's in the in my torso moving

00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
see but it's in the in my torso moving
 

219
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,110
see but it's in the in my torso moving
okay and then on your

220
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,120
okay and then on your
 

221
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,430
okay and then on your
question is well that that would be the

222
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
question is well that that would be the
 

223
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,550
question is well that that would be the
that would be the

225
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,189

external side of this

226
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:48,199
external side of this
 

227
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,870
external side of this
dualism which is really a monism okay

228
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:51,880
dualism which is really a monism okay
 

229
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,790
dualism which is really a monism okay
but there there's the internal side

230
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:53,800
but there there's the internal side
 

231
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,909
but there there's the internal side
which is yours so I don't I'm not

232
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:56,919
which is yours so I don't I'm not
 

233
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:00,110
which is yours so I don't I'm not
pulling him that would be my outer Delta

234
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,120
pulling him that would be my outer Delta
 

235
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,070
pulling him that would be my outer Delta
okay so um he had a pressure there's a

236
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,080
okay so um he had a pressure there's a
 

237
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,830
okay so um he had a pressure there's a
pressure that he had whatever it is

238
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
pressure that he had whatever it is
 

239
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,909
pressure that he had whatever it is
let's say it's X so I match X I don't

240
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
let's say it's X so I match X I don't
 

241
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:20,110
let's say it's X so I match X I don't
make a x + y or a x - y on the yin hand

242
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,120
make a x + y or a x - y on the yin hand
 

243
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,070
make a x + y or a x - y on the yin hand
so that pressure goes and then we're

244
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,080
so that pressure goes and then we're
 

245
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,150
so that pressure goes and then we're
stuck now okay so if he wants to go do

246
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,160
stuck now okay so if he wants to go do
 

247
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,909
stuck now okay so if he wants to go do
you feel that pressure it's just on that

248
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:28,919
you feel that pressure it's just on that
 

249
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,110
you feel that pressure it's just on that
finger

250
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,120
finger
 

251
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,189
finger
at the moment so on just that finger you

252
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:34,199
at the moment so on just that finger you
 

253
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,230
at the moment so on just that finger you
could open your grip so people could see

254
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:37,240
could open your grip so people could see
 

255
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,390
could open your grip so people could see
so just on that finger I could put him

256
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
so just on that finger I could put him
 

257
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,710
so just on that finger I could put him
back well of course then I could make

258
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
back well of course then I could make
 

259
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,909
back well of course then I could make
him go in the direction that he was

260
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
him go in the direction that he was
 

261
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,149
him go in the direction that he was
going but that's not

262
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:49,159
going but that's not
 

263
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,189
going but that's not
pulling we're

264
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:51,199
pulling we're
 

265
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,749
pulling we're
stuck for me to

266
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
stuck for me to
 

267
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,710
stuck for me to
pull he has to be trying to go in the

268
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
pull he has to be trying to go in the
 

269
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,869
pull he has to be trying to go in the
other direction do you see

270
00:07:59,869 --> 00:07:59,879
other direction do you see
 

271
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,550
other direction do you see
but it's not me getting out of the

272
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
but it's not me getting out of the
 

273
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,710
but it's not me getting out of the
way because that would be me just moving

274
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
way because that would be me just moving
 

275
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,550
way because that would be me just moving
in that direction him moving in that

276
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
in that direction him moving in that
 

277
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,950
in that direction him moving in that
direction there's still him him and me

278
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:11,960
direction there's still him him and me
 

279
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,350
direction there's still him him and me
in in the adhesion there is no there's

280
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
in in the adhesion there is no there's
 

281
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,990
in in the adhesion there is no there's
not a him and I okay so see in other

282
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,000
not a him and I okay so see in other
 

283
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,589
not a him and I okay so see in other
words so if he uh if I get out of the

284
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:22,599
words so if he uh if I get out of the
 

285
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:25,510
words so if he uh if I get out of the
way you push and I get out of the way

286
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
way you push and I get out of the way
 

287
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,469
way you push and I get out of the way
you see his balance but if he pushes and

288
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
you see his balance but if he pushes and
 

289
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,589
you see his balance but if he pushes and
then stops really quick you see that's

290
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
then stops really quick you see that's
 

291
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,949
then stops really quick you see that's
different but if we come around and he

292
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:33,959
different but if we come around and he
 

293
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,750
different but if we come around and he
tries to go backwards he just increases

294
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:36,760
tries to go backwards he just increases
 

295
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,670
tries to go backwards he just increases
that I adhesion because there's more

296
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
that I adhesion because there's more
 

297
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,269
that I adhesion because there's more
power in it so whatever X

298
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
power in it so whatever X
 

299
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,150
power in it so whatever X
is I still match X but that X is a much

300
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
is I still match X but that X is a much
 

301
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,350
is I still match X but that X is a much
more energized X than the first one so

302
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,360
more energized X than the first one so
 

303
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,829
more energized X than the first one so
that's why it works he can't pull out

304
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:54,839
that's why it works he can't pull out
 

305
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,190
that's why it works he can't pull out
okay so I'm not pulling I'm

306
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,200
okay so I'm not pulling I'm
 

307
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,910
okay so I'm not pulling I'm
adhering

308
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
adhering
 

309
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,990
adhering
this is why I don't have to grip it I

310
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
this is why I don't have to grip it I
 

311
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,230
this is why I don't have to grip it I
don't have to cut it I here and I move

312
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:05,240
don't have to cut it I here and I move
 

313
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,670
don't have to cut it I here and I move
my hand here that's all I do okay on the

314
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:08,680
my hand here that's all I do okay on the
 

315
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,509
my hand here that's all I do okay on the
C part which is important for C

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
stick and make sure that he keeps going
 

331
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,350
stick and make sure that he keeps going
where I want him to go at the rate I

332
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
where I want him to go at the rate I
 

333
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,829
where I want him to go at the rate I
want him to go at the moment I want him

334
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:44,839
want him to go at the moment I want him
 

335
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,949
want him to go at the moment I want him
to go and what I'm going to

336
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:47,959
to go and what I'm going to
 

337
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,829
to go and what I'm going to
do is take that

338
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:50,839
do is take that
 

339
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,910
do is take that
energy into this hand and so he hits

340
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:54,920
energy into this hand and so he hits
 

341
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,949
energy into this hand and so he hits
that hand

342
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
that hand
 

343
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,350
that hand
boom and that's your Co

344
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:00,360
boom and that's your Co
 

345
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,750
boom and that's your Co
so

346
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:02,760
so
 

347
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,590
so
here it's just like um you're throwing

348
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:06,600
here it's just like um you're throwing
 

349
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,110
here it's just like um you're throwing
the ball into or the orange on your

350
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
the ball into or the orange on your
 

351
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,230
the ball into or the orange on your
bicep kind of thing only I don't move my

352
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,240
bicep kind of thing only I don't move my
 

353
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,630
bicep kind of thing only I don't move my
arm back it's kind of like that I'm

354
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:13,640
arm back it's kind of like that I'm
 

355
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,389
arm back it's kind of like that I'm
making him hit that ground

356
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:17,399
making him hit that ground
 

357
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,670
making him hit that ground
vector and he goes out so it's not

358
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:20,680
vector and he goes out so it's not
 

359
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,750
vector and he goes out so it's not
sometimes if you see my hand go just cuz

360
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:22,760
sometimes if you see my hand go just cuz
 

361
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,509
sometimes if you see my hand go just cuz
I I want to stick to him you see so when

362
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:26,519
I I want to stick to him you see so when
 

363
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,750
I I want to stick to him you see so when
he goes when he goes up I I get that

364
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:28,760
he goes when he goes up I I get that
 

365
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,310
he goes when he goes up I I get that
same the other R don't confuse that

366
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
same the other R don't confuse that
 

367
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:41,470
same the other R don't confuse that
though this is totally

368
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:41,480

 

369
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,710

different you make him hit that hand

370
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
different you make him hit that hand
 

371
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,750
different you make him hit that hand
that hand takes the energy it goes down

372
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:46,760
that hand takes the energy it goes down
 

373
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,430
that hand takes the energy it goes down
it bounces back out that hand and so now

374
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
it bounces back out that hand and so now
 

375
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,190
it bounces back out that hand and so now
you have your kazushi pattern that

376
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,200
you have your kazushi pattern that
 

377
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,430
you have your kazushi pattern that
spiraling rotating cross which means if

378
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
spiraling rotating cross which means if
 

379
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,629
spiraling rotating cross which means if
I were to stop the pattern one of those

380
00:10:58,629 --> 00:10:58,639
I were to stop the pattern one of those
 

381
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,670
I were to stop the pattern one of those
lines of the Cross is going that way

382
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
lines of the Cross is going that way
 

383
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,790
lines of the Cross is going that way
well that means the other line is going

384
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:03,800
well that means the other line is going
 

385
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,509
well that means the other line is going
that way do you see they don't both go

386
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
that way do you see they don't both go
 

387
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,670
that way do you see they don't both go
the same

388
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:10,680

 

389
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,230

way just like in the bump

390
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
way just like in the bump
 

391
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,829
way just like in the bump
sweep okay so this hand goes that way

392
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
sweep okay so this hand goes that way
 

393
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,670
sweep okay so this hand goes that way
and then there has to be another

394
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:20,680
and then there has to be another
 

395
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,110
and then there has to be another
projecting force that

396
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
projecting force that
 

397
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,269
projecting force that
way that's what I

398
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:26,279
way that's what I
 

399
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:33,590
way that's what I
do okay so try it again

400
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600

 

401
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,110

okay in this second one uh we're going

402
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,120
okay in this second one uh we're going
 

403
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,269
okay in this second one uh we're going
to take that hand

404
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:40,279

 

405
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,829

youing we're going take that coo

406
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:44,839
youing we're going take that coo
 

407
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:49,190
youing we're going take that coo
hand but this sound is going to be

408
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200

 

409
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,629

another so it's not a lock he comes into

410
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:53,639
another so it's not a lock he comes into
 

411
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,190
another so it's not a lock he comes into
it you

412
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
it you
 

413
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,590
it you
see so just like he's coming into that

414
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:58,600
see so just like he's coming into that
 

415
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,350
see so just like he's coming into that
one on the last technique he's going to

416
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
one on the last technique he's going to
 

417
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,430
one on the last technique he's going to
come into that one so this this hand is

418
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:06,440
come into that one so this this hand is
 

419
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,870
come into that one so this this hand is
is kind of throwing him you see it's

420
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
is kind of throwing him you see it's
 

421
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,350
is kind of throwing him you see it's
kind of this is now your adhesion if you

422
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
kind of this is now your adhesion if you
 

423
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,269
kind of this is now your adhesion if you
pay attention so I go in

424
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:14,279
pay attention so I go in
 

425
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,670
pay attention so I go in
here once I am here then this hand comes

426
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:18,680
here once I am here then this hand comes
 

427
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,790
here once I am here then this hand comes
this

428
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:19,800
this
 

429
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,870
this
way and then he's going to hit pop a lot

430
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
way and then he's going to hit pop a lot
 

431
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,870
way and then he's going to hit pop a lot
you understand so do you understand you

432
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:27,880
you understand so do you understand you
 

433
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,230
you understand so do you understand you
look confused okay so I was using this

434
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
look confused okay so I was using this
 

435
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,470
look confused okay so I was using this
hand to bring and load him boom onto

436
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
hand to bring and load him boom onto
 

437
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,949
hand to bring and load him boom onto
this hand this time I'm using the first

438
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:39,959
this hand this time I'm using the first
 

439
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,710
this hand this time I'm using the first
hand but I'm not energetically using it

440
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
hand but I'm not energetically using it
 

441
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,829
hand but I'm not energetically using it
the same way it goes there and throws

442
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
the same way it goes there and throws
 

443
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,829
the same way it goes there and throws
him into the lock so this

444
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839
him into the lock so this
 

445
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,150
him into the lock so this
hand has the same shape as the first one

446
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
hand has the same shape as the first one
 

447
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,670
hand has the same shape as the first one
but does not have the same energetic

448
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:56,680
but does not have the same energetic
 

449
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,590
but does not have the same energetic
value of the first one it has has the I

450
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
value of the first one it has has the I
 

451
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,550
value of the first one it has has the I
adhesion of the yin hand in the first

452
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
adhesion of the yin hand in the first
 

453
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,310
adhesion of the yin hand in the first
you see this Yin hand loaded the young

454
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
you see this Yin hand loaded the young
 

455
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,670
you see this Yin hand loaded the young
hand this hand now loads Boom the young

456
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:12,680
hand this hand now loads Boom the young
 

457
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,629
hand this hand now loads Boom the young
hand same shape different value okay

458
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
hand same shape different value okay
 

459
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,670
hand same shape different value okay
let's

460
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680

 

461
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,710

try Okay so the the other hand came here

462
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:23,720
try Okay so the the other hand came here
 

463
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,430
try Okay so the the other hand came here
on the first tech R threw him in okay

464
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
on the first tech R threw him in okay
 

465
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,670
on the first tech R threw him in okay
this time it goes here and it keeps

466
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
this time it goes here and it keeps
 

467
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,030
this time it goes here and it keeps
going this

468
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
going this
 

469
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,470
going this
way again it's an adhesion so he lets go

470
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:35,480
way again it's an adhesion so he lets go
 

471
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,069
way again it's an adhesion so he lets go
it's not it's not that he's hold on to

472
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
it's not it's not that he's hold on to
 

473
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,269
it's not it's not that he's hold on to
me can let go he lets go it's still

474
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
me can let go he lets go it's still
 

475
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,590
me can let go he lets go it's still
going to work

476
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
going to work
 

477
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,870
going to work
okay so just note that I I'm going to

478
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:47,880
okay so just note that I I'm going to
 

479
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,749
okay so just note that I I'm going to
have to move my body because I move both

480
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:50,759
have to move my body because I move both
 

481
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,590
have to move my body because I move both
my body and my tund field in IO my body

482
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:54,600
my body and my tund field in IO my body
 

483
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,269
my body and my tund field in IO my body
moves okay down I'm there and my body my

484
00:13:58,269 --> 00:13:58,279
moves okay down I'm there and my body my
 

485
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,470
moves okay down I'm there and my body my
feel

486
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
feel
 

487
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,550
feel
rotate then this hand is going to do

488
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:03,560
rotate then this hand is going to do
 

489
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,069
rotate then this hand is going to do
very similar thing cuz it doesn't want

490
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
very similar thing cuz it doesn't want
 

491
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,910
very similar thing cuz it doesn't want
to contest and it wants to find that Nel

rebound watch as I increase this hand
 

523
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,230
rebound watch as I increase this hand
into this

524
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,240
into this

hand that's what does it okay don't come
 

527
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,189
hand that's what does it okay don't come
around and

528
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
around and
 

529
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,629

again so the obvious thing to do is to

534
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:22,519
again so the obvious thing to do is to
 

535
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,949
again so the obvious thing to do is to
push

536

push
 

537
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,509

pull it's it's very obvious but why is

538
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
pull it's it's very obvious but why is
 

539
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,389
pull it's it's very obvious but why is
it obvious why

540
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:29,399
it obvious why
 

541
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,710
it obvious why
why is that all I can see why is that

542
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:31,720
why is that all I can see why is that
 

543
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,309
why is that all I can see why is that
all I can understand why does that come

544
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:35,319
all I can understand why does that come
 

545
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:38,670
all I can understand why does that come
to me more why do I I believe that's all

546
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:38,680
to me more why do I I believe that's all
 

547
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,910
to me more why do I I believe that's all
there is because that is the structure

548
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
there is because that is the structure
 

549
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,749
there is because that is the structure

it's dichotomy that's how it works okay

552
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
it's dichotomy that's how it works okay
 

553
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,110
it's dichotomy that's how it works okay
so same thing as I'm doing the second

554
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,120
so same thing as I'm doing the second
 

555
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,590
so same thing as I'm doing the second
technique you're like I can see the

556
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600
technique you're like I can see the
 

557
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,309
technique you're like I can see the
push so I want to push but even in the

558
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:01,319
push so I want to push but even in the
 

559
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:04,030
push so I want to push but even in the
first technique as you came

560
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,040
first technique as you came
 

561
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,749
first technique as you came
around I'm making him boom hit hits me

562
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:08,759
around I'm making him boom hit hits me
 

563
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,790
around I'm making him boom hit hits me
you see he bounc off me I didn't push

564
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:11,800
you see he bounc off me I didn't push
 

565
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,790
you see he bounc off me I didn't push
him

566
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:13,800
him
 

567
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,430
him
right it's exactly the same in the

568
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:16,440
right it's exactly the same in the
 

569
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,990
right it's exactly the same in the
second one as I come around

570
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,000
second one as I come around
 

571
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,150
second one as I come around
here I'm not going to do two

572
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
here I'm not going to do two
 

573
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,990
here I'm not going to do two
pushes this hand makes him come into it

574
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000
pushes this hand makes him come into it
 

575
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,389
pushes this hand makes him come into it
so if you pay attention I have my x

576
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:31,399
so if you pay attention I have my x
 

577
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,749
so if you pay attention I have my x
pattern

578
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:32,759
pattern
 

579
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,790
pattern
again this hand is going to make him his

580
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:35,800
again this hand is going to make him his
 

581
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:43,710
again this hand is going to make him his
head go around this

582
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:43,720

 

583
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,949

way this hand is the X P going that way

584
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:47,959
way this hand is the X P going that way
 

585
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:51,829
way this hand is the X P going that way
you see as I bring him into

586
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839

 

587
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,150

it there's not two hands going like

588
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
it there's not two hands going like
 

589
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,910
it there's not two hands going like
this one hand is going this way

590
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
this one hand is going this way
 

591
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,990
this one hand is going this way
and one hand is going that way and I

592
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,000
and one hand is going that way and I
 

593
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,150
and one hand is going that way and I
combine the

594
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:05,160
combine the
 

595
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,669
combine the
two okay and again if you watch the

596
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:08,679
two okay and again if you watch the
 

597
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,350
two okay and again if you watch the
projecting

598
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:10,360
projecting
 

599
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,870
projecting
hand I won't do what I do is I train

600
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:13,880
hand I won't do what I do is I train
 

601
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,110
hand I won't do what I do is I train
myself so as I train myself as I pop him

602
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,120
myself so as I train myself as I pop him
 

603
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,189
myself so as I train myself as I pop him
I stick to him so you see my hand go

604
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
I stick to him so you see my hand go
 

605
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,270
I stick to him so you see my hand go
away and you think that that projected

606
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
away and you think that that projected
 

607
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,829
away and you think that that projected
him again what I'm doing is just getting

608
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
him again what I'm doing is just getting
 

609
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,909
him again what I'm doing is just getting
more reps on connection

610
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919
more reps on connection
 

611
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,789
more reps on connection
but I won't have that hand do that this

612
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
but I won't have that hand do that this
 

613
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,110
but I won't have that hand do that this
time and just here it just stays here

614
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,120
time and just here it just stays here
 

615
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,909
time and just here it just stays here
and you can see the direction that that

616
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
and you can see the direction that that
 

617
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,549
and you can see the direction that that
hand is going they're not on the same

618
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559
hand is going they're not on the same
 

619
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,590
hand is going they're not on the same
path and this one's not going out

620
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:44,600
path and this one's not going out
 

621
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,440
path and this one's not going out
okay try again
