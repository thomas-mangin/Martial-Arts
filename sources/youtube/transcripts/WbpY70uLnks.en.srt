00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:11,160
another one of these big ones so the
 

9
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,990
another one of these big ones so the
I've been kind of doing them the order

10
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,000
I've been kind of doing them the order
 

11
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,669
I've been kind of doing them the order
of hardest to understand or most

12
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:15,679
of hardest to understand or most
 

13
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,630
of hardest to understand or most
confusing or most involved um kokun is a

very pivotal throw to iido it could be

16
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:22,039
very pivotal throw to iido it could be
 

17
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,630
very pivotal throw to iido it could be
pivotal because a lot of schools call

18
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
pivotal because a lot of schools call
 

19
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,830
pivotal because a lot of schools call
whatever throw they do the most a CAG so

20
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
whatever throw they do the most a CAG so
 

21
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,669
whatever throw they do the most a CAG so
you can be in one school and they'll say

22
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
you can be in one school and they'll say
 

23
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,910
you can be in one school and they'll say
hey this this is a CAG and then that's

24
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
hey this this is a CAG and then that's
 

25
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,430
hey this this is a CAG and then that's
not the same throw in another school at

26
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:34,440
not the same throw in another school at
 

27
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,350
not the same throw in another school at
all uh I personally believe that's

28
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
all uh I personally believe that's
 

29
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,830
all uh I personally believe that's
because of what I think C you means and

30
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:40,840
because of what I think C you means and
 

31
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,270
because of what I think C you means and
when you hear me saying this right now

this this is just how I interpret it it
 

37
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,510

um they're called CAG so any throw you

52
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
um they're called CAG so any throw you
 

53
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,510
um they're called CAG so any throw you
do really well you could call it KAG now

54
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:12,520
do really well you could call it KAG now
 

55
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,990
do really well you could call it KAG now
why it's called koku and meaning breath

56
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,000
why it's called koku and meaning breath
 

57
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,149
why it's called koku and meaning breath
that seems weird but it's because I

cages are throws that should be done

92
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:56,680
cages are throws that should be done

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
coku for kokun nag then it has to look a
 

99
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,910

certain way because if it doesn't look
 

101
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,590
certain way because if it doesn't look
that way it's super confusing to new

102
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
that way it's super confusing to new
 

103
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,070
that way it's super confusing to new
people so if you explain to new people

104
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
people so if you explain to new people
 

105
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,270
people so if you explain to new people
that cages are throws that are done from

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
a calm ready position that's really not
 

109
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,470
a calm ready position that's really not
helpful to a brand new person so I use a

110
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
helpful to a brand new person so I use a
 

111
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,150
helpful to a brand new person so I use a
specific form it matches up with the

112
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
specific form it matches up with the
 

113
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,670
specific form it matches up with the
major iwama CAG and I say that with a

114
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
major iwama CAG and I say that with a
 

115
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,390
major iwama CAG and I say that with a
smile because um in in iwama KAG could

116
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:29,400
smile because um in in iwama KAG could
 

117
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,630
smile because um in in iwama KAG could
be a whole bunch of different things but

118
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:31,640
be a whole bunch of different things but
 

119
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,589
be a whole bunch of different things but
the main KAG is the one that I call KAG

120
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
the main KAG is the one that I call KAG
 

121
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,070
the main KAG is the one that I call KAG
and I limit our school to just that and

122
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,080
and I limit our school to just that and
 

123
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,949
and I limit our school to just that and
it's a side by-side throw I'll get Josh

124
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
it's a side by-side throw I'll get Josh
 

125

Josh all right let's talk about KAG so

134
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:02,599
Josh all right let's talk about KAG so
 

135
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,589
Josh all right let's talk about KAG so
the throw that I call KAG is a side

136
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
the throw that I call KAG is a side
 

137
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,229
the throw that I call KAG is a side
by-side throw like this where I come in

138
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
by-side throw like this where I come in
 

139
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,830
by-side throw like this where I come in
through like this and I throw the guy

140
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
through like this and I throw the guy
 

141
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,789
through like this and I throw the guy
right and I think a lot of schools call

142
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:11,799
right and I think a lot of schools call
 

143
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,670
right and I think a lot of schools call
that KAG um there are major exceptions

144
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:14,680
that KAG um there are major exceptions
 

145
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,030
that KAG um there are major exceptions
like damic sphere has that listed as an

146
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
like damic sphere has that listed as an
 

147
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,670
like damic sphere has that listed as an
ed nag and not a KAG the naming

148
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
ed nag and not a KAG the naming
 

149
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,830
ed nag and not a KAG the naming
convention is probably because you make

150
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
convention is probably because you make
 

151
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,869
convention is probably because you make
an EDI on it right so if Josh I here

152
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,879
an EDI on it right so if Josh I here
 

153
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,270
an EDI on it right so if Josh I here
side by side to get into there I have to

154
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,280
side by side to get into there I have to
 

155
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,149
side by side to get into there I have to
Ed me in to get into Josh and so that

156
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:29,159
Ed me in to get into Josh and so that
 

157
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,869
Ed me in to get into Josh and so that
makes perfect sense I I think you could

158
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:31,879
makes perfect sense I I think you could
 

159
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,949
makes perfect sense I I think you could
call these things all every anything you

160
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:33,959
call these things all every anything you
 

161
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,589
call these things all every anything you
wanted you could call them A B and C

162
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
wanted you could call them A B and C
 

163
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,070
wanted you could call them A B and C
throw if you wanted right um so the name

164
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
throw if you wanted right um so the name
 

165
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,630
throw if you wanted right um so the name
doesn't really matter as far as the

166
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
doesn't really matter as far as the
 

167
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,149
doesn't really matter as far as the
technical form goes except the fact that

168
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:43,159
technical form goes except the fact that
 

169
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,070
technical form goes except the fact that
we all call it the same thing so when

170
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,080
we all call it the same thing so when
 

171
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,070
we all call it the same thing so when
I'm referring to a CAG that's what I

172
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,080
I'm referring to a CAG that's what I
 

173
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,229
I'm referring to a CAG that's what I
mean by it all right now what makes a

174
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:49,239
mean by it all right now what makes a
 

175
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,350
mean by it all right now what makes a
CAG come off a CAG comes off because and

176
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
CAG come off a CAG comes off because and
 

177
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,030
CAG come off a CAG comes off because and
let's go actually let's go sideways to

178
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
let's go actually let's go sideways to
 

179
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,990
let's go actually let's go sideways to
the camera here because I step behind

180
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
the camera here because I step behind
 

181
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,429
the camera here because I step behind
his lower body and put my arm across the

182
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:00,439
his lower body and put my arm across the
 

183
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,030
his lower body and put my arm across the
front of his body and I split him in two

184
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,040
front of his body and I split him in two
 

185
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,990
front of his body and I split him in two
and when Josh is split in two like this

186
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
and when Josh is split in two like this
 

187
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,309
and when Josh is split in two like this
it's really really hard for him to stay

188
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
it's really really hard for him to stay
 

189
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,910
it's really really hard for him to stay
standing now different teachers will

190
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:08,920
standing now different teachers will
 

191
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,069
standing now different teachers will
emphasize different ways to do this and

192
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:12,079
emphasize different ways to do this and
 

193
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:13,990
emphasize different ways to do this and
sometimes there's lots of arguments

194
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
sometimes there's lots of arguments
 

195
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,870
sometimes there's lots of arguments
between Styles because um this way must

196
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:17,880
between Styles because um this way must
 

197
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,830
between Styles because um this way must
be right or that way must be right I'm

198
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
be right or that way must be right I'm
 

199
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,270
be right or that way must be right I'm
going to give you an overview of a few

200
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
going to give you an overview of a few
 

201
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,990
going to give you an overview of a few
of them and you can decide for yourself

202
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,000
of them and you can decide for yourself
 

203
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,510
of them and you can decide for yourself
which ones you want to do I think in

204
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:24,520
which ones you want to do I think in
 

205
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,150
which ones you want to do I think in
truth they're all situational sometimes

206
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,160
truth they're all situational sometimes
 

207
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,870
truth they're all situational sometimes
uh one works out better than another in

208
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
uh one works out better than another in
 

209
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,990
uh one works out better than another in
different situations the basic one that

210
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,000
different situations the basic one that
 

211
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,150
different situations the basic one that
I used to work on that I like the most

212
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,160
I used to work on that I like the most
 

213
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,990
I used to work on that I like the most
was sinking lower than him here right so

214
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
was sinking lower than him here right so
 

215
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,510
was sinking lower than him here right so
I really emphasize getting your hips

216
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
I really emphasize getting your hips
 

217
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,749
I really emphasize getting your hips
lower than his hips and cutting them as

218
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
lower than his hips and cutting them as
 

219
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,350
lower than his hips and cutting them as
far forward as you can and then when

220
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
far forward as you can and then when
 

221
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,070
far forward as you can and then when
that's done just Naturally by turning

222
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
that's done just Naturally by turning
 

223
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,270
that's done just Naturally by turning
here we get a CAG okay and so that's the

224
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
here we get a CAG okay and so that's the
 

225
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,950
here we get a CAG okay and so that's the
one that when I was working on my cagot

226
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
one that when I was working on my cagot
 

227
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,390
one that when I was working on my cagot
and I very first started teaching that

228
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
and I very first started teaching that
 

229
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,710
and I very first started teaching that
was the one I did the most because I

230
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:53,720
was the one I did the most because I
 

231
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,749
was the one I did the most because I
thought it was the coolest it required

232
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
thought it was the coolest it required
 

233
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,189
thought it was the coolest it required
the least amount of force and and got

234
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:58,199
the least amount of force and and got
 

235
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,870
the least amount of force and and got
the job done really nicely I thought it

236
00:04:59,870 --> 00:04:59,880
the job done really nicely I thought it
 

237
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,950
the job done really nicely I thought it
was really great there are lots of

238
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:01,960
was really great there are lots of
 

239
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,749
was really great there are lots of
reasons why that one might not work one

240
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:04,759
reasons why that one might not work one
 

241
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,230
reasons why that one might not work one
is if you got a guy with really low Bas

242
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:07,240
is if you got a guy with really low Bas
 

243
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,990
is if you got a guy with really low Bas
right so so let's just imagine I'm way

244
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,000
right so so let's just imagine I'm way
 

245
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,909
right so so let's just imagine I'm way
taller than Josh I am not so let's

246
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:10,919
taller than Josh I am not so let's
 

247
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,749
taller than Josh I am not so let's
imagine and so this is as low as I can

248
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:12,759
imagine and so this is as low as I can
 

249
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,150
imagine and so this is as low as I can
get right I can't do that throw that's

250
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,160
get right I can't do that throw that's
 

251
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,950
get right I can't do that throw that's
an impossible way to do this throw now

252
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:17,960
an impossible way to do this throw now
 

253
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,390
an impossible way to do this throw now
there are other versions that could be

254
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:19,400
there are other versions that could be
 

255
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,350
there are other versions that could be
done where I emphasize a Timmy up top

256
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,360
done where I emphasize a Timmy up top
 

257
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,749
done where I emphasize a Timmy up top
and you see I drove his upper body over

258
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:24,759
and you see I drove his upper body over
 

259
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,629
and you see I drove his upper body over
and I don't get much on his lower body

260
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
and I don't get much on his lower body
 

261
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,749
and I don't get much on his lower body
because I can't get under it in that way

262
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:28,759
because I can't get under it in that way
 

263
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,390
because I can't get under it in that way
so I just kind of stick my foot back

264
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
so I just kind of stick my foot back
 

265
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,029
so I just kind of stick my foot back
there and I go through with my upper

266
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:32,039
there and I go through with my upper
 

267
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,990
there and I go through with my upper
body and I can get him to bend with my

268
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
body and I can get him to bend with my
 

269
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,469
body and I can get him to bend with my
upper body coming in that could be done

270
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:35,479
upper body coming in that could be done
 

271
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:37,230
upper body coming in that could be done
with the elbow or with the hand if you

272
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,240
with the elbow or with the hand if you
 

273
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,309
with the elbow or with the hand if you
do it with the hand a lot of times that

274
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:38,319
do it with the hand a lot of times that
 

275
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,990
do it with the hand a lot of times that
can lead into juji nag but that's

276
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
can lead into juji nag but that's
 

277
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,830
can lead into juji nag but that's
another video um so so that's another

278
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:42,840
another video um so so that's another
 

279
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,230
another video um so so that's another
way to do it and a lot of times you'll

280
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
way to do it and a lot of times you'll
 

281
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,189
way to do it and a lot of times you'll
see this in teachers where they're

282
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:46,199
see this in teachers where they're
 

283
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,950
see this in teachers where they're
really emphasizing this part I

284
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
really emphasizing this part I
 

285
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,830
really emphasizing this part I
originally thought that was bad because

286
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
originally thought that was bad because
 

287
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,790
originally thought that was bad because
it was like oh it's terrible to hit or

288
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
it was like oh it's terrible to hit or
 

289
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,909
it was like oh it's terrible to hit or
something I don't know what I thought

290
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
something I don't know what I thought
 

291
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,749
something I don't know what I thought
but but it's just another way to get

292
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:56,759
but but it's just another way to get
 

293
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,070
but but it's just another way to get
them to bend backwards and the way you

294
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
them to bend backwards and the way you
 

295
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,029
them to bend backwards and the way you
should think about these throws is how

296
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:00,039
should think about these throws is how
 

297
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,710
should think about these throws is how
do I cut his legs One Direction and his

298
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
do I cut his legs One Direction and his
 

299
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,390
do I cut his legs One Direction and his
upper body the other direction and

300
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
upper body the other direction and
 

301
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,990
upper body the other direction and
that's what makes the caga happen so

302
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,000
that's what makes the caga happen so
 

303
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,390
that's what makes the caga happen so
however that can happen you could do it

304
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:09,400
however that can happen you could do it
 

305
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,309
however that can happen you could do it
as simply as having a foot back here and

306
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:11,319
as simply as having a foot back here and
 

307
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,350
as simply as having a foot back here and
a hand coming up here because that gets

308
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
a hand coming up here because that gets
 

309
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,189
a hand coming up here because that gets
the same split in the body which is a

310
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:16,199
the same split in the body which is a
 

311
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,670
the same split in the body which is a
really natural way to make him fall down

312
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
really natural way to make him fall down
 

313
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,510
really natural way to make him fall down
if his feet stay in front and his uh

314
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
if his feet stay in front and his uh
 

315
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,350
if his feet stay in front and his uh
upper body goes behind then that will

316
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
upper body goes behind then that will
 

317
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,950
upper body goes behind then that will
get a cun nagate to come off um the main

318
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
get a cun nagate to come off um the main
 

319
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,990
get a cun nagate to come off um the main
things that you want to try and

320
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
things that you want to try and
 

321
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,350
things that you want to try and
emphasize are that hip connection right

322
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,360
emphasize are that hip connection right
 

323
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,350
emphasize are that hip connection right
cuz this will do it better right so if I

324
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:30,360
cuz this will do it better right so if I
 

325
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,710
cuz this will do it better right so if I
can bump that hip a lot of times I see

326
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
can bump that hip a lot of times I see
 

327
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,909
can bump that hip a lot of times I see
people having trouble with their CAG

328
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:34,919
people having trouble with their CAG
 

329
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,830
people having trouble with their CAG
it's because they're not going through

330
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
it's because they're not going through
 

331
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,469
it's because they're not going through
his hips so when I push my hips into his

332
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
his hips so when I push my hips into his
 

333
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,990
his hips so when I push my hips into his
hips his hips have to go somewhere and

334
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,000
hips his hips have to go somewhere and
 

335
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,710
hips his hips have to go somewhere and
so unless he's really rigidly locked his

336
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:45,720
so unless he's really rigidly locked his
 

337
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,390
so unless he's really rigidly locked his
hips are going to start moving away and

338
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,400
hips are going to start moving away and
 

339
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,029
hips are going to start moving away and
if I time that with his upper body

340
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
if I time that with his upper body
 

341
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,749
if I time that with his upper body
turning he's probably going to fall but

342
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:50,759
turning he's probably going to fall but
 

343
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,550
turning he's probably going to fall but
remember in iido even if he doesn't fall

344
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
remember in iido even if he doesn't fall
 

345
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,029
remember in iido even if he doesn't fall
who cares as long as he stumbles away

346
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:54,039
who cares as long as he stumbles away
 

347
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,589
who cares as long as he stumbles away
from me I made the distance which is

348
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
from me I made the distance which is
 

349
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,230
from me I made the distance which is
what nag waza is for all right now as I

350
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
what nag waza is for all right now as I
 

351
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,110
what nag waza is for all right now as I
said if I was pushing in into his hips

352
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,120
said if I was pushing in into his hips
 

353
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,029
said if I was pushing in into his hips
come over here for me okay so as I'm

354
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:02,039
come over here for me okay so as I'm
 

355
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,790
come over here for me okay so as I'm
pushing into his hips let's say he

356
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:03,800
pushing into his hips let's say he
 

357
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,909
pushing into his hips let's say he
braces himself against this right so I

358
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
braces himself against this right so I
 

359
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,230
braces himself against this right so I
go to move his hips and oh they got

360
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,240
go to move his hips and oh they got
 

361
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,749
go to move his hips and oh they got
solid if I sink under those suddenly

362
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:10,759
solid if I sink under those suddenly
 

363
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,629
solid if I sink under those suddenly
this guy will start to break down and so

364
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
this guy will start to break down and so
 

365
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,589
this guy will start to break down and so
that makes a really easy KAG here for me

366
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
that makes a really easy KAG here for me
 

367
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,230
that makes a really easy KAG here for me
right so that's the basic idea is I Go

368
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
right so that's the basic idea is I Go
 

369
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,469
right so that's the basic idea is I Go
hip to hip with this guy and then I try

370
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
hip to hip with this guy and then I try
 

371
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,189
hip to hip with this guy and then I try
and move his hips with my hips while

372
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:22,199
and move his hips with my hips while
 

373
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,309
and move his hips with my hips while
turning my upper body to get him to to

374
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
turning my upper body to get him to to
 

375
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,230
turning my upper body to get him to to
fall over if he's too stabilized I try

376
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,240
fall over if he's too stabilized I try
 

377
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,189
fall over if he's too stabilized I try
to shoot underneath his hips and that's

378
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
to shoot underneath his hips and that's
 

379
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,589
to shoot underneath his hips and that's
going to Buck his hips forward a little

380
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:30,599
going to Buck his hips forward a little
 

381
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,589
going to Buck his hips forward a little
more it's going to make an easy C nuget

382
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:32,599
more it's going to make an easy C nuget
 

383
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,670
more it's going to make an easy C nuget
if he is too low for me to do that then

384
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
if he is too low for me to do that then
 

385
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,469
if he is too low for me to do that then
I really emphasize the upper body

386
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:37,479
I really emphasize the upper body
 

387
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:38,869
I really emphasize the upper body
hitting him in the face and that breaks

388
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:38,879
hitting him in the face and that breaks
 

389
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,510
hitting him in the face and that breaks
him back more and as I said that could

390
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:40,520
him back more and as I said that could
 

391
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,070
him back more and as I said that could
be done even from here right I could do

392
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
be done even from here right I could do
 

393
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,309
be done even from here right I could do
it from here and I don't even have hip

394
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:43,319
it from here and I don't even have hip
 

395
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,510
it from here and I don't even have hip
to hiip contact now that's a weaker form

396
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
to hiip contact now that's a weaker form
 

397
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,869
to hiip contact now that's a weaker form
of CAG but it can be done and why I said

398
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
of CAG but it can be done and why I said
 

399
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,749
of CAG but it can be done and why I said
in the beginning that they're

400
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
in the beginning that they're
 

401
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,469
in the beginning that they're
situational is because it depends on the

402
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:51,479
situational is because it depends on the
 

403
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,629
situational is because it depends on the
guy I'm facing if this guy's really

404
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:53,639
guy I'm facing if this guy's really
 

405
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,990
guy I'm facing if this guy's really
short he's going to be hard to throw

406
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,000
short he's going to be hard to throw
 

407
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,309
short he's going to be hard to throw
with that Sinker if he's really tall

408
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
with that Sinker if he's really tall
 

409
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,070
with that Sinker if he's really tall
it's going to be easy to use that Sinker

410
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
it's going to be easy to use that Sinker
 

411
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,110
it's going to be easy to use that Sinker
but it's going to be hard to hit him in

412
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
but it's going to be hard to hit him in
 

413
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,670
but it's going to be hard to hit him in
the face because he's so tall I can't

414
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:00,680
the face because he's so tall I can't
 

415
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,350
the face because he's so tall I can't
get my elbow up there right so imagine

416
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:02,360
get my elbow up there right so imagine
 

417
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,029
get my elbow up there right so imagine
Josh is this much taller than me and I'm

Josh is this much taller than me and I'm
 

419
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:06,070
Josh is this much taller than me and I'm
trying to Elbow him it doesn't work

420
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
trying to Elbow him it doesn't work
 

421
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,950

easily take him out here so you're just

426
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:12,159
easily take him out here so you're just
 

427
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,270
easily take him out here so you're just
adapting those methods to the person

look here's a KAG and that's cool you

444
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
look here's a KAG and that's cool you
 

445
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,430
look here's a KAG and that's cool you
know like two MMA guys and a CAG comes

446
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
know like two MMA guys and a CAG comes
 

447
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,190
know like two MMA guys and a CAG comes
off it happens but it's going to happen

448
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:36,200
off it happens but it's going to happen
 

449
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,149
off it happens but it's going to happen
more in armed conflict than it happens

450
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:39,159
more in armed conflict than it happens
 

451
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,110
more in armed conflict than it happens
in unarmed conflict and the reason is

452
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
in unarmed conflict and the reason is
 

453
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,829
in unarmed conflict and the reason is
because if we have a weapon right so

454
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:42,839
because if we have a weapon right so
 

455
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,550
because if we have a weapon right so
let's say Josh has a weapon here okay

456
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
let's say Josh has a weapon here okay
 

457
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,230
let's say Josh has a weapon here okay
and we're struggling over this I can't

458
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,240
and we're struggling over this I can't
 

459
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,150
and we're struggling over this I can't
be hanging out here in front of Josh

460
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,160
be hanging out here in front of Josh
 

461
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,230
be hanging out here in front of Josh
because he's going to be hitting me and

462
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
because he's going to be hitting me and
 

463
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,670
because he's going to be hitting me and
switching so I'll immediately want to

464
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:52,680
switching so I'll immediately want to
 

465
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,550
switching so I'll immediately want to
pull this weapon away as far as I

466
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
pull this weapon away as far as I
 

467
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,509
pull this weapon away as far as I
possibly can okay now of course this

468
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:56,519
possibly can okay now of course this
 

469
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,430
possibly can okay now of course this
gives me Roos and all kinds of things up

470
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:58,440
gives me Roos and all kinds of things up
 

471
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,150
gives me Roos and all kinds of things up
