00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:03,020
foreign
 

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,190
foreign
so this is for you and the first point

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
so this is for you and the first point
 

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,810
so this is for you and the first point
I'd like to make

6
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:08,820
I'd like to make
 

7
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,850
I'd like to make
is that there is a pattern

8
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:13,860
is that there is a pattern
 

9
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,430
is that there is a pattern
just we'll just use that word there is a

10
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,440
just we'll just use that word there is a
 

11
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,750
just we'll just use that word there is a
pattern

12
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:17,760
pattern
 

13
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,410
pattern
to the techniques

14
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:24,420

 

15
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,269

first let's go over some of the things

16
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:26,279
first let's go over some of the things
 

17
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,189
first let's go over some of the things
that we've said

18
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:28,199
that we've said
 

19
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,589
that we've said
there are three components three

20
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:30,599
there are three components three
 

21
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,590
there are three components three
concentric components to our training

22
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
concentric components to our training
 

23
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,090
concentric components to our training
okay we have

24
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,100

 

25
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,709

the spiritual

26
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:45,719

 

27
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,569

we have the energetic

28
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:52,579

 

29
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:56,630

did I spell that right

30
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640

 

31
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,350

and then

32
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:00,360

 

33
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,490

we have the physical

34
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:07,500

 

35
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,810

when we say they're concentric we mean

36
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:11,820
when we say they're concentric we mean
 

37
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,649
when we say they're concentric we mean
as Is Happening Here Is Happening Here

38
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:15,659
as Is Happening Here Is Happening Here
 

39
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,710
as Is Happening Here Is Happening Here
Is Happening Here

40
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:17,720
Is Happening Here
 

41
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,890
Is Happening Here
also as when is happening here is when

42
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:21,900
also as when is happening here is when
 

43
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,109
also as when is happening here is when
is happening here is when is happening

44
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:24,119
is happening here is when is happening
 

45
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,030
is happening here is when is happening
here

46
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:26,040
here
 

47
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,270
here
it's not one leads to the other

48
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:32,280

 

49
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,950

so

50
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:33,960
so
 

51
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,609
so
in the energetic level

52
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:37,619
in the energetic level
 

53
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,670
in the energetic level
we'll take we'll take this one off for

54
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:40,680
we'll take we'll take this one off for
 

55
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,510
we'll take we'll take this one off for
now

56
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
now
 

57
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,890
now
it's just gonna complicate things

58
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:45,900

 

59
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,550

the physical the forms have a physical

60
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:49,560
the physical the forms have a physical
 

61
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,550
the physical the forms have a physical
component then they have an energetic

62
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
component then they have an energetic
 

63
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,030
component then they have an energetic
component and one is the other

64
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,040
component and one is the other
 

65
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,210
component and one is the other
so for example a physical aspect might

66
00:01:59,210 --> 00:01:59,220
so for example a physical aspect might
 

67
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:05,690
so for example a physical aspect might
be Marshall

68
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:05,700

 

69
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,010

this

70
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,020
this
 

71
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,570
this
the energetic

72
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:11,580

 

73
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,010

pattern

74
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,020
pattern
 

75
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,190
pattern
is also the Marshall pattern

76
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,200
is also the Marshall pattern
 

77
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,530
is also the Marshall pattern
and the Marshall pattern is the

78
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:18,540
and the Marshall pattern is the
 

79
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,809
and the Marshall pattern is the
energetic pattern they're they're not

80
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:20,819
energetic pattern they're they're not
 

81
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,270
energetic pattern they're they're not
different and one doesn't lead to the

82
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
different and one doesn't lead to the
 

83
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,369
different and one doesn't lead to the
other so any

84
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:25,379
other so any
 

85
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,470
other so any
form

86
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:27,480
form
 

87
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,690
form
that you would look at and would say

88
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:29,700
that you would look at and would say
 

89
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,089
that you would look at and would say
that doesn't seem very Marshall you

90
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:32,099
that doesn't seem very Marshall you
 

91
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,430
that doesn't seem very Marshall you
would also see a violation of the

92
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,440
would also see a violation of the
 

93
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,290
would also see a violation of the
energetic pattern

94
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:36,300
energetic pattern
 

95
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,790
energetic pattern
okay

96
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:37,800
okay
 

97
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,770
okay
does that make sense to you guys

98
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:39,780
does that make sense to you guys
 

99
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,509
does that make sense to you guys
okay

100
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
okay
 

101
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,070
okay
so for Aikido people who tend to go

102
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
so for Aikido people who tend to go
 

103
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,710
so for Aikido people who tend to go
it's not a martial art

104
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
it's not a martial art
 

105
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,509
it's not a martial art
and they say that now there's no

106
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:50,519
and they say that now there's no
 

107
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,790
and they say that now there's no
Marshall to it okay

108
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
Marshall to it okay
 

109
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,970
Marshall to it okay
if you if your art

110
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:55,980
if you if your art
 

111
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,830
if you if your art
if someone would look at it and go

112
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
if someone would look at it and go
 

113
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,610
if someone would look at it and go
you're right your Aikido is not Marshall

114
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:01,620
you're right your Aikido is not Marshall
 

115
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,430
you're right your Aikido is not Marshall
we would also see it's also not

116
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:04,440
we would also see it's also not
 

117
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,830
we would also see it's also not
energetically sound there's a violation

118
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:06,840
energetically sound there's a violation
 

119
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,930
energetically sound there's a violation
of the energetics there as well

120
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:11,940

 

121
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,190

so

122
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
so
 

123
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,410
so
knowing this let's look at the form

124
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:17,420
knowing this let's look at the form
 

125
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,729
knowing this let's look at the form
energetically we're going to look at

126
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:19,739
energetically we're going to look at
 

127
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:33,369
energetically we're going to look at
keyhonawaza energetically

128
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:33,379

 

129
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:39,770

energetically your form is going to have

130
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:39,780

 

131
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,250

in

132
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:43,260

 

133
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:53,570

Young

134
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:53,580

 

135
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,589

all this Ike

136
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599

 

137
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,430

Earth

138
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:01,440

 

139
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:08,509

qi

140
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:08,519

 

141
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,710

water

142
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720

 

143
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,890

poke you

144
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:15,900

 

145
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,530

haven't she

146
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:21,540

 

147
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:28,370

fire

148
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:28,380

 

149
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:34,870

D these are all

150
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880

 

151
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,490

manifestations of the unknowable

152
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:37,500
manifestations of the unknowable
 

153
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,710
manifestations of the unknowable
unnamable

154
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:39,720
unnamable
 

155
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,469
unnamable
field of potentiality

156
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
field of potentiality
 

157
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,189
field of potentiality
what you're trying to do energetically

158
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
what you're trying to do energetically
 

159
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,210
what you're trying to do energetically
is reconcile these dualisms

160
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:50,220
is reconcile these dualisms
 

161
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,350
is reconcile these dualisms
to get back to the doubt

162
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:54,360

 

163
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,770

the way you reconcile these dualisms is

164
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:57,780
the way you reconcile these dualisms is
 

165
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,129
the way you reconcile these dualisms is
you start them rotating

166
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:01,139
you start them rotating
 

167
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,330
you start them rotating
kind of like you put in

168
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:05,340
kind of like you put in
 

169
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,950
kind of like you put in
a spice and another spice and you mix

170
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:09,960
a spice and another spice and you mix
 

171
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,090
a spice and another spice and you mix
them

172
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:11,100
them
 

173
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,469
them
do you see so they stop being too

174
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:15,479

 

175
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,629

so

176
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:17,639
so
 

177
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,670
so
your forms

178
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:22,680

 

179
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,950

will always adopt

180
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
will always adopt
 

181
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,249
will always adopt
this pattern

182
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:28,259

 

183
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,390

this mixing pattern

184
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400

 

185
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,430

but this pattern has a micro

186
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440

 

187
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,730

and a macro level

188
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:40,740
and a macro level
 

189
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,270
and a macro level
so

190
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,280

 

191
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,370

uke and I will be on a spiral

192
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:49,380
uke and I will be on a spiral
 

193
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:55,909
uke and I will be on a spiral
and we will be generating these aspects

194
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919

 

195
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,730

and they will be generated by for

196
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:58,740
and they will be generated by for
 

197
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,749
and they will be generated by for
example

198
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:02,759

 

199
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,450

um centripetal energy

200
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:05,460
um centripetal energy
 

201
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,590
um centripetal energy
there's energy going into the spiral and

202
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
there's energy going into the spiral and
 

203
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,710
there's energy going into the spiral and
centrifugal energy there's energy coming

204
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
centrifugal energy there's energy coming
 

205
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,310
centrifugal energy there's energy coming
out of the Spiral

206
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:16,320
out of the Spiral
 

207
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,990
out of the Spiral
and I start mixing those things

208
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,000

 

209
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,809

right now

210
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:23,819
right now
 

211
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,230
right now
you can picture and again moving around

212
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,240
you can picture and again moving around
 

213
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,749
you can picture and again moving around
on a spiral

214
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
on a spiral
 

215
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,650
on a spiral
but the micro level is inside

216
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:33,660
but the micro level is inside
 

217
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,110
but the micro level is inside
inside my body

218
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,120
inside my body
 

219
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,809
inside my body
and inside Bukis body

220
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:38,819
and inside Bukis body
 

221
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,050
and inside Bukis body
so my

222
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,060
so my
 

223
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,210
so my
all of these forces

224
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:46,220

 

225
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,529

water fire they're moving inside

226
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:50,539
water fire they're moving inside
 

227
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:56,270
water fire they're moving inside
my lower tonden

228
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,280

 

229
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,090

this pattern is two-dimensional it's not

230
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,100
this pattern is two-dimensional it's not
 

231
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,249
this pattern is two-dimensional it's not
accurate okay

232
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:01,259
accurate okay
 

233
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:09,890
accurate okay
what you want to understand

234
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:09,900

 

235
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,350

is more

236
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360

 

237
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,749

something like this

238
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
something like this
 

239
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,990
something like this
that is spinning

240
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,000
that is spinning
 

241
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,510
that is spinning
on its own Center Point

242
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
on its own Center Point
 

243
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,450
on its own Center Point
but is also traveling around that spiral

244
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:29,460

 

245
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,370

same thing in my body

246
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,380

 

247
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,430

so

248
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440

 

249
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,890

this is a reference point

250
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:39,900
this is a reference point
 

251
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,589
this is a reference point
in my body

252
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:42,599
in my body
 

253
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,309
in my body
I'm going to start rotating

254
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
I'm going to start rotating
 

255
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,370
I'm going to start rotating
Yang Chi and yinchi

256
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:49,380
Yang Chi and yinchi
 

257
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,089
Yang Chi and yinchi
once internalized so I would rotate it

258
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:53,099
once internalized so I would rotate it
 

259
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:58,309
once internalized so I would rotate it
left or right it'll rotate

260
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319

 

261
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,749

and then I'll lift it up so imagine that

262
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:02,759
and then I'll lift it up so imagine that
 

263
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,249
and then I'll lift it up so imagine that
this line is like this line

264
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:07,259

 

265
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,110

or over here

266
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
or over here
 

267
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,890
or over here
I move the line do you see

268
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:12,900
I move the line do you see
 

269
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,450
I move the line do you see
and I spin the line

270
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:17,460

 

271
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,869

then I rotate the line again

272
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
then I rotate the line again
 

273
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,390
then I rotate the line again
and then I come down

274
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:23,400
and then I come down
 

275
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,689
and then I come down
this is the internal pattern the micro

276
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:26,699
this is the internal pattern the micro
 

277
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,189
this is the internal pattern the micro
pattern

278
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:28,199
pattern
 

279
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,850
pattern
that spiral inside my body

280
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:30,860
that spiral inside my body
 

281
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,969
that spiral inside my body
mixing the yin and yang G okay so it

282
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:34,979
mixing the yin and yang G okay so it
 

283
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,010
mixing the yin and yang G okay so it
could start this way it could start this

284
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,020
could start this way it could start this
 

285
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,050
could start this way it could start this
way but after it starts that way it'll

286
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,060
way but after it starts that way it'll
 

287
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,230
way but after it starts that way it'll
go up it'll go the other way now and

288
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
go up it'll go the other way now and
 

289
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,149
go up it'll go the other way now and
then it'll go down

290
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
then it'll go down
 

291
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,190
then it'll go down
and that's what you're doing to ukia's

292
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,200
and that's what you're doing to ukia's
 

293
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,710
and that's what you're doing to ukia's
body as well so you start the technique

294
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
body as well so you start the technique
 

295
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,930
body as well so you start the technique
Luca is going to go right or left you're

296
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:50,940
Luca is going to go right or left you're
 

297
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,690
Luca is going to go right or left you're
both going to rotate around that pattern

298
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:53,700
both going to rotate around that pattern
 

299
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,630
both going to rotate around that pattern
is going to be brought up go back the

300
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
is going to be brought up go back the
 

301
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,370
is going to be brought up go back the
other way if they went right the first

302
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:58,380
other way if they went right the first
 

303
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,530
other way if they went right the first
time they're going to go left and then

304
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:00,540
time they're going to go left and then
 

305
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,570
time they're going to go left and then
they're going to go down okay

306
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:05,580

 

307
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:12,790

so if we have uh

308
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800

 

309
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,509

does

310
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:14,519
does
 

311
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,930
does
is does both rotating cross patterns the

312
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:17,940
is does both rotating cross patterns the
 

313
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,269
is does both rotating cross patterns the
one to the right and the one to the left

314
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:20,279
one to the right and the one to the left
 

315
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,030
one to the right and the one to the left
that's that's what makes it a unique

316
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
that's that's what makes it a unique
 

317
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,829
that's that's what makes it a unique
training okay

318
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:24,839
training okay
 

319
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,970
training okay
so as I start

320
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:27,980
so as I start
 

321
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,090
so as I start
I rotate Pop I rotate it right it's

322
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,100
I rotate Pop I rotate it right it's
 

323
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,550
I rotate Pop I rotate it right it's
going to come around you're gonna see it

324
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
going to come around you're gonna see it
 

325
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,710
going to come around you're gonna see it
goes up you see

326
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
goes up you see
 

327
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,350
goes up you see
and uh I'm gonna do the other side of

328
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
and uh I'm gonna do the other side of
 

329
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,389
and uh I'm gonna do the other side of
the technique now whoa

330
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:41,399
the technique now whoa
 

331
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,430
the technique now whoa
around

332
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
around
 

333
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,550
around
top

334
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560

 

335
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,570

and the spiral so I'm doing that inside

336
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:49,580
and the spiral so I'm doing that inside
 

337
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,870
and the spiral so I'm doing that inside
but watch our pattern our pattern is

338
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:53,880
but watch our pattern our pattern is
 

339
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,269
but watch our pattern our pattern is
spirally okay

340
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:56,279
spirally okay
 

341
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:01,509
spirally okay
so we start turning

342
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519

 

343
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,290

turning turning

344
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:06,300

 

345
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:13,130

let me change it

346
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:13,140

 

347
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,750

[Music]

348
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:16,760

 

349
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,870

no spiraling pattern do you see that

350
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
no spiraling pattern do you see that
 

351
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:30,730
no spiraling pattern do you see that
let me add its headphones

352
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:30,740

 

353
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:46,910

no spiraling pattern

354
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:46,920

 

355
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,990

so macro

356
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,000

 

357
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,630

I use this spiral let's just look

358
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:53,640
I use this spiral let's just look
 

359
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,670
I use this spiral let's just look
two-dimensionally

360
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:58,680

 

361
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,069

and there's centripetal energy going in

362
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079

 

363
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,230

their centrifugal energy going out

364

centripetal
 

385
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,130
centripetal
and

386
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,140
and

centrifugal
 

389
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,970
centrifugal
okay

390
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:46,980
okay
 

391
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,250
okay
that's what you're trying to do so

392
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,260
that's what you're trying to do so
 

393
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,329
that's what you're trying to do so
I'm going to generate an outwardness on

394
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:53,339
I'm going to generate an outwardness on
 

395
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,690
I'm going to generate an outwardness on
Uke's hip that's where I cook you

396
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:56,700
Uke's hip that's where I cook you
 

397
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,250
Uke's hip that's where I cook you
I'm going to generate an inwardness

398
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,260
I'm going to generate an inwardness
 

399
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,389
I'm going to generate an inwardness
that's where I hiking on Uke's head area

400
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:05,399
that's where I hiking on Uke's head area
 

401
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,650
that's where I hiking on Uke's head area
and then I don't have to do anything the

402
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:09,660
and then I don't have to do anything the
 

403
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,290
and then I don't have to do anything the
technique just does itself I'm in the

404
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:12,300
technique just does itself I'm in the
 

405
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,610
technique just does itself I'm in the
pattern so now I'm in

406
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:16,620
pattern so now I'm in
 

407
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,509
pattern so now I'm in
the doing of not doing I'm in

408
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:20,519
the doing of not doing I'm in
 

409
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,490
the doing of not doing I'm in
uh woo way

410
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:22,500
uh woo way
 

411
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,370
uh woo way
okay

412
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:28,380

 

413
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,250

now you'll watch for that so we're

414
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,260
now you'll watch for that so we're
 

415
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,310
now you'll watch for that so we're
coming around you you'll see a

416
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
coming around you you'll see a
 

417
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,190
coming around you you'll see a
centripetal

418
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
centripetal
 

419
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,769
centripetal
oh

420
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:42,779

 

421
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,230

okay

422
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:45,240

 

423
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,069

um let's do the second

424
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:49,079
um let's do the second
 

425
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,970
um let's do the second
uh poku one or the second kaita nage

426
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:52,980
uh poku one or the second kaita nage
 

427
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,750
uh poku one or the second kaita nage
where I came inside so I don't go here

428
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:56,760
where I came inside so I don't go here
 

429
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,690
where I came inside so I don't go here
stop him and then

430
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:02,700

 

431
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,210

I have to do another turn inside the

432
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:05,220
I have to do another turn inside the
 

433
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,230
I have to do another turn inside the
turn

434
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
turn
 

435
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,990
turn
so it's coming around

436
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,000
so it's coming around
 

437
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,870
so it's coming around
oh

438
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:11,880

 

439
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,110

around and around

440
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
around and around
 

441
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,110
around and around
do you guys see that okay so same thing

442
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120

 

443
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,750

I use the two energy

444
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
I use the two energy
 

445
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,050
I use the two energy
oh

446
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:27,060

 

447
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,389

to generate what I need for him on

448
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:29,399
to generate what I need for him on
 

449
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,190
to generate what I need for him on
marshally okay as well so for example

450
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,200
marshally okay as well so for example
 

451
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,250
marshally okay as well so for example
going to the physical component

452
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:37,260
going to the physical component
 

453
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,949
going to the physical component
I'm in the Box

454
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:39,959
I'm in the Box
 

455
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,190
I'm in the Box
when I do this stuff I'm in the front

456
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:42,200
when I do this stuff I'm in the front
 

457
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,910
when I do this stuff I'm in the front
here's where he tackles me

458
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:46,920

 

459
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,190

stay in the back

460
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,200
stay in the back
 

461
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,990
stay in the back
[Music]

462
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
[Music]
 

463
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,889
[Music]
in the back

464
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:54,899

 

465
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,030

okay

466
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,040
okay
 

467
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:08,269
okay
let's try it ourselves either version go

468
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:08,279

 

469
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:18,850

keep going

470
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:18,860

 

471
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,190

okay so did you feel that did you did

472
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:22,200
okay so did you feel that did you did
 

473
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,069
okay so did you feel that did you did
you see that hiccup

474
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:25,079
you see that hiccup
 

475
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,069
you see that hiccup
okay so being here

476
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
okay so being here
 

477
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,629
okay so being here
good

478
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:29,639
good
 

479
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,250
good
oh

480
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:31,260
oh
 

481
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,350
oh
all right then you're going here like

482
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360
all right then you're going here like
 

483
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,569
all right then you're going here like
this do you see that yes so I gotta pull

484
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:38,579
this do you see that yes so I gotta pull
 

485
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,790
this do you see that yes so I gotta pull
you

486
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
you
 

487
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,689
you
this step goes with the head

488
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:44,699
this step goes with the head
 

489
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:51,110
this step goes with the head
in

490
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120

 

491
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,250

okay

492
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:52,260
okay
 

493
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,069
okay
so when you when you measure here you

494
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:55,079
so when you when you measure here you
 

495
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,310
so when you when you measure here you
came this way then you had to wait for

496
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
came this way then you had to wait for
 

497
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,250
came this way then you had to wait for
them to get there and now you're just

498
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:01,260
them to get there and now you're just
 

499
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,250
them to get there and now you're just
using centrifugal energy you're just

500
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:04,260
using centrifugal energy you're just
 

501
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,290
using centrifugal energy you're just
pushing out

502
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:09,300

 

503
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:20,569

so as we're making the spiral

504
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:20,579

 

505
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,930

you have to make a spiral at your

506
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:23,940
you have to make a spiral at your
 

507
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,370
you have to make a spiral at your
extremities

508
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:25,380
extremities
 

509
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,850
extremities
so your head goes one way

510
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:28,860
so your head goes one way
 

511
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,610
so your head goes one way
and your hips go another way in this

512
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:31,620
and your hips go another way in this
 

513
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,230
and your hips go another way in this
technique okay

514
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,240
technique okay
 

515
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,530
technique okay
so we're coming around

516
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:38,540

 

517
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,970

go off

518
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:40,980
go off
 

519
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,590
go off
okay and that's without the hip you see

520
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
okay and that's without the hip you see
 

521
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:53,410
okay and that's without the hip you see
okay

522
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:53,420

 

523
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,350

this is the hip without the head do you

524
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
this is the hip without the head do you
 

525
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,290
this is the hip without the head do you
see that yes okay so do one without the

526
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:00,300
see that yes okay so do one without the
 

527
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,370
see that yes okay so do one without the
hip okay and one without the head

528
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:04,380
hip okay and one without the head
 

529
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,370
hip okay and one without the head
there you go so with the pattern I'm

530
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:07,380
there you go so with the pattern I'm
 

531
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,949
there you go so with the pattern I'm
generating centripetal and centrifugal

532
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:09,959
generating centripetal and centrifugal
 

533
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,569
generating centripetal and centrifugal
energy

534
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:11,579
energy
 

535
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:16,129
energy
those energies are what I

536
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:16,139
those energies are what I
 

537
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,269
those energies are what I
um

538
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
um
 

539
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,430
um
manipulates

540
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440
manipulates
 

541
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,350
manipulates
to generate Coq and icing okay so uh as

542
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:24,360
to generate Coq and icing okay so uh as
 

543
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,889
to generate Coq and icing okay so uh as
I come around it's because he wants to

544
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:27,899
I come around it's because he wants to
 

545
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,670
I come around it's because he wants to
go out you see that there's an energy

546
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
go out you see that there's an energy
 

547
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,329
go out you see that there's an energy
going out and I match that on the icon

548
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:35,339
going out and I match that on the icon
 

549
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:36,110
going out and I match that on the icon
hand

550
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,120
hand
 

551
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,530
hand
so let's say that was the value of x

552
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:39,540
so let's say that was the value of x
 

553
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,889
so let's say that was the value of x
then I drew a value of x and then we get

554
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:42,899
then I drew a value of x and then we get
 

555
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,889
then I drew a value of x and then we get
stuck okay do you understand that but

556
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:45,899
stuck okay do you understand that but
 

557
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:50,030
stuck okay do you understand that but
it's his outward generating energy that

558
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,040
it's his outward generating energy that
 

559
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,210
it's his outward generating energy that
I use to adhere at that point it's not

560
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:53,220
I use to adhere at that point it's not
 

561
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,970
I use to adhere at that point it's not
that I grab his head okay

562
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:55,980
that I grab his head okay
 

563
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,410
that I grab his head okay
so uh we're going on whoa he's going out

564
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:00,420
so uh we're going on whoa he's going out
 

565
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,889
so uh we're going on whoa he's going out
and this is what I and stuff on you you

566
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:03,899
and this is what I and stuff on you you
 

567
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,809
and this is what I and stuff on you you
got that don't grab the Hat

568
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:05,819
got that don't grab the Hat
 

569
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,669
got that don't grab the Hat
and then

570
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
and then
 

571
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,669
and then
once so he's going out

572
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:10,679
once so he's going out
 

573
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,549
once so he's going out
and once I get the end here

574
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:13,559
and once I get the end here
 

575
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,090
and once I get the end here
that energy is what starts the Coq

576
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:17,100
that energy is what starts the Coq
 

577
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,909
that energy is what starts the Coq
energy because that inward energy is

578
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
energy because that inward energy is
 

579
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,010
energy because that inward energy is
what I bounced

580
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,020
what I bounced
 

581
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,569
what I bounced
off of this hand

582
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:23,579
off of this hand
 

583
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,309
off of this hand
okay so it's not I'm not going like this

584
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:27,319
okay so it's not I'm not going like this
 

585
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,430
okay so it's not I'm not going like this
and pushing

586
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440

 

587
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,690

because he's spinning inside a spiral I

588
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:35,700
because he's spinning inside a spiral I
 

589
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,870
because he's spinning inside a spiral I
can adhere boom and project on the hip

590
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
can adhere boom and project on the hip
 

591
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,490
can adhere boom and project on the hip
okay so that's our 10 feet wow

592
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:46,500

 

593
00:17:46,500 --> 00:18:29,210

have centrifugal energy right so you
 

609
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,830
have centrifugal energy right so you
have centrifugal energy and that's what

610
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:24,840
have centrifugal energy and that's what
 

611
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,810
have centrifugal energy and that's what
I use there you see then you're going

612
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:26,820
I use there you see then you're going

want to spin you and we're going to do
 

621
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,830
want to spin you and we're going to do
the rotating cross inside the spiral

622
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:42,840
the rotating cross inside the spiral
 

623
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,409
the rotating cross inside the spiral
okay remember how I said that it's not

624
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:45,419
okay remember how I said that it's not
 

625
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:48,169
okay remember how I said that it's not
it's not a two-dimensional thing okay

626
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:48,179
it's not a two-dimensional thing okay
 

627
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:51,409
it's not a two-dimensional thing okay
so we go around

628

the eye key

638
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:04,620
the eye key
 

639
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,610
the eye key
is benefiting and continuing the

640

is benefiting and continuing the
centripetal energy I ground that boom

642
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,160
centripetal energy I ground that boom
 

643
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,250
centripetal energy I ground that boom
and I hit the hip and that's what causes

644
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:13,260
and I hit the hip and that's what causes
 

645
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,450
and I hit the hip and that's what causes
it

646
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:14,460
it
 

647
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,590
it
do you understand it as opposed to

648
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:16,600
do you understand it as opposed to
 

649
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,169
do you understand it as opposed to

650
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:18,179
[Music]
 

651
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:25,850
[Music]
I just go around this way

652
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:25,860

 

653
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,010

these versions like this
 

669
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,650
these versions like this
you don't do those verses

670
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:21,660

 

671
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,350

you can you can change as you see one

672
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:24,360
you can you can change as you see one

see that
 

679
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,289
see that
that's not going to be you're not going

680
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:39,299
that's not going to be you're not going
 

681
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,590
that's not going to be you're not going
to have the spirals going okay so you

682
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:42,600
to have the spirals going okay so you
 

683
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,370
to have the spirals going okay so you
can boom there's a spiral

684
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:46,380
