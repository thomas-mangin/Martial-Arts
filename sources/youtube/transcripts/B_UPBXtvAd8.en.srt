and I step into the space likes and so

224
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:02,990
and I step into the space likes and so
 

225
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,949
and I step into the space likes and so
you see how I stayed connected but his

226
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:05,959
you see how I stayed connected but his

me a pen see that the key musubi

232
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:20,260
me a pen see that the key musubi
 

233
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,449
me a pen see that the key musubi
happened on our bodies

234
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:22,459
happened on our bodies
 

235
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:30,100
happened on our bodies
you see you know k do that same key

236
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,110
you see you know k do that same key
 

237
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,350
you see you know k do that same key
musubi right if I I have the same option

all of it you see then I'm just gonna
 

329
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,780
all of it you see then I'm just gonna
wait and I'm follow yeah I thought this

00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:43,790
wait and I'm follow yeah I thought this
 

331
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,520
wait and I'm follow yeah I thought this

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:49,940
our part but the concept of key musubi
 

337
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,080

is there there is a way where I can
 

339
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,560
is there there is a way where I can

so whatever strange cold you you're

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:36,430
at those angles you can do understand
 

417
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:42,130
at those angles you can do understand
got it so that's why it's what we're

418
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,140
got it so that's why it's what we're
 

419
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,910
got it so that's why it's what we're
doing is going well if you take out all

420
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
doing is going well if you take out all
 

421
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,690
doing is going well if you take out all
your other power sources it should still

422
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:49,700
your other power sources it should still
 

423
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,560
your other power sources it should still
function right it should still function

424
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:53,570
function right it should still function
 

425
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,930
function right it should still function
so this step is very hard for you to

426
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:55,940
so this step is very hard for you to
 

427
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,400
so this step is very hard for you to
kill for example but if I just
