this is what most people do and then
 

77
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,270
this is what most people do and then
they push it forward again

78
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
they push it forward again
 

79
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,389
they push it forward again
if you do that

80
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399

 

81
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,030

the same way as a meroti door they could

90
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
the same way as a meroti door they could
 

91
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,950
the same way as a meroti door they could
step to the side

and throw you down
so this is the reason for

00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
so this is the reason for
 

99
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,350
so this is the reason for
using the thumb

100
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
using the thumb
 

101
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,589
using the thumb
in the nicu

102
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
in the nicu
 

103
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,949
in the nicu
and only going forward

104
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959

 

105
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,750

if you find that you're

106

if you find that you're
you've done this

you start to extend forward
 

111
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,910
you start to extend forward
then your timing has to be

112
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
then your timing has to be
 

113
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,589
then your timing has to be
to cut them down first you cut them down

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,550

and it's like projecting forward it's

352
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
and it's like projecting forward it's
 

353
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,070
and it's like projecting forward it's
like projecting forward

354
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
like projecting forward
 

355
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,110
like projecting forward
so you take the hand off

356
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
so you take the hand off
 

357
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,710
so you take the hand off
and as you take it

358
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
and as you take it
 

359
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,070
and as you take it
off

360
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
off
 

361
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,150
off
it slips underneath

362
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
it slips underneath
 

363
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,469
it slips underneath
the arm so the elbows on top here so

364
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
the arm so the elbows on top here so
 

365
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,070
the arm so the elbows on top here so
you're going to let go and you're going

366
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
you're going to let go and you're going
 

367
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,469
you're going to let go and you're going
to

368
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479

 

369
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,589

slide it like this

370
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
slide it like this
 

371
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,670
slide it like this
that's all about the chair you're going

372
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
that's all about the chair you're going
 

373
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,390
that's all about the chair you're going
to slide it like this

374
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
to slide it like this
 

375
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,710
to slide it like this
you can slide it like this and you're

376
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
you can slide it like this and you're
 

377
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,589
you can slide it like this and you're
gonna rub that arm

378
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599

 

379
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,749

against their arm

380
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
against their arm
 

381
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,629
against their arm
in a forward direction

382
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
in a forward direction
 

383
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,550
in a forward direction
so you're gonna keep that momentum of

384
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
so you're gonna keep that momentum of
 

385
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,029
so you're gonna keep that momentum of
forwardness going the same way as this

386
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
forwardness going the same way as this
 

387
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,469
forwardness going the same way as this
pedal action

388
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
pedal action
 

389
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,629
pedal action
that action of forwardness with the

390
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
that action of forwardness with the
 

391
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,150
that action of forwardness with the
elbow

392
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
elbow
 

393
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,309
elbow
you take the hand off you slip under but

394
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
you take the hand off you slip under but
 

395
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,029
you take the hand off you slip under but
you keep extending that forwardness

396
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
you keep extending that forwardness
 

397
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,430
you keep extending that forwardness
so they can't get up it's like you're

398
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
so they can't get up it's like you're
 

399
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,670
so they can't get up it's like you're
keeping them slightly off balance all

400
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
keeping them slightly off balance all
 

401
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,070
keeping them slightly off balance all
the time

402
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
the time
 

403
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,830
the time
and then you can carry on and do the

404
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
and then you can carry on and do the
 

405
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,430
and then you can carry on and do the
same cure the the mote or the ura

406
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
same cure the the mote or the ura
 

407
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,630
same cure the the mote or the ura
i'll make a film on here on this ankylos

408
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640
i'll make a film on here on this ankylos
 

409
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,149
i'll make a film on here on this ankylos
but more on the error because the error

410
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
but more on the error because the error
 

411
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,149
but more on the error because the error
everybody seems to mess up on the

412
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
everybody seems to mess up on the
 

413
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,750
everybody seems to mess up on the
footwork

414
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
footwork
 

415
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,150
footwork
and the development of this um

416
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160

 

417
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,070

spiral

418
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
spiral
 

419
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,990
spiral
the spiral is like an ice cream cone

420
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
the spiral is like an ice cream cone
 

421
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,190
the spiral is like an ice cream cone
okay so

422
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200

 

423
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,190

you need this

424
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
you need this
 

425
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,470
you need this
sort of helical understanding

426
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
sort of helical understanding
 

427
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,110
sort of helical understanding

428
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
to understand kaitenagi
 

429
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,550
to understand kaitenagi

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
if you don't understand this you're just
 

433
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,470
if you don't understand this you're just
pushing their arm up and down and

434
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
pushing their arm up and down and
 

435
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,710
pushing their arm up and down and
pulling it up and down

436
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
pulling it up and down
 

437
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,190
pulling it up and down
but uh the next film will be on the on
