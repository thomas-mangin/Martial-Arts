does not mean i go fast
i try to outrace you that wouldn't be i
don't try to outmastery that's actually
not marshall okay but a train with
presence and with no openings and with
the art yin yang reconciliations do you
see and that also means that i train
from the second mind aspect okay so i'm
not i'm not wigging out
over your pain
or your owies or what i'm doing to you
do you understand it doesn't it doesn't
make me cry
that's your problem
do you understand
you need to figure out how to absorb and
accept
on this side and i don't i'm not
interested in your
psychology or your mood swings or
anything like that do you get it i have
no nothing of that the second mind
aspect does not have those things i'm
just feeling humanly
