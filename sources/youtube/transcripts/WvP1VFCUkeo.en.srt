1
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:10,940

okay so we're just working on tension

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:10,950
okay so we're just working on tension
 

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,820
okay so we're just working on tension
are hit with our some very key basics

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:13,830
are hit with our some very key basics
 

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,349
are hit with our some very key basics
that you're missing because you're doing

6
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:20,359
that you're missing because you're doing
 

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:26,810
that you're missing because you're doing
the body mechanics your way thought it

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:26,820
the body mechanics your way thought it
 

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,730
the body mechanics your way thought it
was our return okay so we're gonna take

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:31,740
was our return okay so we're gonna take
 

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,450
was our return okay so we're gonna take
three things and apply help a whole lot

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:35,460
three things and apply help a whole lot
 

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,360
three things and apply help a whole lot
of chambers so the first one is the

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,370
of chambers so the first one is the
 

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,389
of chambers so the first one is the
connection and then the second one is

16
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:41,399
connection and then the second one is
 

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,000
connection and then the second one is
the Mars spiral and the third one will

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,010
the Mars spiral and the third one will
 

19
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,380
the Mars spiral and the third one will
be the entry okay so on the first one

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:51,390
be the entry okay so on the first one
 

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,880
be the entry okay so on the first one
you don't just open like you can't have

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:57,890
you don't just open like you can't have
 

23
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:04,160
you don't just open like you can't have
the centerline just be Afridi okay

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,170
the centerline just be Afridi okay
 

25
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,160
the centerline just be Afridi okay
that's not the technique

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,170
that's not the technique
 

27
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,570
that's not the technique
so the technique is first going to bring

28
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:10,580
so the technique is first going to bring
 

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,010
so the technique is first going to bring
them up towards heaven and then turn

30
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,020
them up towards heaven and then turn
 

31
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,450
them up towards heaven and then turn
them and drop them towards right Tenshi

32
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:19,460
them and drop them towards right Tenshi
 

33
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,359
them and drop them towards right Tenshi
not giving me seven in her throat but

34
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:22,369
not giving me seven in her throat but
 

35
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,340
not giving me seven in her throat but
it's not just a matter of one hand down

36
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:24,350
it's not just a matter of one hand down
 

37
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,660
it's not just a matter of one hand down
what had up

38
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:25,670
what had up
 

39
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,390
what had up
remember the Dallas principle of

40
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
remember the Dallas principle of
 

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,600
remember the Dallas principle of
concentric truth if it's one hand down

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:31,610
concentric truth if it's one hand down
 

43
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,359
concentric truth if it's one hand down
one hand up is also going to be up and

44
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:34,369
one hand up is also going to be up and
 

45
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:37,840
one hand up is also going to be up and
down throughout okay

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:37,850
down throughout okay
 

47
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,160
down throughout okay
so first they go up then they go down so

48
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,170
so first they go up then they go down so
 

49
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,260
so first they go up then they go down so
how do I do this I can't lift my hands

50
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:44,270
how do I do this I can't lift my hands
 

51
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,620
how do I do this I can't lift my hands
because I can't put the articulation

52
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,630
because I can't put the articulation
 

53
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,450
because I can't put the articulation
point in your shoulders see that but

54
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:52,460
point in your shoulders see that but
 

55
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,150
point in your shoulders see that but
when you think up you go hands up we

56
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,160
when you think up you go hands up we
 

57
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,520
when you think up you go hands up we
have to solve for the solution in

58
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:57,530
have to solve for the solution in
 

59
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,700
have to solve for the solution in
different way so my elbows are going to

60
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:00,710
different way so my elbows are going to
 

61
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,570
different way so my elbows are going to
drop you see that and once my elbows

62
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:04,580
drop you see that and once my elbows
 

63
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,440
drop you see that and once my elbows
drop I have that angle if you want it

64
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:08,450
drop I have that angle if you want it
 

65
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,719
drop I have that angle if you want it
when you brought your hand up so keep

66
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:10,729
when you brought your hand up so keep
 

67
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,430
when you brought your hand up so keep
your breath when you bring your hand up

68
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:12,440
your breath when you bring your hand up
 

69
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,520
your breath when you bring your hand up
you see that elbow yeah I'm gonna do it

70
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:15,530
you see that elbow yeah I'm gonna do it
 

71
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,470
you see that elbow yeah I'm gonna do it
the other way I'm gonna drop my elbow

72
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:17,480
the other way I'm gonna drop my elbow
 

73
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,589
the other way I'm gonna drop my elbow
you see that

74
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
you see that
 

75
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,830
you see that
so I drop I try to make my hands as

76
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:22,840
so I drop I try to make my hands as
 

77
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,920
so I drop I try to make my hands as
still as they are I drop my elbows and

78
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:25,930
still as they are I drop my elbows and
 

79
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:31,739
still as they are I drop my elbows and
then I can lift into her so drop my

80
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:31,749
then I can lift into her so drop my
 

81
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:37,319
then I can lift into her so drop my
elbows don't go back to this drop my

82
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:37,329
elbows don't go back to this drop my
 

83
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:40,949
elbows don't go back to this drop my
elbows and lift into her so to lift into

84
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
elbows and lift into her so to lift into
 

85
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,720
elbows and lift into her so to lift into
her it's the same spiral you you do with

86
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:45,730
her it's the same spiral you you do with
 

87
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,399
her it's the same spiral you you do with
your whole arm like you're going to do

88
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:47,409
your whole arm like you're going to do
 

89
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,770
your whole arm like you're going to do
shomenuchi the shomenuchi doesn't go

90
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:49,780
shomenuchi the shomenuchi doesn't go
 

91
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,800
shomenuchi the shomenuchi doesn't go
like this right the hand rotates the

92
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:52,810
like this right the hand rotates the
 

93
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,679
like this right the hand rotates the
wrist rotates the elbow rotate and the

94
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:55,689
wrist rotates the elbow rotate and the
 

95
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:57,750
wrist rotates the elbow rotate and the
shoulder rotates do you understand

96
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
shoulder rotates do you understand
 

97
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,939
shoulder rotates do you understand
so that's why I mean when I say our lips

98
00:02:59,939 --> 00:02:59,949
so that's why I mean when I say our lips
 

99
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:03,360
so that's why I mean when I say our lips
so I lower my elbows and then I start

100
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,370
so I lower my elbows and then I start
 

101
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,059
so I lower my elbows and then I start
the lid and then you have her okay so

102
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:08,069
the lid and then you have her okay so
 

103
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:13,520
the lid and then you have her okay so
here lower and then the rotation starts

104
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:13,530
here lower and then the rotation starts
 

105
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,020
here lower and then the rotation starts
okay let's try that part drumming so

106
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,030
okay let's try that part drumming so
 

107
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,920
okay let's try that part drumming so
some some ways of helping you I draw I

108
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:22,930
some some ways of helping you I draw I
 

109
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,140
some some ways of helping you I draw I
don't want to do the wrist cycle and the

110
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,150
don't want to do the wrist cycle and the
 

111
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,869
don't want to do the wrist cycle and the
elbow cycle in the way that I'm trying

112
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
elbow cycle in the way that I'm trying
 

113
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,479
elbow cycle in the way that I'm trying
to come out like I'm escaping do you

114
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:33,489
to come out like I'm escaping do you
 

115
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:36,659
to come out like I'm escaping do you
understand that I'm going to film a grip

116
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:36,669
understand that I'm going to film a grip
 

117
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:39,839
understand that I'm going to film a grip
that's what I wanted to drop and fill or

118
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:39,849
that's what I wanted to drop and fill or
 

119
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:44,050
that's what I wanted to drop and fill or
grip fill the grip do you understand

120
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,060
grip fill the grip do you understand
 

121
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,110
grip fill the grip do you understand
at the same time I don't feel her grip

122
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
at the same time I don't feel her grip
 

123
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,300
at the same time I don't feel her grip
where I keep my hands where my wrists

124
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,310
where I keep my hands where my wrists
 

125
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,880
where I keep my hands where my wrists
are you see the alignment that's

126
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:54,890
are you see the alignment that's
 

127
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,570
are you see the alignment that's
incorrect so I I don't it's not a

128
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:58,580
incorrect so I I don't it's not a
 

129
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,199
incorrect so I I don't it's not a
lifting at the elbows you see that I'm

130
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,209
lifting at the elbows you see that I'm
 

131
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,220
lifting at the elbows you see that I'm
coming out aren't I okay and my hands

132
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,230
coming out aren't I okay and my hands
 

133
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,949
coming out aren't I okay and my hands
are coming back towards me you see the

134
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
are coming back towards me you see the
 

135
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,490
are coming back towards me you see the
distance to my torso so it's more of a

136
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:12,500
distance to my torso so it's more of a
 

137
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:19,449
distance to my torso so it's more of a
forward miss you see that so it's

138
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:19,459
forward miss you see that so it's
 

139
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,120
forward miss you see that so it's
totally different because I'm coming out

140
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,130
totally different because I'm coming out
 

141
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,520
totally different because I'm coming out
and it'll be noticed because your hand

142
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:24,530
and it'll be noticed because your hand
 

143
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,000
and it'll be noticed because your hand
is in the same line with your wrists and

144
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,010
is in the same line with your wrists and
 

145
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,980
is in the same line with your wrists and
your forearm so I draw and then whoa am

146
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:32,990
your forearm so I draw and then whoa am
 

147
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,240
your forearm so I draw and then whoa am
i filling that grip up and lifting it

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,250
i filling that grip up and lifting it
 

149
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,780
i filling that grip up and lifting it
and I lift like I always do from here

150
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:40,790
and I lift like I always do from here
 

151

and I lift like I always do from here
down Oh get out of your shoulders set

152
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:52,870

 

153
00:04:52,870 --> 00:05:01,530

okay let's go okay so I don't want to be

154
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:01,540
okay let's go okay so I don't want to be
 

155
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,890
okay let's go okay so I don't want to be
out here there's a plane here and I'm

156
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:05,900
out here there's a plane here and I'm
 

157
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,680
out here there's a plane here and I'm
staying on that plane there's going to

158
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:08,690
staying on that plane there's going to
 

159
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,890
staying on that plane there's going to
be an energy that's going this way so

160
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:11,900
be an energy that's going this way so
 

161
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:18,100
be an energy that's going this way so
she comes up and it's going when I when

162
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,110
she comes up and it's going when I when
 

163
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,220
she comes up and it's going when I when
I yield my elbows tend to come in so I

164
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,230
I yield my elbows tend to come in so I
 

165
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,290
I yield my elbows tend to come in so I
can't really keep my arms here and drop

166
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:26,300
can't really keep my arms here and drop
 

167
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,310
can't really keep my arms here and drop
my elbows too much without bringing the

168
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
my elbows too much without bringing the
 

169
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,460
my elbows too much without bringing the
hands back a lot so when I bring my

170
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:33,470
hands back a lot so when I bring my
 

171
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,250
hands back a lot so when I bring my
elbows in I can get underneath and my

172
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:36,260
elbows in I can get underneath and my
 

173
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,160
elbows in I can get underneath and my
hands aren't coming too far out of that

174
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,170
hands aren't coming too far out of that
 

175
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,340
hands aren't coming too far out of that

by and rotate it on an axis you

276
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:42,460
by and rotate it on an axis you
 

277
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,529
by and rotate it on an axis you
understand

278
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:43,539
understand
 

279
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:48,660
understand
so I know what I'm going this so it's

280
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,670
so I know what I'm going this so it's
 

281
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,190
so I know what I'm going this so it's
just very small he comes it and then we

282
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
just very small he comes it and then we
 

283
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:04,750
just very small he comes it and then we
rotate okay all right

284
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:04,760

 

285
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,900

you're not high they often tilted and

286
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:08,910
you're not high they often tilted and
 

287
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,490
you're not high they often tilted and
located right here have no idea so let's

288
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:13,500
located right here have no idea so let's
 

289
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,930
located right here have no idea so let's
look at West let's step out of that girl

290
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:16,940
look at West let's step out of that girl
 

291
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:23,930
look at West let's step out of that girl
okay and one arm from here because he's

292
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:23,940
okay and one arm from here because he's
 

293
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,760
okay and one arm from here because he's
leaning on me now do you see that that's

294
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:25,770
leaning on me now do you see that that's
 

295
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,430
leaning on me now do you see that that's
why I could project Meyer so one arm

296
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:28,440
why I could project Meyer so one arm
 

297
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,280
why I could project Meyer so one arm
from there is going to go like this

298
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,290

 

299
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:40,510

so he's gonna disappear going here

300
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:40,520

 

301
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,150

there's your figure eight that's your

302
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
there's your figure eight that's your
 

303
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,760
there's your figure eight that's your
same club that I hashed out he goes this

304
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:46,770
same club that I hashed out he goes this
 

305
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,940
same club that I hashed out he goes this
way and we're here that's your Sophie

306
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:49,950
way and we're here that's your Sophie
 

307
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:55,700
way and we're here that's your Sophie
not here right Eva this way the you

308
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:55,710
not here right Eva this way the you
 

309
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,080
not here right Eva this way the you
loaded mom is using your balance and you

310
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,090
loaded mom is using your balance and you
 

311
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:04,900
loaded mom is using your balance and you
take away that hand not like this right

312
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:04,910
take away that hand not like this right
 

313
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,360
take away that hand not like this right
you see that you have to make the

314
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,370
you see that you have to make the
 

315
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,050
you see that you have to make the
pattern it's this way

316
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:12,060
pattern it's this way
 

317
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,560
pattern it's this way
this way then then we'll finish this way

318
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:15,570
this way then then we'll finish this way
 

319
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,750
this way then then we'll finish this way
so I'd load him up boom and I go this

320
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:20,760
so I'd load him up boom and I go this
 

321
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,730
so I'd load him up boom and I go this
way and this way

322
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:24,740

 

323
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,610

this hand cannot contradict that it

324
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:28,620
this hand cannot contradict that it
 

325
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,170
this hand cannot contradict that it
loads him up then it's gonna disappear

326
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:32,180
loads him up then it's gonna disappear
 

327
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,520
loads him up then it's gonna disappear
not by going yet like the other hand but

328
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:37,530
not by going yet like the other hand but
 

329
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:43,960
not by going yet like the other hand but
by going up inside you pay attention

330
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:43,970
by going up inside you pay attention
 

331
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,970
by going up inside you pay attention
this hand is making his body do that

332
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:46,980
this hand is making his body do that
 

333
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:57,220
this hand is making his body do that
same pattern here now I tilted it so

334
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,230
same pattern here now I tilted it so
 

335
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,200
same pattern here now I tilted it so
connection that now he's on me and now I

336
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,210
connection that now he's on me and now I
 

337
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,960
connection that now he's on me and now I
just reconcile all of that with my two

338
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:02,970
just reconcile all of that with my two
 

339
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:11,540
just reconcile all of that with my two
hands but this is Aikido so my body does

340
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:11,550
hands but this is Aikido so my body does
 

341
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,690
hands but this is Aikido so my body does
that right these are patterns are just

342
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:14,700
that right these are patterns are just
 

343
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,040
that right these are patterns are just
doing this the heart shape everything

344
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,050
doing this the heart shape everything
 

345
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,680
doing this the heart shape everything
else happens because my body is charging

346
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:21,690
else happens because my body is charging
 

347
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,680
else happens because my body is charging
should enter got it so I'm always just

348
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:24,690
should enter got it so I'm always just
 

349
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,990
should enter got it so I'm always just
doing this and I make you my body

350
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
doing this and I make you my body
 

351
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,679
doing this and I make you my body
move so if you if you go here and you go

352
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:33,689
move so if you if you go here and you go
 

353
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:37,429
move so if you if you go here and you go
like this is gonna look kind of here so

354
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:37,439
like this is gonna look kind of here so
 

355
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:43,699
like this is gonna look kind of here so
I know my body won't anything see how my

356
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:43,709
I know my body won't anything see how my
 

357
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:47,749
I know my body won't anything see how my
body is moving right back dry tendencies

358
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:47,759
body is moving right back dry tendencies
 

359
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,530
body is moving right back dry tendencies
so the second elements we're getting to

360
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:51,540
so the second elements we're getting to
 

361
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:59,840
so the second elements we're getting to
work on is the arm so you guys are doing

362
00:11:59,840 --> 00:11:59,850
work on is the arm so you guys are doing
 

363
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,600
work on is the arm so you guys are doing
something

364
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:01,610
something
 

365
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,950
something
I'm going to try to describe it in

366
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:03,960
I'm going to try to describe it in
 

367
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,820
I'm going to try to describe it in
multiple ways you're making your hand go

368
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:07,830
multiple ways you're making your hand go
 

369
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,600
multiple ways you're making your hand go
on a circle and your elbows going on the

370
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:11,610
on a circle and your elbows going on the
 

371
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,830
on a circle and your elbows going on the
strip

372
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:13,840
strip
 

373
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,800
strip
that is like to circumcised one here and

374
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:16,810
that is like to circumcised one here and
 

375
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,780
that is like to circumcised one here and
there's one here and you're going like

376
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:18,790
there's one here and you're going like
 

377
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,980
there's one here and you're going like
this so you do the technique and then

378
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:22,990
this so you do the technique and then
 

379
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,100
this so you do the technique and then
you're going

380
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,110

 

381
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,510

if I use this plane here and I make a

382
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:31,520
if I use this plane here and I make a
 

383
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,000
if I use this plane here and I make a
circle it'll be a Halfmoon onto this

384
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,010
circle it'll be a Halfmoon onto this
 

385
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:42,850
circle it'll be a Halfmoon onto this
plane that's not what I wanted to do is

386
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:42,860
plane that's not what I wanted to do is
 

387
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,730
plane that's not what I wanted to do is
imagine like there's a ink spot here

388
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:45,740
imagine like there's a ink spot here
 

389
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,290
imagine like there's a ink spot here
like an ink roller okay and I wanted not

390
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:50,300
like an ink roller okay and I wanted not
 

391
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,620
like an ink roller okay and I wanted not
to touch that part and then be on the

392
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:53,630
to touch that part and then be on the
 

393
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,950
to touch that part and then be on the
other side of that same plane I wanted

394
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:56,960
other side of that same plane I wanted
 

395
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:05,530
other side of that same plane I wanted
to travel all around my arm see that so

396
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:05,540
to travel all around my arm see that so
 

397
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,779
to travel all around my arm see that so
it's like a coiling snake

398
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:10,789

 

399
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:14,989

so however I start I start let's say I'm

400
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:14,999
so however I start I start let's say I'm
 

401
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:20,359
so however I start I start let's say I'm
here at the end I'm going to end up on

402
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:20,369
here at the end I'm going to end up on
 

403
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:26,180
here at the end I'm going to end up on
the other side outside

404
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,190

 

405
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:31,069

so I go one you see I'm coming on my

406
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:31,079
so I go one you see I'm coming on my
 

407
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,710
so I go one you see I'm coming on my
other side there when I when I hit here

408
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:35,720
other side there when I when I hit here
 

409
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,160
other side there when I when I hit here
this outside

410
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,170
this outside
 

411
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:44,360
this outside
this part is touching the joke not the

412
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,370
this part is touching the joke not the
 

413
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:49,309
this part is touching the joke not the
inside of my arms so I'm going wrong

414
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:49,319
inside of my arms so I'm going wrong
 

415
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:52,730
inside of my arms so I'm going wrong
tracing that line all the way around do

416
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:52,740
tracing that line all the way around do
 

417
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,519
tracing that line all the way around do
you see that you guys see that I'm going

418
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:55,529
you see that you guys see that I'm going
 

419
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:57,579
you see that you guys see that I'm going
to touch the inside of my arm

420
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:57,589
to touch the inside of my arm
 

421
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:02,389
to touch the inside of my arm
you see that okay when I stay like this

422
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
you see that okay when I stay like this
 

423
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,490
you see that okay when I stay like this
square plane shoulders shoulders hip in

424
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:07,500
square plane shoulders shoulders hip in
 

425
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,249
square plane shoulders shoulders hip in
alignment you're gonna feel tightness

426
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:10,259
alignment you're gonna feel tightness
 

427
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:12,829
alignment you're gonna feel tightness
you know you do want the tour but it's

428
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:12,839
you know you do want the tour but it's
 

429
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,699
you know you do want the tour but it's
gonna be too much like oh that's gonna

430
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:16,709
gonna be too much like oh that's gonna
 

431
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:20,059
gonna be too much like oh that's gonna
get tight right and then when I turn I

432
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:20,069
get tight right and then when I turn I
 

433
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:23,030
get tight right and then when I turn I
took off that you see that when I come

434
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
took off that you see that when I come
 

435
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,420
took off that you see that when I come
back it's on and I turn the hold you see

436
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:26,430
back it's on and I turn the hold you see
 

437
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,139
back it's on and I turn the hold you see
that that little hip shift is what we're

438
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:30,149
that that little hip shift is what we're
 

439
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:31,699
that that little hip shift is what we're
going to do in the third element we're

440
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:31,709
going to do in the third element we're
 

441
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:35,389
going to do in the third element we're
gonna correct but right now I want you

442
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:35,399
gonna correct but right now I want you
 

443
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,309
gonna correct but right now I want you
to kind of eat roll a snake coiling

the outside of that elbow at the top
 

449
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,679
the outside of that elbow at the top
right and touching the joke oh you see

450
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:54,689
right and touching the joke oh you see
 

451
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:56,650
right and touching the joke oh you see
that

452
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:56,660
that

457
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:16,320

so I'm not making a circle where do you

458
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,330
so I'm not making a circle where do you
 

459
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,170
so I'm not making a circle where do you
let's just round it off to a foot I'm

460
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:19,180
let's just round it off to a foot I'm
 

461
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,690
let's just round it off to a foot I'm
not making a circle a foot away from me

462
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:21,700
not making a circle a foot away from me
 

463
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,680
not making a circle a foot away from me
and another equals circle six inches

464
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:25,690
and another equals circle six inches
 

465
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:32,070
and another equals circle six inches
away that's not what I'm doing I want to

466
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,080
away that's not what I'm doing I want to
 

467
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,160
away that's not what I'm doing I want to
keep the yin and the young going at

keep the yin and the young going at
 

469
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:42,140
keep the yin and the young going at
every level so as you as you watch this

470
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,150
every level so as you as you watch this
 

471
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,230
every level so as you as you watch this
this is what makes it a spiral so as my

472
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
this is what makes it a spiral so as my
 

473
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,070
this is what makes it a spiral so as my
arm this arm is more the hand is more in

474
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,080
arm this arm is more the hand is more in
 

475
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,110
arm this arm is more the hand is more in
dental elbow you see if you see that

476
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,120
dental elbow you see if you see that
 

477
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,180
dental elbow you see if you see that
okay so as it starts to move the hand is

478
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,190
okay so as it starts to move the hand is
 

479
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,350
okay so as it starts to move the hand is
going out do you see that and the elbow

480
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
going out do you see that and the elbow
 

481
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,540
going out do you see that and the elbow
is going in okay and as I come around

482
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:05,550
is going in okay and as I come around
 

483
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,360
is going in okay and as I come around
the elbow is in and the hand is out

484
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,370
the elbow is in and the hand is out
 

485
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,430
the elbow is in and the hand is out
they're not on the same plane as the

486
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
they're not on the same plane as the
 

487
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,930
they're not on the same plane as the
elbow the hand is starting to go up the

488
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:18,940
elbow the hand is starting to go up the
 

489
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,230
elbow the hand is starting to go up the
elbows going down did you see that as

490
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
elbows going down did you see that as
 

491
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,070
elbows going down did you see that as
the hand is coming in the elbow is going

492
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,080
the hand is coming in the elbow is going
 

493
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,150
the hand is coming in the elbow is going
out as the hand is starting to come down

494
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
out as the hand is starting to come down
 

495
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,290
out as the hand is starting to come down
the elbow is going up you see that so

496
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:34,300
the elbow is going up you see that so
 

497
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,670
the elbow is going up you see that so
they're not doing the same thing I have

498
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:38,680
they're not doing the same thing I have
 

499
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,360
they're not doing the same thing I have
a spiral and they're always harmonizing

500
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,370
a spiral and they're always harmonizing
 

501
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,360
a spiral and they're always harmonizing
those yin and Yan aspects they're not

502
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,370
those yin and Yan aspects they're not
 

503
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,820
those yin and Yan aspects they're not
doing the same thing it's not a young

504
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:47,830
doing the same thing it's not a young
 

505
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,140
doing the same thing it's not a young
arm or a yin arm it's both at different

506
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,150
arm or a yin arm it's both at different
 

507
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,940
arm or a yin arm it's both at different
points okay

508
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:53,950
points okay
 

509
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,860
points okay
do you understand so lose this stuff

510
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:57,870
do you understand so lose this stuff
 

511
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:05,880
do you understand so lose this stuff
right

512
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:05,890

 

513
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:12,610

long and for this throw this inner pump

514
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:12,620
long and for this throw this inner pump
 

515
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,220
long and for this throw this inner pump
this outer part has got to be the top

516
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:15,230
this outer part has got to be the top
 

517
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,970
this outer part has got to be the top
inner part at the end of the technique

okay so this is wrong this is wrong this

520
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:22,459
okay so this is wrong this is wrong this
 

521
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:26,980
okay so this is wrong this is wrong this
is wrong this is wrong I don't care

522
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:26,990
is wrong this is wrong I don't care
 

523
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,799
is wrong this is wrong I don't care
about the throat I care about the

524
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:29,809
about the throat I care about the
 

525
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:33,909
about the throat I care about the
movement the movement do you understand

526
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
movement the movement do you understand
 

527
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,650
movement the movement do you understand
I'm going to use that in a million

528
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:35,660
I'm going to use that in a million
 

529
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,570
I'm going to use that in a million
different ways even just at a

530
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:37,580
different ways even just at a
 

531
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,530
different ways even just at a
conditioning level right I might just

532
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:41,540
conditioning level right I might just
 

533
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,690
conditioning level right I might just
hit you with a oh but it will have

534
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:43,700
hit you with a oh but it will have
 

535
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,049
hit you with a oh but it will have
decades of that torquing and it will not

536
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:47,059
decades of that torquing and it will not
 

537
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,390
decades of that torquing and it will not
be the same as somebody who didn't spend

538
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:49,400
be the same as somebody who didn't spend
 

539
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,460
be the same as somebody who didn't spend
decades doing it you got it

540
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:51,470
decades doing it you got it
 

541
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,409
decades doing it you got it
so this spiral is helping me torque all

542
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:56,419
so this spiral is helping me torque all
 

543
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:58,780
so this spiral is helping me torque all
of those tissues and condition them and

544
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:58,790
of those tissues and condition them and
 

545
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:04,360
of those tissues and condition them and
as I'm torquing them I'm reducing the

546
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:04,370
as I'm torquing them I'm reducing the
 

547
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,590
as I'm torquing them I'm reducing the
lack of integrity in the joints and in

548
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:08,600
lack of integrity in the joints and in
 

549
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,730
lack of integrity in the joints and in
the tissues okay so try to keep that

550
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:12,740
the tissues okay so try to keep that
 

551
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,430
the tissues okay so try to keep that
going giving y'all standing up on the

work it his head is now the joke none of

562
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:33,710
work it his head is now the joke none of
 

563
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,909
work it his head is now the joke none of
you not the Joe over you all just trace

564
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:36,919
you not the Joe over you all just trace
 

565
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:40,150
you not the Joe over you all just trace
around that unit so I'd not not get his

566
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
around that unit so I'd not not get his
 

567
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,480
around that unit so I'd not not get his
head over I just traced it around okay

568
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:43,490
head over I just traced it around okay
 

569
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:54,190
head over I just traced it around okay
so that's so at the end that part right

570
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:54,200
so that's so at the end that part right
 

571
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,360
so that's so at the end that part right
if he still up is gonna touch him

572
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,370
if he still up is gonna touch him
 

573

they're not going to go like this with C

574
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,090
they're not going to go like this with C
 

575
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:10,750
they're not going to go like this with C
they go around so around the energy okay

576
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:10,760
they go around so around the energy okay
 

577
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,360
they go around so around the energy okay
let's try it like that you guys are

578
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,370
let's try it like that you guys are
 

579
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,000
let's try it like that you guys are
using your arm it's a sewing nephew item

580
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,010
using your arm it's a sewing nephew item
 

581
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,880
using your arm it's a sewing nephew item
why did we use the arms for what do they

582
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:18,890
why did we use the arms for what do they
 

583
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,940
why did we use the arms for what do they
make sense we already did it literally

584
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:21,950
make sense we already did it literally
 

585
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,880
make sense we already did it literally
they're turning the axis that's all

586
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:24,890
they're turning the axis that's all
 

587
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,770
they're turning the axis that's all
they're doing got it

588
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:26,780
they're doing got it
 

589
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,480
they're doing got it
you guys are trying to knock them down

590

you guys are trying to knock them down
 

591
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,470
you guys are trying to knock them down
so what happens is like once you feel

592
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
so what happens is like once you feel
 

593
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,290
so what happens is like once you feel
that then you're like gotcha but

594
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:38,300
that then you're like gotcha but
 

595
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,300
that then you're like gotcha but
now you're not doing that yogi what I

596
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:40,310
now you're not doing that yogi what I
 

597
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,000
now you're not doing that yogi what I
mean the tissue training and it doesn't

598
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,010
mean the tissue training and it doesn't
 

599
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,490
mean the tissue training and it doesn't
actually work if they're bigger than you

you have to discipline yourself just to
 

607
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,750
you have to discipline yourself just to
work the pattern don't do the throw do

happens with my head right here right

636
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,050
happens with my head right here right
 

637
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,050
happens with my head right here right
here this is the throat

638
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:49,060
here this is the throat
 

639
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,320
here this is the throat

okay so he's here right it's not

642
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:56,549
okay so he's here right it's not
 

643
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:00,729
okay so he's here right it's not
knocking down this it's displacing this

644
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:00,739
knocking down this it's displacing this
 

645
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:04,369
knocking down this it's displacing this
that's the throat so all my arm was

646
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:04,379
that's the throat so all my arm was
 

647
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:13,310
that's the throat so all my arm was
doing was tilting oh I just do the

648
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,320
doing was tilting oh I just do the
 

649
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:26,509
doing was tilting oh I just do the
pattern and this has been before you for

650
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:26,519
pattern and this has been before you for
 

651
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,499
pattern and this has been before you for
decades

some of you I don't I'm not throwing

654
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:37,470
some of you I don't I'm not throwing
 

655
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,710
some of you I don't I'm not throwing
them I'm just I like to say I'm creating

656
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720
them I'm just I like to say I'm creating
 

657
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,879
them I'm just I like to say I'm creating
in a geometry for falling okay so I

658
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:46,889
in a geometry for falling okay so I
 

659
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:53,330
in a geometry for falling okay so I
don't need a bracing angle or even a hip

660
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:53,340
don't need a bracing angle or even a hip
 

661
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,210
don't need a bracing angle or even a hip
rotation to get the throat it happened

662
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:56,220
rotation to get the throat it happened

the person was already following do you

664
00:21:59,570 --> 00:21:59,580
the person was already following do you
 

665
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,259
the person was already following do you
understand so and why is that important

666
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:03,269
understand so and why is that important
 

667
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:05,810
understand so and why is that important
because that means that I have redundant

668
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:05,820
because that means that I have redundant
 

669
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,180
because that means that I have redundant
elements and you need redundant elements

670
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,190
elements and you need redundant elements
 

671
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,489
elements and you need redundant elements
when ever you go you try to be marshal

672
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:10,499
when ever you go you try to be marshal
 

673
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:15,619
when ever you go you try to be marshal
thing things fail okay so you could you

00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:15,629
thing things fail okay so you could you
 

675
00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:19,930
thing things fail okay so you could you
should be able to do the throw without

676
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:19,940
should be able to do the throw without
 

677
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,680
should be able to do the throw without
even entering ok so then and then might

678
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:24,690
even entering ok so then and then might
 

679
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,200
even entering ok so then and then might
that means therefore my stance is not

680
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,210
that means therefore my stance is not
 

681
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,639
that means therefore my stance is not
really the throw in terms of the

682
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:30,649
really the throw in terms of the
 

683
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,129
really the throw in terms of the
acceleration do you get that so I'm not

684
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:34,139
acceleration do you get that so I'm not
 

685
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:37,029
acceleration do you get that so I'm not
accelerating this oh I don't need a

686
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
accelerating this oh I don't need a
 

687
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,720
accelerating this oh I don't need a
bracing angle I don't need a hit

688
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:41,730
bracing angle I don't need a hit
 

689
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:47,180
bracing angle I don't need a hit
rotation right what I want to do is to

690
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,190
rotation right what I want to do is to
 

691
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,229
rotation right what I want to do is to
get this hip I create that opening and

692
00:22:51,229 --> 00:22:51,239
get this hip I create that opening and
 

693
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:54,619
get this hip I create that opening and
the head is going this way his feet are

694
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:54,629
the head is going this way his feet are
 

695
00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:57,169
the head is going this way his feet are
going up in the air so I'm rotating that

696
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:57,179
going up in the air so I'm rotating that
 

697
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:02,450
going up in the air so I'm rotating that
and I'm going to now shorten the

698
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:02,460
and I'm going to now shorten the
 

699
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,239
and I'm going to now shorten the
rotation which means you will have less

700
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:05,249
rotation which means you will have less
 

701
00:23:05,249 --> 00:23:08,830
rotation which means you will have less
capacity to spin out of the technique

702
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:08,840
capacity to spin out of the technique
 

703
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,349
capacity to spin out of the technique
here so if I if he's here and I do like

704
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:12,359
here so if I if he's here and I do like
 

705
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,989
here so if I if he's here and I do like
a big thing he hadn't kind of turned

706
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:14,999
a big thing he hadn't kind of turned
 

707
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:19,849
a big thing he hadn't kind of turned
over this way but if I do it work I'm

708
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:19,859
over this way but if I do it work I'm
 

709
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:23,389
over this way but if I do it work I'm
right in here and I just spin this part

710
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:23,399
right in here and I just spin this part
 

711
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:26,930
right in here and I just spin this part
it's very hard for him to turn belly

712
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:26,940
it's very hard for him to turn belly
 

713
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,440
it's very hard for him to turn belly
down you get that you can't you can't

714
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:30,450
down you get that you can't you can't
 

715
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,190
down you get that you can't you can't
turn belly down so I'm gonna I got it

716
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:34,200
turn belly down so I'm gonna I got it
 

717
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,799
turn belly down so I'm gonna I got it
tilting and then I'm gonna change the

718
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:36,809
tilting and then I'm gonna change the
 

719
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:40,779
tilting and then I'm gonna change the
axis of rotation with my body and that

720
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:40,789
axis of rotation with my body and that
 

721
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:45,470
axis of rotation with my body and that
will help this thing as I rotate around

722
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:45,480
will help this thing as I rotate around
 

723
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,039
will help this thing as I rotate around
his center I'm also moving his center to

724
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:49,049
his center I'm also moving his center to
 

725
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:52,700
his center I'm also moving his center to
space you see that so his center is

726
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:52,710
space you see that so his center is
 

727
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,440
space you see that so his center is
moving through space and now it's

728
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:54,450
moving through space and now it's
 

729
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,090
moving through space and now it's
spinning around itself on my hip and you

730
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,100
spinning around itself on my hip and you
 

731
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,340
spinning around itself on my hip and you
can't go belly down okay so it's this

732
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:04,350
can't go belly down okay so it's this
 

733
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,370
can't go belly down okay so it's this
this is the action

734
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:07,380
this is the action
 

735
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,700
this is the action
so let's this is your drill you're going

736
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:11,710
so let's this is your drill you're going
 

737
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:17,220
so let's this is your drill you're going
to put a foot and a diagonal and bring

738
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,230
to put a foot and a diagonal and bring
 

739
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,490
to put a foot and a diagonal and bring
the other foot here and you're going to

740
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:20,500
the other foot here and you're going to
 

741
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:27,480
the other foot here and you're going to
push it Brown this leg pushing you will

742
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:27,490
push it Brown this leg pushing you will
 

743
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,240
push it Brown this leg pushing you will
have more weight on this leg at that you

744
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,250
have more weight on this leg at that you
 

745
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,200
have more weight on this leg at that you
see that so I'm not going this way right

746
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,210
see that so I'm not going this way right
 

747
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,910
see that so I'm not going this way right
I'm not going that way and then turn i'm

748
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:37,920
I'm not going that way and then turn i'm
 

749
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,690
I'm not going that way and then turn i'm
already turn

750
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:39,700
already turn
 

751
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:46,160
already turn
boom already turn so your guy is down

752
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,170
boom already turn so your guy is down
 

753
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,680
boom already turn so your guy is down
right he gets in that position I put

754
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:49,690
right he gets in that position I put
 

755
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,270
right he gets in that position I put
this foot look where do you put that

756
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:51,280
this foot look where do you put that
 

757
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,080
this foot look where do you put that
foot that foot is going to be behind his

758
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,090
foot that foot is going to be behind his
 

759
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:58,590
foot that foot is going to be behind his
other foot so that this foot can move

760
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:58,600
other foot so that this foot can move
 

761
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,060
other foot so that this foot can move
out in the trajectory where that foots

762
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,070
out in the trajectory where that foots
 

763
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:07,890
out in the trajectory where that foots
pushing okay so if this foot is here and

764
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:07,900
pushing okay so if this foot is here and
 

765
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,010
pushing okay so if this foot is here and
I try to get behind us foot this foots

766
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,020
I try to get behind us foot this foots
 

767
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,200
I try to get behind us foot this foots
not pushing all right do you understand

768
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,210
not pushing all right do you understand
 

769
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,500
not pushing all right do you understand
so this way has to be it can be a little

770
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:16,510
so this way has to be it can be a little
 

771
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,160
so this way has to be it can be a little
shy like I got some of this heel you see

772
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,170
shy like I got some of this heel you see
 

773
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,860
shy like I got some of this heel you see
that that will get my hip even closer

774
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:22,870
that that will get my hip even closer
 

775
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,100
that that will get my hip even closer
but it can't be to such a degree that is

776
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,110
but it can't be to such a degree that is
 

777
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:31,980
but it can't be to such a degree that is
no longer pushing anymore so and back

778
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:31,990
no longer pushing anymore so and back
 

779
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:36,140
no longer pushing anymore so and back
and then I'm close enough that my hip

780
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,150
and then I'm close enough that my hip
 

781
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:43,590
and then I'm close enough that my hip
will make his hip move got it but I'm

782
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:43,600
will make his hip move got it but I'm
 

783
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,680
will make his hip move got it but I'm
going to do that when he's here so I

784
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:46,690
going to do that when he's here so I
 

785
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:56,300
going to do that when he's here so I
just moving in okay try that
