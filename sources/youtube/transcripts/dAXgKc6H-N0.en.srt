kenag is another one of the throws in I

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,320
kenag is another one of the throws in I
 

7
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,629
kenag is another one of the throws in I
kiddo that I feel like kind of gets

8
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
kiddo that I feel like kind of gets
 

9
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,430
kiddo that I feel like kind of gets
messed up all the time and there's a lot

10
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440
messed up all the time and there's a lot
 

11
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,869
messed up all the time and there's a lot
of confusion about what it is the way it

12
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:15,879
of confusion about what it is the way it
 

13
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:18,630
of confusion about what it is the way it
looks in the form is fine but if you

14
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
looks in the form is fine but if you
 

15
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,269
looks in the form is fine but if you
tried to apply it the way it looks in

16
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:20,279
tried to apply it the way it looks in
 

17
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,710
tried to apply it the way it looks in
the form you'll probably find it's

18
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:21,720
the form you'll probably find it's
 

19
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,750
the form you'll probably find it's
really difficult at the same time I feel

20
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
really difficult at the same time I feel
 

21
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,269
really difficult at the same time I feel
like it's a throw that kind of comes off

22
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
like it's a throw that kind of comes off
 

23
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,269
like it's a throw that kind of comes off
in rondor and Gaza a fair amount and so

24
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:28,279
in rondor and Gaza a fair amount and so
 

25
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,269
in rondor and Gaza a fair amount and so
maybe you say oh well it must be an easy

26
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:30,279
maybe you say oh well it must be an easy
 

27
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,269
maybe you say oh well it must be an easy
technique but it's not like the form or

28
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:32,279
technique but it's not like the form or
 

29
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,150
technique but it's not like the form or
the form is right no one can do it right

30
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
the form is right no one can do it right
 

31
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,350
the form is right no one can do it right
and so that's why it comes off in Rond

32
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:36,360
and so that's why it comes off in Rond
 

33
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,110
and so that's why it comes off in Rond
or it comes off wrong you know so

34
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,120
or it comes off wrong you know so
 

35
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,470
or it comes off wrong you know so
there's all kinds of problems with the

36
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:39,480
there's all kinds of problems with the
 

37
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,029
there's all kinds of problems with the
way we look at kenag it just means turn

38
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:42,039
way we look at kenag it just means turn
 

39
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,830
way we look at kenag it just means turn

there's a color chart on the wall that
 

95

what does that mean in iido well in iido

100
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
what does that mean in iido well in iido
 

101
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,270
what does that mean in iido well in iido
the form for kitan pretty consistent l

102
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,280
the form for kitan pretty consistent l
 

103
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,910
the form for kitan pretty consistent l
in most schools looks like this and I

104
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
in most schools looks like this and I
 

105
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,149
in most schools looks like this and I
throw this guy and he flies away and

106
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
throw this guy and he flies away and
 

107
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,790
throw this guy and he flies away and
that's a kitan Nagi so kenag might seem

108
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:09,800
that's a kitan Nagi so kenag might seem
 

109
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,869
that's a kitan Nagi so kenag might seem
like a weird name for that throw I've

110
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
like a weird name for that throw I've
 

111
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,910
like a weird name for that throw I've
heard before that people say it's called

112
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:14,920
heard before that people say it's called
 

113
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,030
heard before that people say it's called
kenag because of that because it makes

114
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
kenag because of that because it makes
 

115
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,270
kenag because of that because it makes
you roll and rolling is kiten and so

116
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,280
you roll and rolling is kiten and so
 

117
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,790
you roll and rolling is kiten and so
then that would make sense like oh it

118
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:21,800
then that would make sense like oh it
 

119
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,869
then that would make sense like oh it
makes them do a roll but how does that

120
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:23,879
makes them do a roll but how does that
 

121
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,390
makes them do a roll but how does that
really distinguish it from a lot of

122
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:25,400
really distinguish it from a lot of
 

123
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,150
really distinguish it from a lot of
other throws in iido that make people

124
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,160
other throws in iido that make people
 

125
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,949
other throws in iido that make people
take rolls so a lot of things in iido

126
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:28,959
take rolls so a lot of things in iido
 

127
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,869
take rolls so a lot of things in iido
make people take a roll so how come that

128
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
make people take a roll so how come that
 

129
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,229
make people take a roll so how come that
one well you could argue that it's

130
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
one well you could argue that it's
 

131
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,430
one well you could argue that it's
specifically because it puts their head

132
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
specifically because it puts their head
 

133
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,150
specifically because it puts their head
down to the ground and they literally

134
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,160
down to the ground and they literally
 

135
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,030
down to the ground and they literally
have to take a roll or smash their face

136
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
have to take a roll or smash their face
 

137
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,910
have to take a roll or smash their face
okay so that's reasonable I think

138
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:38,920
okay so that's reasonable I think
 

139
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,190
okay so that's reasonable I think
there's really a different kind of

140
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,200
there's really a different kind of
 

141
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,390
there's really a different kind of
reason that we call it kiten um and I'll

142
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
reason that we call it kiten um and I'll
 

143
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,229
reason that we call it kiten um and I'll
show that in just a second but in the

144
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
show that in just a second but in the
 

145
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,070
show that in just a second but in the
form one of the problems we have and so

146
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
form one of the problems we have and so
 

147
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,869
form one of the problems we have and so
let's just do shanci that's real easy so

148
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:47,879
let's just do shanci that's real easy so
 

149
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,710
let's just do shanci that's real easy so
I go from here to here I draw this back

150
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
I go from here to here I draw this back
 

151
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,670
I go from here to here I draw this back
I catch his head and I do the throw and

152
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:52,680
I catch his head and I do the throw and
 

153
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,070
I catch his head and I do the throw and
one of the problems you're going to have

154
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
one of the problems you're going to have
 

155
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,869
one of the problems you're going to have
is his head is going to be very

156
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
is his head is going to be very
 

157
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,949
is his head is going to be very
difficult to push down so if you're

158
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
difficult to push down so if you're
 

159
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,589
difficult to push down so if you're
trying to push his head down that's

160
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:00,599
trying to push his head down that's
 

161
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,070
trying to push his head down that's
going to be hard now I know in the a

162
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,080
going to be hard now I know in the a
 

163
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,789
going to be hard now I know in the a
system there's a thing about this about

164
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:04,799
system there's a thing about this about
 

165
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,190
system there's a thing about this about
you should hold the head and not the

166
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,200
you should hold the head and not the
 

167
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,869
you should hold the head and not the
neck because if you hold the head it's

168
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:07,879
neck because if you hold the head it's
 

169
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,190
neck because if you hold the head it's
harder right so meaning if I tried to

170
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
harder right so meaning if I tried to
 

171
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,830
harder right so meaning if I tried to
grab Josh's neck just stand up for me if

172
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:10,840
grab Josh's neck just stand up for me if
 

173
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,190
grab Josh's neck just stand up for me if
I tried to grab Josh's neck and push him

174
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,200
I tried to grab Josh's neck and push him
 

175
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,949
I tried to grab Josh's neck and push him
down Josh can resist that pretty easy

176
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:13,959
down Josh can resist that pretty easy
 

177
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,149
down Josh can resist that pretty easy
however if I go to the top of his head

178
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:15,159
however if I go to the top of his head
 

179
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,789
however if I go to the top of his head
he wants to resist that less because

180
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:16,799
he wants to resist that less because
 

181
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,869
he wants to resist that less because
it's difficult on his neck so I know

182
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
it's difficult on his neck so I know
 

183
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,229
it's difficult on his neck so I know
there are conventions talking about

there are conventions talking about
little tricks to get their head to go

186
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840

187
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,270
little tricks to get their head to go
down but when I started having more

00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,280
down but when I started having more
 

189
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,030
down but when I started having more
success with kenag I realized that I

190
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
success with kenag I realized that I
 

191
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,869
success with kenag I realized that I
don't want to make their head go down

192
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879

they make their head go down and I just

194
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
they make their head go down and I just
 

195
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,710
they make their head go down and I just
take advantage of it and this is like a

196
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
take advantage of it and this is like a
 

197
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,390
take advantage of it and this is like a
lot of my iido that I realize there is a

198
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:35,400
lot of my iido that I realize there is a
 

199
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,589
lot of my iido that I realize there is a
situation created where he'll want to do

200
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
situation created where he'll want to do
 

201
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,910
situation created where he'll want to do
something and my job is to capitalize

202
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
something and my job is to capitalize
 

203
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,910
something and my job is to capitalize
upon that instead of trying to force him

204
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
upon that instead of trying to force him
 

205
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,270
upon that instead of trying to force him
to do that so instead of trying to force

206
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
to do that so instead of trying to force
 

207
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,149
to do that so instead of trying to force
this guy to do it there are situations

208
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:45,159
this guy to do it there are situations
 

209
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,190
this guy to do it there are situations
where he will put his head down now

210
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
where he will put his head down now
 

211
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,390
where he will put his head down now
those same situations will actually also

212
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:49,400
those same situations will actually also
 

213
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,229
those same situations will actually also
create a situation like this which is

214
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:52,239
create a situation like this which is
 

215
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,630
create a situation like this which is
much like a kiten so yes he's probably

216
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
much like a kiten so yes he's probably
 

217
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,069
much like a kiten so yes he's probably
going to do a roll out of it but also

218
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,079
going to do a roll out of it but also
 

219
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,630
going to do a roll out of it but also
it's going to create a kiten situation

220
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:57,640
it's going to create a kiten situation
 

221
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,509
it's going to create a kiten situation
let me explain let's say we were in

222
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:00,519
let me explain let's say we were in
 

223
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,350
let me explain let's say we were in
okay and I use triangle to get out boom

224

okay and I use triangle to get out boom
 

225
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,229
okay and I use triangle to get out boom
okay now Josh can't unless he's way more

226
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
okay now Josh can't unless he's way more
 

227
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,069
okay now Josh can't unless he's way more
powerful than me come in on this line

228
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:08,079
powerful than me come in on this line
 

229
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,309
powerful than me come in on this line
right because my hand's in the way okay

230
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
right because my hand's in the way okay
 

231
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,550
right because my hand's in the way okay
so going under that is very reasonable

232
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
so going under that is very reasonable
 

233
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,910
so going under that is very reasonable
and you see this in wrestling and all

234
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
and you see this in wrestling and all
 

235
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,150
and you see this in wrestling and all

240
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:21,639
and he'll go lower and I'll go lower now
 

241
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,830
and he'll go lower and I'll go lower now
look at what just happened now if I stay

242
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
look at what just happened now if I stay
 

243
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,310
look at what just happened now if I stay
right here when Josh does that you see

244
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:25,320
right here when Josh does that you see
 

245
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,870
right here when Josh does that you see
how my legs available to him he's going

246
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
how my legs available to him he's going
 

247

how my legs available to him he's going
to get my legs he's going to pull them

248
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,040
to get my legs he's going to pull them
 

249
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,150
to get my legs he's going to pull them
out from under me however if if when he

250
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
out from under me however if if when he
 

251
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,909
out from under me however if if when he
goes to grab that leg I turn like this

252
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:32,919
goes to grab that leg I turn like this
 

253
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,710
goes to grab that leg I turn like this
we notice what starts to happen a really

254
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:35,720
we notice what starts to happen a really
 

255
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,070
we notice what starts to happen a really
really effortless kitag we're kiening in

256
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
really effortless kitag we're kiening in
 

257
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,670
really effortless kitag we're kiening in
this way not in this way and I'm not

258
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:42,680
this way not in this way and I'm not
 

259
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,390
this way not in this way and I'm not
saying that the original definition

260
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
saying that the original definition
 

261
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,510
saying that the original definition
because you know zle kiten is a forward

262
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:46,520
because you know zle kiten is a forward
 

263
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,590
because you know zle kiten is a forward
role that makes sense with this but if

264
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:48,600
role that makes sense with this but if
 

265
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,150
role that makes sense with this but if
you think about the fact of the struggle

266
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
you think about the fact of the struggle
 

267
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,710
you think about the fact of the struggle
that's happening like this and then when

268
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:51,720
that's happening like this and then when
 

269
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,230
that's happening like this and then when
we start to plug it into our context

270
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:53,240
we start to plug it into our context
 

271
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,150
we start to plug it into our context
it'll make a lot more sense so

272
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,160
it'll make a lot more sense so
 

273
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,710
it'll make a lot more sense so
understand that I'm always trying to get

274
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
understand that I'm always trying to get
 

275
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,029
understand that I'm always trying to get
over here and then ideally back here now

276
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:00,039
over here and then ideally back here now
 

277
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,070
over here and then ideally back here now
if he's chasing me around that and I'm

278
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
if he's chasing me around that and I'm
 

279
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,510
if he's chasing me around that and I'm
putting my hand in his way as he's

280
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
putting my hand in his way as he's
 

281
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,469
putting my hand in his way as he's
chasing me around that that throw comes

282
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:05,479
chasing me around that that throw comes
 

283
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,510
chasing me around that that throw comes
off with me doing almost nothing right

284
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
off with me doing almost nothing right
 

285
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,029
off with me doing almost nothing right
so kitag toi is our basic defense for

286
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
so kitag toi is our basic defense for
 

287
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,710
so kitag toi is our basic defense for
low leg attacks and it comes off that

288
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:15,720
low leg attacks and it comes off that
 

289
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,590
low leg attacks and it comes off that
way for mainly two parts one is from any

290
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:18,600
way for mainly two parts one is from any
 

291
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,430
way for mainly two parts one is from any
kind of wide attack I one want to put

292
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
kind of wide attack I one want to put
 

293
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,909
kind of wide attack I one want to put
something in the middle so he can't just

294
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:22,919
something in the middle so he can't just
 

295
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,909
something in the middle so he can't just
enter in there and then two I'm going to

296
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:24,919
enter in there and then two I'm going to
 

297
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,150
enter in there and then two I'm going to
try and keep my space here now as he

298
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,160
try and keep my space here now as he
 

299
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,029
try and keep my space here now as he
comes into that I'm going to move myself

300
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
comes into that I'm going to move myself
 

301
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,590
comes into that I'm going to move myself
out and out and out until eventually we

302
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
out and out and out until eventually we
 

303
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,590
out and out and out until eventually we
get a kitan out of that right so the

304
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
get a kitan out of that right so the
 

305
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,749
get a kitan out of that right so the
kenag comes because he keeps pushing in

306
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
kenag comes because he keeps pushing in
 

307
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,070
kenag comes because he keeps pushing in
and I won't let him come up now if he

308
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
and I won't let him come up now if he
 

309
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,950
and I won't let him come up now if he
chose to come up that'd be fine we'd do

310
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:39,960
chose to come up that'd be fine we'd do
 

311
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,430
chose to come up that'd be fine we'd do
a different throw tons of stuff like

312
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
a different throw tons of stuff like
 

313
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,110
a different throw tons of stuff like

going under to circumvent that so
 

333
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,150
