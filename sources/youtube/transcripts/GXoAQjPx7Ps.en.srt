way around the

184
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
way around the
 

185
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:36,269
way around the
P boom around the resistance of

186
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:36,279

 

187
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:42,750

the pushing it and I'm shoving it

188
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:42,760

 

189
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,269

down that's wrong who

190
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:48,279
down that's wrong who
 

191
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,110
down that's wrong who
around boom

192
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,120

 

193
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,790

around now you have your spiral rotation

194
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
around now you have your spiral rotation
 

195
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:05,750
around now you have your spiral rotation
on your internals

196
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760

 

197
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,990

again there it is C pass the arm around

198
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
again there it is C pass the arm around

203
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,350

again don't my pattern is out

204
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
again don't my pattern is out
 

205
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,150
again don't my pattern is out
rotate rotate rotate the other way okay

235
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,470

key and this CU I'm over the elbow you

236
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
key and this CU I'm over the elbow you
 

237
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,829
key and this CU I'm over the elbow you
can see I'm over the

238
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839

 

239
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,949

El over the El over the

240
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959

 

241
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,150

El this also follows the general rule as

242
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,160
El this also follows the general rule as
 

243
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,430
El this also follows the general rule as
as you attack and he defends that's

244
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:18,440
as you attack and he defends that's
 

245
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,670
as you attack and he defends that's
where the elbow is going to exposed do

246
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:20,680
where the elbow is going to exposed do
 

247
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,990
where the elbow is going to exposed do
you see so you got to attack the core

248
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,000
you see so you got to attack the core
 

249
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,670
you see so you got to attack the core
then the arms become

250
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
then the arms become
 

251
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,550
then the arms become
vulnerable and then you you can work

252
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:29,560
vulnerable and then you you can work
 

253
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,829
vulnerable and then you you can work
your way back from the arms back to the

254
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
your way back from the arms back to the
 

255
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,189
your way back from the arms back to the
core okay so when I come around I'm

256
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:36,199
core okay so when I come around I'm
 

257
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:38,990
core okay so when I come around I'm
attacking the core he counters so I go

258
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,000
attacking the core he counters so I go
 

259
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,189
attacking the core he counters so I go
take the arm okay and now I got the core
