especially on the grounding foot is at
 

69
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,550
especially on the grounding foot is at
the midfoot and we use one midfoot at a

the midfoot and we use one midfoot at a
 

71
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,190
the midfoot and we use one midfoot at a
time in techniques you never use two

and already at his pressure that he's
 

327
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,389
and already at his pressure that he's
doing now my shoulder is starting to

328
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:47,399
doing now my shoulder is starting to
 

329
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,230
doing now my shoulder is starting to
burn as I'm trying to hold this kind of

330
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:49,240
burn as I'm trying to hold this kind of
 

331
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,949
burn as I'm trying to hold this kind of
thing and you could gradually push you

332
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:51,959
thing and you could gradually push you
 

333
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,310
thing and you could gradually push you
you already have me there's the heel

334
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:53,320
you already have me there's the heel
 

335
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,150
you already have me there's the heel
weight and then there I go okay

336
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160
weight and then there I go okay
 

337
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,710
weight and then there I go okay
so if if you follow the

338
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720

 

339
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,870

rules knee to

340
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:05,880
rules knee to
 

341
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,190
rules knee to
toes mid foot it will

342
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,200
toes mid foot it will
 

343
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,990
toes mid foot it will
fix that okay but if you're in iido

344
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,000
fix that okay but if you're in iido
 

345
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,269
fix that okay but if you're in iido
culture you're going to go knee to

346
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
culture you're going to go knee to
 

347
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,509
culture you're going to go knee to
midfoot and you're going to create

348
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:20,519
midfoot and you're going to create
 

349
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,470
midfoot and you're going to create
that that

350
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
that that
 

351
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,630
that that
samurai samurai stance which is not

352
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:25,640
samurai samurai stance which is not
 

353
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,550
samurai samurai stance which is not
really in the samurai stance or nor in

354
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
really in the samurai stance or nor in
 

355
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,870
really in the samurai stance or nor in
the martial arts okay so you have to

356
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
the martial arts okay so you have to
 

357
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,790
the martial arts okay so you have to
watch that back it would be no

358
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
watch that back it would be no
 

359
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,269
watch that back it would be no
different if I was

360
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:38,279
different if I was
 

361
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:44,069
different if I was
here and you see this a lot in in Ikea

362
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:44,079
here and you see this a lot in in Ikea
 

363
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:45,949
here and you see this a lot in in Ikea
you see and you're going like this this

364
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:45,959
you see and you're going like this this
 

365
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,750
you see and you're going like this this
is all back bracing angle with the lower

366
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:50,760
is all back bracing angle with the lower
 

367
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,509
is all back bracing angle with the lower
back

368
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
back
 

369
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,030
back
instead I'm

370
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,040
instead I'm
 

371
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,550
instead I'm
flat here not here

372
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:01,560

 

373
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,069

here he's driving and is just

374
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:05,079
here he's driving and is just
 

375
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,949
here he's driving and is just
pushing that down don't go up cuz then

376
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
pushing that down don't go up cuz then
 

377
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,910
pushing that down don't go up cuz then
you'll come over

378
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:10,920
you'll come over
 

379
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,310
you'll come over
okay so another way of thinking of

380
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320

 

381
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,269

it is

382
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
it is
 

383
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,910
it is
that everything hangs off my

384
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:22,920
that everything hangs off my
 

385
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,430
that everything hangs off my
spine but my spine is being hooked up

386
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:28,440
spine but my spine is being hooked up
 

387
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,190
spine but my spine is being hooked up
like a butcher

388
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:30,200
like a butcher
 

389
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,110
like a butcher
side of a cow it's hooked up on the

390
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,120
side of a cow it's hooked up on the
 

391
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,030
side of a cow it's hooked up on the
ceiling and if you curl this that would

392
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,040
ceiling and if you curl this that would
 

393
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,910
ceiling and if you curl this that would
be

394
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:38,920
be
 

395
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,629
be
weird it should just

396
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:42,639
weird it should just
 

397
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,350
weird it should just
hang and that's not going to be there

398
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
hang and that's not going to be there
 

399
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,870
hang and that's not going to be there
you don't want that tension in there so

400
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:47,880
you don't want that tension in there so
 

401
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,269
you don't want that tension in there so
by these two

402
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
by these two
 

403
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,430
by these two
metrics midfoot knee to toes you can't

404
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
metrics midfoot knee to toes you can't
 

405
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,190
metrics midfoot knee to toes you can't
do this and by the other metric my spine

406
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:56,200
do this and by the other metric my spine
 

407
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,790
do this and by the other metric my spine
just hangs from the ceiling you can't do

408
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
just hangs from the ceiling you can't do
 

409
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,949
just hangs from the ceiling you can't do
this either

410
00:10:59,949 --> 00:10:59,959
this either
 

411
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,829
this either
okay so careful though cuz when I say

412
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
okay so careful though cuz when I say
 

413
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,310
okay so careful though cuz when I say
this especially you you come too far

414
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
this especially you you come too far
 

415
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,910
this especially you you come too far
under you see and now you're on your

416
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:08,920
under you see and now you're on your
 

417
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,069
under you see and now you're on your
toes not on the midfoot okay and you'll

418
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
toes not on the midfoot okay and you'll
 

419
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,470
toes not on the midfoot okay and you'll
get rolled out over the toes so same

420
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
get rolled out over the toes so same
 

421
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,829
get rolled out over the toes so same
thing boom straight I go under and

422
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:20,839
thing boom straight I go under and
 

423
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,269
thing boom straight I go under and
eventually keep going there I go roll

424
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
eventually keep going there I go roll
 

425
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,710
eventually keep going there I go roll
out over the side of my foot okay all

426
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
out over the side of my foot okay all
 

427
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,389
out over the side of my foot okay all
right so you your pelvis has to be in a

428
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
right so you your pelvis has to be in a
 

429
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,190
right so you your pelvis has to be in a
certain place okay and use those metrics

430
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
certain place okay and use those metrics
 

431
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,069
certain place okay and use those metrics
I gave you all right TR okay the next uh

432
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:39,079
I gave you all right TR okay the next uh
 

433
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,190
I gave you all right TR okay the next uh
iido

434
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
iido
 

435
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,350
iido
fallacy is you're up straight you're up

436
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
fallacy is you're up straight you're up
 

437
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,230
fallacy is you're up straight you're up
straight like this you

438
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,240
straight like this you
 

439
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,790
straight like this you
see okay

440
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:49,800
see okay
 

441
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,629
see okay
so I'll find I'll go to the Yong on off

442
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
so I'll find I'll go to the Yong on off
 

443
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,990
so I'll find I'll go to the Yong on off
you can give me some pressure I find the

444
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,000
you can give me some pressure I find the
 

445
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,790
you can give me some pressure I find the
midfoot now I'm going to do that other

446
00:11:59,790 --> 00:11:59,800
midfoot now I'm going to do that other
 

447
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,190
midfoot now I'm going to do that other
stance so keep your pressure going and I

448
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:02,200
stance so keep your pressure going and I
 

449
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,150
stance so keep your pressure going and I
do the other stance and now I'm not

450
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,160
do the other stance and now I'm not
 

451
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,910
do the other stance and now I'm not
midfoot okay I get I get heel weighted

452
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:08,920
midfoot okay I get I get heel weighted
 

453
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,990
midfoot okay I get I get heel weighted
again and I eventually the force goes

454
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
again and I eventually the force goes
 

455
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,389
again and I eventually the force goes
over the

456
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:13,399
over the
 

457
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,949
over the
heel

458
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
heel
 

459
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,990
heel
so that's going to be I want you guys to

460
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
so that's going to be I want you guys to
 

461
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,990
so that's going to be I want you guys to
try that get get to the midfoot get to

462
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
try that get get to the midfoot get to
 

463
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,189
try that get get to the midfoot get to
the good midfoot with a good pelvis

464
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:23,199
the good midfoot with a good pelvis
 

465
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:26,030
the good midfoot with a good pelvis
they'll keep the pressure and then stand

466
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,040
they'll keep the pressure and then stand
 

467
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,310
they'll keep the pressure and then stand
up straight and you'll see Ah that's

468
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:29,320
up straight and you'll see Ah that's
 

469
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,069
up straight and you'll see Ah that's
okay all right so that's not what we do

470
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:33,079
okay all right so that's not what we do
 

471
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:38,350
okay all right so that's not what we do
you just follow the rules knee to toes

472
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:38,360
you just follow the rules knee to toes
 

473
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,389
you just follow the rules knee to toes
weight on the mid fooot pelvis in the

474
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:41,399
weight on the mid fooot pelvis in the
 

475
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,750
weight on the mid fooot pelvis in the
right place and that's the angle that

476
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
right place and that's the angle that
 

477
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,269
right place and that's the angle that
your torso is in that's the angle and

478
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:46,279
your torso is in that's the angle and
 

479
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,829
your torso is in that's the angle and
it's kind of like not here just a little

480
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839
it's kind of like not here just a little
 

481
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,430
it's kind of like not here just a little
just a little forward okay here straight

482
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
just a little forward okay here straight
 

483
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,710
just a little forward okay here straight
and there I go okay all right try it

484
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
and there I go okay all right try it
 

485
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,750
and there I go okay all right try it
again all right so those adjustments and

486
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:00,760
again all right so those adjustments and
 

487
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,069
again all right so those adjustments and
Rio you need to make those adjustments

488
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:03,079
Rio you need to make those adjustments
 

489
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:05,350
Rio you need to make those adjustments
Margaret you're doing pretty good on all

important don't do that one okay and you

678
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,520
important don't do that one okay and you
 

679
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,430
important don't do that one okay and you
start figuring it

680
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
start figuring it
 

681
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,549
start figuring it
out that it's really a very small thing

682
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
out that it's really a very small thing
 

683
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,710
out that it's really a very small thing
that has to maintain Integrity but you

684
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
that has to maintain Integrity but you
 

685
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,870
that has to maintain Integrity but you
have to start from the big thing and you

686
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:15,880
have to start from the big thing and you
 

687
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,990
have to start from the big thing and you
experiment as you start

688
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
experiment as you start
 

689
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,590
experiment as you start
releasing uh more and more of that

690
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:20,600
releasing uh more and more of that
 

691
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,750
releasing uh more and more of that
muscle tension but if you're just like

692
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:22,760
muscle tension but if you're just like
 

693
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,789
muscle tension but if you're just like
here uh and you never

694
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
here uh and you never
 

695
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,110
here uh and you never
get any structural Integrity we you

696
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120
get any structural Integrity we you
 

697
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,870
get any structural Integrity we you
you're never going to get there it's

698
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:32,880
you're never going to get there it's
 

699

easier to have a mixture of external and
internal structural integrity and then

702
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
internal structural integrity and then
 

703
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,470
internal structural integrity and then
start taking away those external blocks

704
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:41,480
start taking away those external blocks
 

705
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,630
