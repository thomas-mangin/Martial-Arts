all right uh we're going to introduce
 

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,190
all right uh we're going to introduce
lift number

4
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:04,200
lift number
 

5
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,830
lift number
one um we do about four or five lifts

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:07,840
one um we do about four or five lifts
 

7
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,910
one um we do about four or five lifts
only U and our goal here is objective

8
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:10,920
only U and our goal here is objective
 

9
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,150
only U and our goal here is objective
strength gain okay so we'll review the

10
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160
strength gain okay so we'll review the
 

11
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,630
strength gain okay so we'll review the
bench press lift number one so ronan's

12
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:17,640
bench press lift number one so ronan's
 

13
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,109
bench press lift number one so ronan's
going to help me out

14
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
going to help me out
 

15
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,590
going to help me out
here you guys can come around so you can

16
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
here you guys can come around so you can
 

17
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,029
here you guys can come around so you can
see

18
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
see
 

19
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,150
see
everything all right the first thing is

20
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:25,160
everything all right the first thing is
 

21
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,390
everything all right the first thing is
how to how to and where to position

22
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:27,400
how to how to and where to position
 

23
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,150
how to how to and where to position
yourself on the bench so when you start

24
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
yourself on the bench so when you start
 

25
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,589
yourself on the bench so when you start
out you're going to put your eyes right

26
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:32,599
out you're going to put your eyes right
 

27
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,350
out you're going to put your eyes right
underneath the bar that's what he's

28
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:34,360
underneath the bar that's what he's
 

29
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,389
underneath the bar that's what he's
doing right there okay so the question

30
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:37,399
doing right there okay so the question
 

31
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,910
doing right there okay so the question
here is how far forward or how far down

32
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
here is how far forward or how far down
 

33
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,510
here is how far forward or how far down
towards my feet am I on the bench I put

34
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:42,520
towards my feet am I on the bench I put
 

35
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,670
towards my feet am I on the bench I put
my eyes right underneath the bar that's

36
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:44,680
my eyes right underneath the bar that's
 

37
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,590
my eyes right underneath the bar that's
the answer

38
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:46,600
the answer
 

39
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,069
the answer
okay um you want your feet flat on the

40
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
okay um you want your feet flat on the
 

41
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,709
okay um you want your feet flat on the
ground and if you cannot do that then

42
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:53,719
ground and if you cannot do that then
 

43
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,709
ground and if you cannot do that then
you can make these risers I'm sure

44
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:55,719
you can make these risers I'm sure
 

45
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,709
you can make these risers I'm sure
someone sells them but we just made them

46
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
someone sells them but we just made them
 

47
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,670
someone sells them but we just made them
and again you just want a stable

48
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:00,680
and again you just want a stable
 

49
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,270
and again you just want a stable
platform you don't want the balls of

50
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:02,280
platform you don't want the balls of
 

51
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,109
platform you don't want the balls of
your feet being the only thing you're

52
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
your feet being the only thing you're
 

53
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,950
your feet being the only thing you're
touching the next question here is where

54
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:07,960
touching the next question here is where
 

55
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,870
touching the next question here is where
do I grip the bar okay you if you look

56
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:11,880
do I grip the bar okay you if you look
 

57
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,510
do I grip the bar okay you if you look
at the bar I'm not sure they'll show up

58
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
at the bar I'm not sure they'll show up
 

59
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,109
at the bar I'm not sure they'll show up
on camera but they have these nerling

60
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:16,119
on camera but they have these nerling
 

61
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,230
on camera but they have these nerling
marks one here one here and then the

62
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
marks one here one here and then the
 

63
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,109
marks one here one here and then the
inside nerling line and you use these

64
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
inside nerling line and you use these
 

65
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,270
inside nerling line and you use these
lines to gain a symmetrical grip between

66
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,280
lines to gain a symmetrical grip between
 

67
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,350
lines to gain a symmetrical grip between
your right and left hand your main thing

68
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
your right and left hand your main thing
 

69
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,670
your right and left hand your main thing
here is that your arm should not be too

70
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
here is that your arm should not be too
 

71
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,910
here is that your arm should not be too
open nor too closed and so the rule of

72
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:34,920
open nor too closed and so the rule of
 

73
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,670
open nor too closed and so the rule of
thumb is that your forearms are going to

74
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
thumb is that your forearms are going to
 

75
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,910
thumb is that your forearms are going to
be straight at the down position so

76
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:39,920
be straight at the down position so
 

77
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,270
be straight at the down position so
that's what he's demonstrating right now

78
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:42,280
that's what he's demonstrating right now
 

79
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,030
that's what he's demonstrating right now
okay if they're too uh close they'll be

80
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,040
okay if they're too uh close they'll be
 

81
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,310
okay if they're too uh close they'll be
in at a diagonal and if they're too far

82
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
in at a diagonal and if they're too far
 

83
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,109
in at a diagonal and if they're too far
away they're out at a diagonal so the

84
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
away they're out at a diagonal so the
 

85
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,630
away they're out at a diagonal so the
best way of doing this is have no weight

86
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:53,640
best way of doing this is have no weight
 

87
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,469
best way of doing this is have no weight
on the bar guesstimate where you think

88
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:57,479
on the bar guesstimate where you think
 

89
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,990
on the bar guesstimate where you think
your hands need to be go you would take

90
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
your hands need to be go you would take
 

91
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,670
your hands need to be go you would take
the bar off this is light for him so we

92
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:02,680
the bar off this is light for him so we
 

93
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,270
the bar off this is light for him so we
we're going to just leave the weight on

94
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
we're going to just leave the weight on
 

95
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,190
we're going to just leave the weight on
and then you come down and your partner

96
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
and then you come down and your partner
 

97
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,270
and then you come down and your partner
tells you a little bit more out a little

98
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
tells you a little bit more out a little
 

99
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,190
tells you a little bit more out a little
more in with your forearm you mark it

100
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,200
more in with your forearm you mark it
 

101
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,670
more in with your forearm you mark it
using those knurling lines so that you

102
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:14,680
using those knurling lines so that you
 

103
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,509
using those knurling lines so that you
have a symmetrical grip and then up goes

104
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:17,519
have a symmetrical grip and then up goes
 

105
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,070
have a symmetrical grip and then up goes
the bar back on and so when you now grab

106
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,080
the bar back on and so when you now grab
 

107
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,949
the bar back on and so when you now grab
the bar that's what you use so what he's

108
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:23,959
the bar that's what you use so what he's
 

109
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,150
the bar that's what you use so what he's
using his pinky on the inner knurling

110
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
using his pinky on the inner knurling
 

111
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,350
using his pinky on the inner knurling
okay so he puts both pinkies on that Inn

112
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:30,360
okay so he puts both pinkies on that Inn
 

113
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,350
okay so he puts both pinkies on that Inn
earling and now he knows that's where he

114
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:32,360
earling and now he knows that's where he
 

115
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,350
earling and now he knows that's where he
grips the bar

116
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:34,360
grips the bar
 

117
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,949
grips the bar
okay uh the path of the bar and we'll

118
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:37,959
okay uh the path of the bar and we'll
 

119
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,509
okay uh the path of the bar and we'll
also introduce the spotter at this

120
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:40,519
also introduce the spotter at this
 

121
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,190
also introduce the spotter at this
time so as you get heavy you don't ever

122
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
time so as you get heavy you don't ever
 

123
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,869
time so as you get heavy you don't ever
want to lift alone and we want to lift

124
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:45,879
want to lift alone and we want to lift
 

125
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,630
want to lift alone and we want to lift
heavy because you only gain strength by

126
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
heavy because you only gain strength by
 

127
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,790
heavy because you only gain strength by
increasing the resistance which means

128
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
increasing the resistance which means
 

129
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,869
increasing the resistance which means
you want to lift heavy so your partner

130
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:53,879
you want to lift heavy so your partner
 

131
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,149
you want to lift heavy so your partner
is standing at the Forefront of the

132
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:56,159
is standing at the Forefront of the
 

133
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,589
is standing at the Forefront of the
bench they have a good stance ready to

134
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:58,599
bench they have a good stance ready to
 

135
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,070
bench they have a good stance ready to
save your life if they need to uh which

136
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,080
save your life if they need to uh which
 

137
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,750
save your life if they need to uh which
could range from anything from you have

138
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:02,760
could range from anything from you have
 

139
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,710
could range from anything from you have
a cramp to you have a heart attack and

140
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
a cramp to you have a heart attack and
 

141
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,750
a cramp to you have a heart attack and
you're just completely out of it we

142
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:06,760
you're just completely out of it we
 

143
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,470
you're just completely out of it we
don't want that bar falling on you so

144
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
don't want that bar falling on you so
 

145
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,270
don't want that bar falling on you so
they need a very good stance okay and if

146
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
they need a very good stance okay and if
 

147
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,190
they need a very good stance okay and if
they need to what they'll do is they'll

148
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
they need to what they'll do is they'll
 

149
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,789
they need to what they'll do is they'll
drop one end on the floor and then they

150
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:15,799
drop one end on the floor and then they
 

151
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,550
drop one end on the floor and then they
lift only half the weight using the

152
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:17,560
lift only half the weight using the
 

153
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,589
lift only half the weight using the
leverage uh in that lean to just get the

154
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:20,599
leverage uh in that lean to just get the
 

155
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,070
leverage uh in that lean to just get the
other part off of you

156
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,080
other part off of you
 

157
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,270
other part off of you
okay um inside our gym and just like

158
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,280
okay um inside our gym and just like
 

159
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,550
okay um inside our gym and just like
wherever you're lifting if Tristan just

160
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
wherever you're lifting if Tristan just
 

161
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,710
wherever you're lifting if Tristan just

the path to action for the lift so the
 

201
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,229
the path to action for the lift so the
bar will go down it will touch your

lift you want to lift somewhere between
 

217
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,710
lift you want to lift somewhere between
80 and 90% of your maximum because we're

218
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
80 and 90% of your maximum because we're
 

219

only going to do five sets of five so
 

221
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,629
only going to do five sets of five so
you're never going to do more than that

222
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
you're never going to do more than that

235
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,390

so Tristan do what's that math right 245

236
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
so Tristan do what's that math right 245
 

237
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,990
so Tristan do what's that math right 245
okay so he's lifting

80% well
80% is like number five at set one you

244
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:44,759
80% is like number five at set one you
 

245
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,550
80% is like number five at set one you
make it but you know it's hard uh number

246
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:47,560
make it but you know it's hard uh number
 

247
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,990
make it but you know it's hard uh number
four and five at set five like you're

248
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
four and five at set five like you're
 

249
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,909
four and five at set five like you're
barely making it but you make it if you

250
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:52,919
barely making it but you make it if you
 

251

259
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,990
going to demonstrate we're going to Fain
that Ronin is on set five a rep four and

260
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
that Ronin is on set five a rep four and
 

261
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,270
that Ronin is on set five a rep four and
you just can't get the bar up okay so

you just can't get the bar up okay so
 

263
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,830
you just can't get the bar up okay so
he's down this is set five rep four he

264
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
he's down this is set five rep four he
 

265
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,230
he's down this is set five rep four he
calls spot R Tristan will give him two

266
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:21,240
calls spot R Tristan will give him two
 

267
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,629
calls spot R Tristan will give him two
finger lift okay and then uh we'll

268
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:25,639
finger lift okay and then uh we'll
 

269
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,309
finger lift okay and then uh we'll
either take the bar off so Tristan will

270
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
either take the bar off so Tristan will
 

271
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,110
either take the bar off so Tristan will
give him a chance to do it with two

272
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,120
give him a chance to do it with two
 

273
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,189
give him a chance to do it with two
fingers only but if Ronin can't do it

274
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
fingers only but if Ronin can't do it
 

275
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,270
fingers only but if Ronin can't do it
then we don't fudge around with spotters

276
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
then we don't fudge around with spotters
 

277
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,270
then we don't fudge around with spotters
we just take the bar back off okay so

278
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
we just take the bar back off okay so
 

279
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,950
we just take the bar back off okay so
we'll do it one more time and Ronan will

280
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:39,960
we'll do it one more time and Ronan will
 

281
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,870
we'll do it one more time and Ronan will
this is all fake okay so he goes down

282
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880

right um a fully perform set looks like

304
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
right um a fully perform set looks like
 

305
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,029
right um a fully perform set looks like
this he's going to do a set of five of

306
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:20,039
this he's going to do a set of five of
 

307
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:35,110
this he's going to do a set of five of
this one two three

308

309
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,589

okay so as you can see around five even

310
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
okay so as you can see around five even
 

311
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,749
okay so as you can see around five even
on set what would this might be like set

312
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
on set what would this might be like set
 

313
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,350
on set what would this might be like set
two he's working to get it up there

314
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:42,360
two he's working to get it up there
 

315
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,629
two he's working to get it up there

off one deal one detail so if Rodan

348
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,080
off one deal one detail so if Rodan
 

349
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,190
off one deal one detail so if Rodan
keeps his back perfectly flat on the

350
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:36,200
keeps his back perfectly flat on the
 

351
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,990
keeps his back perfectly flat on the
bench uh what will happen is his

352
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,000
bench uh what will happen is his
 

353
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,589
bench uh what will happen is his
shoulder mechanism will impinge the

354
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
shoulder mechanism will impinge the
 

355
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,470

lowering of his elbow it kind of gets

356
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
lowering of his elbow it kind of gets
 

357
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,470
lowering of his elbow it kind of gets
locked in there so if you look his hand

358
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:47,480
locked in there so if you look his hand
 

359
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,790
locked in there so if you look his hand
level is actually would have the bar not

360
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:49,800
level is actually would have the bar not

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,310
level is actually would have the bar not
touching his chest so what you have to

362

touching his chest so what you have to
 

363
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,230
touching his chest so what you have to
do is take away that shoulder imp

364
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
do is take away that shoulder imp
 

365

his shoulder the blades together and now
 

371
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,590
his shoulder the blades together and now
you can see that the bar is low enough

372
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
you can see that the bar is low enough

to touch his uh chest so just to
 

375
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,230
to touch his uh chest so just to
demonstrate we'll take a little more

376
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:09,240
demonstrate we'll take a little more

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,150
demonstrate we'll take a little more
weight

378
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,160

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360

 

381
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,389

25 the incorrect way of doing this is

382
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
25 the incorrect way of doing this is
 

383
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,829
25 the incorrect way of doing this is
with a flat

back uh I don't want you to push through
the impingment but just to show how the

388
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
the impingment but just to show how the
 

389
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,670
the impingment but just to show how the
bar wouldn't be on your chest keeps a
