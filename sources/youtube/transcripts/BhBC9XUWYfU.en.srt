hi

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:01,920
hi
 

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,889
hi
on the

4
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:03,899
on the
 

5
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,249
on the
on the films I've been talking about Out

6
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:07,259
on the films I've been talking about Out
 

7
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,290
on the films I've been talking about Out
of Body Experience

8
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:09,300
of Body Experience
 

9
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,810
of Body Experience
but

10
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:11,820
but
 

11
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,490
but
I don't really know what that means

12
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:13,500
I don't really know what that means
 

13
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,369
I don't really know what that means
because what I've been talking about is

14
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:16,379
because what I've been talking about is
 

15
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,810
because what I've been talking about is
an inner body experience

16
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:20,820

 

17
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,810

I think when you say the outer body

18
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:23,820
I think when you say the outer body
 

19
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,050
I think when you say the outer body
experience when we're unsure of

20
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:27,060
experience when we're unsure of
 

21
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,050
experience when we're unsure of
what we're saying because it's

22
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:30,060
what we're saying because it's
 

23
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,990
what we're saying because it's
it's something that we we can't equate

24
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,000
it's something that we we can't equate
 

25
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,630
it's something that we we can't equate
to we it's not something that happens is

26
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:35,640
to we it's not something that happens is
 

27
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,950
to we it's not something that happens is
it

28
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
it
 

29
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,069
it
I'm sure we all touch from time to time

30
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
I'm sure we all touch from time to time
 

31
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,330
I'm sure we all touch from time to time
a Deja Vu moment

32
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:44,340

 

33
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,510

and I'd put it more in the deja vu

34
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
and I'd put it more in the deja vu
 

35
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,529
and I'd put it more in the deja vu
category

36
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:48,539
category
 

37
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,110
category
but what about if you had a Deja Vu

38
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
but what about if you had a Deja Vu
 

39
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,069
but what about if you had a Deja Vu
moment that lasted and lasted and lasted

40
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:55,079
moment that lasted and lasted and lasted
 

41
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,889
moment that lasted and lasted and lasted
and those who've seen um

42
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:57,899
and those who've seen um
 

43
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,490
and those who've seen um
grow up the film Groundhog Day

44
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:01,500
grow up the film Groundhog Day
 

45
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,969
grow up the film Groundhog Day
a very unusual film but

46
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:04,979
a very unusual film but
 

47
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,830
a very unusual film but
makes you makes you think about how each

48
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
makes you makes you think about how each
 

49
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,090
makes you makes you think about how each
day

50
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,100
day
 

51
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,510
day
he knew what was coming in the end so he

52
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:14,520
he knew what was coming in the end so he
 

53
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,770
he knew what was coming in the end so he
could replan what he could do with it

54
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:18,780
could replan what he could do with it
 

55
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,990
could replan what he could do with it
and um

56
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,000
and um
 

57
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,450
and um
it's a little bit like

58
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:23,460
it's a little bit like
 

59
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,249
it's a little bit like
so far I've been talking about

60
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:25,259
so far I've been talking about
 

61
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,390
so far I've been talking about
out-of-body experiences and warm air

62
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:29,400
out-of-body experiences and warm air
 

63
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,950
out-of-body experiences and warm air
becoming

64
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
becoming
 

65
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,390
becoming
part of part of you and being in the

66
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:35,400
part of part of you and being in the
 

67
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,950
part of part of you and being in the
theater and

68
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
theater and
 

69
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,749
theater and
sensing them

70
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:38,759
sensing them
 

71
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,749
sensing them
no one else was there and I was immersed

72
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
no one else was there and I was immersed
 

73
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,090
no one else was there and I was immersed
in a warmth for love that

74
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:47,100

 

75
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,850

you just don't feel it in this normal

76
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:49,860
you just don't feel it in this normal
 

77
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,889
you just don't feel it in this normal
world you don't feel it in this um

78
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:54,899

 

79
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,410

human environment

80
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:57,420
human environment
 

81
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,730
human environment
perhaps it gets tangled up with all the

82
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:01,740
perhaps it gets tangled up with all the
 

83
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,929
perhaps it gets tangled up with all the
the problems that people as humans have

84
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:05,939
the problems that people as humans have
 

85

anybody who discovers nature to adapt

86
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
anybody who discovers nature to adapt
 

87
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,030
anybody who discovers nature to adapt
where nature

88
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,040
where nature
 

89
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,729
where nature
is so important because they realize

90
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:16,739
is so important because they realize
 

91
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,369
is so important because they realize
that they are part of nature

92
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:19,379
that they are part of nature
 

93
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,010
that they are part of nature
no more no less

no more no less
 

95
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,990
no more no less
and the less you disturb nature

96
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,000
and the less you disturb nature
 

97
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,589
and the less you disturb nature
the more it will benefit you

98
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:30,599

if you if you're kind
 

101
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,530
if you if you're kind
to the planet then I believe the planet

102
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:36,540

I think I felt at the time as if I

238
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:54,840
I think I felt at the time as if I
 

239
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,670

it was a love greater than what a human

248
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:13,500
it was a love greater than what a human
 

249
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,290
it was a love greater than what a human
being can give

250
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:15,300
being can give
 

251
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,890
