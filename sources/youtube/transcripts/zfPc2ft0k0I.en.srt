grappling um in its like full version
 

53
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,070
grappling um in its like full version
than it is in um more of what I consider

54
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,080
than it is in um more of what I consider
 

55
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,710
than it is in um more of what I consider
the iido context although it comes up in

56
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
the iido context although it comes up in
 

57
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,429
the iido context although it comes up in
iido a fair amount um but you kind of

58
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:14,439
iido a fair amount um but you kind of
 

59
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,270
iido a fair amount um but you kind of
have to understand what it is and and

60
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:16,280
have to understand what it is and and
 

61
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,630
have to understand what it is and and
basically it's just getting the arms to

62
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
basically it's just getting the arms to
 

63
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,069
basically it's just getting the arms to
cross and then what you're going to do

64
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:20,079
cross and then what you're going to do
 

65
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,749
cross and then what you're going to do
with the arms from the cross position so

66
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:22,759
with the arms from the cross position so
 

67
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,149
with the arms from the cross position so
it seems silly you know like I'm going

68
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
it seems silly you know like I'm going
 

69
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,469
it seems silly you know like I'm going
to grab this guy or something and then

70
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:25,479
to grab this guy or something and then
 

71
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:26,390
to grab this guy or something and then
I'm going to

72
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
I'm going to
 

73
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,469
I'm going to
go and I'm going to cross his arms that

74
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
go and I'm going to cross his arms that
 

75
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,390
go and I'm going to cross his arms that
seems silly but it happens Happ s really

76
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
seems silly but it happens Happ s really
 

77
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,030
seems silly but it happens Happ s really
naturally in lots and lots of ways right

78
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,040
naturally in lots and lots of ways right
 

79
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,550
naturally in lots and lots of ways right
so for example let's say I had a weapon

80
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
so for example let's say I had a weapon
 

81
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,590
so for example let's say I had a weapon
here right and Josh grabbed me okay uh

82
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:36,600
here right and Josh grabbed me okay uh
 

83
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,590
here right and Josh grabbed me okay uh
grab the other way and it'll just be

84
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
grab the other way and it'll just be
 

85
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,350
grab the other way and it'll just be
easier for the camera okay so he grabs

86
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
easier for the camera okay so he grabs
 

87
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,590
easier for the camera okay so he grabs
me here um and I want to clear the

88
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
me here um and I want to clear the
 

89
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,109
me here um and I want to clear the
weapon okay now I can clear the weapon

90
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
weapon okay now I can clear the weapon
 

91
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,350
weapon okay now I can clear the weapon
but he's just going to immediately reach

92
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,360
but he's just going to immediately reach
 

93
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,429
but he's just going to immediately reach
and grab and you're going to kind of

94
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
and grab and you're going to kind of
 

95
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,910
and grab and you're going to kind of
learn this in arm grappling happens a

96
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:46,920
learn this in arm grappling happens a
 

97
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,190
learn this in arm grappling happens a
lot where you make an escape and then

98
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,200
lot where you make an escape and then
 

99
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,429
lot where you make an escape and then
they immediately grab you again right

100
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
they immediately grab you again right
 

101
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,670
they immediately grab you again right
and this your Escape was no good so I

102
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
and this your Escape was no good so I
 

103
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,190
and this your Escape was no good so I
want to do something so he can't

104
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
want to do something so he can't
 

105
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,910
want to do something so he can't
immediately grab with this hand again

106
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:54,920
immediately grab with this hand again
 

107
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,310
immediately grab with this hand again
right now I've isolated this hand so

108
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320
right now I've isolated this hand so
 

109
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,590
right now I've isolated this hand so
what's he going to do he's going to grab

110
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
what's he going to do he's going to grab
 

111
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,149
what's he going to do he's going to grab
me with the other hand what did Josh

113
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,190
me with the other hand what did Josh
just do to him himself well he set

114
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
just do to him himself well he set
 

115
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,469
just do to him himself well he set
himself up for juji nag is what he did

himself up for juji nag is what he did
 

117
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,709
himself up for juji nag is what he did
right so that happens constantly uh if

118
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
right so that happens constantly uh if
 

119
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,589
right so that happens constantly uh if
you have an armed grappling practice you

120
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:08,599
you have an armed grappling practice you
 

121
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,910
you have an armed grappling practice you
will constantly see one person getting

122
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:10,920
will constantly see one person getting
 

123
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,910
will constantly see one person getting
free and either going to cut the other

124
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:12,920
free and either going to cut the other
 

125
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,070
free and either going to cut the other
person or the other person just

126
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
person or the other person just
 

127
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,990
person or the other person just
instinctively reaching with that hand

128
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
instinctively reaching with that hand
 

129
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,630
instinctively reaching with that hand
and now we're going to bind one against

130
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:17,640
and now we're going to bind one against
 

131
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,229
and now we're going to bind one against
the other and that's that's naturally

132
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:19,239
the other and that's that's naturally
 

133
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,790
the other and that's that's naturally
going to happen over and over and over

134
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
going to happen over and over and over
 

135
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,910
going to happen over and over and over
in our iido context usually the solution

136
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:22,920
in our iido context usually the solution
 

137
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,030
in our iido context usually the solution
is going to be simple it's going to be

138
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,040
is going to be simple it's going to be
 

139
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,830
is going to be simple it's going to be
about that and then bing bang bang bang

140
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
about that and then bing bang bang bang
 

141
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,869
about that and then bing bang bang bang
bang I'm going to go back to work

142
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
bang I'm going to go back to work
 

143
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,710
bang I'm going to go back to work
because it's a lot more work and time to

144
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
because it's a lot more work and time to
 

145
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,869
because it's a lot more work and time to
deal with this guy stand in up in that

the time we see them as uh just clearing
 

153
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,030
the time we see them as uh just clearing
techniques right okay so that's going to

154
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
techniques right okay so that's going to
 

155
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,350
techniques right okay so that's going to
happen anytime we're across the body I

because I'm driving this one down and

196
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
because I'm driving this one down and
 

197
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,509
because I'm driving this one down and
turning it in like this and I'm driving

198
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:22,519
turning it in like this and I'm driving
 

199
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,110
turning it in like this and I'm driving
this one up and turning it like this so

200
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
this one up and turning it like this so

they're not just being twisted around

202
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:26,760
they're not just being twisted around
 

203
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,470

each other they're being forced together
 

205
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,949
each other they're being forced together
so the insides of those elbows are

206
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:29,959
so the insides of those elbows are
 

207
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,630
so the insides of those elbows are
touching and the more you do that the

208
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:31,640
touching and the more you do that the
 

209
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,390
touching and the more you do that the
more compression he'll get now so what

210
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,400
more compression he'll get now so what
 

211
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,750
more compression he'll get now so what
that will do is it will make him want to
