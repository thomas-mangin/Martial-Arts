it and if you're just here

198
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,100
it and if you're just here
 

199
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,960
it and if you're just here
your body is being pressurized from the

goes boom okay I'm bracing for impact
 

217
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,290
goes boom okay I'm bracing for impact
I have the pressure I have the skeletal

218
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:45,300
I have the pressure I have the skeletal
 

219
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,950
I have the pressure I have the skeletal
alignment but psychologically you have
