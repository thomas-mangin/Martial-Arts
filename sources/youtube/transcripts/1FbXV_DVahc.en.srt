00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:47,809
this great brain it can often hinder us
 

951
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:50,749
this great brain it can often hinder us
but we have other faculties other

years for some of you you can't do it
 

967
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:30,050
years for some of you you can't do it
anymore just get off the line just take

968
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:30,060
anymore just get off the line just take
 

969
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:35,390
anymore just get off the line just take
a step who cares we're in that step you

970
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:35,400
a step who cares we're in that step you
 

971
