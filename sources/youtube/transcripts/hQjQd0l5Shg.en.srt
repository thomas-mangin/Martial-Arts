shutting them down we play a kind of

240
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:41,430
shutting them down we play a kind of
 

241
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,960
shutting them down we play a kind of
games with the beginner so okay you

242
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:44,970
games with the beginner so okay you
 

243
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,730
games with the beginner so okay you
don't have it here's where you stopped

244

don't have it here's where you stopped
 

245
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,700
don't have it here's where you stopped
me and then I kind of get myself into

246
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:49,710
me and then I kind of get myself into
 

247
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,310
me and then I kind of get myself into
position from them because that's the

248
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:52,320
position from them because that's the
 

249
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,720
position from them because that's the
prescribed to kami

250
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:53,730
prescribed to kami
 

251
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,970

you see that they didn't get me there

252
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:55,980
you see that they didn't get me there
 

253
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,290
you see that they didn't get me there
I'll get myself didn't they can do do

254
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:00,300
I'll get myself didn't they can do do
 

255

I'll get myself didn't they can do do
you understand that that works because

256
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,110
you understand that that works because
 

257
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,920
you understand that that works because
they get to see more of the technique

258
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:06,930
they get to see more of the technique
 

259
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,780
they get to see more of the technique
than if you just shut them down where

260
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:08,790
than if you just shut them down where
 

261
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,930
than if you just shut them down where
you just pull out you get it it comes

262
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:11,940
you just pull out you get it it comes
 

263
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,090
you just pull out you get it it comes
with stages though so they're not

with stages though so they're not
 

265
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,730
with stages though so they're not
actually doing it but they're getting a

little piece do you see and they need
 

271
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,190
little piece do you see and they need
the exposure for it but understand the

272
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,200
the exposure for it but understand the
 

273
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,250
the exposure for it but understand the
larger amount

274
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:31,260
larger amount

lifted the same weight you're not
 

485
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:39,439
lifted the same weight you're not
improving or you get knows her and your

486
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:39,449
improving or you get knows her and your
 

487
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:43,670

amounts going down yeah you're getting

488
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
amounts going down yeah you're getting
 

489
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,090
amounts going down yeah you're getting
worse it's hard to deny that you just

490
