took that and
 

71
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,189
took that and

um it that that shape is is very very
 

81
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,790
um it that that shape is is very very
ancient and very very strange because

like you know we have to use books and

90
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:47,159
like you know we have to use books and
 

91
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,909
like you know we have to use books and
stuff people know what the heart look

92
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:48,919
stuff people know what the heart look
 

93
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,110
stuff people know what the heart look
like that doesn't look like the heart

94
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,120
like that doesn't look like the heart
 

95
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,110
like that doesn't look like the heart
okay um so let's just open the door that

96
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,120
okay um so let's just open the door that
 

97
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,469
okay um so let's just open the door that
it's it's it may reference

98
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
it's it's it may reference
 

99
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,469
it's it's it may reference
cocol like the heart mind right but it's

00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
cocol like the heart mind right but it's
 

101
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,189
cocol like the heart mind right but it's
not a literal drawing of it okay and uh

102
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:10,199
not a literal drawing of it okay and uh
 

103
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,189
not a literal drawing of it okay and uh
when we look at that shape in terms of

104
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:12,199
when we look at that shape in terms of
 

105
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,710
when we look at that shape in terms of
our iido

106
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:13,720
our iido
 

107
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,990
our iido
tabaki you you have your inward spiral

108
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,000
tabaki you you have your inward spiral
 

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,629
tabaki you you have your inward spiral
you see and you reverse it and you have

110
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:19,639
you see and you reverse it and you have
 

111
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,790
you see and you reverse it and you have
the the outer spiral and you if you

112
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
the the outer spiral and you if you
 

113
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,469
the the outer spiral and you if you
follow it to the other end there's your

114
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
follow it to the other end there's your
 

115
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,629
follow it to the other end there's your
outward spiral okay and so these we know

116
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
outward spiral okay and so these we know
 

117
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,029
outward spiral okay and so these we know
that this these hand shapes here um

118
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
that this these hand shapes here um
 

119
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,870
that this these hand shapes here um
represent a kind of uh Duality that when

120
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:37,880
represent a kind of uh Duality that when
 

121
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,269
represent a kind of uh Duality that when
combined make up the universe okay so

122
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
combined make up the universe okay so
 

123
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,790
combined make up the universe okay so
you have your uh in in Dost circles you

124
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
you have your uh in in Dost circles you
 

125
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,110
you have your uh in in Dost circles you
have your your fire and your water and

126
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
have your your fire and your water and
 

127
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,350
have your your fire and your water and
fire and water are like representative

128
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
fire and water are like representative
 

129
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,110
fire and water are like representative
of Yin and yangong okay so now you're

130
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
of Yin and yangong okay so now you're
 

131
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,310
of Yin and yangong okay so now you're
putting them

132
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
putting them
 

133
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,310
putting them
together and we know also that our lower

134
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
together and we know also that our lower
 

135
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,430
together and we know also that our lower
tonen what we're trying to do is undo

136
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
tonen what we're trying to do is undo
 

137
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,829
tonen what we're trying to do is undo
move or reverse the doing of Yin and

138
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
move or reverse the doing of Yin and
 

139
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,790
move or reverse the doing of Yin and
yangong and to return to the Dow okay um

140
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:07,800
yangong and to return to the Dow okay um
 

141
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,150
yangong and to return to the Dow okay um
and so we have our fire or our yangong

142
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
and so we have our fire or our yangong
 

143
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,550
and so we have our fire or our yangong
and we have our uh water or our Yin

144
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:15,560
and we have our uh water or our Yin
 

145
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,710
and we have our uh water or our Yin
right but you know Earth is Yin too so

146
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
right but you know Earth is Yin too so
 

147
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,630
right but you know Earth is Yin too so
you have all these kind of modalities

148
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
you have all these kind of modalities
 

149
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,350
you have all these kind of modalities
where you're going to combine Yin and

150
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
where you're going to combine Yin and
 

151
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,670
where you're going to combine Yin and
yangong uh fire water Heaven and Earth

152
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:26,680
yangong uh fire water Heaven and Earth
 

153
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,190
yangong uh fire water Heaven and Earth
Etc you're going to combine these

154
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,200
Etc you're going to combine these
 

155
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,710
Etc you're going to combine these
dualities and and you're going to

156
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
dualities and and you're going to
 

157
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,430
dualities and and you're going to
reverse their doing to get back to the

158
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
reverse their doing to get back to the
 

159
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,069
reverse their doing to get back to the
doubt okay and we say in my discourse

160
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:37,079
doubt okay and we say in my discourse
 

161
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,710
doubt okay and we say in my discourse
that we're going to spiral rotate the

162
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:39,720
that we're going to spiral rotate the
 

163
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,350
that we're going to spiral rotate the
these two aspects when you spiral rotate

164
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:42,360
these two aspects when you spiral rotate
 

165
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,670
these two aspects when you spiral rotate
them they can't be in the XY dichotomy

166
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:46,680
them they can't be in the XY dichotomy
 

167
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,269
them they can't be in the XY dichotomy
relationship dichotomous relationship

168
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
relationship dichotomous relationship
 

169
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,470
relationship dichotomous relationship
and the universe reorders itself it's

170
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:51,480
and the universe reorders itself it's
 

171
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,030
and the universe reorders itself it's
just what happens okay so if we look for

172
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
just what happens okay so if we look for
 

173
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,470
just what happens okay so if we look for

um where you're working by yourself we
 

177
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,630
um where you're working by yourself we
know that I'm going to release

178
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
know that I'm going to release
 

179

body I have to let go of the
 

183
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,310
body I have to let go of the
tension and we have uh movements where

184
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,320
tension and we have uh movements where
 

185
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,350
tension and we have uh movements where
we're

186
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:14,360
we're
 

187
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,630
we're
dropping dropping right so we come down

188
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:17,640
dropping dropping right so we come down
 

189
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,350
dropping dropping right so we come down
dropping the chi coming around we have

what they're doing you just did them uh

196
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:28,360
what they're doing you just did them uh
 

197
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,710
what they're doing you just did them uh
but you can see that you're going to

198
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:29,720
but you can see that you're going to
 

199
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,389
but you can see that you're going to
make that heart shape do you see you're

200
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:31,399
make that heart shape do you see you're
 

201
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,630
make that heart shape do you see you're
going to make that heart shape with your

202
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:33,640
going to make that heart shape with your
 

203
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,829
going to make that heart shape with your
hand and that heart shape is in here uh

204
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:36,839
hand and that heart shape is in here uh
 

205
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,550
hand and that heart shape is in here uh
we just have to make sure we're doing it

206
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
we just have to make sure we're doing it
 

207
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,629
we just have to make sure we're doing it
because the heart shape through laong is

208
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:41,639
because the heart shape through laong is
 

209
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,710
because the heart shape through laong is
going to spir rotate the Heaven and

210
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
going to spir rotate the Heaven and
 

211
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,269
going to spir rotate the Heaven and
Earth aspects that are in my uh lower

212
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
Earth aspects that are in my uh lower
 

213
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,310
Earth aspects that are in my uh lower
ton den and that's going to drop my mind

214
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:51,320
ton den and that's going to drop my mind
 

215
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,829
ton den and that's going to drop my mind
that's going to bring a sensation to the

216
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:52,839
that's going to bring a sensation to the
 

217
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:55,509
that's going to bring a sensation to the
ego tripartite mind and in that way it

218
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
ego tripartite mind and in that way it
 

219
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,190
ego tripartite mind and in that way it
is a moving meditation as long as I

220
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:58,200
is a moving meditation as long as I
 

221
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,310
is a moving meditation as long as I
understand meditation energy ically or

222
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
understand meditation energy ically or
 

223
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,389
understand meditation energy ically or
it is a moving prayer as long as I

224
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:03,399
it is a moving prayer as long as I
 

225
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,230
it is a moving prayer as long as I
understand prayer as a no self practice

226
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
understand prayer as a no self practice
 

227
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,590
understand prayer as a no self practice
okay so as you're doing this

228
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:08,600
okay so as you're doing this
 

229
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,230
okay so as you're doing this
technique you are working th those

230
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
technique you are working th those
 

231
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,269
technique you are working th those
patterns to spiral rotate the lower

232
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
patterns to spiral rotate the lower
 

233
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,150
patterns to spiral rotate the lower
tanden through laong okay so that is way

234
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,160
tanden through laong okay so that is way
 

235
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,990
tanden through laong okay so that is way
more important than you just throw the

236
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,000
more important than you just throw the
 

237
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,990
more important than you just throw the
guy okay so as you as you watch me I

238
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,000
guy okay so as you as you watch me I
 

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,110
guy okay so as you as you watch me I
have gon which is the outward spiral

240
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,120
have gon which is the outward spiral
 

241
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,230
have gon which is the outward spiral
it's the beginning of the out spiral but

242
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
it's the beginning of the out spiral but
 

243
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,829
it's the beginning of the out spiral but
because I'm on the inside it is

244
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:32,839
because I'm on the inside it is
 

245
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,629
because I'm on the inside it is
functioning like an inward spiral and

246
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:35,639
functioning like an inward spiral and
 

247
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,629
functioning like an inward spiral and
that's part of the undoing of the

248
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:37,639
that's part of the undoing of the
 

249
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,590
that's part of the undoing of the
dichotomous relationship okay that

250
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
dichotomous relationship okay that
 

251
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,230
dichotomous relationship okay that
you're trying to do so I'm I'm inversing

252
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:43,240
you're trying to do so I'm I'm inversing
 

253
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,350
you're trying to do so I'm I'm inversing
things do you see that so I come

254
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:46,360
things do you see that so I come
 

255
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,829
things do you see that so I come
around one and

256
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:48,839
around one and
 

257
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,710
around one and
yes get

258
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
yes get
 

259
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,590
yes get
Cheon but as I go under it it's now

260
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
Cheon but as I go under it it's now
 

261
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,829
Cheon but as I go under it it's now
jodon you see so I established jodon

262
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:56,839
jodon you see so I established jodon
 

263
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,670
jodon you see so I established jodon
without changing anything and and yes

264
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:00,680
without changing anything and and yes
 

265
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,990
without changing anything and and yes
his hand is going up but because I'm

266
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,000
his hand is going up but because I'm
 

267
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,670
his hand is going up but because I'm
rotating it's he's going backwards on

268
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:06,680
rotating it's he's going backwards on
 

269
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,629
rotating it's he's going backwards on
the hand and so I'm inversing and

270
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
the hand and so I'm inversing and
 

271
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,629
the hand and so I'm inversing and
reversing to undo these dichotomies okay

272
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
reversing to undo these dichotomies okay
 

273
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,430
reversing to undo these dichotomies okay
so outward spiral acting like inward

274
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
so outward spiral acting like inward
 

275
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,310
so outward spiral acting like inward
spiral a pushing of Chon you see is

276
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:21,320
spiral a pushing of Chon you see is
 

277
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,470
spiral a pushing of Chon you see is
bringing him in and Jon which is the up

278
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:25,480
bringing him in and Jon which is the up
 

279
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,550
bringing him in and Jon which is the up
is bringing him out

280
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:29,560

 

281
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,870

and all that's moving in me so I'm I'm

282
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:31,880
and all that's moving in me so I'm I'm
 

283
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,990
and all that's moving in me so I'm I'm
really just doing this I'm just happen

284
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
really just doing this I'm just happen
 

285
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:43,629
really just doing this I'm just happen
to be turning inside of

286
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:43,639

 

287
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,189

it then after the upward you turn back

288
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:47,199
it then after the upward you turn back
 

289
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,189
it then after the upward you turn back
to get down and the outward

290
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:50,199
to get down and the outward
 

291
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:56,189
to get down and the outward
spiral the outward spiral Che on Jo

292
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:56,199
spiral the outward spiral Che on Jo
 

293
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:06,629
spiral the outward spiral Che on Jo
on get on

294
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639

 

295
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,150

I'm feeling it in here and I'm feeling

296
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,160
I'm feeling it in here and I'm feeling
 

297
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:58,230
I'm feeling it in here and I'm feeling
it what it's doing to my mind

298
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240

 

299
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,509

hey

300
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:02,519

 

301
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,590

can you see it

302
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600

 

303
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,949

now

304
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:09,959

 

305
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,150

okay okay so part of the energetics and

306
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,160
okay okay so part of the energetics and
 

307
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,870
okay okay so part of the energetics and
because of the concentric relationship

308
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:14,880
because of the concentric relationship
 

309
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,670
because of the concentric relationship
between the energetic field and the

310
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
between the energetic field and the
 

311
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,189
between the energetic field and the
Marshall field is that there's no

312
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
Marshall field is that there's no
 

313
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,150
Marshall field is that there's no
tension in my body there's absolutely no

314
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160
tension in my body there's absolutely no
 

315
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,829
tension in my body there's absolutely no
tension in my body which you can feel so

316
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:24,839
tension in my body which you can feel so
 

317
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,550
tension in my body which you can feel so
the technique feels light as until

318
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
the technique feels light as until
 

319
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,430
the technique feels light as until
the throwing part

320
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:32,440

 

321
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:40,150

um it's very tempting to start

322
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160

 

323
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,230

tensing you see like no that's not right

324
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:43,240
tensing you see like no that's not right
 

325
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,150
tensing you see like no that's not right
cuz you won't get your tonden feel you

326
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
cuz you won't get your tonden feel you
 

327
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,150
cuz you won't get your tonden feel you
won't feel that

328
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
won't feel that
 

329
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,910
won't feel that
okay so the technique is very light it's

330
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
okay so the technique is very light it's
 

331
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,829
okay so the technique is very light it's
very light there there's nothing there

332
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:54,839
very light there there's nothing there
 

333
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,829
very light there there's nothing there
there's nothing right but there's enough

334
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839
there's nothing right but there's enough
 

335
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,350
there's nothing right but there's enough
to adhere right and there's enough like

336
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:00,360
to adhere right and there's enough like

okay but there's power in there you have

422
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
okay but there's power in there you have
 

423
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,270
okay but there's power in there you have

from the internalization of the conflict

430
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:48,440
from the internalization of the conflict
 

431
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,430
from the internalization of the conflict
this is why there's no true non-c

432
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
this is why there's no true non-c
 

433
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,230
this is why there's no true non-c
contestation externally so for example

434
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:55,240
contestation externally so for example
 

435
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,830
contestation externally so for example
if he's pushing

436
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:56,840
if he's pushing
 

437
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,029

I got out of the
 

441
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,470
I got out of the
way but if you pay attention there's

442
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
way but if you pay attention there's
 

443
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,789
way but if you pay attention there's
there's a tension in my body and then I

444
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
there's a tension in my body and then I
 

445
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,590
there's a tension in my body and then I
move with

446
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600

 

447
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,029

tension but your internal there's no

448
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
tension but your internal there's no
 

449
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,990
tension but your internal there's no
tension we're not we're not going to

450
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,000
tension we're not we're not going to
 

451
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,070
tension we're not we're not going to
move we're not going to move at no point

452
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,080

can he push into me throughout any of

454
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
can he push into me throughout any of
 

455
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,270
can he push into me throughout any of
the cycle he can't push into me but

456
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280
the cycle he can't push into me but
 

457
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,630
the cycle he can't push into me but
there's no tension because it's being

458
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:25,640
there's no tension because it's being
 

459
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,909
there's no tension because it's being
internalized okay true non-c

460
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,919
internalized okay true non-c
 

461
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,669
internalized okay true non-c
contestation can only happen internally

462
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:30,679
contestation can only happen internally
 

463
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:33,310
contestation can only happen internally
and that's what is allowing me to stay

464
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:33,320
and that's what is allowing me to stay
 

465
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,190
and that's what is allowing me to stay
relaxed because I don't ever push on

466
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,200
relaxed because I don't ever push on
 

467
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,510
relaxed because I don't ever push on
what's pushing on me and so I I don't

00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:38,520
what's pushing on me and so I I don't
 

469
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,029
what's pushing on me and so I I don't
need that I just stay relaxed his young

470
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:42,039
need that I just stay relaxed his young
 

471
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,230
need that I just stay relaxed his young
