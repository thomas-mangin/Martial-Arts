at that angle
 

151
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,190
at that angle
that's the ground

152
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
that's the ground

so even though my arm is your boom this

154
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
so even though my arm is your boom this

with the arm movement well if i don't

162
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
with the arm movement well if i don't
 

163
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,790
with the arm movement well if i don't
have to do the arm movement then cut the
