00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:04,380
then the second thing is this is not a
dead arm go ahead and roll come back

324
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:04,390
dead arm go ahead and roll come back
 

325
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,930
dead arm go ahead and roll come back
this is a live arm so it's not shoving

326
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:07,940
this is a live arm so it's not shoving
 

327
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,790
this is a live arm so it's not shoving
him down but you can't pick it up do you

328
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
him down but you can't pick it up do you
 

329
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,840
him down but you can't pick it up do you
see that so some of you got our arm that

330
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:16,850
see that so some of you got our arm that
 

331
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,270
see that so some of you got our arm that
looks like to extend it but it doesn't

332
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:19,280
looks like to extend it but it doesn't
 

333
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,850
looks like to extend it but it doesn't
have any energy in it and so it doesn't

334
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:21,860
have any energy in it and so it doesn't
 

335
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,790
have any energy in it and so it doesn't
work at the apex point so if these two

336
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
work at the apex point so if these two
 

337
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,740
work at the apex point so if these two
things right stay up with it stay up

338
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:26,750
things right stay up with it stay up
 

339
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,520
things right stay up with it stay up
with it everybody it's an alive arm okay

340
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:29,530
with it everybody it's an alive arm okay
 

341
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,100
with it everybody it's an alive arm okay
let's go

342
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,110
let's go
 

343
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,530
let's go
says strike goes right to it in his

344
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:35,540
says strike goes right to it in his
 

345
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:43,569
says strike goes right to it in his
folly and I just stay up with it it's

346
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:43,579
folly and I just stay up with it it's
 

347
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:46,360
folly and I just stay up with it it's
folly leaving it around

348
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,370
folly leaving it around
 

349
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,540
folly leaving it around
so let's stop at that one point so let's

350
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:49,550
so let's stop at that one point so let's
 

351
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,999
so let's stop at that one point so let's
get to where we were here right and I'm

352
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,009
get to where we were here right and I'm
 

353
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:54,639
get to where we were here right and I'm
here right there's a little bit more

354
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:54,649
here right there's a little bit more
 

355
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:58,090
here right there's a little bit more
like this and I have that pin on his

356
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:58,100
like this and I have that pin on his
 

357
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,369
like this and I have that pin on his
shoulder if you see that right okay I

358
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:00,379
shoulder if you see that right okay I
 

359
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:02,769
shoulder if you see that right okay I
can't go any more but that's why it's a

360
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:02,779
can't go any more but that's why it's a
 

361
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:05,350
can't go any more but that's why it's a
check all right if I could go like this

362
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
check all right if I could go like this
 

363
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,829
check all right if I could go like this
he could come to me you see

364
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
he could come to me you see
 

365
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,429
he could come to me you see
so you'll hit another contention point

366
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:12,439
so you'll hit another contention point
 

367
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:16,269
so you'll hit another contention point
energy going against energy so that's

368
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:16,279
energy going against energy so that's
 

369
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:23,679
energy going against energy so that's
what I take around you think so I just

370
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:23,689
what I take around you think so I just
 

371
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:26,949
what I take around you think so I just
stay up with that small stay up with it

372
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
stay up with that small stay up with it
 

373
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,199
stay up with that small stay up with it
and it's going to fall and I just keep

374
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:29,209
and it's going to fall and I just keep
 

375
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:39,780
and it's going to fall and I just keep
connection keeping connection boom boom

376
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:39,790

393
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,490
where right you can kick that's going to
tell you I'm at the energy contention

394
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:12,500
tell you I'm at the energy contention
 

395
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:18,550
tell you I'm at the energy contention
point right if I go like this let me fix

396
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
point right if I go like this let me fix

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:30,380
that are giving the pattern but it's
 

403
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,670
that are giving the pattern but it's
still eluding you you your eat your work

on your grounding party you keep seeking

406
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:35,720
on your grounding party you keep seeking

I'm gonna have extreme absence of
 

411
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:49,390
I'm gonna have extreme absence of
bracing angles okay so I'm over here and

412
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:49,400
bracing angles okay so I'm over here and
 

413
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,170
bracing angles okay so I'm over here and
I would want you to push back at me like

414
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:52,180
I would want you to push back at me like
 

415
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,700
I would want you to push back at me like
it doesn't matter weird which put yes

416
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:57,710

 

417
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,540

bracing angles bracing angles just keep

418
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:01,550
bracing angles bracing angles just keep
 

419
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,180
bracing angles bracing angles just keep
walking

420
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,190
walking
 

421
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:12,600
walking
instead you're grounding grounding

422
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:12,610

 

423
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,430

raising this is how they get away from

424
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
raising this is how they get away from
 

425
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,910
raising this is how they get away from
you

426
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:20,920

 

427
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,919

he's still jacking up with me right and

428
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:23,929
he's still jacking up with me right and
 

429
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:25,749
he's still jacking up with me right and
you can see how I think you keep pushing

430
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:25,759
you can see how I think you keep pushing
 

431
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:37,439
you can see how I think you keep pushing
on it you can see that I can keep going

432
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:37,449

 

433
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:40,150

so I just do that I'm doing that into

434
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
so I just do that I'm doing that into
 

435
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,699
so I just do that I'm doing that into
the technique
