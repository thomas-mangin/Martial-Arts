we were making good alignments you want

72
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:19,909
we were making good alignments you want
 

73
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:21,640
we were making good alignments you want
to make the strongest alignment you can

74
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:21,650
to make the strongest alignment you can
 

75
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,320
to make the strongest alignment you can
with your body in the ground so right

now in this natural position Sascha's

78
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,310
now in this natural position Sascha's
 

79
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,070
now in this natural position Sascha's
and a pretty strong alignment in fact if

80
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,080
and a pretty strong alignment in fact if
 

81
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,109
and a pretty strong alignment in fact if
Josh were to come up behind her and just

82
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
Josh were to come up behind her and just
 

83
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,520
Josh were to come up behind her and just
jump up in the air and land behind her

84
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:30,530
jump up in the air and land behind her
 

85
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,620
jump up in the air and land behind her
like this she can pretty easily one of

86
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:32,630
like this she can pretty easily one of
 

87
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,300
like this she can pretty easily one of
them right there like that right so and

88
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:34,310
them right there like that right so and
 

89
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,010
them right there like that right so and
all the tapping loss is less she's not

90
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,020
all the tapping loss is less she's not
 

91
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,149
all the tapping loss is less she's not
having to use a whole lot of muscles

92
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:37,159
having to use a whole lot of muscles
 

93
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,830
having to use a whole lot of muscles
other than take deeper core from coming

94
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:38,840
other than take deeper core from coming
 

95
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,330
other than take deeper core from coming
out of alignment all she's doing is

96
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:40,340
out of alignment all she's doing is
 

97
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,920
out of alignment all she's doing is
allowing that force to go through her

98
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:41,930
allowing that force to go through her
 

99
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,109
allowing that force to go through her
bones and into the ground another way

100
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:44,119
bones and into the ground another way
 

101
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:45,399
bones and into the ground another way
stop she can do that she can align up

102
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:45,409
stop she can do that she can align up
 

103
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:47,620
stop she can do that she can align up
horizontally to Josh so we had Josh come

104
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,630
horizontally to Josh so we had Josh come
 

105
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,590
horizontally to Josh so we had Josh come
over here Sasha reaches out into Josh

106
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:52,600

 

107
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,020

okay so if josh is reaching a grabbing

108
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,030
okay so if josh is reaching a grabbing
 

109
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,280
okay so if josh is reaching a grabbing
Sasha and reaching out into our net

110
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,290
Sasha and reaching out into our net
 

111
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,080
Sasha and reaching out into our net
sasha reaches back into Josh she can

112
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,090
sasha reaches back into Josh she can
 

113
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,480
sasha reaches back into Josh she can
make an alignment from our foot all the

114
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:01,490
make an alignment from our foot all the
 

115
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,679
make an alignment from our foot all the
way through the structure foreboding

116
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:02,689
way through the structure foreboding
 

117
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,450
way through the structure foreboding
into Josh giving Josh a lot of

118
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:04,460
into Josh giving Josh a lot of
 

119
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,800
into Josh giving Josh a lot of
difficulty now josh is bigger and

120
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:05,810
difficulty now josh is bigger and
 

121
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,780
difficulty now josh is bigger and
stronger than Sasha but Sasha's able you

122
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:07,790
stronger than Sasha but Sasha's able you
 

123
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,630
stronger than Sasha but Sasha's able you
can relax but the staple the whole

124
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:09,640
can relax but the staple the whole
 

125
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,309
can relax but the staple the whole
the back break and the reason is cuz she

126
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:11,319
the back break and the reason is cuz she
 

127
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,050
the back break and the reason is cuz she
has her bones aligned in a really nice

128
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,060
has her bones aligned in a really nice
 

129
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,880
has her bones aligned in a really nice
way another way we can show this his job

130
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:14,890
way another way we can show this his job
 

131
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,540
way another way we can show this his job
that Sasha could sit on the ground

132
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:17,550
that Sasha could sit on the ground
 

133
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,940
that Sasha could sit on the ground
and Josh could push on to her chest and

134
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:20,950
and Josh could push on to her chest and
 

135
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,650
and Josh could push on to her chest and
what's us gonna do again is she's gonna

136
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:22,660
what's us gonna do again is she's gonna
 

137
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,140
what's us gonna do again is she's gonna
make an alignment to align with Josh so

138
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,150
make an alignment to align with Josh so
 

139
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,180
make an alignment to align with Josh so
as he's pushing into her she's able to

140
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,190
as he's pushing into her she's able to
 

141
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,040
as he's pushing into her she's able to
keep him back by aligning her body and

142
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,050
keep him back by aligning her body and
 

143
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,300
keep him back by aligning her body and
the same thing that's famously

144
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,310
the same thing that's famously
 

145
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,590
the same thing that's famously
demonstrated by you is she was he can

146
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:31,600
demonstrated by you is she was he can
 

147
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,690
demonstrated by you is she was he can
push on her head and she lying again and

148
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:33,700
push on her head and she lying again and
 

149
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,920
push on her head and she lying again and
all she's doing here is making a

150
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:34,930
all she's doing here is making a
 

151
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,390
all she's doing here is making a
straight line through all the muscles

152
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
straight line through all the muscles
 

153
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,979
straight line through all the muscles
are bums in her body and straight

154
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:37,989
are bums in her body and straight
 

155
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:39,270
are bums in her body and straight
through the ground giving them a lot of

156
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,280
through the ground giving them a lot of
 

157
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,699
through the ground giving them a lot of
difficulty in holding or pushing her

158
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:41,709
difficulty in holding or pushing her
 

159
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,060
difficulty in holding or pushing her
over this is the alignment principle and

160
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,070
over this is the alignment principle and
 

161
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,290
over this is the alignment principle and
the first important thing we need to

162
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:46,300
the first important thing we need to
 

163
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,090
the first important thing we need to
