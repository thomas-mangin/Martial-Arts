00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,269

I just I want you to train slow to try

2
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:04,279
I just I want you to train slow to try
 

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,430
I just I want you to train slow to try
to feel that uh back outward kazushi

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:08,440
to feel that uh back outward kazushi
 

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,789
to feel that uh back outward kazushi
between iag and

6
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:10,799
between iag and
 

7
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:14,310
between iag and
K when you can get the two techniques

8
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
K when you can get the two techniques
 

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,590
K when you can get the two techniques
that use the same kazushi pattern that

10
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:16,600
that use the same kazushi pattern that
 

11
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,830
that use the same kazushi pattern that
to feel exactly the

12
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:18,840
to feel exactly the
 

13
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,230
to feel exactly the
same then you're on your way for all the

14
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:21,240
same then you're on your way for all the
 

15
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,150
same then you're on your way for all the
techniques feeling the same then you're

16
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,160
techniques feeling the same then you're
 

17
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,509
techniques feeling the same then you're
on your way to reconciling form

18
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:26,519
on your way to reconciling form
 

19
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,710
on your way to reconciling form
okay so we'll just keep the two variants

20
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:29,720
okay so we'll just keep the two variants
 

21
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:36,869
okay so we'll just keep the two variants
that we

22
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:36,879

 

23
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:46,549

have we do

24
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559

 

25
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:58,910

both

26
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920

 

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:28,830

one

28
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:28,840

 

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,710

there

30
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:35,720

 

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,789

teach okay the two parts I'd like you to

32
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
teach okay the two parts I'd like you to
 

33
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,030
teach okay the two parts I'd like you to
focus

34
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,040
focus
 

35
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:47,709
focus
on is

36
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:47,719

 

37
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,550

um this part that brings her legs

38
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
um this part that brings her legs
 

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,389
um this part that brings her legs
forward do you

40
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399

 

41
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:10,710

see it's again here

42
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720

 

43
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,930

here not here bring her forward in the

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:14,940
here not here bring her forward in the
 

45
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:27,830

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840

 

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,309

adhesion not here

48
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:33,319

 

49
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,309

forward there it

50
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
forward there it
 

51
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,630
forward there it
is

52
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
is
 

53
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,949
is
okay you feel that yes

54
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
okay you feel that yes
 

55
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,910
okay you feel that yes
okay here going slow I'd like you to

56
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
okay here going slow I'd like you to
 

57
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,550
okay here going slow I'd like you to
exaggerate that when you're going

58
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:49,560
exaggerate that when you're going
 

59
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,750
exaggerate that when you're going
quicker you don't always have to have

60
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
quicker you don't always have to have
 

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,030
quicker you don't always have to have
the legs going forward you'll always

62
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,040
the legs going forward you'll always
 

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,509
the legs going forward you'll always
have one if you're

64
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
have one if you're
 

65
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,750
have one if you're
standing but the

66
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:58,760
standing but the
 

67
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,309
standing but the
center has to be has to come forward

68
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:03,319
center has to be has to come forward
 

69
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:08,470
center has to be has to come forward
can't go stay there and then you from

70
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
can't go stay there and then you from
 

71
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,270
can't go stay there and then you from
there now go

72
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,280
there now go
 

73
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,470
there now go
backwards it has to go forward into the

74
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
backwards it has to go forward into the
 

75
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,589
backwards it has to go forward into the
kazushi that's enough do you see he

76
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
kazushi that's enough do you see he
 

77
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,750
kazushi that's enough do you see he
didn't I didn't exaggerate like with you

78
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:20,760
didn't I didn't exaggerate like with you
 

79
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:28,670
didn't I didn't exaggerate like with you
but it happened in terms of his Center

80
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:28,680

 

81
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,350

gravity

82
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:32,360

 

83
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,350

you see how the center comes

84
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
you see how the center comes
 

85
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,190
you see how the center comes
from not here and from where it is his

86
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,200
from not here and from where it is his
 

87
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,990
from not here and from where it is his
center of gravity you move it backwards

88
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,000
center of gravity you move it backwards
 

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,030
center of gravity you move it backwards
that's not

90
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040

 

91
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,350

it so another

92
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:52,360
it so another
 

93
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,869
it so another
commonality is you you have your inward

94
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
commonality is you you have your inward
 

95
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,509
commonality is you you have your inward
spiral and if you were to reverse so

96
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
spiral and if you were to reverse so
 

97
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,589
spiral and if you were to reverse so
that SD me

98
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:02,599

 

99
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,750

nuget you

100
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:04,760
nuget you
 

101
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,390
nuget you
see you guys

102
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:07,400
see you guys
 

103
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,470
see you guys
see so you have your inward spiral and

104
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
see so you have your inward spiral and
 

105
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,589
see so you have your inward spiral and
if you were to reverse it and you keep

106
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
if you were to reverse it and you keep
 

107
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,069
if you were to reverse it and you keep
extending it you have your C hole you

108
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:17,079
extending it you have your C hole you
 

109
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,629
extending it you have your C hole you
have your outward spiral so the outward

110
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
have your outward spiral so the outward
 

111
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,430
have your outward spiral so the outward
spiral is just the reverse or the

112
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:20,440
spiral is just the reverse or the
 

113
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,189
spiral is just the reverse or the
inverse of the inward spiral it's the

114
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:22,199
inverse of the inward spiral it's the
 

115
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,070
inverse of the inward spiral it's the
same

116
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,080
same
 

117
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,510
same
technique so the spiral pattern is

118
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
technique so the spiral pattern is
 

119
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,390
technique so the spiral pattern is
exactly the same just one's going

120
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:27,400
exactly the same just one's going
 

121
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,230
exactly the same just one's going
forward one's going rearward or one's

122
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
forward one's going rearward or one's
 

123
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,629
forward one's going rearward or one's
winding in one's winding

124
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
winding in one's winding
 

125
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,110
winding in one's winding
out the other one is where your power is

126
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,120
out the other one is where your power is
 

127
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,950
out the other one is where your power is
so you it's not here where he's gripping

128
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
so you it's not here where he's gripping
 

129
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,150
so you it's not here where he's gripping
it it's in my elbow and in my and my

151
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,029
quad so I put this now in what I'm
trying to do but he's going

152
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:26,039

 

153
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,749

00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:30,520
forward in the qu is going to move you
 

157
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:38,749
forward in the qu is going to move you
see qu and the elbows connected to

159
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,029

it he's got to go

forward and then the qua St the cla's
 

163
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:58,469
forward and then the qua St the cla's
going to move R and my elbow does the

00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
he has to go
 

169
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:12,830
he has to go
forward P moves elbow

170
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:12,840
