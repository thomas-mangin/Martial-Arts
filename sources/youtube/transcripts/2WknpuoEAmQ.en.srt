king on and therefore that you could do

346
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
king on and therefore that you could do
 

347
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,949
king on and therefore that you could do
it

348
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
it
 

349
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,670
it
but you you're not okay it's just so

350
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
but you you're not okay it's just so
 

351
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,590
but you you're not okay it's just so
confined in environment

352
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
confined in environment
 

353
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,230
confined in environment
that all the adaptability that would be

354
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
that all the adaptability that would be
 

355
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,350
that all the adaptability that would be
required to

356
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
required to
 

357
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,990
required to
transfer that technique into a live

358
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
transfer that technique into a live
 

359
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,870
transfer that technique into a live
environment

360
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
environment
 

361
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,190
environment
you don't have it so i'll show you what

362
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
you don't have it so i'll show you what
 

363
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,550
you don't have it so i'll show you what
we're having here so

364
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
we're having here so
 

365
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,470
we're having here so
we're let's say i'm going to do eq all

366
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
we're let's say i'm going to do eq all
 

367
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,350
we're let's say i'm going to do eq all
right ikea does not work like with his

368
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
right ikea does not work like with his
 

369
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,230
right ikea does not work like with his
armpit

370
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
armpit
 

371
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,990
armpit
do you see i need to know how to keep

372
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
do you see i need to know how to keep
 

373
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,269
do you see i need to know how to keep
his arm in such a position

374
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
his arm in such a position
 

375
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,710
his arm in such a position
that energy can be transferred from his

376
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
that energy can be transferred from his
 

377
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,030
that energy can be transferred from his
arm

378
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
arm
 

379
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,990
arm
to his center so when i go like this

380
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
to his center so when i go like this
 

381
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,030
to his center so when i go like this
energy is being

382
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
energy is being
 

383
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,949
energy is being
leaked through these hinges do you see

384
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
leaked through these hinges do you see
 

385
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,509
leaked through these hinges do you see
so i have to have his arm in such a

386
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
so i have to have his arm in such a
 

387
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,389
so i have to have his arm in such a
position

388
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
position
 

389
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,750
position
that it can go into his body as i move

390
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
that it can go into his body as i move
 

391
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,470
that it can go into his body as i move
his arm

392
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
his arm
 

393
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,509
his arm
okay

394
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519

 

395
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,350

most of the time in kihon it just

396
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
most of the time in kihon it just
 

397
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,910
most of the time in kihon it just
happens because the culture the training

398
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
happens because the culture the training
 

399
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,590
happens because the culture the training
culture the uke they just do that right

400
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
culture the uke they just do that right
 

401
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,389
culture the uke they just do that right
so here we are now with this technique

402
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
so here we are now with this technique
 

403
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:56,790
so here we are now with this technique
and

404
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
and
 

405
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,990
and
this technique requires that i find a

406
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
this technique requires that i find a
 

407
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,110
this technique requires that i find a
way

408
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
way
 

409
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,230
way
of having that happen but from an

410
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
of having that happen but from an
 

411
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,910
of having that happen but from an
entirely different position

412
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
entirely different position
 

413
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,310
entirely different position
because what we're seeing you do now is

414
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
because what we're seeing you do now is
 

415
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,389
because what we're seeing you do now is
you're getting like this

416
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
you're getting like this
 

417
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,190
you're getting like this
you see and there's a lot of energy

418
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
you see and there's a lot of energy
 

419
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,550
you see and there's a lot of energy
leakage

420
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
leakage
 

421
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,430
leakage
from here in all these points of

422
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
from here in all these points of
 

423
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,470
from here in all these points of
articulation

424
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
articulation
 

425
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,310
articulation
shoulder elbow wrist

426
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320

 

427
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,829

so as we go i have to be able

428
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
so as we go i have to be able
 

429
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,990
so as we go i have to be able
to control his body with the equal

430
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
to control his body with the equal
 

431
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,710
to control his body with the equal
no energy leakage i have to know how to

432
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
no energy leakage i have to know how to
 

433
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,509
no energy leakage i have to know how to
do that

434
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
do that
 

435
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,949
do that
without it always being like the keyhole

436
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959

 

437
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,230

and it's a matter of feeling feeling

438
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
and it's a matter of feeling feeling
 

439
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,110
and it's a matter of feeling feeling
feeling i move if i feel he's he's

440
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
feeling i move if i feel he's he's
 

441
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,389
feeling i move if i feel he's he's
starting to leak

442
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
starting to leak
 

443
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,670
starting to leak
you see i'll move i move to keep that

444
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
you see i'll move i move to keep that
 

445
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,470
you see i'll move i move to keep that
feeling

446
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
feeling
 

447
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,230
feeling
okay so we're going boom

448
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
okay so we're going boom
 

449
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,110
okay so we're going boom
i'm moving okay try it again

450
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
i'm moving okay try it again
 

451
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,910
i'm moving okay try it again
so let's let's slow this one down okay

452
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
so let's let's slow this one down okay
 

453
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,350
so let's let's slow this one down okay
so he's going here

454
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
so he's going here
 

455
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,590
so he's going here
his energy's coming back to me maybe

456
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
his energy's coming back to me maybe
 

457
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,230
his energy's coming back to me maybe
maybe he's trying to stab he's going uh

458
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
maybe he's trying to stab he's going uh
 

459
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,509
maybe he's trying to stab he's going uh
one and two so the same thing won't

00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
one and two so the same thing won't
 

461
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,430
one and two so the same thing won't
pull i go here this is what i affect his

00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
pull i go here this is what i affect his
 

463
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,910
pull i go here this is what i affect his
elbow get the same angle cancellation in

464
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
elbow get the same angle cancellation in
 

465
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,550
elbow get the same angle cancellation in

row by getting this shoulder lower than
the other one can't stand here because

470
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
the other one can't stand here because
 

471
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,069
the other one can't stand here because
this is not

472
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
this is not

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,509
this is not
jiu jitsu i'm fighting him so i yield

474
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
jiu jitsu i'm fighting him so i yield
 

475
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,949
jiu jitsu i'm fighting him so i yield
and i get it down there's my

476
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
and i get it down there's my
 

477
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,790
and i get it down there's my
cross lateral check on the other side of

478
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
cross lateral check on the other side of
 

479
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,550
cross lateral check on the other side of
his body i got my high check

480
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
his body i got my high check
 

481
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:43,910
his body i got my high check
on his legs and this is where i strip

482
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920

 

483
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,509

so we'll slow it down just so you get

484
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
so we'll slow it down just so you get
 

485
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,190
so we'll slow it down just so you get
the feeling

486
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200

 

487
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,069

move have a good base it's trap pull

488
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
move have a good base it's trap pull
 

489
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,030
move have a good base it's trap pull
your arm out

490
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
your arm out
 

491
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,389
your arm out
it's trapped it's not just here and i'm

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,269
not sliding it down
and it escapes out the bottom

496
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
and it escapes out the bottom
 

497
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:10,690

00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
okay try it again keep that arm
 

503
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,829
okay try it again keep that arm
without any energy leaking no let's have

504
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
without any energy leaking no let's have
 

505
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,350
without any energy leaking no let's have
a one and two

506
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
a one and two
 

507
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,949
a one and two
so one and two okay so we get an

508
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
so one and two okay so we get an
 

509
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,870
so one and two okay so we get an
another energy as we're coming around

510
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
another energy as we're coming around
 

511
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,389
another energy as we're coming around
this way okay
