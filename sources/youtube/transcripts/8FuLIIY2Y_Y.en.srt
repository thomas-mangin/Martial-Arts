00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
So
 

169
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,030
So
what I'm going to tell you is that is

170
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,040
what I'm going to tell you is that is
 

171
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,350
what I'm going to tell you is that is
happening from the tension that you have

172
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
happening from the tension that you have
 

173
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,590
happening from the tension that you have
in the right arm. So start out what you

174
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
in the right arm. So start out what you
 

175
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,110
in the right arm. So start out what you
think is even. Okay? And then just start

176
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
think is even. Okay? And then just start
 

177
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,070
think is even. Okay? And then just start
leaving the left arm tense, tense the

178
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
leaving the left arm tense, tense the
 

179
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,150
leaving the left arm tense, tense the
right arm. This is a discovery learning

180
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
right arm. This is a discovery learning
 

181
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,230
right arm. This is a discovery learning
exercise. And when I say tense, I mean

182
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
exercise. And when I say tense, I mean
 

183
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,550
exercise. And when I say tense, I mean
squeeze the hell out of that right arm.

184
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
squeeze the hell out of that right arm.
 

185
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,029
squeeze the hell out of that right arm.
And then notice how oh my shoulder is

186
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039
And then notice how oh my shoulder is
 

187
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,029
And then notice how oh my shoulder is
forward and the claw came slightly

188
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
forward and the claw came slightly
 

189
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,310
forward and the claw came slightly
forward. Okay, do you guys see that? All

190
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
forward. Okay, do you guys see that? All
 

191
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,830
forward. Okay, do you guys see that? All
right. What people do, this is one

192
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840
right. What people do, this is one
 

193
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,070
right. What people do, this is one
reason why you see people bring back

194
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
reason why you see people bring back
 

195
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,590
reason why you see people bring back
here.

196
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
here.
 

197
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,430
here.
Do do you get the come back here?

198
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
Do do you get the come back here?
 

199
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,110
Do do you get the come back here?
Because the the weapon is fighting the

200
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
Because the the weapon is fighting the
 

201
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,510
Because the the weapon is fighting the
tension and they loosen the tension and

202
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
tension and they loosen the tension and
 

203
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,510
tension and they loosen the tension and
the hand will come back. Okay,

204
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
the hand will come back. Okay,
 

205
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,710
the hand will come back. Okay,
but here's this. Watch this.

206
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720

 

207
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,230

If my hand is coming up the middle, I

208
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
If my hand is coming up the middle, I
 

209
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,070
If my hand is coming up the middle, I
bring it up the middle and I don't have

210
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
bring it up the middle and I don't have
 

211
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,189
bring it up the middle and I don't have
tension.

212
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199

 

213
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,749

Do you see? And I bring the other hand

214
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
Do you see? And I bring the other hand
 

215
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,550
Do you see? And I bring the other hand
up the middle.

216
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
up the middle.
 

217
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,270
up the middle.
It's not making me turn.

218
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
It's not making me turn.
 

219
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,390
It's not making me turn.
It's not making me turn.

220
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
It's not making me turn.
 

221
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,110
It's not making me turn.
Just bring the hand up the middle. Down

222
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
Just bring the hand up the middle. Down
 

223
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,870
Just bring the hand up the middle. Down
the middle. This was the exercise.

224
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
the middle. This was the exercise.
 

225
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,950
the middle. This was the exercise.
Okay,

226
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
Okay,
 

227
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,270
Okay,
if you pay attention

228
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280

 

229
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,990

when you

230
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
when you
 

231
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,110
when you
add that tension

232
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
add that tension
 

233
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,990
add that tension
and start to make this thing

234
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
and start to make this thing
 

235
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,550
and start to make this thing
be more of a form as opposed to follow

236
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
be more of a form as opposed to follow
 

237
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,350
be more of a form as opposed to follow
the tension in your body,

238
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
the tension in your body,
 

239
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,469
the tension in your body,
you do weird things

240
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
you do weird things
 

241
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,590
you do weird things
like this. You see that? And now there's

242
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:51,600
like this. You see that? And now there's
 

243
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,909
like this. You see that? And now there's
the tension in my arm. And now I have to

244
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
the tension in my arm. And now I have to
 

245
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,029
the tension in my arm. And now I have to
stop. And now the sword is up here. But

246
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
stop. And now the sword is up here. But
 

247
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,430
stop. And now the sword is up here. But
if I just let it drop, and if you pay

248
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
if I just let it drop, and if you pay
 

249
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,589
if I just let it drop, and if you pay
attention, yes, both hands are on the

250
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
attention, yes, both hands are on the
 

251
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,309
attention, yes, both hands are on the
center line, but they're not in the same

252
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319
center line, but they're not in the same
 

253
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,629
center line, but they're not in the same
point on the arc of the arm through

254
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
point on the arc of the arm through
 

255
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,309
point on the arc of the arm through
space at the same time. Do you get that?

256
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
space at the same time. Do you get that?
 

257
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,870
space at the same time. Do you get that?
So if this hand did not bring a shoulder

258
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
So if this hand did not bring a shoulder
 

259
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,350
So if this hand did not bring a shoulder
forward or back, then even though this

260
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
forward or back, then even though this
 

261
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,629
forward or back, then even though this
hand is further on the sword, it should

262
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
hand is further on the sword, it should
 

263
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,909
hand is further on the sword, it should
not bring a shoulder forward or back

264
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
not bring a shoulder forward or back
 

265
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,749
not bring a shoulder forward or back
because it is at a different place on

266
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
because it is at a different place on
 

267
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,990
because it is at a different place on
the ark. Do do you guys get what I'm

268
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
the ark. Do do you guys get what I'm
 

269
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,950
the ark. Do do you guys get what I'm
saying? Okay. So, usually we can't feel

270
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
saying? Okay. So, usually we can't feel
 

271
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,749
saying? Okay. So, usually we can't feel
the arc when we're doing something like

272
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759
the arc when we're doing something like
 

273
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,670
the arc when we're doing something like
just hitting.

274
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
just hitting.
 

275
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,150
just hitting.
So, forget sword cutting. And I'm going

276
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
So, forget sword cutting. And I'm going
 

277
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,469
So, forget sword cutting. And I'm going
to have you bring your hand in even a

278
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
to have you bring your hand in even a
 

279
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,870
to have you bring your hand in even a
little, not side by side, but just a

280
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
little, not side by side, but just a
 

281
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,189
little, not side by side, but just a
little to get you there. Okay? And just

282
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
little to get you there. Okay? And just
 

283
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,390
little to get you there. Okay? And just
realize that the hands are not doing the

284
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
realize that the hands are not doing the
 

285
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,869
realize that the hands are not doing the
same thing at the same time.

286
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
same thing at the same time.
 

287
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,350
same thing at the same time.
Do you understand? Okay. See if you can

288
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
Do you understand? Okay. See if you can
 

289
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,390
Do you understand? Okay. See if you can
feel that. And I'll bring your mind to

290
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
feel that. And I'll bring your mind to
 

291
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,950
feel that. And I'll bring your mind to
the wrist flexion. Okay. So, for

292
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
the wrist flexion. Okay. So, for
 

293
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,230
the wrist flexion. Okay. So, for
example, as I start, if I kept my wrists

294
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
example, as I start, if I kept my wrists
 

295
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,189
example, as I start, if I kept my wrists
the same as they are right now, and I

296
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
the same as they are right now, and I
 

297
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,589
the same as they are right now, and I
move my arms up, I keep that wrist

298
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
move my arms up, I keep that wrist
 

299
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,189
move my arms up, I keep that wrist
flexion,

300
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
flexion,
 

301
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,270
flexion,
I'm never going to get to the up part.

302
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
I'm never going to get to the up part.
 

303
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,270
I'm never going to get to the up part.
Do you understand? So, the elbow is

304
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
Do you understand? So, the elbow is
 

305
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,430
Do you understand? So, the elbow is
flexing, the wrist is flexing. Do do you

306
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
flexing, the wrist is flexing. Do do you
 

307
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,670
flexing, the wrist is flexing. Do do you
understand? Okay.

308
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
understand? Okay.
 

309
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,990
understand? Okay.
There's a time in the arc where that

310
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
There's a time in the arc where that
 

311
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,389
There's a time in the arc where that
happens without tension.

312
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
happens without tension.
 

313
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,310
happens without tension.
That's what I don't know yet because I'm

314
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
That's what I don't know yet because I'm
 

315
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,389
That's what I don't know yet because I'm
trying to move the sword as opposed to

316
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
trying to move the sword as opposed to
 

317
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,909
trying to move the sword as opposed to
let the sword move me. Okay. So, what I

318
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
let the sword move me. Okay. So, what I
 

319
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,670
let the sword move me. Okay. So, what I
want you to do in this exercise is we're

320
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
want you to do in this exercise is we're
 

321
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,310
want you to do in this exercise is we're
going to come back a little bit to get a

322
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
going to come back a little bit to get a
 

323
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,030
going to come back a little bit to get a
fighting chance. And you'll see that the

324
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
fighting chance. And you'll see that the
 

325
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,430
fighting chance. And you'll see that the
wrists are not exactly in the same

326
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
wrists are not exactly in the same
 

327
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,110
wrists are not exactly in the same
flexion

328
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
flexion
 

329
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,269
flexion
at the same time. Do do you get that?

330
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279
at the same time. Do do you get that?
 

331
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,550
at the same time. Do do you get that?
But I don't want to do this either.

332
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
But I don't want to do this either.
 

333
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,630
But I don't want to do this either.
Okay.

334
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
Okay.
 

335
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,630
Okay.
The elbows too are not in the same

336
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
The elbows too are not in the same
 

337
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,230
The elbows too are not in the same
articulation angle as I'm going through.

338
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
articulation angle as I'm going through.
 

339
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,790
articulation angle as I'm going through.
And if I just measure for tension in my

340
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800
And if I just measure for tension in my
 

341
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,790
And if I just measure for tension in my
body, you'll find it.

342
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
body, you'll find it.
 

343
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:44,470
body, you'll find it.
Okay. Try it.

344
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480

 

345
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,829

Bring the left hand back where it goes.

346
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:49,839

 

347
00:09:49,839 --> 00:10:04,870

Don't let tension come in your body.

348
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880

 

349
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,110

Now bring some awareness to your

350
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
Now bring some awareness to your
 

351
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,910
Now bring some awareness to your
shoulders and your claw because you

352
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
shoulders and your claw because you
 

353
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,790
shoulders and your claw because you
might just be doing it out of habit. So

354
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
might just be doing it out of habit. So
 

355
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,150
might just be doing it out of habit. So
keep your shoulders and claws square as

356
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160
keep your shoulders and claws square as
 

357
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,790
keep your shoulders and claws square as
you monitor for tension through your

358
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
you monitor for tension through your
 

359
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:30,790
you monitor for tension through your
arms, wrist, fingers.

360
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800

 

361
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,509

Keep your shoulders square and your claw

362
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
Keep your shoulders square and your claw
 

363
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,269
Keep your shoulders square and your claw
square.

364
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279

 

365
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,750

Okay. So, now we'll watch. That was

366
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
Okay. So, now we'll watch. That was
 

367
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,389
Okay. So, now we'll watch. That was
going up. Now we watch for going down.

368
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
going up. Now we watch for going down.
 

369
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,350
going up. Now we watch for going down.
Okay. So, if I come down and you watch

370
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
Okay. So, if I come down and you watch
 

371
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,069
Okay. So, if I come down and you watch
watch my elbows, this is you. You get

372
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
watch my elbows, this is you. You get
 

373
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,670
watch my elbows, this is you. You get
this problem. You know what I'm talking

374
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
this problem. You know what I'm talking
 

375
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,230
this problem. You know what I'm talking
about. I mentioned that you have you

376
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
about. I mentioned that you have you
 

377
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,949
about. I mentioned that you have you
have uh greater wrist flexion and you're

378
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
have uh greater wrist flexion and you're
 

379
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,430
have uh greater wrist flexion and you're
trying to do it at the same time. Your

380
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
trying to do it at the same time. Your
 

381
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,110
trying to do it at the same time. Your
elbows are doing it at the same time,

382
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
elbows are doing it at the same time,
 

383
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,269
elbows are doing it at the same time,
too. The elbows can't be at the same

384
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:05,279
too. The elbows can't be at the same
 

385
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,949
too. The elbows can't be at the same
time because the hands aren't in the

386
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
time because the hands aren't in the
 

387
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,949
time because the hands aren't in the
same position of the arc at the same

388
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
same position of the arc at the same
 

389
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,790
same position of the arc at the same
time. They can no more be in the same

390
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
time. They can no more be in the same
 

391
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,110
time. They can no more be in the same
time than the wrist can be. And that is

392
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
time than the wrist can be. And that is
 

393
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,430
time than the wrist can be. And that is
important coming down. So, if I try to

394
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
important coming down. So, if I try to
 

395
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,670
important coming down. So, if I try to
come down with my elbows at the exact

396
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
come down with my elbows at the exact
 

397
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,310
come down with my elbows at the exact
same articulation, the sword will never

398
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
same articulation, the sword will never
 

399
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,269
same articulation, the sword will never
get out and do the cut. Do do you

400
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
get out and do the cut. Do do you
 

401
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,150
get out and do the cut. Do do you
understand that? So they don't go at the

402
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
understand that? So they don't go at the
 

403
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,150
understand that? So they don't go at the
same time. So as I come out, you can see

404
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
same time. So as I come out, you can see
 

405
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,790
same time. So as I come out, you can see
they don't have the exact same angle of

406
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
they don't have the exact same angle of
 

407
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,269
they don't have the exact same angle of
articulation.

408
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279

 

409
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,590

Do you see that? They don't. Okay? And

410
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
Do you see that? They don't. Okay? And
 

411
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,790
Do you see that? They don't. Okay? And
if you just follow

412
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
if you just follow
 

413
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,269
if you just follow
just like yinyang, one hand's doing one

414
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
just like yinyang, one hand's doing one
 

415
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,870
just like yinyang, one hand's doing one
thing, the other hand's never doing the

416
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
thing, the other hand's never doing the
 

417
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,829
thing, the other hand's never doing the
same exact thing at the same time. Okay?

418
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
same exact thing at the same time. Okay?
 

419
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,430
same exact thing at the same time. Okay?
Right? So, one hand is doing an inward

420
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
Right? So, one hand is doing an inward
 

421
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,190
Right? So, one hand is doing an inward
spiral, other hand is doing an outward

422
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
spiral, other hand is doing an outward
 

423
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,230
spiral, other hand is doing an outward
spiral. Okay? One hand is yong, one hand

424
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
spiral. Okay? One hand is yong, one hand
 

425
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,350
spiral. Okay? One hand is yong, one hand
is yin. Same thing here. Don't make them

426
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
is yin. Same thing here. Don't make them
 

427
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,310
is yin. Same thing here. Don't make them
go at the same time. What's what's my

428
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
go at the same time. What's what's my
 

429
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,630
go at the same time. What's what's my
clue I want you to do is I want you to

430
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:04,640
clue I want you to do is I want you to
 

431
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,910
clue I want you to do is I want you to
feel no tension in the arm and the grip.

432
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
feel no tension in the arm and the grip.
 

433
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,790
feel no tension in the arm and the grip.
And the sword is moving your

434
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
And the sword is moving your
 

435
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,030
And the sword is moving your
shoulders, arms, all that through space.

436
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
shoulders, arms, all that through space.
 

437
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:24,550
shoulders, arms, all that through space.
Okay? So, let's bring that. Go.

438
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560

 

439
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,509

Don't pull both elbows down

440
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
Don't pull both elbows down
 

441
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,829
Don't pull both elbows down
at the same rate.

442
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
at the same rate.
 

443
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,750
at the same rate.
Don't bring them up at the same rate.

444
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760

 

445
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,750

Send that sword out. You have wrist

446
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
Send that sword out. You have wrist
 

447
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:47,910
Send that sword out. You have wrist
angles that got to be the same.

448
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920

 

449
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,670

So very very common. A lot of people do

450
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:51,680
So very very common. A lot of people do
 

451
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,350
So very very common. A lot of people do
this is they're trying to stack the

452
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
this is they're trying to stack the
 

453
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,310
this is they're trying to stack the
weapon. Do you see how it's stacked? You

454
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
weapon. Do you see how it's stacked? You
 

455
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,949
weapon. Do you see how it's stacked? You
see that? And then they come down and

456
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
see that? And then they come down and
 

457
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,069
see that? And then they come down and
they stack the weapon again.

458
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
they stack the weapon again.
 

459
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,350
they stack the weapon again.
Understand?

460
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
Understand?
 

461
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,870
Understand?
>> Okay.

462
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
>> Okay.
 

463
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,990
>> Okay.
So here I am stacked and you can see

464
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
So here I am stacked and you can see
 

465
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,949
So here I am stacked and you can see
that my wrists are in the same angle.

466
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
that my wrists are in the same angle.
 

467
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,069
that my wrists are in the same angle.
They should not be in the same angle.

468
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
They should not be in the same angle.
 

469
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,389
They should not be in the same angle.
Got it? They're in different places on

470
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
Got it? They're in different places on
 

471
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,870
Got it? They're in different places on
that arc. There should not be a time

472
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
that arc. There should not be a time
 

473
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,910
that arc. There should not be a time
when they're over each other like that.

474
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
when they're over each other like that.
 

475
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,470
when they're over each other like that.
In which case, the sword should never

476
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
In which case, the sword should never
 

477
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,190
In which case, the sword should never
end up here. Neither going forward. No,

478
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200
end up here. Neither going forward. No,
 

479
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,990
end up here. Neither going forward. No,
no, no, no. Okay. They're doing

480
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
no, no, no. Okay. They're doing
 

481
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,910
no, no, no. Okay. They're doing
different things at They're doing the

482
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
different things at They're doing the
 

483
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,910
different things at They're doing the
same thing, but at different rates. At

484
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
same thing, but at different rates. At
 

485
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,910
same thing, but at different rates. At
different rates. At different rates.

486
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
different rates. At different rates.
 

487
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,670
different rates. At different rates.
They're following each other. Same

488
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
They're following each other. Same
 

489
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,629
They're following each other. Same
thing. Following each other. Okay, try

490
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
thing. Following each other. Okay, try
 

491
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:54,230
thing. Following each other. Okay, try
it again.

492
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240

 

493
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,230

And they follow each other all the way

494
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
And they follow each other all the way
 

495
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:04,790
And they follow each other all the way
down to the bottom.

496
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800

 

497
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:24,710

Don't stack it.

498
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720

 

499
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,470

All the way down. Let the left hand

500
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,480
All the way down. Let the left hand
 

501
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:49,030
All the way down. Let the left hand
drop. Let the left hand drop.

502
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040

 

503
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,870

All right. Marshially there's two

504
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
All right. Marshially there's two
 

505
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,310
All right. Marshially there's two
reasons for this. So, if we were in Sean

506
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320

 

507
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,430

and if I stack the sword going up,

508
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,440
and if I stack the sword going up,
 

509
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,189
and if I stack the sword going up,
you're going to see that the sword is no

510
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
you're going to see that the sword is no
 

511
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,189
you're going to see that the sword is no
longer threatening him. It's not

512
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:03,199
longer threatening him. It's not
 

513
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,750
longer threatening him. It's not
threatening him. The sword is

514
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
threatening him. The sword is
 

515
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,590
threatening him. The sword is
threatening threatening threatening

516
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
threatening threatening threatening
 

517
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,590
threatening threatening threatening
threatening. So, the threat the threat

518
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
threatening. So, the threat the threat
 

519
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,389
threatening. So, the threat the threat
threshold stays longer than if I stack

520
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
threshold stays longer than if I stack
 

521
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,509
threshold stays longer than if I stack
the sword, it goes away earlier. On the

522
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
the sword, it goes away earlier. On the
 

523
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,949
the sword, it goes away earlier. On the
cut, you're going to have a chop.

524
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
cut, you're going to have a chop.
 

525
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,470
cut, you're going to have a chop.
You're gonna chop and a wrist flick as

526
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
You're gonna chop and a wrist flick as
 

527
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,590
You're gonna chop and a wrist flick as
opposed to just letting the weapon do

528
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
opposed to just letting the weapon do
 

529
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,550
opposed to just letting the weapon do
its thing. Do you understand? Okay. Um,

530
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
its thing. Do you understand? Okay. Um,
 

531
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,470
its thing. Do you understand? Okay. Um,
so again, a little bit more. Do not

532
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
so again, a little bit more. Do not
 

533
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,550
so again, a little bit more. Do not
stack the sword going up. Do not stack

534
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
stack the sword going up. Do not stack
 

535
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,199
stack the sword going up. Do not stack
the sword going down. Go.
