00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,110

okay for this video we're going to look

2
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,120
okay for this video we're going to look
 

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,700
okay for this video we're going to look
at the second qubit a chi fairly gloomy

4
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:29,710
at the second qubit a chi fairly gloomy
 

5
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,060
at the second qubit a chi fairly gloomy
Shuang is a few interesting bits and

6
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,070
Shuang is a few interesting bits and
 

7
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,970
Shuang is a few interesting bits and
pieces to it has been a few changes over

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:35,980
pieces to it has been a few changes over
 

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,650
pieces to it has been a few changes over
the years I'll be doing it she'll talk

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:37,660
the years I'll be doing it she'll talk
 

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,049
the years I'll be doing it she'll talk
about where things have changed they're

12
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:40,059
about where things have changed they're
 

13
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:43,560
about where things have changed they're
not necessarily you know right there

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:43,570
not necessarily you know right there
 

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,630
not necessarily you know right there
they were right in there there now

16
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:45,640
they were right in there there now
 

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,940
they were right in there there now
wrongman yeah they're just different so

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:47,950
wrongman yeah they're just different so
 

19
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,420
wrongman yeah they're just different so
hmm there's you learn different aspects

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:51,430
hmm there's you learn different aspects
 

21
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,920
hmm there's you learn different aspects
from doing in different ways

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:52,930
from doing in different ways
 

23
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,740
from doing in different ways
okay so keeps all fairly open wide some

24
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:55,750
okay so keeps all fairly open wide some
 

25
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,250
okay so keeps all fairly open wide some
of the changes that we've made

26
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:58,260
of the changes that we've made
 

27
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,270
of the changes that we've made
okay in the first video I see some of

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
okay in the first video I see some of
 

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,280
okay in the first video I see some of
these are snapshots so don't necessarily

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,290
these are snapshots so don't necessarily
 

31
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,100
these are snapshots so don't necessarily
start you know necessary starting in

32
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,110
start you know necessary starting in
 

33
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,330
start you know necessary starting in
this position though obviously you are

34
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:09,340
this position though obviously you are
 

35
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,550
this position though obviously you are
but the exercise and this is this was

36
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:11,560
but the exercise and this is this was
 

37
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,900
but the exercise and this is this was
quite a good demonstration because the

38
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:12,910
quite a good demonstration because the
 

39
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:18,210
quite a good demonstration because the
attack yuki does doesn't he's not very

40
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:18,220
attack yuki does doesn't he's not very
 

41
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,520
attack yuki does doesn't he's not very
practical from this sort of position was

42
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:20,530
practical from this sort of position was
 

43
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,620
practical from this sort of position was
he be David makes things easy he's

44
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:22,630
he be David makes things easy he's
 

45
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,050
he be David makes things easy he's
attacking the leg so he's gotta be here

46
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,060
attacking the leg so he's gotta be here
 

47
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,529
attacking the leg so he's gotta be here
now I could reach you very easily

48
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:27,539
now I could reach you very easily
 

49
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:33,059
now I could reach you very easily
without before he gets into range

50
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:33,069
without before he gets into range
 

51
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:36,120
without before he gets into range
so yes have some significant time on me

52
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,130
so yes have some significant time on me
 

53
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,790
so yes have some significant time on me
to make me react to block that otherwise

54
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:38,800
to make me react to block that otherwise
 

55
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,650
to make me react to block that otherwise
I can just sort of counter it very

56
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:40,660
I can just sort of counter it very
 

57
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,540
I can just sort of counter it very
easily now there's no hint emitting

58
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:42,550
easily now there's no hint emitting
 

59
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,160
easily now there's no hint emitting
there as we both raise up the defender

60
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,170
there as we both raise up the defender
 

61
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,900
there as we both raise up the defender
is following the attacker and that sort

62
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:48,910
is following the attacker and that sort
 

63
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,449
is following the attacker and that sort
of raises last but it's not quite enough

64
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:51,459
of raises last but it's not quite enough
 

65
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:54,590
of raises last but it's not quite enough
to create that time gap

66
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:54,600
to create that time gap
 

67
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,399
to create that time gap
I mean that boy will attack but yeah

68
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:57,409
I mean that boy will attack but yeah
 

69
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,700
I mean that boy will attack but yeah
this is this is the exercise so we check

70
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:01,710
this is this is the exercise so we check
 

71
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,560
this is this is the exercise so we check
from here we show from the attack and

72
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:03,570
from here we show from the attack and
 

73
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,590
from here we show from the attack and
this is quite interesting creeps in the

74
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:06,600
this is quite interesting creeps in the
 

75
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,390
this is quite interesting creeps in the
first so folks praise he starts he

76
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,400
first so folks praise he starts he
 

77
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,210
first so folks praise he starts he
raises up he takes the leg

78
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:14,220
raises up he takes the leg
 

79
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,150
raises up he takes the leg
now that's very simple finish I could do

80
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,160
now that's very simple finish I could do
 

81
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,240
now that's very simple finish I could do
from there yeah he can't really reach me

82
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,250
from there yeah he can't really reach me
 

83
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,050
from there yeah he can't really reach me
so with it but I shoot he's managed to

84
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:24,060
so with it but I shoot he's managed to
 

85
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,470
so with it but I shoot he's managed to
time I didn't have to respond to the

86
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:27,480
time I didn't have to respond to the
 

87
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,070
time I didn't have to respond to the
attack so look at it from this point of

88
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,080
attack so look at it from this point of
 

89
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,750
attack so look at it from this point of
view a snapshot he's actually got more

90
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:32,760
view a snapshot he's actually got more
 

91
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,340
view a snapshot he's actually got more
time I blocked down here now from here

92
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:37,350
time I blocked down here now from here
 

93
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,500
time I blocked down here now from here
now because of this geometry how this

94
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:39,510
now because of this geometry how this
 

95
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:39,890
now because of this geometry how this
works

96
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:39,900
works
 

97
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,970
works
he's risked his in within range of my

98
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:42,980
he's risked his in within range of my
 

99
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,210
he's risked his in within range of my
sword

100
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,220
sword
 

101
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,940
sword
so I raise a zither to cut put your

102
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:46,950
so I raise a zither to cut put your
 

103
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:55,590
so I raise a zither to cut put your
wrist hallelujah

104
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:55,600

 

105
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,900

okay so that's the line of his wrist I'm

106
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:58,910
okay so that's the line of his wrist I'm
 

107
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,710
okay so that's the line of his wrist I'm
down here that's the attack button doing

108
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
down here that's the attack button doing
 

109
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,640
down here that's the attack button doing
these risk okay so from here I raised to

110
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:09,650
these risk okay so from here I raised to
 

111
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,190
these risk okay so from here I raised to
attack as this comes up he raises the

112
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,200
attack as this comes up he raises the
 

113
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,140
attack as this comes up he raises the
point of his sword the other side now I

114
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,150
point of his sword the other side now I
 

115
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,630
point of his sword the other side now I
can no longer get to attack you I have

116
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
can no longer get to attack you I have
 

117
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,150
can no longer get to attack you I have
to change my mind I hold this on line he

118
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,160
to change my mind I hold this on line he
 

119
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,030
to change my mind I hold this on line he
comes around for a thrust and I blow

120
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,040
comes around for a thrust and I blow
 

121
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,450
comes around for a thrust and I blow
back and parry and that's the first part

122
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:27,460
back and parry and that's the first part
 

123
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,580
back and parry and that's the first part
