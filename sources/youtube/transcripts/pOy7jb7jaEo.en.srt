at all your different Learners you must
 

53
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,750
at all your different Learners you must
grasp different things but as I make

this circle this hand stays quite High
 

57
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,170
this circle this hand stays quite High
so I need this the important thing is

58
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:18,180
so I need this the important thing is
 

59
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,190
so I need this the important thing is
this thumb

60
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
this thumb
 

61
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,490
this thumb
to get into there they can't get in

62
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:22,500
to get into there they can't get in
 

63
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,429
to get into there they can't get in
there if I turn it over

64
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
there if I turn it over
 

65
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,170
there if I turn it over
and grip it

66
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,180
and grip it
 

67
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,810

so what ends up if the timing's right

68
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:29,820
so what ends up if the timing's right
 

69
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,210
so what ends up if the timing's right
wrong we end up sort of with a bit of a

70
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:32,220
wrong we end up sort of with a bit of a
 

71
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,490
wrong we end up sort of with a bit of a
hold and then we wonder why they can

72
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:34,500
hold and then we wonder why they can
 

73
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,069
hold and then we wonder why they can
block us

74
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:37,079

 

75
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,929

it's the coordination bit
 

103
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,390
it's the coordination bit
because men are physically strong

so I have to adjust to get under loans

128
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:53,879
so I have to adjust to get under loans
 

129
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,229
so I have to adjust to get under loans
if I do it correctly I'm in first then

130
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:57,239
if I do it correctly I'm in first then
 

131
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,630
if I do it correctly I'm in first then
here look I didn't have to adjust to

132
00:02:59,630 --> 00:02:59,640
here look I didn't have to adjust to
 

133
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,589
here look I didn't have to adjust to
that I did began and

134
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:02,599
that I did began and

I couldn't do the dirt bike
so if I use strength my thumb's in there

140
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:13,319
so if I use strength my thumb's in there
 

141
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,130
so if I use strength my thumb's in there
a bit but it's not what up to the the

142
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,140
a bit but it's not what up to the the
 

143
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,170
a bit but it's not what up to the the
clothes but if you see it's not up to

144
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,180
clothes but if you see it's not up to
 

145
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,250
clothes but if you see it's not up to
that bit

146

that bit
 

147
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,009
that bit
that's in there but it has no value now

148
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:22,019
that's in there but it has no value now
 

149
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,710
that's in there but it has no value now
so about nearly blocked I now lower my

150
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
so about nearly blocked I now lower my
 

151
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,670
so about nearly blocked I now lower my
body and I go under it
