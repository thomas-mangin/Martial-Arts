1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,590

so he's going to go backwards right from

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:04,600
so he's going to go backwards right from
 

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,309
so he's going to go backwards right from
my thrust or at least my thrust is

4
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:06,319
my thrust or at least my thrust is
 

5
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,310
my thrust or at least my thrust is
coming that way so by default that means

6
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:09,320
coming that way so by default that means
 

7
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,870
coming that way so by default that means
he has to be coming

8
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
he has to be coming
 

9
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,789
he has to be coming
forward on My ATT so it's not that I go

10
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,799
forward on My ATT so it's not that I go
 

11
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,990
forward on My ATT so it's not that I go
here he goes go well it's not that I'm

12
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,000
here he goes go well it's not that I'm
 

13
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,990
here he goes go well it's not that I'm
here and then I let him stop and then I

14
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,000
here and then I let him stop and then I
 

15
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,910
here and then I let him stop and then I
come back okay so you have to feel the

16
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:22,920
come back okay so you have to feel the
 

17
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,029
come back okay so you have to feel the
you established the iy at the front so

18
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:25,039
you established the iy at the front so
 

19
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,950
you established the iy at the front so
when he goes you're already off of it

20
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
when he goes you're already off of it
 

21
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,589
when he goes you're already off of it
not

22
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
not
 

23
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,350
not
and then I try to go I actually got

24
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
and then I try to go I actually got
 

25
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,670
and then I try to go I actually got
checked out okay so you have to feel for

26
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:36,680
checked out okay so you have to feel for
 

27
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,110
checked out okay so you have to feel for
that and then you're just

28
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,120
that and then you're just
 

29
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:48,350
that and then you're just
in and there's no tension in what you're

30
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:48,360

 

31
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,630

doing okay so what's he doing boom

32
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:53,640
doing okay so what's he doing boom
 

33
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,069
doing okay so what's he doing boom
in so you have a clearing of defense and

34
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:57,079
in so you have a clearing of defense and
 

35
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,349
in so you have a clearing of defense and
then attack up down the center l okay

36
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:00,359
then attack up down the center l okay
 

37
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,550
then attack up down the center l okay
reconcile Yin boom and come in the

38
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:04,560
reconcile Yin boom and come in the
 

39
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,670
reconcile Yin boom and come in the
void so Yin reconciliation boom and then

40
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:08,680
void so Yin reconciliation boom and then
 

41
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:28,830
void so Yin reconciliation boom and then
in the void okay all right let's

42
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:28,840

 

43
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:36,510

go

44
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:36,520

 

45
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,990

so uh

46
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
so uh
 

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,749
so uh
geomet speaking he has a line of attack

48
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
geomet speaking he has a line of attack
 

49
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,630
geomet speaking he has a line of attack
he's going to uh have some sort of

50
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
he's going to uh have some sort of
 

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,230
he's going to uh have some sort of
linearity to it so the linearity is

52
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
linearity to it so the linearity is
 

53
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,230
linearity to it so the linearity is
going to require my circle okay so just

54
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
going to require my circle okay so just
 

55
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,270
going to require my circle okay so just
like on the other one I yielded with the

56
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,280
like on the other one I yielded with the
 

57
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,950
like on the other one I yielded with the
circle I always yield on the circle so

58
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
circle I always yield on the circle so
 

59
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,069
circle I always yield on the circle so
here if you're fine don't worry okay I'm

60
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
here if you're fine don't worry okay I'm
 

61
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,029
here if you're fine don't worry okay I'm
going to go I have to go around this

62
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:02,039
going to go I have to go around this
 

63
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,469
going to go I have to go around this
thing so I'm going to go around it with

64
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
thing so I'm going to go around it with
 

65
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,830
thing so I'm going to go around it with
my body

66
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
my body
 

67
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,470
my body
okay not that I'm just on the side going

68
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:10,480
okay not that I'm just on the side going
 

69
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,670
okay not that I'm just on the side going
here I meet

70
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:12,680
here I meet
 

71
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,750
here I meet
this with

72
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:14,760
this with
 

73
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,470
this with
circles

74
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:17,480
circles
 

75
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,550
circles
okay and again the same thing you can't

76
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:21,560
okay and again the same thing you can't
 

77
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,750
okay and again the same thing you can't
know that's too late okay it's the same

78
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:24,760
know that's too late okay it's the same
 

79
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,390
know that's too late okay it's the same
body reading that you're

80
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400

 

81
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,110

doing same body

82
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120

 

83
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,509

body the

84
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
body the
 

85
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,830
body the
defang then

86
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:38,840
defang then
 

87
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:53,790
defang then
Pi again don't start so far close close

88
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:53,800

 

89
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,630

[Music]

90
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:55,640
[Music]
 

91
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,750
[Music]
close let's

92
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:58,760
close let's
 

93
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:38,190
close let's
try

94
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,200

 

95
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,869

so just like on the sword technique the

96
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
so just like on the sword technique the
 

97
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,710
so just like on the sword technique the
circle it allows you to keep coming in

98
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:43,720
circle it allows you to keep coming in
 

99
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,270
circle it allows you to keep coming in
remember I need you to come in okay so

100
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:46,280
remember I need you to come in okay so
 

101
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,910
remember I need you to come in okay so
as he's going here I go linear you're

102
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:48,920
as he's going here I go linear you're
 

103
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,710
as he's going here I go linear you're
not motivated to come in okay my my

104
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
not motivated to come in okay my my
 

105
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,190
not motivated to come in okay my my
circle is going this

106
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
circle is going this
 

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,350
circle is going this
way it's a circle

108
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:58,360
way it's a circle
 

109
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,309
way it's a circle
whoa not

110
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
whoa not
 

111
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,789
whoa not
here you're just doing that cuz it's

112
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
here you're just doing that cuz it's
 

113
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,630
here you're just doing that cuz it's
safer all right but it's a circle again

114
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
safer all right but it's a circle again
 

115
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,789
safer all right but it's a circle again
if you're reading the body you know when

116
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
if you're reading the body you know when
 

117
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,789
if you're reading the body you know when
he's going to go you're just you're

118
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:11,799
he's going to go you're just you're
 

119
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,390
he's going to go you're just you're
actually waiting okay so I'm here and

120
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:15,400
actually waiting okay so I'm here and
 

121
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,150
actually waiting okay so I'm here and
I'm waiting if you pay attention I've

122
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
I'm waiting if you pay attention I've
 

123
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,030
I'm waiting if you pay attention I've
already moved watch when I touched his

124
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
already moved watch when I touched his
 

125
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,310
already moved watch when I touched his
arm watch when my blade goes to his arm

126
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
arm watch when my blade goes to his arm
 

127
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,629
arm watch when my blade goes to his arm
okay

128
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:25,639
okay
 

129
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,029
okay
so and then watch his watch his spine in

130
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:29,039
so and then watch his watch his spine in
 

131
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,189
so and then watch his watch his spine in
space okay we're still coming forward

132
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:32,199
space okay we're still coming forward
 

133
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,430
space okay we're still coming forward
when the knife goes into it okay try it

134
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
when the knife goes into it okay try it
 

135
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,990
when the knife goes into it okay try it
again all right so there's two size to

136
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
again all right so there's two size to
 

137
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,790
again all right so there's two size to
the circle that's the cool thing about

138
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:39,800
the circle that's the cool thing about
 

139
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,510
the circle that's the cool thing about
using circles okay so if we take this

140
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:42,520
using circles okay so if we take this
 

141
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,710
using circles okay so if we take this
one arm and I'm coming here you're going

142
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
one arm and I'm coming here you're going
 

143
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,830
one arm and I'm coming here you're going
to go one and instead of going back on a

144
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:48,840
to go one and instead of going back on a
 

145
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,150
to go one and instead of going back on a
straight line it's here boom this way

146
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
straight line it's here boom this way
 

147
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,909
straight line it's here boom this way
okay that's what you're trying to do so

148
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
okay that's what you're trying to do so
 

149
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,830
okay that's what you're trying to do so
as he's coming in boom it helps keep

150
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:56,840
as he's coming in boom it helps keep
 

151
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,150
as he's coming in boom it helps keep
from coming in okay he's is coming

152
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:01,160
from coming in okay he's is coming
 

153
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,470
from coming in okay he's is coming
in if you look for example I on me right

154
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:06,480
in if you look for example I on me right
 

155
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,749
in if you look for example I on me right

the
 

161
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,590
the
circle so that's what that has doing

162
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
circle so that's what that has doing
 

163
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,150
circle so that's what that has doing
both

164
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160

 

165
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,110

in if he's not there because he's coming

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
in if he's not there because he's coming
 

167
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,749
in if he's not there because he's coming
in so fast then it's in your angle of

168
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:22,759
in so fast then it's in your angle of
 

169
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,029
in so fast then it's in your angle of
Defense you see so it's got an angle

170
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:26,039
Defense you see so it's got an angle
 

171
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,270
Defense you see so it's got an angle
across the arm I'm not I'm not over here

172
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
across the arm I'm not I'm not over here
 

173
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,189
across the arm I'm not I'm not over here
okay

174
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:30,199
okay
 

175
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,309
okay
so sometimes you touch him it depends

176
00:05:32,309 --> 00:05:32,319
so sometimes you touch him it depends
 

177
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,950
so sometimes you touch him it depends
how fast he's coming in

178
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
how fast he's coming in
 

179
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,309
how fast he's coming in
okay then the other arm the same thing

180
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:37,319
okay then the other arm the same thing
 

181
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,950
okay then the other arm the same thing
so this was feeding the

182
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:39,960
so this was feeding the
 

183
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,749
so this was feeding the
defang

184
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:42,759
defang
 

185
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,790
defang
okay this way think of the circle

186
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
okay this way think of the circle
 

187
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,029
okay this way think of the circle
vertical now after it does its feeding

188
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:50,039
vertical now after it does its feeding
 

189
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,629
vertical now after it does its feeding
then it continues on the downside and

190
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:53,639
then it continues on the downside and
 

191
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,790
then it continues on the downside and
brings the check

192
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800

 

193
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:05,510

in so this hand more

194
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520

 

195
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,589

here start so

196
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:10,599

 

197
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,830

far okay so same principles though you

198
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:14,840
far okay so same principles though you
 

199
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,309
far okay so same principles though you
you're still going to have your uh

200
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:17,319
you're still going to have your uh
 

201
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,350
you're still going to have your uh
ground vectoring do you see I still have

202
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
ground vectoring do you see I still have
 

203
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,790
ground vectoring do you see I still have
it when I enter I'm still in your Center

204
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:21,800
it when I enter I'm still in your Center
 

205
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,950
it when I enter I'm still in your Center
do you see so you can

206
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:23,960
do you see so you can
 

207
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,430
do you see so you can
project okay and then the same thing

208
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
project okay and then the same thing
 

209
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,670
project okay and then the same thing
when I stab I'm not Like This Hold the

210
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
when I stab I'm not Like This Hold the
 

211
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,070
when I stab I'm not Like This Hold the
End Hold the End okay it's same thing

212
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
End Hold the End okay it's same thing
 

213
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,270
End Hold the End okay it's same thing
you're still doing the same thrust with

214
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,280
you're still doing the same thrust with
 

215
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,469
you're still doing the same thrust with
the ground Ving okay so same thing here

216
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:41,479
the ground Ving okay so same thing here
 

217
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:43,790
the ground Ving okay so same thing here
you have your adhesion do you see that

218
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:43,800
you have your adhesion do you see that
 

219
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,550
you have your adhesion do you see that
adhesion brings him

220
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
adhesion brings him
 

221
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,309
adhesion brings him
in now you're just sophisticating it

222
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:49,319
in now you're just sophisticating it
 

223
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,150
in now you're just sophisticating it
with the other

224
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:51,160
with the other
 

225
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,230
with the other
hand okay try that again okay so again

226
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
hand okay try that again okay so again
 

227
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,430
hand okay try that again okay so again
the yield is on the circle use

228
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440

 

229
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,909

and that Circle tactically helps pull

230
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
and that Circle tactically helps pull
 

231
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,350
and that Circle tactically helps pull
the guy in okay

232
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
the guy in okay
 

233
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,510
the guy in okay
um so let's do a right cross this time

234
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:10,520
um so let's do a right cross this time
 

235
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,790
um so let's do a right cross this time
so right straight cross boom you Shuffle

236
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
so right straight cross boom you Shuffle
 

237
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,710
so right straight cross boom you Shuffle
in and everything right boom okay so

238
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
in and everything right boom okay so
 

239
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,469
in and everything right boom okay so
maybe over

240
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
maybe over
 

241
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,510
maybe over
here instead of leaving

242
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
here instead of leaving
 

243
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,589
here instead of leaving
straight I'll make that same

244
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:24,599
straight I'll make that same
 

245
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,710
straight I'll make that same
Circle it goes back you see I I combine

246
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
Circle it goes back you see I I combine
 

247
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,909
Circle it goes back you see I I combine
it and I'm now moving in so I sucker him

248
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:32,919
it and I'm now moving in so I sucker him
 

249
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,469
it and I'm now moving in so I sucker him
in and then come in and I'll come up

250
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
in and then come in and I'll come up
 

251
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,830
in and then come in and I'll come up
with that reverse hammerfist down on the

252
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:38,840
with that reverse hammerfist down on the
 

253
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,390
with that reverse hammerfist down on the
groin okay so if I hit the groin see how

254
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,400
groin okay so if I hit the groin see how
 

255
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,990
groin okay so if I hit the groin see how
he kind of bends over like that and then

256
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
he kind of bends over like that and then
 

257
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,589
he kind of bends over like that and then
you follow the rule that we've been

258
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
you follow the rule that we've been
 

259
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,390
you follow the rule that we've been
doing we Circle where the circle ends

260
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
doing we Circle where the circle ends
 

261
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,909
doing we Circle where the circle ends
the line begins and you so you have

262
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:50,919
the line begins and you so you have
 

263
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,710
the line begins and you so you have
continuous motion okay so where the

264
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:53,720
continuous motion okay so where the
 

265
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,070
continuous motion okay so where the
circle ends the line begins boom you're

266
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,080
circle ends the line begins boom you're
 

267
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,710
circle ends the line begins boom you're
here and we'll come back around will hit

268
00:07:59,710 --> 00:07:59,720
here and we'll come back around will hit
 

269
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,869
here and we'll come back around will hit
this kidney back

270
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:01,879
this kidney back
 

271
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,990
this kidney back
here so if you watch my body my body is

272
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
here so if you watch my body my body is
 

273
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,550
here so if you watch my body my body is
just

274

okay around and then I'm going drop back
 

277
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,469
okay around and then I'm going drop back
on the M

278
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
on the M
 

279
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:18,189
on the M
okay so I'm here

280
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:18,199

447
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,470
don't I don't want to show it cuz it's
even greater because the target is even

448
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
even greater because the target is even
 

449
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,870
even greater because the target is even
more vulnerable when you're here on the

450
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
more vulnerable when you're here on the
 

451
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,189
more vulnerable when you're here on the
head so I'll move it back a little but

it's the same thing he'd have more
 

455
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,069
it's the same thing he'd have more
Buckle right and this would be more bent

456
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:55,079
Buckle right and this would be more bent
 

457
