55
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,910
move with him the angles
crisscross do you see if i put the angle

56
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
crisscross do you see if i put the angle
 

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,350
crisscross do you see if i put the angle
where i was

58
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
where i was
 

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,830
where i was
i would miss so shiro tencon

60
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
i would miss so shiro tencon
 

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,869
i would miss so shiro tencon
is going to use not

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
a creating of distance but a rotational
 

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,990
a creating of distance but a rotational
deviation that's going to require that

66
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
seek contact initially
 

127
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,789

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,390
okay uh also that's not biomechanically
sound

198
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
sound
 

199
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,670
sound
my majority of my mass is far from my

200
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
my majority of my mass is far from my
 

201
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,710
my majority of my mass is far from my
weapon and that's the target the elbow

202
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
weapon and that's the target the elbow
 

203
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,189
weapon and that's the target the elbow
joint

204
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
joint
 

205
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,029
joint
is you got a joint in the middle of the

206
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
is you got a joint in the middle of the
 

207
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,950
is you got a joint in the middle of the
lever that's a weak point too so there's

208
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
lever that's a weak point too so there's
 

209
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,790
lever that's a weak point too so there's
going to be energy leakage there and

210
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
going to be energy leakage there and
 

211
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,309
going to be energy leakage there and
probably an injury so my hand will come

212
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
probably an injury so my hand will come
 

213
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,670
probably an injury so my hand will come
up

214
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
up
 

215
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,790
up
up the center line and i'm going to use

216
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
up the center line and i'm going to use
 

217
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,830
up the center line and i'm going to use
my body

218
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
my body
 

219
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,150
my body
to change whatever angle that i might

220
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
to change whatever angle that i might
 

221
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,830
to change whatever angle that i might
need but i don't make my hand go to the

222
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
need but i don't make my hand go to the
 

223
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,150
need but i don't make my hand go to the
side

224
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
side
 

225
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,550
side
so my hand comes up and then my elbow

226
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
so my hand comes up and then my elbow
 

227
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,350
so my hand comes up and then my elbow
drops

228
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
drops
 

229
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,070
drops
in and then my body my body

230
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080

 

231
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:57,350

my whole body is hitting

233
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,469

10 card okay so this part's all the same

234
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
10 card okay so this part's all the same
 

235
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,589
10 card okay so this part's all the same
i'll come up i see

236
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
i'll come up i see
 

237
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,390
i'll come up i see
contact all right i'm going to shift

238
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400
contact all right i'm going to shift
 

239
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,510
contact all right i'm going to shift
weight onto

240
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
weight onto
 

241
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,230
weight onto
a single pivot point and i'm going to

242
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
a single pivot point and i'm going to
 

243
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,029
a single pivot point and i'm going to
rotate

244
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
rotate
 

245
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,150
rotate
and so i'll be inside of that strike

246
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
and so i'll be inside of that strike
 

247
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,309
and so i'll be inside of that strike
and then this isn't anything this is

248
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
and then this isn't anything this is
 

249
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,350
and then this isn't anything this is
just me getting a new vector of attack

250
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
just me getting a new vector of attack
 

251
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,350
just me getting a new vector of attack
okay so uh i'll shift onto the single

252
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
okay so uh i'll shift onto the single
 

253
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,430
okay so uh i'll shift onto the single
pivot point so there's no no weight on

254
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
pivot point so there's no no weight on
 

255
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,150
pivot point so there's no no weight on

this foot
 

257
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,469

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,949
um and you're painting the picture
you're like i'm making him go

295
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,509

so as we're going up i'm adhering to the

296
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
so as we're going up i'm adhering to the
 

297

movement
it's gonna do me different different

300
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
it's gonna do me different different
 

301
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,750
it's gonna do me different different
things okay

302
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
things okay
 

303
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,670
things okay
the first thing is i actually have a

304
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
the first thing is i actually have a
 

305
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,310
the first thing is i actually have a
check if i'm on the inside and i want to

306
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
check if i'm on the inside and i want to
 

307
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,150
check if i'm on the inside and i want to
stay on the inside of his hand

308
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
stay on the inside of his hand
 

309
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,990
stay on the inside of his hand
i don't want to go on the outside of his

310
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
i don't want to go on the outside of his
 

311
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,829
i don't want to go on the outside of his
hand

312
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
hand
 

313
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,190
hand
so i have to stay perpendicular to my

314
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
so i have to stay perpendicular to my
 

315
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,030
so i have to stay perpendicular to my
angle of cancellation

316
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040

 

317
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,630

not go over it he can hug me and all

318
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
not go over it he can hug me and all
 

319
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,230
not go over it he can hug me and all
kinds of stuff

320
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
kinds of stuff
 

321
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,230
kinds of stuff
keep him on the outside if i'm on the

322
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
keep him on the outside if i'm on the
 

323
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,949
keep him on the outside if i'm on the
inside so i'm on the inside

324
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959

 

325
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,030

i'm on the inside

326
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040

 

327
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:50,389

i'm on the inside

328
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399

 

329
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,269

so then when i'm on the inside like this

330
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
so then when i'm on the inside like this
 

331
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,150
so then when i'm on the inside like this
instead of

332
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
instead of
 

333
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,269
instead of
tilting him i just let his strike keep

334
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
tilting him i just let his strike keep
 

335
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,829
tilting him i just let his strike keep
going into the

336
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839
going into the
 

337
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,430
going into the
technique when you tilt him you're

338
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
technique when you tilt him you're
 

339
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,030
technique when you tilt him you're
trying to change the direction of the

340
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
trying to change the direction of the
 

341
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,350
trying to change the direction of the
strike

342
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
strike
 

343
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,430
strike
well his strike's coming here boom

344
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
well his strike's coming here boom
 

345
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,110
well his strike's coming here boom
now i'm just staying inside of that

346
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
now i'm just staying inside of that
 

347
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,069
now i'm just staying inside of that
okay next thing is when i if i use i

348
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:18,079
okay next thing is when i if i use i
 

349
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,590
okay next thing is when i if i use i
like the adhesion rather than an

350
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
like the adhesion rather than an
 

351
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,949
like the adhesion rather than an
external check

352
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
external check
 

353
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,870
external check
just just kind of hang and just kind of

354
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
just just kind of hang and just kind of
 

355
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,230
just just kind of hang and just kind of
hang out uh

356
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
hang out uh
 

357
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,310
hang out uh
you can affect his balance more

358
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320

 

359
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,389

much more than you go and you're just

360
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
much more than you go and you're just
 

361
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,230
much more than you go and you're just
trying to cut this down

362
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
trying to cut this down
 

363
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,190
trying to cut this down
okay so instead i'm i'm blending with

364
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
okay so instead i'm i'm blending with
 

365
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,790
okay so instead i'm i'm blending with
this energy and i just keep

366
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
this energy and i just keep
 

367
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,990
this energy and i just keep
extending that into the stripe into his

368
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
extending that into the stripe into his
 

369
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,710
extending that into the stripe into his
strike

370
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
strike
 

371
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:55,670
strike
he will send in the indigestion

372
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680

 

373
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,230

so standing the that hands there this

374
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
so standing the that hands there this
 

375
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,829
so standing the that hands there this
time this is coming in

376
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
time this is coming in
 

377
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,550
time this is coming in
boom

378
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560

 

379
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,030

boom so i'll keep doing it but you're

380
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
boom so i'll keep doing it but you're
 

381
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:36,629
boom so i'll keep doing it but you're
watching the checking hats

382
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639

 

383
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,870

okay so let's again look at the checking

384
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
okay so let's again look at the checking
 

385
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,670
okay so let's again look at the checking
hand

386
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
hand
 

387
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,389
hand
okay so he's going up i reach out to get

388
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
okay so he's going up i reach out to get
 

389
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,069
okay so he's going up i reach out to get
him now he's going to drop his elbow

390
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
him now he's going to drop his elbow
 

391
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:44,710
him now he's going to drop his elbow
inside

392
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
inside
 

393
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,470
inside
it's going to be inward pressure right

394
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
it's going to be inward pressure right
 

395
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,949
it's going to be inward pressure right
there we're going to go really slow

396
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
there we're going to go really slow
 

397
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,190
there we're going to go really slow
okay so as i feel his inner pressure

398
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
okay so as i feel his inner pressure
 

399
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,990
okay so as i feel his inner pressure
that's when i start

400
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
that's when i start
 

401
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,310
that's when i start
yielding on this foot do you see that's

402
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
yielding on this foot do you see that's
 

403
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,190
yielding on this foot do you see that's
going to

404
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,200
going to
 

405
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,910
going to
stop that's go back that's going to

406
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
stop that's go back that's going to
 

407
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,030
stop that's go back that's going to
decide

408
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
decide
 

409
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,829
decide
uh that oh i'm going to a shield tank on

410
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
uh that oh i'm going to a shield tank on
 

411
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,949
uh that oh i'm going to a shield tank on
okay

412
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
okay
 

413
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,990
okay
so i'm over here and at a certain

414
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
so i'm over here and at a certain
 

415
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,949
so i'm over here and at a certain
point as i rotate into this i can't go

416
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
point as i rotate into this i can't go
 

417
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,389
point as i rotate into this i can't go
anymore and i feel

418
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
anymore and i feel
 

419
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,990
anymore and i feel
that pressure now on me so that's when i

420
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
that pressure now on me so that's when i
 

421
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,269
that pressure now on me so that's when i
go ahead and step back so you're still

422
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
go ahead and step back so you're still
 

423
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,190
go ahead and step back so you're still
doing the yielding strategy

424
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
doing the yielding strategy
 

425
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,790
doing the yielding strategy
okay so i'm going up his pressure is

426
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
okay so i'm going up his pressure is
 

427
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,269
okay so i'm going up his pressure is
coming

428
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
coming
 

429
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,310
coming
in so i will shift weight that's me

430
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
in so i will shift weight that's me
 

431
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,069
in so i will shift weight that's me
moving in the same direction you don't

432
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
moving in the same direction you don't
 

433
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,550
moving in the same direction you don't
have to

434
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
have to
 

435
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,030
have to
tilt your head i'm still moving in the

436
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
tilt your head i'm still moving in the
 

437
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,230
tilt your head i'm still moving in the
same direction

438
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
same direction
 

439
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,350
same direction
as his weapon is i'm going to rotate and

440
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
as his weapon is i'm going to rotate and
 

441
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,829
as his weapon is i'm going to rotate and
now

442
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,839
now
 

443
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,310
now
here i can't go i can't turn anymore and

444
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
here i can't go i can't turn anymore and
 

445
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,310
here i can't go i can't turn anymore and
that's when my foot will move and yield

446
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
that's when my foot will move and yield
 

447
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,310
that's when my foot will move and yield
again

448
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
again
 

449
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,030
again
okay so again up that's the first yield

450
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
okay so again up that's the first yield
 

451
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,990
okay so again up that's the first yield
i'm done rotating and that is exactly

452
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
i'm done rotating and that is exactly
 

453
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,629
i'm done rotating and that is exactly
where the

454
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
where the
 

455
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,829
where the
sheet of tank happens

456
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
sheet of tank happens
 

457
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,350
sheet of tank happens
long shift rotate

458
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
long shift rotate
 

459
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,829
long shift rotate
then i can't rotate anymore i can't

460
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
then i can't rotate anymore i can't
 

461
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,189
then i can't rotate anymore i can't
rotate anymore

462
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
rotate anymore
 

463
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,670
rotate anymore
so that's he's now still pushing on me

464
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
so that's he's now still pushing on me
 

465
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,470
so that's he's now still pushing on me
and that's where the

466
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
and that's where the
 

467
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,389
and that's where the
tank on happens okay but

468
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
tank on happens okay but
 

469
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,829
tank on happens okay but
watch how i'm using my inward and hours

470
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839
watch how i'm using my inward and hours
 

471
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:15,990
watch how i'm using my inward and hours
spirals

472
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
spirals
 

473
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,350
spirals
my hand is not straight

474
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
my hand is not straight
 

475
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,550
my hand is not straight
out trying to do this thing

476
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
out trying to do this thing
 

477
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,310
out trying to do this thing
all of the yielding is happening also

478
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
all of the yielding is happening also
 

479
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,670
all of the yielding is happening also
with my spirals so

480
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
with my spirals so
 

481
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,829
with my spirals so
i'm going to show you he's going to come

482
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:31,839
i'm going to show you he's going to come
 

483
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,590
i'm going to show you he's going to come
in and when i feel the pressure

484
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
in and when i feel the pressure
 

485
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,670
in and when i feel the pressure
you see how as i rotate

486
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680

 

487
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,629

i can take that pressure off so i'm not

488
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
i can take that pressure off so i'm not
 

489
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,509
i can take that pressure off so i'm not
here

490
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519
here
 

491
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,269
here
and just moving out of the way

492
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
and just moving out of the way
 

493
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,230
and just moving out of the way
my arm itself is going through its own

494
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
my arm itself is going through its own
 

495
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,710
my arm itself is going through its own
yin phases

496
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
yin phases
 

497
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,110
yin phases
as it's going through the inward spiral

498
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
as it's going through the inward spiral
 

499
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,829
as it's going through the inward spiral
womb

500
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
womb
 

501
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,870
womb
i feel you'll feel that pressure turn

502
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
i feel you'll feel that pressure turn
 

503
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,310
i feel you'll feel that pressure turn
inside of it so

504
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
inside of it so
 

505
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,870
inside of it so
boom turn

506
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880

 

507
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,110

not one two i had no awareness of that

508
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
not one two i had no awareness of that
 

509
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,509
not one two i had no awareness of that
or worse boom

510
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:13,519
or worse boom
 

511
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,590
or worse boom
come up and rotate inside of it

512
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600

 

513
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,629

boom you see you can do this here past

514
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:22,639
boom you see you can do this here past
 

515
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,629
boom you see you can do this here past
that same

516
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
that same
 

517
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:33,269
that same
um i passed the contention point

518
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279

 

519
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,269

so pay attention how this hand is

520
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
so pay attention how this hand is
 

521
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,470
so pay attention how this hand is
rotating palm

522
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
rotating palm
 

523
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,550
rotating palm
towards me then out

524
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,560

 

525
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,509

even if i start here i'm cognizant that

526
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
even if i start here i'm cognizant that
 

527
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,790
even if i start here i'm cognizant that
i can rotate this hand

528
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,800
i can rotate this hand
 

529
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,470
i can rotate this hand
it's almost the opposite because you

530
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
it's almost the opposite because you
 

531
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,310
it's almost the opposite because you
want to go this way

532
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320
want to go this way
 

533
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,910
want to go this way
and i'm actually going this way

534
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
and i'm actually going this way
 

535
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,470
and i'm actually going this way
the other side my hands going this

536
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480

 

537
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:18,710

inside from this thing this way

538
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720

 

539
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:26,870

use your spirals

540
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880

 

541
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,990

the more your spirals are yielding boom

542
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
the more your spirals are yielding boom
 

543
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,069
the more your spirals are yielding boom
then the more less deviation you

544
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,079
then the more less deviation you
 

545
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,110
then the more less deviation you
actually need

546
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
actually need
 

547
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,829
actually need
the less time you need is this a

548
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
the less time you need is this a
 

549
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:50,150
the less time you need is this a
redundant system

550
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
redundant system
 

551
00:16:50,160 --> 00:17:07,590
redundant system
you guys see how much is taking off

552
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600

 

553
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,559

okay
