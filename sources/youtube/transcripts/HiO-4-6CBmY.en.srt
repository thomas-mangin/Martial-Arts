each weapon has two qualities

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:03,760
each weapon has two qualities
 

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,190
each weapon has two qualities
and they share one quality among them

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
and they share one quality among them
 

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,749
and they share one quality among them
so the vulcan's individual quality

6
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:11,759
so the vulcan's individual quality
 

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:28,230
so the vulcan's individual quality
is slightness and quickness

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,240

 

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,709

it's second quality is sticky

10
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719

 

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:01:00,389

it sticks

12
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399

 

13
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,430

joe's individual quality

14
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
joe's individual quality
 

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,830
joe's individual quality
is heavy not like great

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,840

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,109

heavy and the shared quality

20
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
heavy and the shared quality
 

21
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:41,030
heavy and the shared quality
sticky sticky

22
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
sticky sticky
 

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,510
sticky sticky
so

anymore it's a ballistic takedown it's a
 

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,430
anymore it's a ballistic takedown it's a
ballistic throw

91
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,350

so your footwork is off

93
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,630

oh i have to shift and then

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
oh i have to shift and then
 

95
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:58,830
oh i have to shift and then
hit this angle but this stays over my

then next thing don't let your uk stay

you can go slow but you go full

so that part probably
 

109
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,430

is a little pain compliance but it's
