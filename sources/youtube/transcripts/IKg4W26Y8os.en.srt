225
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,830

00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:54,360
generate the grace State and you do that

specific so we we did eeko and we did
 

347
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,630
specific so we we did eeko and we did
kokun and uh we're going

348
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
kokun and uh we're going
 

349
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,269
kokun and uh we're going
to uh up the spinal displacement and

350
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:20,279
to uh up the spinal displacement and
 

351
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,190
to uh up the spinal displacement and
that's that's what I want you to do for

352
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
that's that's what I want you to do for
 

353
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,030
that's that's what I want you to do for
your own Discovery learning and watch

354
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,040
your own Discovery learning and watch
 

355
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,069
your own Discovery learning and watch
your Technique go out the window

356
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:29,079
your Technique go out the window
 

357
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:32,430
your Technique go out the window
because say it is a harder Marshall

358
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:32,440
because say it is a harder Marshall
 

359
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,590
because say it is a harder Marshall
problem to

360
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:34,600
problem to
 

361
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,829
problem to
solve all right so we

362
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:39,839

 

363
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,269

have we have e

364
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
have we have e
 

365
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:50,470
have we have e
from

366
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480

 

367
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,949

okay go your

368
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:55,959

 

369
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:58,310

home that's what's going to happen every

370
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
home that's what's going to happen every
 

371
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,750
home that's what's going to happen every
time and he has a lot of skill but this

372
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
time and he has a lot of skill but this
 

373
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,069
time and he has a lot of skill but this
is harder okay and you can feel the

374
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:05,079
is harder okay and you can feel the
 

375
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:10,230
is harder okay and you can feel the
bracing angle the shortness of it okay

376
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
bracing angle the shortness of it okay
 

377
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,110
bracing angle the shortness of it okay
um and that's just with

378
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
um and that's just with
 

379
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,190
um and that's just with
katak um

380
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200

 

381
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,630

so if your UK goes out off the line and

382
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
so if your UK goes out off the line and
 

383
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,110
so if your UK goes out off the line and
you're I'm sorry your Nog goes out off

384
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
you're I'm sorry your Nog goes out off
 

385
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,670
you're I'm sorry your Nog goes out off
the line and your

386
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
the line and your
 

387
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,829
the line and your
UK did not go go blasting

388
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839
UK did not go go blasting
 

389
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,430
UK did not go go blasting
in then they weren't spinally displacing

390
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:34,440
in then they weren't spinally displacing
 

391
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,629
in then they weren't spinally displacing
there just no way

392
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:36,639
there just no way
 

393
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,710
there just no way
okay

394
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
okay
 

395
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,509
okay
um so we're going to play with that you

396
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
um so we're going to play with that you
 

397
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:58,230
um so we're going to play with that you
guys play with it okay uh let's get it

398
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240

 

399
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:40,160

going e

400
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,170

 

401
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:58,790

[Music]

402
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800

 

403
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,790

Okay so so you

404
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:03,800

 

405
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,750

no on the first one your elbow back

406
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
no on the first one your elbow back
 

407
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,310
no on the first one your elbow back
smash the only reason my elbows got

408
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
smash the only reason my elbows got
 

409
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,870
smash the only reason my elbows got
smash is I'm pushing up

410
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:13,880
smash is I'm pushing up
 

411
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,509
smash is I'm pushing up
him you then reacted to it don't get

412
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
him you then reacted to it don't get
 

413
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,430
him you then reacted to it don't get
smashed with now you're jerking out of

414
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
smashed with now you're jerking out of
 

415
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,870
smashed with now you're jerking out of
there cuz you're like go faster the

416
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
there cuz you're like go faster the
 

417
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,110
there cuz you're like go faster the
window's smaller you get it's all it's

418
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,120
window's smaller you get it's all it's
 

419
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,430
window's smaller you get it's all it's
all

420
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
all
 

421
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,790
all
illusion because he he's pushing where

422
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
illusion because he he's pushing where
 

423
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,910
illusion because he he's pushing where
it doesn't matter it never mattered it

424
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
it doesn't matter it never mattered it
 

425
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,389
it doesn't matter it never mattered it
never

426
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:33,399
never
 

427
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,710
never
mattered you understand do you get what

428
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:35,720
mattered you understand do you get what
 

429
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,949
mattered you understand do you get what
I mean by I said it doesn't matter cuz

430
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
I mean by I said it doesn't matter cuz
 

431
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,910
I mean by I said it doesn't matter cuz
it's going in me right okay so you just

432
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:42,920
it's going in me right okay so you just
 

433
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,670
it's going in me right okay so you just
like you could stop everything you can

434
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
like you could stop everything you can
 

435
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,350
like you could stop everything you can
stop everything you can decide how much

436
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:48,360
stop everything you can decide how much
 

437
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,949
stop everything you can decide how much
he he

438
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:51,959

 

439
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,430

moved and because that doesn't matter

440
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
moved and because that doesn't matter
 

441
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,069
moved and because that doesn't matter
this doesn't matter either

442
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079

 

443
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,269

which is why as you watch it doesn't

444
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
which is why as you watch it doesn't
 

445
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,350
which is why as you watch it doesn't
look like he's driving and maybe those

446
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:06,360
look like he's driving and maybe those
 

447
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,910
look like he's driving and maybe those
at patreon they also think he's not

448
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:08,920
at patreon they also think he's not
 

449
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,430
at patreon they also think he's not
driving because it doesn't look like he

450
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
driving because it doesn't look like he
 

451
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,269
driving because it doesn't look like he
is but he is

452
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:14,279
is but he is
 

453
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,629
is but he is
okay um and then the difference

454
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
okay um and then the difference
 

455
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,990
okay um and then the difference
is as it doesn't matter I can I control

456
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
is as it doesn't matter I can I control
 

457
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,790
is as it doesn't matter I can I control
the rate that he's going this is where I

458
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
the rate that he's going this is where I
 

459
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,269
the rate that he's going this is where I
this is where I was doing so here you're

460
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
this is where I was doing so here you're
 

461
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,310
this is where I was doing so here you're
trying

462
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:29,320
trying
 

463
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,870
trying
to get to his speed but you want to

464
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:31,880
to get to his speed but you want to
 

465
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,470
to get to his speed but you want to
control the rate that he's go that he's

466
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480
control the rate that he's go that he's
 

467
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,750
control the rate that he's go that he's
going you see so you don't go late got

468
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:37,760
going you see so you don't go late got
 

469
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,509
going you see so you don't go late got
to go faster you don't you don't do that

470
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:40,519
to go faster you don't you don't do that
 

471
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,750
to go faster you don't you don't do that
you make

472
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
you make
 

473
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,710
you make
connection okay and so you could slow

474
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
connection okay and so you could slow
 

475
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,949
connection okay and so you could slow
him down to a stop where it doesn't look

476
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
him down to a stop where it doesn't look
 

477
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,790
him down to a stop where it doesn't look
like he's driving at all okay and so as

478
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:51,800
like he's driving at all okay and so as
 

479
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,870
like he's driving at all okay and so as
it doesn't look like he's

480
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:53,880
it doesn't look like he's
 

481
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:00,069
it doesn't look like he's
driving um likewise if he's pushing

482
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
driving um likewise if he's pushing
 

483
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,710
driving um likewise if he's pushing
and I can do it it's the technique gets

484
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:03,720
and I can do it it's the technique gets
 

485
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,110
and I can do it it's the technique gets
easier because that's the Tactical

486
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,120
easier because that's the Tactical
 

487
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,990
easier because that's the Tactical
opening for the technique it doesn't get

488
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,000
opening for the technique it doesn't get
 

489
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,030
opening for the technique it doesn't get
harder it gets easier but if I can't do

490
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,040
harder it gets easier but if I can't do
 

491
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,509
harder it gets easier but if I can't do
the internals it does get harder okay

492
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
the internals it does get harder okay
 

493
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,389
the internals it does get harder okay
and I won't know that

494
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:17,399
and I won't know that
 

495
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,949
and I won't know that
unless I task him with it okay and so it

496
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:22,959
unless I task him with it okay and so it
 

497
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,949
unless I task him with it okay and so it
he he goes the technique gets easier all

498
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:25,959
he he goes the technique gets easier all
 

499
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,590
he he goes the technique gets easier all
the forces get

500
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
the forces get
 

501
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,470
the forces get
easier because y value goes up the Y

502
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:31,480
easier because y value goes up the Y
 

503
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,150
easier because y value goes up the Y
value goes

504
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,160
value goes
 

505
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,389
value goes
up everything gets

506
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:35,399
up everything gets
 

507
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,829
up everything gets
easier okay that's what we're trying to

508
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
easier okay that's what we're trying to
 

509
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,949
easier okay that's what we're trying to
get

510
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
get
 

511
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,990
get

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,230
throws there is what I call an inertial
throw which I do mostly if I do them I

686
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:47,240
throw which I do mostly if I do them I
 

687
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,549
throw which I do mostly if I do them I
do them in

688
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:48,559
do them in
 

689
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,350
do them in
guaza but if I'm teaching and I'm trying

690
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:52,360
guaza but if I'm teaching and I'm trying
 

691
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,750
guaza but if I'm teaching and I'm trying
to get the whole system into my dashing

692
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
to get the whole system into my dashing
 

693
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,230
to get the whole system into my dashing
we use the x pattern and we utilize the

694
00:19:59,230 --> 00:19:59,240
we use the x pattern and we utilize the
 

695
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,789
we use the x pattern and we utilize the
base displacement because it requires

696
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
base displacement because it requires
 

697
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,789
base displacement because it requires
more ground vectoring and mid and

698
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:05,799
more ground vectoring and mid and
 

699
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,029
more ground vectoring and mid and
midfoot

700
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:07,039

701
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,590
midfoot
weighting uh timing so we're going to do

702
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:10,600
weighting uh timing so we're going to do
 

703
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,590
weighting uh timing so we're going to do
that but this not the only way of

704
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:12,600
that but this not the only way of
 

705
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,990
that but this not the only way of
throwing someone into the rear inward or

706
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,000
throwing someone into the rear inward or
 

707
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,110
throwing someone into the rear inward or
rear

708
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120

outward you can generate an x pattern so

710
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:21,640
outward you can generate an x pattern so
 

711
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,029
outward you can generate an x pattern so
to speak

712
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:24,039
to speak
 

713
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:27,149
to speak
inertially where you use the forward

714
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:27,159
inertially where you use the forward
 

715
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,149
inertially where you use the forward
momentum of the their

716
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:30,159
momentum of the their
 

717
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,549
momentum of the their
assault to prevent the feet from going

718
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
assault to prevent the feet from going
 

719
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,710
assault to prevent the feet from going
backwards so that they cannot put their

720
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:37,720
backwards so that they cannot put their
 

721
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,909
backwards so that they cannot put their
base of support back under their line of

722
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:40,919
base of support back under their line of
 

723
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,390
base of support back under their line of
gravity so I don't have the problem we

724
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:45,400
gravity so I don't have the problem we
 

725
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,870
gravity so I don't have the problem we
always raise with the acceleration throw

726
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
always raise with the acceleration throw
 

727
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,110
always raise with the acceleration throw
if I Tas them going forward they can't

728
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,120
if I Tas them going forward they can't
 

729
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,549
if I Tas them going forward they can't
step going

730
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:53,559
step going
 

731
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,549
step going
backwards not possible just as if I step

732
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:57,559
backwards not possible just as if I step
 

733
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,990
backwards not possible just as if I step
behind their leg

734
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
behind their leg
 

735
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,029
behind their leg
they can't step going

736
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:04,039

 

737
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,710

backwards so when we

738
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
backwards so when we
 

739
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,390
backwards so when we
do a chin strike throw for

740
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
do a chin strike throw for
 

741
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,909
do a chin strike throw for
example you have to have all this in

742
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
example you have to have all this in
 

743
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,590
example you have to have all this in
mind and the two types of

744
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,600
mind and the two types of
 

745
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,830
mind and the two types of
ukemi are if we take the x pattern with

746
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
ukemi are if we take the x pattern with
 

747
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,590
ukemi are if we take the x pattern with
the spinal displacement you have to do

748
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:24,600
the spinal displacement you have to do
 

749
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,149
the spinal displacement you have to do
the Contracting Center back brake P but

750
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,159
the Contracting Center back brake P but
 

751
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,149
the Contracting Center back brake P but
if we do the

752
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
if we do the
 

753
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,310
if we do the
inertial displacement you you have to

754
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:33,320
inertial displacement you you have to
 

755
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,549
inertial displacement you you have to
slide forward there's no way you you're

756
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:35,559
slide forward there's no way you you're
 

757
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,710
slide forward there's no way you you're
going to slide forward because you're

758
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
going to slide forward because you're
 

759
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,230
going to slide forward because you're
going to be coming forward okay uh and

760
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
going to be coming forward okay uh and
 

761
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,909
going to be coming forward okay uh and
that's what's happening in this thrum

762
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:42,919
that's what's happening in this thrum
 

763
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:45,630
that's what's happening in this thrum
okay so

764
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:45,640
okay so
 

765
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:53,630
okay so
uh let us trade the

766
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:53,640

 

767
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,710

camera and let us look at what this

768
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:57,720
camera and let us look at what this
 

769
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,350
camera and let us look at what this
means okay

770
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,360
means okay
 

771
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,710
means okay
okay also use this north south line on

772
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:02,720
okay also use this north south line on
 

773
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,269
okay also use this north south line on
the mat Chris go over there at that end

774
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:05,279
the mat Chris go over there at that end
 

775
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,029
the mat Chris go over there at that end
you see this mat between this okay and

776
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
you see this mat between this okay and
 

777
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,110
you see this mat between this okay and
uh I'll just show it not from The Kino

778
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
uh I'll just show it not from The Kino
 

779
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,070
uh I'll just show it not from The Kino
nag because that doesn't really change

780
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,080
nag because that doesn't really change
 

781
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:19,510
nag because that doesn't really change
anything okay if we plot his spine in

782
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520

 

783
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,590

space I don't want to

784
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:22,600
space I don't want to
 

785
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,510
space I don't want to
enter and then shove his head

786
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520

 

787
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,590

backwards because as you saw him do he

788
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:31,600
backwards because as you saw him do he
 

789
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,390
backwards because as you saw him do he
would just walk his base of

790
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
would just walk his base of
 

791
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,789
would just walk his base of
support back under his line of gravity

792
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:37,799
support back under his line of gravity
 

793
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:41,470
support back under his line of gravity
and neutralize the kazushi angle the

794
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:41,480
and neutralize the kazushi angle the
 

795
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,029
and neutralize the kazushi angle the
angle disturbance from the strik on his

796
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,039
angle disturbance from the strik on his
 

797
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,510
angle disturbance from the strik on his
chin what happens in most iido land is

798
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:48,520
chin what happens in most iido land is
 

799
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,190
chin what happens in most iido land is
for some reason he pins his feet there

800
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:52,200
for some reason he pins his feet there
 

801
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,430
for some reason he pins his feet there
and I get to push his chin back far

802
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
and I get to push his chin back far
 

803
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,590
and I get to push his chin back far
enough to where it makes sense for his

804
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:58,600
enough to where it makes sense for his
 

805
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,669
enough to where it makes sense for his
body to fall but what never makes sense

806
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
body to fall but what never makes sense
 

807
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,830
body to fall but what never makes sense
is why did you leave your feet

808
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:03,840
is why did you leave your feet
 

809
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,110
is why did you leave your feet
there okay and so you can see there's

810
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,120
there okay and so you can see there's
 

811
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,669
there okay and so you can see there's
nothing I'm doing to stop him from

812
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:10,679
nothing I'm doing to stop him from
 

813
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,990
nothing I'm doing to stop him from
moving his feet back with

814
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,000
moving his feet back with
 

815
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,029
moving his feet back with
him in which case his line of gravity

816
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:16,039
him in which case his line of gravity
 

817
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,789
him in which case his line of gravity
will never fall out of his face of

818
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:17,799
will never fall out of his face of
 

819
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:21,269
will never fall out of his face of
support and there's no reason to fall

820
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:21,279
support and there's no reason to fall
 

821
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,190
support and there's no reason to fall
okay now you could make this a full-on

822
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,200
okay now you could make this a full-on
 

823
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,789
okay now you could make this a full-on
palm heel strike but that's not a throw

824
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:28,799
palm heel strike but that's not a throw
 

825
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,590
palm heel strike but that's not a throw
that's an attempt at

826
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:30,600
that's an attempt at
 

827
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,070
that's an attempt at
unconsciousness then you get lights out

828
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
unconsciousness then you get lights out
 

829
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,630
unconsciousness then you get lights out
and he will fall okay but that's not the

830
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:37,640
and he will fall okay but that's not the
 

831
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,750
and he will fall okay but that's not the
technique so what I'm saying here is you

832
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:42,760
technique so what I'm saying here is you
 

833
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,789
technique so what I'm saying here is you
can do this technique with the spinal

834
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:45,799
can do this technique with the spinal
 

835
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,110
can do this technique with the spinal
displacement so I've come out and I'll

836
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,120
displacement so I've come out and I'll
 

837
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,950
displacement so I've come out and I'll
move this

838
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960

 

839
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,870

way now he can't step

840
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
way now he can't step
 

841
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,149
way now he can't step
there and this is what what we've done a

842
00:23:59,149 --> 00:23:59,159
there and this is what what we've done a
 

843
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:02,390
there and this is what what we've done a
lot of so

844
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
lot of so
 

845
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,430
lot of so
w attacking the leg

846
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
w attacking the leg
 

847
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,350
w attacking the leg
okay

848
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
okay
 

849
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,549
okay
um let's do that same side from this

850
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559

00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:37,679
base the AR the hand on the head is
 

861
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,830
base the AR the hand on the head is
doing the same pattern we always do for

862

doing the same pattern we always do for
 

863
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,630
doing the same pattern we always do for
the back outward so that means don't

864
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:44,640
the back outward so that means don't
 

865
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,830

version okay so I just asked I they just
felt my technique Taylor felt it as the

886
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,200
felt my technique Taylor felt it as the
 

887
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,750

uko and I just threw Chris and I I asked

888
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:28,760
uko and I just threw Chris and I I asked
 

889
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,510
uko and I just threw Chris and I I asked
them what did you feel in my technique

890
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:31,520
them what did you feel in my technique
 

891
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,070
them what did you feel in my technique
and Chris is

892
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,080
and Chris is
 

893
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,710

and so let's pay attention to that part
 

901
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,669
and so let's pay attention to that part
that is very important

902
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:50,679

 

903
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:56,789

okay okay so if you look at the first

904
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:56,799
okay okay so if you look at the first
 

905
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,549
okay okay so if you look at the first
version which is just totally wrong when

906
00:25:59,549 --> 00:25:59,559
version which is just totally wrong when
 

907
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,230
version which is just totally wrong when
I shove him he would feel that strength

908
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:03,240
I shove him he would feel that strength
 

909
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,909
I shove him he would feel that strength
you feel that that's what doesn't feel

910
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:05,919
you feel that that's what doesn't feel
 

911
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,029
you feel that that's what doesn't feel
soft okay and if you look at

912
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:10,039
soft okay and if you look at
 

913
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:14,669
soft okay and if you look at
it it's because there is a there's an

914
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:14,679
it it's because there is a there's an
 

915
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:18,549
it it's because there is a there's an
inertia meaning his body is right now at

916
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:18,559
inertia meaning his body is right now at
 

917
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,630
inertia meaning his body is right now at
rest and when I push it I am contesting

918
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:23,640
rest and when I push it I am contesting
 

919
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,029
rest and when I push it I am contesting
the restfulness of that position and

920
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:27,039
the restfulness of that position and
 

921
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:32,630
the restfulness of that position and
that feels not soft to the UK

922
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:32,640

 

923
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,230

okay um what I have to do instead is
 

941
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,149
okay um what I have to do instead is
through the internalization control the

942
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:08,159
through the internalization control the
 

943
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,269
through the internalization control the
rate at which he's able to come forward

944
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:11,279
rate at which he's able to come forward
 

945
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,430
rate at which he's able to come forward
okay so excuse

946

00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,389
this line right there almost a full 2
m you you first touched his head at at

1016
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:08,399
m you you first touched his head at at
 

1017
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,990
m you you first touched his head at at
this line and

1018
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,000
this line and
 

1019
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,149
this line and
then you let go of his head at this line

1020
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:15,159
then you let go of his head at this line
 

1021
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:18,750
then you let go of his head at this line
so you you push back 2 MERS do you get

1022
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:18,760
so you you push back 2 MERS do you get
 

1023
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,070
so you you push back 2 MERS do you get
that and I'm not sure where I go but it

1024
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,080
that and I'm not sure where I go but it
 

1025
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,549
that and I'm not sure where I go but it
starts to look like you're

1026
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:25,559
starts to look like you're
 

1027
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:28,710
starts to look like you're
pushing him okay so

1028
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:28,720
pushing him okay so
 

1029
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,909
pushing him okay so
you you got his head here you see and

1030
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:32,919
you you got his head here you see and
 

1031
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,630
you you got his head here you see and
then you pushed his

1032
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:35,640
then you pushed his
 

1033
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,669
then you pushed his
head to this line

1034
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:39,679
head to this line
 

1035
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,110
head to this line
right and when I that to

1036
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,120
right and when I that to
 

1037
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,350
right and when I that to
me it starts to go Yong it starts to go

1038
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:46,360
me it starts to go Yong it starts to go
 

1039
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,669
me it starts to go Yong it starts to go
Yong you see and what I'm going to do

1040
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:48,679
Yong you see and what I'm going to do
 

1041
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:50,710
Yong you see and what I'm going to do
here is go this

1042
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:50,720
here is go this
 

1043
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,710
here is go this
way so I'm on the same neutral Y Line do

1044
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:56,720
way so I'm on the same neutral Y Line do
 

1045
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,110
way so I'm on the same neutral Y Line do
you see that

1046
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,120

 

1047
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,149

so you're

1048
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159
so you're
 

1049
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,710
so you're
here you're all and then you

1050
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:05,720
here you're all and then you
 

1051
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,669
here you're all and then you
went yeah you can I can feel it I can

1052
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:08,679
went yeah you can I can feel it I can
 

1053
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:10,350
went yeah you can I can feel it I can
feel it

1054
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:10,360
feel it
 

1055
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,990
feel it
okay and what I'm going to do instead is

1056
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,000
okay and what I'm going to do instead is
 

1057
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,149
okay and what I'm going to do instead is
be back

1058
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:15,159
be back
 

1059
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:19,190
be back
here and I stay here and my only goal on

1060
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,200
here and I stay here and my only goal on
 

1061
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,470
here and I stay here and my only goal on
the spinal

1062
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:20,480
the spinal
 

1063
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,470
the spinal
displacement is

1064
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:22,480
displacement is
 

1065
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,230
displacement is
this right you see that with forward

1066
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:26,240
this right you see that with forward
 

1067
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,230
this right you see that with forward
progress that's your only mark goal your

1068
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:29,240
progress that's your only mark goal your
 

1069
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,590
progress that's your only mark goal your
Martial goal is not to do this and line

1070
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:33,600
Martial goal is not to do this and line
 

1071
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,029
Martial goal is not to do this and line
of Gravity Falls outside

1072
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:37,039
of Gravity Falls outside
 

1073
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,389
of Gravity Falls outside
so boom

1074
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:40,399
so boom
 

1075
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,909
so boom
bo then the leg is

1076
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:42,919
bo then the leg is
 

1077
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:47,190
bo then the leg is
available okay let's try it right all

1078
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,200
available okay let's try it right all
 

1079
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,630
available okay let's try it right all
right so we had Chris try it and all all

1080
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,640
right so we had Chris try it and all all
 

1081
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,430
right so we had Chris try it and all all
he did was come back here and then

1082
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:53,440
he did was come back here and then
 

1083
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,269
he did was come back here and then
shove he kept the line thing but in my

1084
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:57,279
shove he kept the line thing but in my
 

1085
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,629
shove he kept the line thing but in my
description I said all I need is for him

1086
00:30:59,629 --> 00:30:59,639
description I said all I need is for him
 

1087
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:04,190
description I said all I need is for him
to tilt and keep his forward inertia and

1088
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:04,200
to tilt and keep his forward inertia and
 

1089
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,669
to tilt and keep his forward inertia and
so when you shoving him backwards where

1090
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:07,679
so when you shoving him backwards where
 

1091
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,590
so when you shoving him backwards where
it doesn't feel soft anymore he he's not

1092
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:10,600
it doesn't feel soft anymore he he's not
 

1093
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,669
it doesn't feel soft anymore he he's not
still coming forward I'm trying to

1094
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:12,679
still coming forward I'm trying to
 

1095
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:14,909
still coming forward I'm trying to
accelerate his head backwards that's

1096
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:14,919
accelerate his head backwards that's
 

1097
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:18,029
accelerate his head backwards that's
what you're doing instead so instead I'm

1098
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:18,039
what you're doing instead so instead I'm
 

1099
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:21,750
what you're doing instead so instead I'm
I'm using his his y displacement here

1100
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:21,760
I'm using his his y displacement here
 

1101
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:47,110
I'm using his his y displacement here
that's what I'm using to make that go

1102
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,120

 

1103
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,830

go and so you can see as we increase the

1104
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:50,840
go and so you can see as we increase the
 

1105
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,350
go and so you can see as we increase the
the spinal

1106
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:52,360
the spinal
 

1107
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,549
the spinal
displacement the center comes up right

1108
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:56,559
displacement the center comes up right
 

1109
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,149
displacement the center comes up right
did you see that did you see that

1110
00:31:59,149 --> 00:31:59,159
did you see that did you see that
 

1111
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:02,870
did you see that did you see that
the center comes up and now we're

1112
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:02,880
the center comes up and now we're
 

1113
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,430
the center comes up and now we're
doing the same

1114
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:05,440
doing the same
 

1115
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,750
doing the same
throw we always

1116
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:07,760
throw we always
 

1117
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,590
throw we always
do we

1118
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,600
do we
 

1119
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,149
do we
don't accelerate this we let this thing

1120
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:15,159
don't accelerate this we let this thing
 

1121
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:19,710
don't accelerate this we let this thing
start rotating around this way so the

1122
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:19,720
start rotating around this way so the
 

1123
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,830
start rotating around this way so the
legs come up and we start to Circle it

1124
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:23,840
legs come up and we start to Circle it
 

1125
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,789
legs come up and we start to Circle it
around the centrifugal energy as the

1126
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:26,799
around the centrifugal energy as the
 

1127
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,190
around the centrifugal energy as the
legs are coming up going around it

1128
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:29,200
legs are coming up going around it
 

1129
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,430
legs are coming up going around it
starts to bring the head down and that's

1130
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,440
starts to bring the head down and that's
 

1131
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,350
starts to bring the head down and that's
the fall that's the Thro okay and again

1132
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:35,360
the fall that's the Thro okay and again
 

1133
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,549
the fall that's the Thro okay and again
like in the beginning of this video the

1134
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:38,559
like in the beginning of this video the
 

1135
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,070
like in the beginning of this video the
harder it comes in if I'm doing it right

1136
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,080
harder it comes in if I'm doing it right
 

1137
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,110
harder it comes in if I'm doing it right
the easier the technique not the harder

1138
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:44,120
the easier the technique not the harder
 

1139
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,590
the easier the technique not the harder
the technique that's why I'm doing it

1140
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:45,600
the technique that's why I'm doing it
 

1141
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,430
the technique that's why I'm doing it
wrong I'm Yong Ying things okay all

1142
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:48,440
wrong I'm Yong Ying things okay all
 

1143
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,070
wrong I'm Yong Ying things okay all
right so try to try to keep his forward

1144
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,080
right so try to try to keep his forward
 

1145
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,190
right so try to try to keep his forward
progress try to keep letting his Center

1146
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,200
progress try to keep letting his Center
 

1147
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,990
progress try to keep letting his Center
his feet go past you not trying to

1148
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,000
his feet go past you not trying to
 

1149
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,029
his feet go past you not trying to
accelerate the top of that Joe back the

1150
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:02,039
accelerate the top of that Joe back the
 

1151
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,509
accelerate the top of that Joe back the
other way okay all right we're going to

1152
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:04,519
other way okay all right we're going to
 

1153
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:12,350
other way okay all right we're going to
play with it

1154
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:12,360

 

1155
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:26,750

right okay

1156
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:26,760

 

1157
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:59,549

so e

1158
00:33:59,549 --> 00:33:59,559

 

1159
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,509

we going

1160
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:01,519
we going
 

1161
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,710
we going
here cool you see plotted in

1162
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:06,720
here cool you see plotted in
 

1163
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,310
here cool you see plotted in
space got it then it goes

1164
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:12,320

 

1165
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,470

out moved away from me he then comes

1166
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:16,480
out moved away from me he then comes
 

1167
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,550
out moved away from me he then comes
back

1168
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:19,560

 

1169
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,470

he if I need him to go

1170
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:22,480
he if I need him to go
 

1171
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,149
he if I need him to go
forward this hand doesn't ever go that

1172
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:25,159
forward this hand doesn't ever go that
 

1173
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,950
forward this hand doesn't ever go that
direction all right just like eel right

1174
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:29,960
direction all right just like eel right
 

1175
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,389
direction all right just like eel right
I want him

1176
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:31,399
I want him
 

1177
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,589
I want him
to I I don't want to push him

1178
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:34,599
to I I don't want to push him
 

1179
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:37,349
to I I don't want to push him
away it's it's inverse because we're on

1180
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:37,359
away it's it's inverse because we're on
 

1181
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,190
away it's it's inverse because we're on
the front inward so I this hand goes

1182
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,200
the front inward so I this hand goes
 

1183
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,669
the front inward so I this hand goes
around me all

1184
00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:44,679

 

1185
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,389

right say

1186
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:47,399
right say
 

1187
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,349
right say
time this hand cannot go away from me if

1188
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:51,359
time this hand cannot go away from me if
 

1189
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,869
time this hand cannot go away from me if
this hand goes away from me then that

1190
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:53,879
this hand goes away from me then that
 

1191
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:59,510
this hand goes away from me then that
elbow is out there so likewise

1192
00:34:59,510 --> 00:34:59,520

 

1193
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,829

when I go

1194
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:00,839
when I go
 

1195
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,069
when I go
here that's that's where he's

1196
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:04,079
here that's that's where he's
 

1197
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,310
here that's that's where he's
pushing so that hand slips goes this way

1198
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:09,320
pushing so that hand slips goes this way
 

1199
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,710
pushing so that hand slips goes this way
okay do it again here's here's his

1200
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:12,720
okay do it again here's here's his
 

1201
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,390
okay do it again here's here's his
energy I don't want to contest it so I

1202
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:15,400
energy I don't want to contest it so I
 

1203
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,870
energy I don't want to contest it so I
don't want to take even doing the distal

1204
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:18,880
don't want to take even doing the distal
 

1205
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,550
don't want to take even doing the distal
lever that's just external leverage okay

1206
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:22,560
lever that's just external leverage okay
 

1207
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,510
lever that's just external leverage okay
I don't contest it it goes around me

1208
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:25,520
I don't contest it it goes around me
 

1209
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,870
I don't contest it it goes around me
this way all right then he keeps going

1210
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:27,880
this way all right then he keeps going
 

1211
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,470
this way all right then he keeps going
forward so if you

1212
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,480
forward so if you
 

1213
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,069
forward so if you
watch his spine as we go his he keeps

1214
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:35,079
watch his spine as we go his he keeps
 

1215
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:37,750
watch his spine as we go his he keeps
going forward into the

1216
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:37,760
going forward into the
 

1217
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,430
going forward into the
technique I go like this kind of stop

1218
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:42,440
technique I go like this kind of stop
 

1219
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,190
technique I go like this kind of stop
okay so I do make

1220
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:46,200
okay so I do make
 

1221
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,950
okay so I do make
contact but no energy goes that way and

1222
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:49,960
contact but no energy goes that way and
 

1223
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,710
contact but no energy goes that way and
no energy stops all energy keeps going

1224
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:53,720
no energy stops all energy keeps going
 

1225
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,150
no energy stops all energy keeps going
in the direction that he's

1226
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,160
in the direction that he's
 

1227
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,470
in the direction that he's
going right see that okay all right

1228
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:00,480
going right see that okay all right
 

1229
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,910
going right see that okay all right
let's try it and uh Ian you doing this

1230
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:04,920
let's try it and uh Ian you doing this
 

1231
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,910
let's try it and uh Ian you doing this
you bring in your hand back forward all

1232
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:06,920
you bring in your hand back forward all
 

1233
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:19,550
you bring in your hand back forward all
your people are okay try

1234
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:19,560

 

1235
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,190

it you so it looks

1236
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:24,200
it you so it looks
 

1237
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,630
it you so it looks
like you two are doing this it looks

1238
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:27,640
like you two are doing this it looks
 

1239
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,910
like you two are doing this it looks
looks like

1240
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
looks like
 

1241
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,910
looks like
you uh get this

1242
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:32,920
you uh get this
 

1243
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,069
you uh get this
hand in this pulling that and I don't I

1244
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:37,079
hand in this pulling that and I don't I
 

1245
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,390
hand in this pulling that and I don't I
don't do that so

1246
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:39,400
don't do that so
 

1247
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,109
don't do that so
his

1248
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:41,119
his
 

1249
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,990
his
his inertia that he's using here is

1250
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:45,000
his inertia that he's using here is
 

1251
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,109
his inertia that he's using here is
telling me how far this hand and where

1252
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:49,119
telling me how far this hand and where
 

1253
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,790
telling me how far this hand and where
it has to go so stay where you are so

1254
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:51,800
it has to go so stay where you are so
 

1255
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,750
it has to go so stay where you are so
there's a lot of pressure there right

1256
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:53,760
there's a lot of pressure there right
 

1257
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,710
there's a lot of pressure there right
you see

1258
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:54,720
you see
 

1259
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,069
you see
that just like there would be a lot of

1260
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:58,079
that just like there would be a lot of
 

1261
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,950
that just like there would be a lot of
pressure here do you feel do you feel

1262
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:00,960
pressure here do you feel do you feel
 

1263
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,309
pressure here do you feel do you feel
that so this is telling me that pressure

1264
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:04,319
that so this is telling me that pressure
 

1265
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:07,589
that so this is telling me that pressure
there I have to take it to where it goes

1266
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:07,599
there I have to take it to where it goes
 

1267
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,309
there I have to take it to where it goes
off you

1268
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:10,319
off you
 

1269
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:14,829
off you
see do you feel that yes okay so I think

1270
00:37:14,829 --> 00:37:14,839
see do you feel that yes okay so I think
 

1271
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:18,950
see do you feel that yes okay so I think
when you guys try to throw you're

1272
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:18,960
when you guys try to throw you're
 

1273
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,550
when you guys try to throw you're
throwing with the

1274
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:23,560

 

1275
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,109

obvious that kind of thing and what I'm

1276
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:27,119
obvious that kind of thing and what I'm
 

1277
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,150
obvious that kind of thing and what I'm
throwing

1278
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,160
throwing
 

1279
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,349
throwing
with is the

1280
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:30,359
with is the
 

1281
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,390
with is the
inertia the inertia that's turning him

1282
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:33,400
inertia the inertia that's turning him
 

1283
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,150
inertia the inertia that's turning him
this this forward progress that's what

1284
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,160
this this forward progress that's what
 

1285
00:37:36,160 --> 00:38:05,470
this this forward progress that's what
I'm throwing

1286
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:05,480

 

1287
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,109

not his skin suit okay so let's bring

1288
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:10,119
not his skin suit okay so let's bring
 

1289
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:12,710
not his skin suit okay so let's bring
some awareness you should not feel his

1290
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:12,720
some awareness you should not feel his
 

1291
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,510
some awareness you should not feel his
fingers of which all that you feel is

1292
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:15,520
fingers of which all that you feel is
 

1293
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:23,190
fingers of which all that you feel is
that there's a mass going

1294
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,200

 

1295
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,829

here there's a mask

1296
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:25,839
here there's a mask
 

1297
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,750
here there's a mask
going and I'm string here and here do

1298
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:29,760
going and I'm string here and here do
 

1299
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,589
going and I'm string here and here do
you see and what I do is make it go like

1300
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:34,599
you see and what I do is make it go like
 

1301
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:37,470
you see and what I do is make it go like
that that's all I feel don't pull on the

1302
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:37,480
that that's all I feel don't pull on the
 

1303
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,470
that that's all I feel don't pull on the
limbs okay try to turn the body you

1304
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:41,480
limbs okay try to turn the body you
 

1305
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,630
limbs okay try to turn the body you
always throw the

1306
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,640

 

1307
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,430

body even if we are in the limb we're in

1308
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:48,440
body even if we are in the limb we're in
 

1309
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,470
body even if we are in the limb we're in
the body in this case we've done what

1310
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:51,480
the body in this case we've done what
 

1311
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,950
the body in this case we've done what
mid-range grappling almost always does

1312
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:54,960
mid-range grappling almost always does
 

1313
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,109
mid-range grappling almost always does
start at the wrist pass through to the

1314
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:57,119
start at the wrist pass through to the
 

1315
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,950
start at the wrist pass through to the
spine fin line that's what you do all

1316
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:58,960
spine fin line that's what you do all
 

1317
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,710
spine fin line that's what you do all
the time in this case I'm not I'm

1318
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:00,720
the time in this case I'm not I'm
 

1319
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,870
the time in this case I'm not I'm
bypassing the elbow but not really

1320
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:03,880
bypassing the elbow but not really
 

1321
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,950
bypassing the elbow but not really
because it's in that first check do you

1322
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:06,960
because it's in that first check do you
 

1323
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,910
because it's in that first check do you
see and then you're back on the spine we

1324
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:09,920
see and then you're back on the spine we
 

1325
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,589
see and then you're back on the spine we
just do it over and over and over again

1326
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:12,599
just do it over and over and over again
 

1327
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,550
just do it over and over and over again
so that means we're

1328
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:16,560
so that means we're
 

1329
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,950
so that means we're
throwing the whole body and that means

1330
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:19,960
throwing the whole body and that means
 

1331
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,390
throwing the whole body and that means
the inertia that I feel of the spinal

1332
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:22,400
the inertia that I feel of the spinal
 

1333
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,309
the inertia that I feel of the spinal
displacement Bo that is what I'm turning

1334
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:25,319
displacement Bo that is what I'm turning
 

1335
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,870
displacement Bo that is what I'm turning
and when I start pulling on it then I'm

1336
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:27,880
and when I start pulling on it then I'm
 

1337
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,510
and when I start pulling on it then I'm
not using the forward energy that's

1338
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:30,520
not using the forward energy that's
 

1339
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,030
not using the forward energy that's
coming forward I'm trying to pull on the

1340
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,040
coming forward I'm trying to pull on the
 

1341
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,990
coming forward I'm trying to pull on the
extremities of the spine doesn't work

1342
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,000
extremities of the spine doesn't work
 

1343
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,829
extremities of the spine doesn't work
okay try it again

1344
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:41,839

 

1345
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,349

so

1346
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:43,359
so
 

1347
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:49,470
so
this means that the UK is never going to

1348
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:49,480
this means that the UK is never going to
 

1349
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,510
this means that the UK is never going to
be able to turn

1350
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:52,520
be able to turn
 

1351
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,829
be able to turn
around and do a forward roll

1352
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:57,839

 

1353
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,349

if my UK is doing that there's only two

1354
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:02,359
if my UK is doing that there's only two
 

1355
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:03,829
if my UK is doing that there's only two
ways that can

1356
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:03,839
ways that can
 

1357
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,589
ways that can
happen the one way

1358
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:06,599
happen the one way
 

1359
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,430
happen the one way
is I

1360
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:08,440
is I
 

1361
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,150
is I
am contesting at the head and contesting

1362
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,160
am contesting at the head and contesting
 

1363
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,230
am contesting at the head and contesting
at the grip and bringing this all like

1364
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,240
at the grip and bringing this all like
 

1365
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,150
at the grip and bringing this all like
that because their Center is now not

1366
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,160
that because their Center is now not
 

1367
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,750
that because their Center is now not
being occupied with the forward progress

1368
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:23,760
being occupied with the forward progress
 

1369
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,430
being occupied with the forward progress
you stop their forward progress that's

1370
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:26,440
you stop their forward progress that's
 

1371
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,829
you stop their forward progress that's
going to give them back back their

1372
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:27,839
going to give them back back their
 

1373
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,550
going to give them back back their
ability to rotate on the basis the

1374
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:30,560
ability to rotate on the basis the
 

1375
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,710
ability to rotate on the basis the
single basic support and you don't want

1376
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:32,720
single basic support and you don't want
 

1377
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,349
single basic support and you don't want
that that's not the technique okay the

1378
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:35,359
that that's not the technique okay the
 

1379
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,589
that that's not the technique okay the
only other way is that the UK does not

1380
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:39,599
only other way is that the UK does not
 

1381
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,790
only other way is that the UK does not
spinally

1382
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:40,800
spinally
 

1383
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,069
spinally
displace per the technique so the person

1384
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:45,079
displace per the technique so the person
 

1385
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:48,030
displace per the technique so the person
I will go like this you see and there

1386
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,040
I will go like this you see and there
 

1387
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,510
I will go like this you see and there
there's no attack there that's not it

1388
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:51,520
there's no attack there that's not it
 

1389
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:58,710
there's no attack there that's not it
okay so what I do is I tell UK you have

1390
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:58,720
okay so what I do is I tell UK you have
 

1391
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,790
okay so what I do is I tell UK you have
to spinally displace and now let him get

1392
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:03,800
to spinally displace and now let him get
 

1393
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,069
to spinally displace and now let him get
there let him get

1394
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:08,079

 

1395
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,550

there and then I can't control it so I

1396
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:11,560
there and then I can't control it so I
 

1397
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,150
there and then I can't control it so I
don't kill

1398
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:14,160
don't kill
 

1399
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,349
don't kill
them and give them that sense of feeling

1400
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:17,359
them and give them that sense of feeling
 

1401
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,309
them and give them that sense of feeling
and usually they're afraid of the x

1402
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:19,319
and usually they're afraid of the x
 

1403
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:22,030
and usually they're afraid of the x
pattern so I don't do it as much I'll do

1404
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:22,040
pattern so I don't do it as much I'll do
 

1405
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,750
pattern so I don't do it as much I'll do
more of the inertial

1406
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:23,760
more of the inertial
 

1407
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,870
more of the inertial
throw um but then eventually

1408
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:27,880
throw um but then eventually
 

1409
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,829
throw um but then eventually
as you as you two know that I've that's

1410
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:30,839
as you as you two know that I've that's
 

1411
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,390
as you as you two know that I've that's
enough of you and I I throw you in the x

1412
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:33,400
enough of you and I I throw you in the x
 

1413
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,150
enough of you and I I throw you in the x
pattern okay then we're back to that oh

1414
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,160
pattern okay then we're back to that oh
 

1415
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,829
pattern okay then we're back to that oh
how do you want to land that's your

1416
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:37,839
how do you want to land that's your
 

1417
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,030
how do you want to land that's your
that's your choice there okay sooner or

1418
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:40,040
that's your choice there okay sooner or
 

1419
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,190
that's your choice there okay sooner or
later you know all your UK have to be

1420
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:42,200
later you know all your UK have to be
 

1421
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,470
later you know all your UK have to be
brought to that point but let's make it

1422
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:44,480
brought to that point but let's make it
 

1423
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,270
brought to that point but let's make it
later for your UK because maybe they

1424
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,280
later for your UK because maybe they
 

1425
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,309
later for your UK because maybe they
haven't done the ground work for the

1426
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:49,319
haven't done the ground work for the
 

1427
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:51,710
haven't done the ground work for the
Contracting Center back break ball we

1428
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:51,720
Contracting Center back break ball we
 

1429
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,829
Contracting Center back break ball we
don't want to hurt anyone okay so just

1430
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:54,839
don't want to hurt anyone okay so just
 

1431
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:58,109
don't want to hurt anyone okay so just
tell your UK

1432
00:41:58,109 --> 00:41:58,119
tell your UK
 

1433
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:00,069
tell your UK
to keep coming

1434
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:00,079
to keep coming
 

1435
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,550
to keep coming
forward without

1436
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:02,560
forward without
 

1437
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,349
forward without
you pushing them backwards where they

1438
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:05,359
you pushing them backwards where they
 

1439
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,670
you pushing them backwards where they
would be motivated to turn then the two

1440
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:08,680
would be motivated to turn then the two
 

1441
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,190
would be motivated to turn then the two
of you meet in the

1442
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:10,200
of you meet in the
 

1443
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,510
of you meet in the
center uh you know so to speak and they

1444
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,520
center uh you know so to speak and they
 

1445
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,470
center uh you know so to speak and they
will keep coming forward and it's a back

1446
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:17,480
will keep coming forward and it's a back
 

1447
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,829
will keep coming forward and it's a back
breakfall but it is forward of the

1448
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:20,839
breakfall but it is forward of the
 

1449
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:24,109
breakfall but it is forward of the
spinal displacement okay and that's if

1450
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:24,119
spinal displacement okay and that's if
 

1451
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:27,630
spinal displacement okay and that's if
for doing the the uh the uh base

1452
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:27,640
for doing the the uh the uh base
 

1453
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,309
for doing the the uh the uh base
displacement x pattern okay if if

1454
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:30,319
displacement x pattern okay if if
 

1455
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,349
displacement x pattern okay if if
they're coming in really really fast

1456
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:32,359
they're coming in really really fast
 

1457
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:34,990
they're coming in really really fast
which tends to happen for me in guaza

1458
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:35,000
which tends to happen for me in guaza
 

1459
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,870
which tends to happen for me in guaza
then this whole thing is out here you

1460
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:36,880
then this whole thing is out here you
 

1461
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,470
then this whole thing is out here you
don't need the base the legs come up on

1462
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:39,480
don't need the base the legs come up on
 

1463
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,230
don't need the base the legs come up on
their own and it's the exact same throw

1464
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:42,240
their own and it's the exact same throw
 

1465
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,430
their own and it's the exact same throw
but they go even more forward into the

1466
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:44,440
but they go even more forward into the
 

1467
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,990
but they go even more forward into the
technique which we're not going to show

1468
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:46,000
technique which we're not going to show
 

1469
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,790
technique which we're not going to show
tonight we this took a while but I think

1470
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:48,800
tonight we this took a while but I think
 

1471
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,549
tonight we this took a while but I think
everyone learned something here okay

1472
00:42:51,549 --> 00:42:51,559
everyone learned something here okay
 

1473
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:54,190
everyone learned something here okay
lots to work on pay attention to that

1474
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:54,200
lots to work on pay attention to that
 

1475
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,790
lots to work on pay attention to that

to keep their forward progress you're
 

1483
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,150
to keep their forward progress you're
not going to be spiral rotating the
