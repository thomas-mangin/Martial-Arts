hi everyone alex gent here so in today's

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:02,000
hi everyone alex gent here so in today's
 

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,270
hi everyone alex gent here so in today's
video i'm going to be showing you what i

4
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
video i'm going to be showing you what i
 

5
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,870
video i'm going to be showing you what i
think is the most important movement

6
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:04,880
think is the most important movement
 

7
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,789
think is the most important movement
for both club swinging and staff

8
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:06,799
for both club swinging and staff
 

9
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,470
for both club swinging and staff
spinning

10
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
spinning
 

11
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,669
spinning
make sure you stick around to the end of

12
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
make sure you stick around to the end of
 

13
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,110
make sure you stick around to the end of
the video because i'll also be showing

14
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,120
the video because i'll also be showing
 

15
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,709
the video because i'll also be showing
some martial applications of this

16
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719
some martial applications of this
 

17
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,830
some martial applications of this
movement

18
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:13,840
movement
 

19
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,550
movement
okay so let's get

20
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560

 

21
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,910

so when we start i'm going to be

22
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920
so when we start i'm going to be
 

23
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,750
so when we start i'm going to be
starting off with the clubs and

24
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
starting off with the clubs and
 

25
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,429
starting off with the clubs and
if you think of when we're using the

26
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
if you think of when we're using the
 

27
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,830
if you think of when we're using the
staff if you think of the side that's

28
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
staff if you think of the side that's
 

29
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,390
staff if you think of the side that's
the thumb side if you like is

30
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
the thumb side if you like is
 

31
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,990
the thumb side if you like is
representative of where the club would

32
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
representative of where the club would
 

33
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,389
representative of where the club would
be

34
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
be
 

35
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,670
be
so as i show you the movement i'll

36
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
so as i show you the movement i'll
 

37
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,510
so as i show you the movement i'll
explain what i mean okay to start with

38
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
explain what i mean okay to start with
 

39
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,630
explain what i mean okay to start with
i'm going to be showing you the movement

40
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
i'm going to be showing you the movement
 

41
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,750
i'm going to be showing you the movement
with the club

42
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
with the club
 

43
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,110
with the club
um from side to side

44
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
um from side to side
 

45
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,830
um from side to side
i'm just going to be just doing a basic

46
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840
i'm just going to be just doing a basic
 

47
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,270
i'm just going to be just doing a basic
pendulum

48
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
pendulum
 

49
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,270
pendulum
so it's swinging across my body at

50
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
so it's swinging across my body at
 

51
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,549
so it's swinging across my body at
shoulder level

52
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
shoulder level
 

53
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,830
shoulder level
both sides i'm changing this to the

54
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
both sides i'm changing this to the
 

55
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,709
both sides i'm changing this to the
other hand

56
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
other hand
 

57
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,990
other hand
so the changeover is going to be in the

58
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
so the changeover is going to be in the
 

59
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,229
so the changeover is going to be in the
middle it comes up the club's facing

60
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
middle it comes up the club's facing
 

61
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:56,950
middle it comes up the club's facing
towards

62
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960
towards
 

63
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,990
towards
my head i change hands here

64
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
my head i change hands here
 

65
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,990
my head i change hands here
and i let it slide out to the side and

66
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
and i let it slide out to the side and
 

67
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,590
and i let it slide out to the side and
again i pendulum on the other side as

68
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
again i pendulum on the other side as
 

69
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,190
again i pendulum on the other side as
well

70
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200

 

71
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,510

okay again shoulder level

72
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520

 

73
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,149

so let's do the same with the staff

74
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159

 

75
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,429

so same movement with the staff pendulum

76
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
so same movement with the staff pendulum
 

77
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,109
so same movement with the staff pendulum
from side to side

78
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
from side to side
 

79
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,710
from side to side
we're going to do the hand change over

80
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
we're going to do the hand change over
 

81
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,310
we're going to do the hand change over
in the middle so

82
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
in the middle so
 

83
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,550
in the middle so
unchangeover as i said imagine this is

84
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
unchangeover as i said imagine this is
 

85
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,590
unchangeover as i said imagine this is
the club side

86
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
the club side
 

87
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,910
the club side
so the thumb side that's where the pub

88
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
so the thumb side that's where the pub
 

89
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,590
so the thumb side that's where the pub
is so you'll be changing over at this

90
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
is so you'll be changing over at this
 

91
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,390
is so you'll be changing over at this
point

92
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
point
 

93
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,710
point
and then taking it into the other hand

94
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
and then taking it into the other hand
 

95
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,310
and then taking it into the other hand
and then you can pendulum

96
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
and then you can pendulum
 

97
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,550
and then you can pendulum
on the other side as well

98
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
on the other side as well
 

99
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,590
on the other side as well
we can then go backwards and forwards

100
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
we can then go backwards and forwards
 

101
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,670
we can then go backwards and forwards
from side to side so we'll go just from

102
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
from side to side so we'll go just from
 

103
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,350
from side to side so we'll go just from
side to side and your room

104
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
side to side and your room
 

105
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,590
side to side and your room
making sure it's shoulder level from

106
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
making sure it's shoulder level from
 

107
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,310
making sure it's shoulder level from
side to side

108
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320

 

109
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,670

make sure with this side the the back

110
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
make sure with this side the the back
 

111
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,709
make sure with this side the the back
side of the

112
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
side of the
 

113
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,789
side of the
staff is behind your arm

114
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
staff is behind your arm
 

115
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,990
staff is behind your arm
so it's behind your arm rather than

116
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
so it's behind your arm rather than
 

117
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,109
so it's behind your arm rather than
in front of your arms

118
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
in front of your arms
 

119
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,790
in front of your arms
okay and we're just going side to side

120
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
okay and we're just going side to side
 

121
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,110
okay and we're just going side to side
you can do this both with a pull or a

122
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
you can do this both with a pull or a
 

123
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,309
you can do this both with a pull or a
step

124
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319

 

125
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,990

so this next part of the movement i'm

126
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
so this next part of the movement i'm
 

127
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,990
so this next part of the movement i'm
bringing the club up at 45 degree

128
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
bringing the club up at 45 degree
 

129
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,070
bringing the club up at 45 degree
angle so it's kind of kind of coming in

130
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
angle so it's kind of kind of coming in
 

131
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,350
angle so it's kind of kind of coming in
towards my head

132
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
towards my head
 

133
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,390
towards my head
it's as if you're going to hit yourself

134
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
it's as if you're going to hit yourself
 

135
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,910
it's as if you're going to hit yourself
on the head but you don't and you just

136
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
on the head but you don't and you just
 

137
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,430
on the head but you don't and you just
rest it on your shoulder

138
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
rest it on your shoulder
 

139
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,589
rest it on your shoulder
okay when you're first learning this

140
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
okay when you're first learning this
 

141
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,270
okay when you're first learning this
movement you might just want to rest it

142
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
movement you might just want to rest it
 

143
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,070
movement you might just want to rest it
here

144
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
here
 

145
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,150
here
as it makes it easier when you turn your

146
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
as it makes it easier when you turn your
 

147
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,470
as it makes it easier when you turn your
body 180 degrees and then throw it out

148
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
body 180 degrees and then throw it out
 

149
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,509
body 180 degrees and then throw it out
to the other side

150
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
to the other side
 

151
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,350
to the other side
and then you connect that to your body

152
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
and then you connect that to your body
 

153
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,350
and then you connect that to your body
movement so when it's resting here you

154
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
movement so when it's resting here you
 

155
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,710
movement so when it's resting here you
turn your whole body

156
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
turn your whole body
 

157
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,830
turn your whole body
around face the opposite way and

158
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
around face the opposite way and
 

159
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,550
around face the opposite way and
throw the club out you then let it

160
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
throw the club out you then let it
 

161
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,990
throw the club out you then let it
pendulum across

162
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
pendulum across
 

163
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,390
pendulum across
and then you bring it back up again okay

164
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
and then you bring it back up again okay
 

165
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,150
and then you bring it back up again okay
so you turn your body

166
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
so you turn your body
 

167
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,750
so you turn your body
throw it out and you're on the cross

168
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
throw it out and you're on the cross
 

169
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,390
throw it out and you're on the cross
bring it back up okay and you just carry

170
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
bring it back up okay and you just carry
 

171
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,430
bring it back up okay and you just carry
that movement

172
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
that movement
 

173
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,509
that movement
going until you can then do it all in

174
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
going until you can then do it all in
 

175
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,750
going until you can then do it all in
one

176
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760

 

177
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,309

when it comes up you want to let it drop

178
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
when it comes up you want to let it drop
 

179
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:12,949
when it comes up you want to let it drop
down

180
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
down
 

181
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,110
down
when you're doing it in a fluid movement

182
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
when you're doing it in a fluid movement
 

183
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,149
when you're doing it in a fluid movement
you let it drop

184
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
you let it drop
 

185
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,790
you let it drop
let the weight feel that weight of the

186
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
let the weight feel that weight of the
 

187
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,509
let the weight feel that weight of the
club

188
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
club
 

189
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,110
club
swing around and then cast out to the

190
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
swing around and then cast out to the
 

191
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,149
swing around and then cast out to the
opposite side

192
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
opposite side
 

193
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:32,070
opposite side
so as it comes up

194
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
so as it comes up
 

195
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,670
so as it comes up
you want to avoid doing something like

196
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
you want to avoid doing something like
 

197
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,630
you want to avoid doing something like
this because this is a different

198
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
this because this is a different
 

199
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,350
this because this is a different
movement

200
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
movement
 

201
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,789
movement
or anything where you're pulling it like

202
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
or anything where you're pulling it like
 

203
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,949
or anything where you're pulling it like
this again that's a different movement

204
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
this again that's a different movement
 

205
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,149
this again that's a different movement
nothing wrong with it but it's just

206
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
nothing wrong with it but it's just
 

207
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,949
nothing wrong with it but it's just
different to what i'm showing you here

208
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
different to what i'm showing you here
 

209
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,309
different to what i'm showing you here
you want to make sure that it's coming

210
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
you want to make sure that it's coming
 

211
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,630
you want to make sure that it's coming
in towards you turn your body

212
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
in towards you turn your body
 

213
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,789
in towards you turn your body
throw it out okay so

214
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
throw it out okay so
 

215
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,630
throw it out okay so
then when you change the direction

216
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
then when you change the direction
 

217
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,869
then when you change the direction
you essentially bring it across your

218
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
you essentially bring it across your
 

219
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,229
you essentially bring it across your
body this time

220
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
body this time
 

221
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,350
body this time
and you're at this 45 degree angle turn

222
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
and you're at this 45 degree angle turn
 

223
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,789
and you're at this 45 degree angle turn
your body

224
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
your body
 

225
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,390
your body
and then throw it out this way so we're

226
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
and then throw it out this way so we're
 

227
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,470
and then throw it out this way so we're
casting it away so rather than before

228
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
casting it away so rather than before
 

229
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,429
casting it away so rather than before
we're going

230
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
we're going
 

231
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,110
we're going
inwards this time we're going outwards

232
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
inwards this time we're going outwards
 

233
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,270
inwards this time we're going outwards
okay essentially this is just a reverse

234
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
okay essentially this is just a reverse
 

235
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,910
okay essentially this is just a reverse
of the other direction

236
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
of the other direction
 

237
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,030
of the other direction
45 degrees by five

238
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
45 degrees by five
 

239
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,870
45 degrees by five
cast it out okay

240
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880

 

241
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,830

so then now at this point we're in this

242
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
so then now at this point we're in this
 

243
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,670
so then now at this point we're in this
position where it's coming across i can

244
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
position where it's coming across i can
 

245
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,990
position where it's coming across i can
actually

246
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
actually
 

247
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,990
actually
change it to my other side and then do

248
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
change it to my other side and then do
 

249
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,070
change it to my other side and then do
the same on the other side

250
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
the same on the other side
 

251
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,310
the same on the other side
we're back to the beginning where i stop

252
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
we're back to the beginning where i stop
 

253
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,550
we're back to the beginning where i stop
here 45 degree angle

254
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
here 45 degree angle
 

255
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,350
here 45 degree angle
throw it out bring it back around

256
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
throw it out bring it back around
 

257
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,749
throw it out bring it back around
there okay and i'll just repeat the same

258
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
there okay and i'll just repeat the same
 

259
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,110
there okay and i'll just repeat the same
process on this side

260
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
process on this side
 

261
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,430
process on this side
both directions inwards and outwards

262
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
both directions inwards and outwards
 

263
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,469
both directions inwards and outwards
45 cast it out

264
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
45 cast it out
 

265
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,710
45 cast it out
okay then we can do the same with the

266
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
okay then we can do the same with the
 

267
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,350
okay then we can do the same with the
staff

268
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360

 

269
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,710

so again the staff is the same imagine

270
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
so again the staff is the same imagine
 

271
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,110
so again the staff is the same imagine
this is

272
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
this is
 

273
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,469
this is
the club side pointed in towards my body

274
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
the club side pointed in towards my body
 

275
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,590
the club side pointed in towards my body
i turn 180 degrees and then throw it out

276
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
i turn 180 degrees and then throw it out
 

277
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,270
i turn 180 degrees and then throw it out
remember this is on the outside of my

278
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
remember this is on the outside of my
 

279
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,510
remember this is on the outside of my
arm i'll bring it back around

280
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
arm i'll bring it back around
 

281
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,430
arm i'll bring it back around
and then i can bring it back up again

282
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
and then i can bring it back up again
 

283
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,189
and then i can bring it back up again
okay

284
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199

 

285
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,070

and then you smooth the movement out

286
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
and then you smooth the movement out
 

287
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,749
and then you smooth the movement out
feel the weight of the

288
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
feel the weight of the
 

289
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,390
feel the weight of the
the staff drop down i want to feel this

290
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
the staff drop down i want to feel this
 

291
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,510
the staff drop down i want to feel this
weight drop down

292
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
weight drop down
 

293
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,990
weight drop down
create a circle behind like a circular

294
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
create a circle behind like a circular
 

295
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,990
create a circle behind like a circular
pendulum behind my head

296
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
pendulum behind my head
 

297
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,990
pendulum behind my head
and then i let that swing and then

298
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
and then i let that swing and then
 

299
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,550
and then i let that swing and then
passed out on the inside

300
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
passed out on the inside
 

301
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,350
passed out on the inside
okay stop and then reverse the direction

302
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
okay stop and then reverse the direction
 

303
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,070
okay stop and then reverse the direction
the other way

304
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080

 

305
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,029

okay it then comes back i can then

306
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
okay it then comes back i can then
 

307
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:47,670
okay it then comes back i can then
transfer

308
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
transfer
 

309
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,070
transfer
into the other hand back to the side

310
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
into the other hand back to the side
 

311
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,029
into the other hand back to the side
back up now we're on the other side

312
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
back up now we're on the other side
 

313
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:55,430
back up now we're on the other side
again

314
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
again
 

315
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,749
again
the same idea as the with the clubs i

316
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
the same idea as the with the clubs i
 

317
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,670
the same idea as the with the clubs i
bring it in at this 45 degree angle

318
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
bring it in at this 45 degree angle
 

319
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,990
bring it in at this 45 degree angle
throw it out this time it's going across

320
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
throw it out this time it's going across
 

321
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,670
throw it out this time it's going across
my body

322
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
my body
 

323
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,390
my body
and i stop at the side and i'll reverse

324
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
and i stop at the side and i'll reverse
 

325
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,230
and i stop at the side and i'll reverse
the direction so i'm casting it

326
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
the direction so i'm casting it
 

327
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,790
the direction so i'm casting it
away from my body so it's going outwards

328
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
away from my body so it's going outwards
 

329
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,469
away from my body so it's going outwards
so it comes up

330
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
so it comes up
 

331
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,029
so it comes up
turn my body out

332
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039

 

333
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,150

okay so in a routine

334
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
okay so in a routine
 

335
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,590
okay so in a routine
you start by going inwards so inwards

336
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
you start by going inwards so inwards
 

337
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,590
you start by going inwards so inwards
one and then outwards change hands

338
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
one and then outwards change hands
 

339
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,189
one and then outwards change hands

stop outwards change hands
you just can kind of carry on this

358
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
you just can kind of carry on this
 

359
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,950
you just can kind of carry on this
pattern

360
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960

 

361
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,990

and it just continues in this cycle

362
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
and it just continues in this cycle
 

363
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,670
and it just continues in this cycle
as many times as you want to do it

364
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680

 

365
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,110

so all these movements that we've done

366
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
so all these movements that we've done
 

367
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,990
so all these movements that we've done
with the club and the staff

368
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
with the club and the staff
 

369
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,710
with the club and the staff
you can do with the sailor and actually

370
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
you can do with the sailor and actually
 

371
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,909
you can do with the sailor and actually
i mean i'm using the saber it could be

372
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
i mean i'm using the saber it could be
 

373
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,189
i mean i'm using the saber it could be
any sort

374
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
any sort
 

375
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,469
any sort
but what it does is it gives you that

376
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
but what it does is it gives you that
 

377
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,550
but what it does is it gives you that
blade alignment um

378
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
blade alignment um
 

379
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,070
blade alignment um
and that teaches you how to use the club

380
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,080
and that teaches you how to use the club
 

381
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,909
and that teaches you how to use the club
and staff properly

382
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
and staff properly
 

383
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,510
and staff properly
if you think about doing these movements

384
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
if you think about doing these movements
 

385
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,230
if you think about doing these movements
you want your knuckles on top so when

386
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
you want your knuckles on top so when
 

387
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,189
you want your knuckles on top so when
i'm turning here

388
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
i'm turning here
 

389
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,390
i'm turning here
as i'm striking down see my knuckles are

390
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
as i'm striking down see my knuckles are
 

391
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,510
as i'm striking down see my knuckles are
on top there i don't want something

392
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
on top there i don't want something
 

393
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,390
on top there i don't want something
strange like this

394
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
strange like this
 

395
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,150
strange like this
that'd be like holding your sword and

396
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
that'd be like holding your sword and
 

397
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,070
that'd be like holding your sword and
doing a cup like this

398
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
doing a cup like this
 

399
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,150
doing a cup like this
make any sense so you want to make sure

400
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
make any sense so you want to make sure
 

401
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,350
make any sense so you want to make sure
that when you're turning

402
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
that when you're turning
 

403
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,510
that when you're turning
you're cutting with the blade down

404
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520

 

405
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,110

and then that gets your hand in the

406
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
and then that gets your hand in the
 

407
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,629
and then that gets your hand in the
right position

408
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
right position
 

409
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,110
right position
so when you're thinking of the weapons

410
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
so when you're thinking of the weapons
 

411
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,270
so when you're thinking of the weapons
application of this

412
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
application of this
 

413
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,430
application of this
all these movements are the same with

414
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
all these movements are the same with
 

415
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,629
all these movements are the same with
the sabre

416
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
the sabre
 

417
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,469
the sabre
you see is the same movement

418
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
you see is the same movement
 

419
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,029
you see is the same movement
with the club all the stuff

420
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039

 

421
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,749

you can do it turning between your body

422
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
you can do it turning between your body
 

423
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,830
you can do it turning between your body
going the other direction

424
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
going the other direction
 

425
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,510
going the other direction
yeah it's all the same thing so again

426
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
yeah it's all the same thing so again
 

427
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,550
yeah it's all the same thing so again
with the staff you can do these

428
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
with the staff you can do these
 

429
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,309
with the staff you can do these
movements i was showing it holding from

430
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
movements i was showing it holding from
 

431
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,270
movements i was showing it holding from
the center

432
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
the center
 

433
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,309
the center
but actually if we move up and down to

434
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
but actually if we move up and down to
 

435
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,110
but actually if we move up and down to
here

436
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
here
 

437
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,070
here
we can also do these movements

438
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080

 

439
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,990

in a more sort of standard grip i would

440
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
in a more sort of standard grip i would
 

441
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,430
in a more sort of standard grip i would
actually hold this stuff

442
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
actually hold this stuff
 

443
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,750
actually hold this stuff
so if you think of this movement where

444
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
so if you think of this movement where
 

445
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,029
so if you think of this movement where
we're raising

446
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
we're raising
 

447
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,029
we're raising
again i'll show you raising from the

448
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
again i'll show you raising from the
 

449
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,430
again i'll show you raising from the
middle but if we've got our hand here we

450
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
middle but if we've got our hand here we
 

451
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,469
middle but if we've got our hand here we
could raise

452
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
could raise
 

453
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,829
could raise
to cut obviously now i'm actually

454
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
to cut obviously now i'm actually
 

455
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,310
to cut obviously now i'm actually
putting footwork in as well

456
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
putting footwork in as well
 

457
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,750
putting footwork in as well
but the movement is still the same

458
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
but the movement is still the same
 

459
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,190
but the movement is still the same
all these sort of movements where we're

460
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
all these sort of movements where we're
 

461
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,790
all these sort of movements where we're
raising it up turning

462
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
raising it up turning
 

463
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,150
raising it up turning
that's why i think this exercise is so

464
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160
that's why i think this exercise is so
 

465
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,509
that's why i think this exercise is so
important because it actually teaches

466
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
important because it actually teaches
 

467
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,389
important because it actually teaches
you

468
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
you
 

469
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,509
you
um i suppose planes of control that type

470
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
um i suppose planes of control that type
 

471
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,870
um i suppose planes of control that type
of thing

472
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
of thing
 

473
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,110
of thing
and transitioning whether it's like say

474
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
and transitioning whether it's like say
 

475
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,630
and transitioning whether it's like say
a club staff

476
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
a club staff
 

477
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,150
a club staff
