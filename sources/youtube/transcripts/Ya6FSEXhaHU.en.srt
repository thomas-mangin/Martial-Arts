already there yeah so it it cuts out it
 

161
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,950
already there yeah so it it cuts out it
cuts out this movement cuz then if I do

162
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:17,960
cuts out this movement cuz then if I do
 

163
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,070
cuts out this movement cuz then if I do
that then I it would be better just to

164
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,080
that then I it would be better just to
 

165
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,390
