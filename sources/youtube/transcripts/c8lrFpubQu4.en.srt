some people do and some people here
 

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,469
some people do and some people here
today were doing it like this

20
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479

 

21
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,190

um

22
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200

 

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,630

but this is too exposed

24
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
but this is too exposed
 

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,310
but this is too exposed
and uh you just see don't expose your

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,320
and uh you just see don't expose your
 

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,350
and uh you just see don't expose your
armpit area the place where your armor

28
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
armpit area the place where your armor
 

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,469
armpit area the place where your armor
is not

30
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
is not
 

31
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,590
is not
there you don't expose it even in modern

32
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
there you don't expose it even in modern
 

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,310
there you don't expose it even in modern
law enforcement

we don't stand in weaver stance anymore

36
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
we don't stand in weaver stance anymore
 

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,910
we don't stand in weaver stance anymore
because there's no armor there

38
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
because there's no armor there
 

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,990
because there's no armor there
you're always like this okay so you

40
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
you're always like this okay so you
 

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,110
you're always like this okay so you
don't open the armpits

42
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
don't open the armpits
 

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,869
don't open the armpits
so that can't be right

44
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
so that can't be right
 

45
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,589
so that can't be right
also things that are done

46
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
also things that are done
 

47
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,229
also things that are done
in a yin-yang universe are done

48
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
in a yin-yang universe are done
 

49
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,070
in a yin-yang universe are done

50
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
incrementally
 

51
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,030
incrementally
not all at once so that can't be right

52
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
not all at once so that can't be right
 

53
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,790
not all at once so that can't be right
okay

54
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
okay
 

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,070
okay
and also

things

62
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
things
 

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,270
things
that are done in a yin-yang world

64
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
that are done in a yin-yang world
 

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,509
that are done in a yin-yang world
are done in harmony

66
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
are done in harmony
 

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,670
are done in harmony
with yiddiyam so i wouldn't be pulling

68
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
with yiddiyam so i wouldn't be pulling
 

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,229
with yiddiyam so i wouldn't be pulling
against his standing base

70
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
against his standing base
 

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,190
against his standing base
okay

72
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
okay
 

73
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,350
okay
i need him to be lowering

74
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
i need him to be lowering
 

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,070
i need him to be lowering
in some way that i would then continue

76
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
in some way that i would then continue
 

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,589
in some way that i would then continue
his load

78
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,599
his load
 

79
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,110
his load
does that make sense

80
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
does that make sense
 

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,670
does that make sense
so you wouldn't ever you would never do

82
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
so you wouldn't ever you would never do
 

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,430
so you wouldn't ever you would never do
this technique like this

84
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440

 

85
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,350

that wouldn't work

86
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
that wouldn't work
 

87
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,110
that wouldn't work
okay

88
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120

 

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,229

so

90
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
so
 

91
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,270
so
let's first

92
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280

 

93
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,589

i think because it's so simple

94
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
i think because it's so simple
 

95
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,670
i think because it's so simple
let's identify

96
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
let's identify
 

97
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,670
let's identify
where he first

98
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
where he first
 

99
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,430
where he first
lowers himself because i need to extend

100
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
lowers himself because i need to extend
 

101
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,750
lowers himself because i need to extend
i need to lower him you just reverse

102
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
i need to lower him you just reverse
 

103
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,869
i need to lower him you just reverse
engineer that i need to lower him then i

104
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
engineer that i need to lower him then i
 

105
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,750
engineer that i need to lower him then i
need to extend his lower and lowering

106
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
need to extend his lower and lowering
 

107
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,869
need to extend his lower and lowering
energy

108
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
energy
 

109
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,149
energy
then he must be lowering himself prior

110
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
then he must be lowering himself prior
 

111
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,550
then he must be lowering himself prior
to that let's find out

112
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
to that let's find out
 

113
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,949
to that let's find out
where he first lowers himself

114
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959

 

115
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,710

when he comes from the graph so don't

116
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
when he comes from the graph so don't
 

117
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,589
when he comes from the graph so don't
stick your hands up here because this is

118
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
stick your hands up here because this is
 

119
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,390
stick your hands up here because this is
not good

120
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400

 

121
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,470

okay

122
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
okay
 

123
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,390
okay
um

124
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
um
 

125
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,470
um
so whatever i do

126
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
so whatever i do
 

127
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,110
so whatever i do
is going to be in conjunction

128
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
is going to be in conjunction
 

129
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,670
is going to be in conjunction
with his reaching for my house does that

130
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
with his reaching for my house does that
 

131
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,910
with his reaching for my house does that
make sense okay

132
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
make sense okay
 

133
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,229
make sense okay
then let's go back and let's look at the

134
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
then let's go back and let's look at the
 

135
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,309
then let's go back and let's look at the
handwork

136
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
handwork
 

137
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,750
handwork
okay

138
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
okay
 

139
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,190
okay
um

140
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
um
 

141
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,309
um
i have

142
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
i have
 

143
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,149
i have
i have giddon

144
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
i have giddon
 

145
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:20,550
i have giddon
chewed on

146
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560

 

147
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,790

um

148
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
um
 

149
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,510
um
it again does not make sense that i have

150
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
it again does not make sense that i have
 

151
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,110
it again does not make sense that i have
three things

152
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
three things
 

153
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,749
three things
i have one thing

154
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
i have one thing
 

155
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,990
i have one thing
but those are phases amongst that one

156
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
but those are phases amongst that one
 

157
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,270
but those are phases amongst that one
thing

158
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
thing
 

159
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,950
thing
so if i was

160
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960

 

161
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,950

combining

162
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
combining
 

163
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,749
combining
my outward spiral do you see it

164
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
my outward spiral do you see it
 

165
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,950
my outward spiral do you see it
with my

166
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
with my
 

167
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,270
with my
inward spiral and i do a movement like

168
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
inward spiral and i do a movement like
 

169
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,030
inward spiral and i do a movement like
this you see

170
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
this you see
 

171
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,110
this you see
so i go get on

172
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120

 

173
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,870

that's how i always been you never you

174
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
that's how i always been you never you
 

175
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,070
that's how i always been you never you
never go to joe dawn like this

176
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
never go to joe dawn like this
 

177
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,350
never go to joe dawn like this
is jordan doesn't start down here get on

178
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
is jordan doesn't start down here get on
 

179
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,270
is jordan doesn't start down here get on
do you see hey you would never go to

180
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
do you see hey you would never go to
 

181
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,430
do you see hey you would never go to
gone like that

182
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440

all of this testovaki is i'm gonna i'm
 

369
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,310
all of this testovaki is i'm gonna i'm
gonna do this powder i'm gonna do this

370
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
gonna do this powder i'm gonna do this
 

371
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,150
gonna do this powder i'm gonna do this
powder i'm gonna do this

372
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160

 

373
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,430

i'm gonna do that powder

374
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440

 

375
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,630

but i'm gonna find his neck

376
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
but i'm gonna find his neck
 

377
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,430
but i'm gonna find his neck
i'm going to find an imi nugget

378
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
i'm going to find an imi nugget
 

379
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,110
i'm going to find an imi nugget
and i'm going to find the back of this

380
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
and i'm going to find the back of this
 

381
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,710
and i'm going to find the back of this
person

382
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
person
 

383
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,150
person
in the technique

384
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
in the technique
 

385
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,550
in the technique
so between these two

386
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
so between these two
 

387
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,389
so between these two
guide posts my body will learn when and

388
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
guide posts my body will learn when and
 

389
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,910
guide posts my body will learn when and
how to move

390
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
how to move
 

391
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,389
how to move
because i don't change my arms

392
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
because i don't change my arms
 

393
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,509
because i don't change my arms
i change my body i can do that

394
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
i change my body i can do that
 

395
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,670
i change my body i can do that
i can change my timing

396
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680
i can change my timing
 

397
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,910
i can change my timing
i can do that okay

398
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920
i can do that okay
 

399
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,430
i can do that okay
so

400
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
so
 

401
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,269
so
i know my body

402
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
i know my body
 

403
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,750
i know my body
is going to come down

404
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
is going to come down
 

405
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,389
is going to come down
and do this

406
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
and do this
 

407
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,550
and do this
but i know i have to end up

408
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
but i know i have to end up
 

409
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,269
but i know i have to end up
here

410
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279

 

411
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,350

so i do my arm pattern

412
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360

 

413
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,110

and

414
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120

 

415
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,550

i do it when

416
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560

 

417
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,670

and with

418
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
and with
 

419
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,670
and with
the foot maneuver that allows me to get

420
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
the foot maneuver that allows me to get
 

421
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,829
the foot maneuver that allows me to get
to the back oh the

422
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
to the back oh the
 

423
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,949
to the back oh the
the guide rail of the hand pattern

424
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
the guide rail of the hand pattern
 

425
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,790
the guide rail of the hand pattern
is going to teach me

426
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
is going to teach me
 

427
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,310
is going to teach me
the tempo

428
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
the tempo
 

429
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,470
the tempo
and how to walk how to move how to get

430
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
and how to walk how to move how to get
 

431
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,590
and how to walk how to move how to get
to the back okay

432
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600

 

433
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,069

what would what would the contrary be

434
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
what would what would the contrary be
 

435
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,870
what would what would the contrary be
over here

436
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880

 

437
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,670

you see i if you look at it and you

438
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
you see i if you look at it and you
 

439
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,350
you see i if you look at it and you
start plotting that

440
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
start plotting that
 

441
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,910
start plotting that
geometrically on a grid

442
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920

 

443
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,110

he's coming at me i get out of the way i

444
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
he's coming at me i get out of the way i
 

445
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,190
he's coming at me i get out of the way i
click i clear the line of attack i get

446
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
click i clear the line of attack i get
 

447
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,110
click i clear the line of attack i get
to the side you see

448
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
to the side you see
 

449
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,389
to the side you see
and then

450
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
and then
 

451
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,629
and then
i lead him to the inside as i go to the

452
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
i lead him to the inside as i go to the
 

453
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,150
i lead him to the inside as i go to the
outside

454
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
outside
 

455
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,670
outside
and then

456
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
and then
 

457
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,990
and then
i pull him around

458
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
i pull him around
 

459
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,310
i pull him around
almost like a

460
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
almost like a
 

461
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,430
almost like a
shot clip

462
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
shot clip
 

463
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,870
shot clip
okay i generate centrifugal energy

464
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
okay i generate centrifugal energy
 

465
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,990
okay i generate centrifugal energy
uh with this centripetal energy

466
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,000
uh with this centripetal energy
 

467
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,389
uh with this centripetal energy
okay

468
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399

 

469
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,150

but what we're going to do instead

470
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
but what we're going to do instead
 

471
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,110
but what we're going to do instead
instead is i'm just doing

472
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
instead is i'm just doing
 

473
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,190
instead is i'm just doing
my power okay

474
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
my power okay
 

475
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,509
my power okay
my arms are going to open

476
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
my arms are going to open
 

477
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,710
my arms are going to open
and i'm going to move

478
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720

 

479
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,030

so that it touches his neck

480
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
so that it touches his neck
 

481
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,110
so that it touches his neck
what does that mean so that the next

482
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
what does that mean so that the next
 

483
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,670
what does that mean so that the next
inward spiral is in the right place for

484
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
inward spiral is in the right place for
 

485
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,110
inward spiral is in the right place for
the position that's how i move okay

486
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
the position that's how i move okay
 

487
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,110
the position that's how i move okay
let me move without the next inward

488
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
let me move without the next inward
 

489
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,069
let me move without the next inward
spiral to be in its place okay

490
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
spiral to be in its place okay
 

491
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,269
spiral to be in its place okay
so

492
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279

 

493
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,430

that's not gonna be an inner spiral now

494
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440
that's not gonna be an inner spiral now
 

495
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,829
that's not gonna be an inner spiral now
i'm gonna have to pull

496
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839

 

497
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,150

i know my arm from here

498
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
i know my arm from here
 

499
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,670
i know my arm from here
is going to go

500
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
is going to go
 

501
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,870
is going to go
boom

502
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
boom
 

503
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,269
boom
right into the inner spiral

504
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
right into the inner spiral
 

505
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:33,110
right into the inner spiral
huh

506
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120

 

507
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,190

so look if you look here

508
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
so look if you look here
 

509
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,829
so look if you look here
it's not where it needs to be so i have

510
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
it's not where it needs to be so i have
 

511
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,110
it's not where it needs to be so i have
to move

512
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
to move
 

513
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,790
to move
so that it can be

514
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
so that it can be
 

515
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,350
so that it can be
where it needs to be

516
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,360
where it needs to be
 

517
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,069
where it needs to be
i don't chase him with my hands my hands

518
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
i don't chase him with my hands my hands
 

519
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,870
i don't chase him with my hands my hands
do the pattern i move my body so that

520
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:48,880
do the pattern i move my body so that
 

521
00:13:48,880 --> 00:14:05,910
do the pattern i move my body so that
that pattern is in the right place

522
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920

 

523
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:17,990

wow

524
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000

 

525
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,910

no reaching

526
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
no reaching
 

527
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,670
no reaching
no reaching

528
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
no reaching
 

529
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,069
no reaching
no changing the shape

530
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
no changing the shape
 

531
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,870
no changing the shape
okay so

532
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
okay so
 

533
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,470
okay so
get on

534
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480
get on
 

535
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,150
get on
shoot on goes right into

536
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
shoot on goes right into
 

537
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,310
shoot on goes right into
the next inverse spiral

538
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
the next inverse spiral
 

539
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,189
the next inverse spiral
on the head on the head back

540
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199

 

541
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,350

so

542
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360

 

543
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,550

very sophisticated martial principles

544
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
very sophisticated martial principles
 

545
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,150
very sophisticated martial principles

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
i don't want to come underneath and
 

723
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,710
i don't want to come underneath and
he'll hold me in the face

724
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
he'll hold me in the face
 

725
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,990
he'll hold me in the face
so i'm not going to come underneath and

726
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
so i'm not going to come underneath and
 

727
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,909
so i'm not going to come underneath and
hook you with my

728
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
hook you with my
 

729
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,150
hook you with my
fingers like some of you are again to do

730
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
fingers like some of you are again to do
 

731
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,430
fingers like some of you are again to do
the turning

732
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,440
the turning
 

733
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,590
the turning
right or worse

734
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600

 

735
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,310

again you're dreaming you're unchecked

736
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
again you're dreaming you're unchecked
 

737
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,669
again you're dreaming you're unchecked
it's not going to happen

738
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
it's not going to happen
 

739
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,590
it's not going to happen
that's where the check is

740
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
that's where the check is
 

741
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,750
that's where the check is
but that's where the check stays until

742
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
but that's where the check stays until
 

743
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,549
but that's where the check stays until
guess what the kazushi

744
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:54,559
guess what the kazushi
 

745
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,470
guess what the kazushi
repurposes it

746
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480
repurposes it
 

747
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,750
repurposes it
he comes up

748
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
he comes up
 

749
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,430
he comes up
it's right there

750
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
it's right there
 

751
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,430
it's right there
you see it's that little guy oh

752
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440

 

753
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,230

so

754
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
so
 

755
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,310
so
we have a concept of control maintenance

756
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
we have a concept of control maintenance
 

757
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,390
we have a concept of control maintenance
i go from one control point to the other

758
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
i go from one control point to the other
 

759
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,070
i go from one control point to the other
control point before i replace the

760
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,080
control point before i replace the
 

761
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,350
control point before i replace the
control point so both the check

762
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
control point so both the check
 

763
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,870
control point so both the check
and the kazushi are on at the same time

764
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
and the kazushi are on at the same time
 

765
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,430
and the kazushi are on at the same time
for a moment in time until the kazushi

766
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,440
for a moment in time until the kazushi
 

767
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,510
for a moment in time until the kazushi
takes over and then the check is no

768
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,520
takes over and then the check is no
 

769
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,870
takes over and then the check is no
longer needed

770
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
longer needed
 

771
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,029
longer needed
because she's checking the person

772
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:27,039
because she's checking the person
 

773
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,549
because she's checking the person
okay

774
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
okay
 

775
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,870
okay
again the reason you're doing it is

776
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:30,880
again the reason you're doing it is
 

777
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,870
again the reason you're doing it is
because you need

778
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
because you need
 

779
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,110
because you need
a push pull

780
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
a push pull
 

781
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,029
a push pull
to do the turn

782
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
to do the turn
 

783
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,950
to do the turn
you understand and you can't be the

784
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:38,960
you understand and you can't be the
 

785
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,630
you understand and you can't be the
center of the technique

786
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,640
center of the technique
 

787
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,710
center of the technique
and do a push-pull you have to think

788
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720
and do a push-pull you have to think
 

789
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,830
and do a push-pull you have to think
about that one okay it's not possible if

790
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
about that one okay it's not possible if
 

791
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,750
about that one okay it's not possible if
you're in the center of the technique

792
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
you're in the center of the technique
 

793
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,669
you're in the center of the technique
uh you're either pushing or you're

794
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
uh you're either pushing or you're
 

795
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,150
uh you're either pushing or you're
pulling but you can't do a pull that if

796
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
pulling but you can't do a pull that if
 

797
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,990
pulling but you can't do a pull that if
you do a push pull the center is

798
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
you do a push pull the center is
 

799
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,669
you do a push pull the center is
somewhere between you

800
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
somewhere between you
 

801
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,110
somewhere between you
do you get that

802
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
do you get that
 

803
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,990
do you get that
okay

804
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,000
okay
 

805
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,190
okay
so

806
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
so
 

807
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,110
so
a hair oh

808
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
a hair oh
 

809
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,630
a hair oh
and this hand stays there checking there

810
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
and this hand stays there checking there
 

811
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,549
and this hand stays there checking there
won't tell it's not needed then it's

812
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
won't tell it's not needed then it's
 

813
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,230
won't tell it's not needed then it's
repurposed

814
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240

 

815
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,669

the other way you can think about it is

816
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:11,679
the other way you can think about it is
 

817
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,110
the other way you can think about it is
the sword

818
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
the sword
 

819
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,270
the sword
if our swords are touching you're not

820
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
if our swords are touching you're not
 

821
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,870
if our swords are touching you're not
going to take your sword off of mine and

822
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
going to take your sword off of mine and
 

823
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,710
going to take your sword off of mine and
try to come around i'm going to cut this

824
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
try to come around i'm going to cut this
 

825
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,710
try to come around i'm going to cut this
 out of you right

826
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
out of you right
 

827
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,350
out of you right
okay you're just taking advantage of it

828
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,360
okay you're just taking advantage of it
 

829
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,029
okay you're just taking advantage of it
and it's king on

830
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:25,039
and it's king on
 

831
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,270
and it's king on
and there's no blades and stuff like

832
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,280
and there's no blades and stuff like
 

833
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,310
and there's no blades and stuff like
that but

834
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
that but
 

835
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,549
that but
again if i don't understand the martial

836
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:30,559
again if i don't understand the martial
 

837
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,549
again if i don't understand the martial
principles i should just do what my

838
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:32,559
principles i should just do what my
 

839
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,640
principles i should just do what my
teacher is doing until i do okay
