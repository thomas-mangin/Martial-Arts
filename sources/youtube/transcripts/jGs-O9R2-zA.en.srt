190
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:37,580

 

191
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,370

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
and
 

195
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,450
and
it made me sort of go from this really

196
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:47,460
it made me sort of go from this really
 

197
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,390
it made me sort of go from this really
positive person that traveled across the

00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:57,900
the top in the UK for my level you know
 

203
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,749
the top in the UK for my level you know
there was higher grades but I'm talking

204
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
there was higher grades but I'm talking
 

205
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,230
there was higher grades but I'm talking
about at second down level and I'd

206
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:03,240
about at second down level and I'd
 

207
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,870
about at second down level and I'd
recently got my second down

208
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:05,880
recently got my second down
 

209
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,450
recently got my second down
so it was a new second now

210
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:08,460
so it was a new second now
 

211
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,390
so it was a new second now
but there was these two first cues

212
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:11,400
but there was these two first cues
 

213
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,530
but there was these two first cues
during the 31 community

214
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:14,540
during the 31 community
 

215
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,050

00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:19,860
ridiculous it was like
 

219
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,790
ridiculous it was like
you know me being a third queue compared

220
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
you know me being a third queue compared
 

221
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,129
you know me being a third queue compared
with them being a first kid

so I realized the first 10 years of my
 

225
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,689

all this icono
 

253
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,730
all this icono
so over the years I I realized that

254
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:06,740
so over the years I I realized that
 

255
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,170
so over the years I I realized that
unbelow to me I was observing I was

256
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:11,180
unbelow to me I was observing I was
 

257
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,610
unbelow to me I was observing I was
observing people in the streets just

258
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:13,620
observing people in the streets just
 

259
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,110
observing people in the streets just
normal people if they had an unusual

266
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:27,660
so you just pick up these things and you
 

267
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,270
so you just pick up these things and you
don't know why you're looking at them

268
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
don't know why you're looking at them
 

269

a case of you spot these things you you
 

273
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,550
a case of you spot these things you you
see something and you you just analyze

274
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:37,560
see something and you you just analyze
 

275
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,529
see something and you you just analyze
it in a

276
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:39,539
it in a
 

277
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:44,629
it in a
in a millisecond then you've analyzed it

278
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639

 

279
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,390

and over the years I've been trying to

280
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,400
and over the years I've been trying to
 

281
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,090
and over the years I've been trying to
find out more about how my mind works

282
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:50,100
find out more about how my mind works
 

283
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,409
find out more about how my mind works
and how if you get mind control

284
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:54,419

 

285
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,650

and it's like my head has become like a

286
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:57,660
and it's like my head has become like a
 

287
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,050
and it's like my head has become like a
cake and divided into all these

288
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,060
cake and divided into all these
 

289
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,210
cake and divided into all these
different segments

290
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:02,220
different segments
 

291
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,590
different segments
of what I think we get for my kiddo

292
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:06,600
of what I think we get for my kiddo
 

293
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,309
of what I think we get for my kiddo

294
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319

 

295
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,950

what we observe

296
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
what we observe
 

297
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,590
what we observe
is because I believe from the weapons

298
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:15,600
is because I believe from the weapons
 

299
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,870
is because I believe from the weapons
that you have to switch

300
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:17,880
that you have to switch
 

301
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,930
that you have to switch
switch on you become attuned and once

302
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:20,940
switch on you become attuned and once
 

303
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,510
switch on you become attuned and once
you become attuned that switch

304
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
you become attuned that switch
 

305
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,790
you become attuned that switch
eventually will stay in the on position

306
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800

this works every single time if you
 

371
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,449
this works every single time if you
watch a professional match

372

now
I never thought of it before until

376
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:04,380
I never thought of it before until
 

377
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,650
I never thought of it before until
yesterday

378
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:06,660
yesterday
 

379
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,970
yesterday
but

380
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:07,980
but
 

381
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,850
but
how do they know I mean these balls have

382
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:10,860
how do they know I mean these balls have
 

383
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,070
how do they know I mean these balls have
changed every few

384
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,080
changed every few
 

385
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,430
changed every few
uh sets or matches I don't know enough

386
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:16,440
uh sets or matches I don't know enough

about tennis to be correct but after

388
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
about tennis to be correct but after
 

389
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,630
about tennis to be correct but after
they've played several uh games

390
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:23,640
they've played several uh games
 

391
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,810
they've played several uh games
they you hear new balls please

they you hear new balls please
 

393
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,690
they you hear new balls please
so the balls aren't worn out are they

394
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:29,700
so the balls aren't worn out are they
 

395
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,389
so the balls aren't worn out are they
they're they're regularly changed and if

396
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
they're they're regularly changed and if
 

397
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,430
they're they're regularly changed and if
you can tell a good ball from a bad Bowl

398
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440

 

399
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,570

um

400
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:38,580
um
 

401
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,790
um
then you'd think they must see something

402
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
then you'd think they must see something
 

403
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,990
then you'd think they must see something
on the ball

404
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
on the ball
 

405
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,210
on the ball
and that's what gives them the

406
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:44,220
and that's what gives them the
 

407
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,850
and that's what gives them the
indication

408
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:46,860

 

409
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,269

so I just thought that it was uh viewing

410
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:50,279
so I just thought that it was uh viewing
 

411
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,190
so I just thought that it was uh viewing
like looking at Apples knowing whether

412
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,200
like looking at Apples knowing whether
 

413
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,829
like looking at Apples knowing whether
it's a good apple or bad apple in a

414
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:54,839
it's a good apple or bad apple in a
 

415
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,110
it's a good apple or bad apple in a
millisecond

416
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
millisecond
 

417
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,350
millisecond
but then I was watching um a little bit

418
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:00,360
but then I was watching um a little bit
 

419
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,690
but then I was watching um a little bit
deeper because it's suddenly made me

420
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:02,700
deeper because it's suddenly made me
 

421
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,470
deeper because it's suddenly made me
realize why do they bother to even all

422
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
realize why do they bother to even all
 

423
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,990
realize why do they bother to even all
the balls are new why bother to select

424
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,000
the balls are new why bother to select
 

425
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,389
the balls are new why bother to select
them why don't they just take two balls

426
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:11,399
them why don't they just take two balls
 

427
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,490
them why don't they just take two balls
one to point in their pocket one to

428
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:13,500
one to point in their pocket one to
 

429
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,949
one to point in their pocket one to
serve with and then get two balls next

430
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:15,959
serve with and then get two balls next
 

431
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,470
serve with and then get two balls next
time why do they go through three or

432
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
time why do they go through three or
 

433
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,130
time why do they go through three or
four throw two away go back to two

434
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:24,140

 

435
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,530

so I I've always thought for years that

436
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:27,540
so I I've always thought for years that
 

437
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,329
so I I've always thought for years that
they obviously see something on the ball

438
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:29,339
they obviously see something on the ball
 

439
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,210
they obviously see something on the ball
a scarf or something like apple and they

440
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:32,220
a scarf or something like apple and they
 

441
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,430
a scarf or something like apple and they
throw it away

442
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:34,440
throw it away
 

443
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,910
throw it away
so here's the point of both of the films

444
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
so here's the point of both of the films
 

445
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,710
so here's the point of both of the films
that I've made

446
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:39,720
that I've made
 

447
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,350
that I've made
I realized that

448
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:42,360
I realized that
 

449
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,410
I realized that
if I look a little bit closer they often

450
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:45,420
if I look a little bit closer they often
 

451
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,990
if I look a little bit closer they often
take the balls and they throw one away

452
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
take the balls and they throw one away
 

453
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,130
take the balls and they throw one away
without looking at them

454
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,140

 

455
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,530

so how do they know

456
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:54,540
so how do they know
 

457
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,230
so how do they know
what ball to throw away

458
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,240
what ball to throw away
 

459
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,870
what ball to throw away
and I believe that's because our

460
00:10:59,870 --> 00:10:59,880
and I believe that's because our
 

461
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,810
and I believe that's because our
intuition

462
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:01,820
intuition
 

463
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,610
intuition
the more years we do Aikido and the more

464
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:04,620
the more years we do Aikido and the more
 

465
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,750
the more years we do Aikido and the more
years we do any martial art or sport or

466
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:08,760
years we do any martial art or sport or
 

467
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,829
years we do any martial art or sport or
anything where we're perfecting the art

468
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
anything where we're perfecting the art
 

469
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,530
anything where we're perfecting the art
we're also perfecting the mind

470
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:15,540
we're also perfecting the mind
 

471
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,030
we're also perfecting the mind
and sometimes we don't put enough into

472
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
and sometimes we don't put enough into
 

473
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,970
and sometimes we don't put enough into
them giving the Mind time and we give

474
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:22,980
them giving the Mind time and we give
 

475
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,210
them giving the Mind time and we give
too much to doing the technical

476
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:26,220
too much to doing the technical
 

477
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,210
too much to doing the technical
but the mind is a thing that

478
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:29,220
but the mind is a thing that
 

479
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,009
but the mind is a thing that
as I said

480
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:31,019
as I said
 

481
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,990
as I said
they might the tennis player may be

482
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,000
they might the tennis player may be
 

483
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,470
they might the tennis player may be
winning winning they get over the six

484
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
winning winning they get over the six
 

485
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,509
winning winning they get over the six
games they're even the other person's

486
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:38,519
games they're even the other person's
 

487
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,670
games they're even the other person's
got six they've got six

488
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:40,680
got six they've got six
 

489
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,490
got six they've got six
then also the tie break comes

490
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:43,500
then also the tie break comes
 

491
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,590
then also the tie break comes
the younger more inexperienced in years

492
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:48,600
the younger more inexperienced in years
 

493
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,630
the younger more inexperienced in years
not always

494
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:50,640
not always
 

495
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,410
not always
but mainly what I've watched

496
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:54,420
but mainly what I've watched
 

497
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,690
but mainly what I've watched
loses the tie break

498
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:56,700
loses the tie break
 

499
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,170
loses the tie break
because they just they can't hit the

500
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:00,180
because they just they can't hit the
 

501
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,810
because they just they can't hit the
accurate shots because they'd so

502
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:02,820
accurate shots because they'd so
 

503
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,569
accurate shots because they'd so
desperately want to win and that makes

504
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:05,579
