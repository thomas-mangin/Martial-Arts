the internal aspect your extra last way

276
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,060
the internal aspect your extra last way
 

277
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,690
the internal aspect your extra last way
so you only have one mind you don't have

much angle this way well guess what that

286
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:21,650
much angle this way well guess what that
 

287
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,150

for corner integrity okay so what

290
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:28,730
for corner integrity okay so what
 

291
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,870
for corner integrity okay so what
usually do is you going to see and then

292
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:31,880
usually do is you going to see and then
 

293
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,060
usually do is you going to see and then
you step in how you make it worse okay

294
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,070
you step in how you make it worse okay
 

295
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,430
you step in how you make it worse okay
so leave it where it is and practice it

296
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:38,440
so leave it where it is and practice it
 

297
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,330
so leave it where it is and practice it
it doesn't change but you have to do

298
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:43,340
it doesn't change but you have to do
 

299
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:50,290
it doesn't change but you have to do
that you would be doing that in the all

300
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:50,300
that you would be doing that in the all
 

301
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,080
that you would be doing that in the all
right so I go and walk around where you

302
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,090
right so I go and walk around where you
 

303
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,930
right so I go and walk around where you
can see right you see how much tension

304
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:55,940
can see right you see how much tension
 

305
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,530
can see right you see how much tension
there and this is the holdup

306
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:58,540
there and this is the holdup
 

307
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,990
there and this is the holdup
okay little ignore it okay

308
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
okay little ignore it okay
 

309
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,030
okay little ignore it okay
so I do not have that four corner

okay now here's what here's the solution
 

315
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,390
okay now here's what here's the solution
you guys use instead you see that but

00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:12,270
doing is pushing him away that means
 

539
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,210
doing is pushing him away that means
he's not underneath that means I'm not

540
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:14,220
he's not underneath that means I'm not
 

541
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,190
he's not underneath that means I'm not
controlling him and we're gonna keep

that's where I'm doing look at the curve

550
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:31,190
that's where I'm doing look at the curve
 

551
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,740
that's where I'm doing look at the curve
and see the curve

552
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:32,750
and see the curve
 

553
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:40,950

00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:33,559
that's happy well then you don't really
 

561
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:37,120
that's happy well then you don't really
have to follow but more importantly the

lucky you don't have that concept and so

566
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:44,960
lucky you don't have that concept and so
 

567
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,249
lucky you don't have that concept and so
we wouldn't you want everything every

you don't have the projection capacity

580
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:12,460
you don't have the projection capacity
 

581
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,420
you don't have the projection capacity
you don't feel we're easy though so you

582
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:16,430
you don't feel we're easy though so you
 

583
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:21,640
you don't feel we're easy though so you
will understand why are you in front it

584
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:21,650
will understand why are you in front it
 

585

go well what happens when the person
 

595
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:41,050
go well what happens when the person
comes into your body right well that's

596
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,060
comes into your body right well that's
 

597
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,240
comes into your body right well that's
what you're trying to push and you get

598
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,250
what you're trying to push and you get
 

599
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,220
what you're trying to push and you get
you the person has more more mass more

600

here's some adaptation if you're

610
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:04,550
here's some adaptation if you're

620
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:19,869
make that first projection that first
 

621
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:21,960
make that first projection that first
projection is more of a master key move

622
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:21,970
projection is more of a master key move
 

623
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:26,760
projection is more of a master key move
then this little handle okay so some of

624
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:26,770
then this little handle okay so some of
 

625
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,309
then this little handle okay so some of
the things I've seen is your state

626
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:29,319
the things I've seen is your state
 

627
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:34,440
the things I've seen is your state
normal line it doesn't have to be a big

629
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:39,829
normal line it doesn't have to be a big
huge thing and the bigger you make it

00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:39,839
huge thing and the bigger you make it
 

631
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,980

the less fat raise a massive ki-moon and

632
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:43,990
the less fat raise a massive ki-moon and
 

633
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,780
the less fat raise a massive ki-moon and
now with this becomes one of the

634
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:45,790
now with this becomes one of the
 

635
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:49,799
now with this becomes one of the
elements of the narrow okay but because

636
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:49,809
elements of the narrow okay but because
 

637

640
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:55,780
in with whatever right good whatever I
 

641
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:59,099
in with whatever right good whatever I
can't go like this it doesn't work okay

642
00:42:59,099 --> 00:42:59,109
can't go like this it doesn't work okay
 

643
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,859
can't go like this it doesn't work okay
it's gotta be very something up I was it

644
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:01,869
it's gotta be very something up I was it
 

645
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:03,870
it's gotta be very something up I was it
do we want the I'm going to get the

646
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:03,880
do we want the I'm going to get the
 

647
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,000
do we want the I'm going to get the
angle right there you see this angle is

648
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,010
angle right there you see this angle is
 

649
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:10,740
angle right there you see this angle is
line and then the so the more I can make

650
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:10,750
line and then the so the more I can make
 

651
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:19,470
line and then the so the more I can make
my initial technique and then I

652
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:19,480
my initial technique and then I
 

653
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,870
my initial technique and then I
recommend there's the it right is

654
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:21,880
recommend there's the it right is
 

655
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:30,000
recommend there's the it right is
orchard here comes down and once you get
