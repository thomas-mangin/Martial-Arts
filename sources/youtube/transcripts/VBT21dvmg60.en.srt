00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:27,920
but you ask a question you ask a
 

25
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,070
but you ask a question you ask a
question mentally so because you're

26
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
question mentally so because you're
 

27
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,069
question mentally so because you're
seeing this album go down they're saying

28
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
seeing this album go down they're saying
 

29
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,990

this can't go down but that's because
 

31
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,350
this can't go down but that's because
he's falling down

32
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360

 

33
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,950

so of course he's going to get down but

34
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
so of course he's going to get down but

and watching
the hand following the person down and

44
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
the hand following the person down and
 

45
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,990
the hand following the person down and
so this is where you should uh you know

46
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000
so this is where you should uh you know
 

47
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,189
so this is where you should uh you know
this see i'm holding him up the same

48
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
this see i'm holding him up the same
 

49
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,869
this see i'm holding him up the same
technique as kite

50
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
technique as kite
 

51
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,270
technique as kite
i've got control of him he hasn't

52
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
i've got control of him he hasn't
 

53
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,150
i've got control of him he hasn't
controlled himself he just thinks yes

54
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
controlled himself he just thinks yes
 

55
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,750
controlled himself he just thinks yes
so you

56
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
so you
 

57
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,910
so you
know

58
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
know
 

59
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,149
know
so

60
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
so
 

61
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,109
so
you do this you spin them all right it's

62
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
you do this you spin them all right it's
 

63
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,149
you do this you spin them all right it's
like a tammy but to send a wave through

his body
 

67
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,469
his body
so you go one and you go like that you

68
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
so you go one and you go like that you
 

69
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,350
so you go one and you go like that you

81
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,350
that direction
if i choose a cut down

82
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
if i choose a cut down

a lot of senses don't like being made to
 

95
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,389
a lot of senses don't like being made to
look before because

96
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399

my knee goes out

116
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
my knee goes out
 

117
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,110
my knee goes out
my direction goes there and then i

118
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
my direction goes there and then i
 

119
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,830
my direction goes there and then i
follow them down as they fall i follow

120
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
follow them down as they fall i follow
 

121
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,190
follow them down as they fall i follow
them i follow them so i have control i

122
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
them i follow them so i have control i
 

123
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,030
them i follow them so i have control i
step in

124
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
step in
 

125
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,390
step in
so this is basic

126
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400

 

127
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,270

this is basic copy dozer

128
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280

 

129
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,030

00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
people
 

139
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,430
people
we take the knee like that and we take

140
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
we take the knee like that and we take
 

141
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,949
we take the knee like that and we take
it right over there

142
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
it right over there
 

143
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,150
it right over there
and this arm instead of falling down

144
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
and this arm instead of falling down
 

145
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,550
and this arm instead of falling down
where where it was on the knee instead

146
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
where where it was on the knee instead
 

147
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,309
where where it was on the knee instead
of falling down there

148
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
of falling down there
 

149
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,589
of falling down there
we tend to they'll tend to move it

150
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
we tend to they'll tend to move it
 

151
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,910
we tend to they'll tend to move it
danny's good because he's not letting me

152
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920
danny's good because he's not letting me
 

153
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,710
danny's good because he's not letting me
try to show you it wrong

154
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
try to show you it wrong
 

155
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,710
try to show you it wrong
so he's not letting me take over a lot

156
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
so he's not letting me take over a lot
 

157
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,229
so he's not letting me take over a lot
of people do that because it it helps me

158
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
of people do that because it it helps me
 

159
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,750
of people do that because it it helps me
get this next bit of the technique

160
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
get this next bit of the technique
 

161
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,710
get this next bit of the technique
so

162
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
so
 

163
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,670
so
if i cheat if i cheat

164
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
if i cheat if i cheat
 

165
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,869
if i cheat if i cheat
and do that then he's already leaning so

166
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
and do that then he's already leaning so
 

167
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,670
and do that then he's already leaning so
with this hand on here i can

168
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
with this hand on here i can
 

169
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,910
with this hand on here i can
do the technique

170
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
do the technique
 

171
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,309
do the technique
