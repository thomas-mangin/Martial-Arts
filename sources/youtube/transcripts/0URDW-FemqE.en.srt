We did these drills
 

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,549
We did these drills
and

4
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
and

trying to use this. So you you had

12
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
trying to use this. So you you had
 

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,590
trying to use this. So you you had
touched my arm. Remember how mush how

I focus on my spine

18
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
I focus on my spine
 

19
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,429
I focus on my spine
and I release the tension that's

20
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
and I release the tension that's
 

21
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,150
and I release the tension that's
happening. So

22
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
happening. So
 

23
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,110
happening. So
there's no strain in my voice.

24
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
there's no strain in my voice.
 

25

00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,000
He has to do what I'm telling him. So he
 

27
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,590
He has to do what I'm telling him. So he
has to push with his muscles, but I

28
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
has to push with his muscles, but I
 

29
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,389
has to push with his muscles, but I
don't push my muscles. And I just if I

30
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
don't push my muscles. And I just if I
 

31
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,190
don't push my muscles. And I just if I
feel any tension,

32
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
feel any tension,
 

33
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,229

I don't try for any kind of manipulation
for angles. I just where he's going. He

38
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
for angles. I just where he's going. He
 

39
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,550
for angles. I just where he's going. He
got tired. I just letting that go down.

40
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:06,560

 

41
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,789

This is loose.

42
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799

 

43
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,190

Now I saw some of you you have foot

44
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
Now I saw some of you you have foot
 

45
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,190
Now I saw some of you you have foot
bandages.

46
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
bandages.
 

47
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,109
bandages.
Seems like it shouldn't be possible, but

48
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
Seems like it shouldn't be possible, but
 

49
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,270
Seems like it shouldn't be possible, but
it is possible

50
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
it is possible
 

51
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,390
it is possible
that you're bracing with your feet.

52
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
that you're bracing with your feet.
 

53
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,990
that you're bracing with your feet.
Okay?

54
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay?
 

55
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,510
Okay?
And the energy should just go down.

56
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
And the energy should just go down.
 

57
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,990
And the energy should just go down.
Not not if you flex your legs, you you

58
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
Not not if you flex your legs, you you
 

59
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,109
Not not if you flex your legs, you you
can get some, you know, lower body power

60
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
can get some, you know, lower body power
 

61
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,230
can get some, you know, lower body power
in there, but the angle is cutting this

62
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
in there, but the angle is cutting this
 

63
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,670
in there, but the angle is cutting this
way through your legs as opposed to just

64
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
way through your legs as opposed to just
 

65
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,789
way through your legs as opposed to just
down like this. Okay. I don't feel the

66
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
down like this. Okay. I don't feel the
 

67
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,469
down like this. Okay. I don't feel the
the sliding on my feet. Okay. So, even

68
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
the sliding on my feet. Okay. So, even
 

69
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,069
the sliding on my feet. Okay. So, even
though um you might feel relaxed here, I

70
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
though um you might feel relaxed here, I
 

71
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,069
though um you might feel relaxed here, I
want you to scan your whole body,

72
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
want you to scan your whole body,
 

73
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,950
want you to scan your whole body,
including down here. Okay. All right.

74

including down here. Okay. All right.
 

75
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,789
including down here. Okay. All right.
Let's just just get a little bit. We're

76
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
Let's just just get a little bit. We're
 

77
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,990
Let's just just get a little bit. We're
just going to do a little bit of that.

78
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
just going to do a little bit of that.
 

79
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,230
just going to do a little bit of that.
Okay. Try because I know some of you

80
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
Okay. Try because I know some of you
 

81
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,749
Okay. Try because I know some of you
already got those wounds, but those

82
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
already got those wounds, but those
 

83
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:24,150
already got those wounds, but those
wounds will help teach you.

84
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160

 

85
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,710

Just like the other days, you scan for

86
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
Just like the other days, you scan for
 

87
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,750
Just like the other days, you scan for
flexion and then release it. Keep your

88
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
flexion and then release it. Keep your
 

89
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,750
flexion and then release it. Keep your
spine extended.

90
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
spine extended.
 

91
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,509
spine extended.
And again, you're going to push pretty

92
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
And again, you're going to push pretty
 

93
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,350
And again, you're going to push pretty
hard. If you get tired, you can let go,

94
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
hard. If you get tired, you can let go,
 

95
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:47,270
hard. If you get tired, you can let go,
but you're going to push pretty hard.

96
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280

 

97
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,670

Keep your spine long.

98
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
Keep your spine long.
 

99
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,710
Keep your spine long.
Release all the tension.

100
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
Release all the tension.
 

101
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,270
Release all the tension.
Let the tissues other than the spine

102
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
Let the tissues other than the spine
 

103
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:11,030
Let the tissues other than the spine
drop.

104
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040

 

105
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,030

Try to keep

106
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
Try to keep
 

107
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:23,110
Try to keep
articulation angle.

108
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120

 

109
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,509

Okay.

110
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
Okay.
 

111
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,910
Okay.
So

112
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
So
 

113
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,470
So
if we look at this

114
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
if we look at this
 

115
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,990
if we look at this
somehow

116
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
somehow
 

117
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,550
somehow
I didn't turn

118
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
I didn't turn
 

119
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,390
I didn't turn
somehow I didn't go backwards that

120
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
somehow I didn't go backwards that
 

121
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,750
somehow I didn't go backwards that
happened everyone agree okay when we go

122
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
happened everyone agree okay when we go
 

123
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,270
happened everyone agree okay when we go
to standing

124
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280

 

125
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,830

I can't start using the other angles

126
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
I can't start using the other angles
 

127
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,589
I can't start using the other angles
because already when I braced on that

128
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
because already when I braced on that
 

129
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,949
because already when I braced on that
you can see that that came up that way

130
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
you can see that that came up that way
 

131
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,670
you can see that that came up that way
I have to figure out how Though I have

132
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
I have to figure out how Though I have
 

133
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,470
I have to figure out how Though I have
my legs, I don't use my legs. Do you get

134
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
my legs, I don't use my legs. Do you get
 

135
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,190
my legs, I don't use my legs. Do you get
it? Okay. So, I'm just here.

136
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200

 

137
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:16,870

Weight just goes down on that leg.

138
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880

 

139
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,710

You keep pushing. But how hard would you

140
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
You keep pushing. But how hard would you
 

141
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,310
You keep pushing. But how hard would you
say you're pushing? Okay.

142
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
say you're pushing? Okay.
 

143
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,230
say you're pushing? Okay.
But if you look at me, how hard does he

144
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
But if you look at me, how hard does he
 

145
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,030
But if you look at me, how hard does he
look like he's pushing? Not hard at all.

146
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
look like he's pushing? Not hard at all.
 

147
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,710
look like he's pushing? Not hard at all.
Okay, got it. Okay, we lift. We're

148
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
Okay, got it. Okay, we lift. We're

153
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,950
like, "Oh, yeah. Okay, go to the other
arm and try it." Okay. If the other

154
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
arm and try it." Okay. If the other
 

155
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,990
arm and try it." Okay. If the other
person gets the idea, go to the other

156
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
person gets the idea, go to the other
 

157
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,430
person gets the idea, go to the other
arm and try it. It's not We're not

158
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
arm and try it. It's not We're not
 

159
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,110
arm and try it. It's not We're not
conditioning. We're doing a

coordination. Okay. All right. So, try
 

163
00:04:45,040 --> 00:05:22,230
coordination. Okay. All right. So, try
it.

164
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240

 

165
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:37,029

319
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,190
not in alignment. Okay. So, watch what
watch where the energy goes. And while

320
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
watch where the energy goes. And while
 

321
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:05,750
watch where the energy goes. And while
I'm pushing

322

It's going this way. And so the things
 

329
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,509
It's going this way. And so the things
that have to keep it out start to flex.

330
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
that have to keep it out start to flex.

348
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800

 

349
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,550

And if let's do this. If you bend this
 

357
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,949
And if let's do this. If you bend this
arm a little, now it goes into the

358
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
arm a little, now it goes into the
 

359
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,470
arm a little, now it goes into the
bicep.

360
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
bicep.
 

361
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,509
bicep.
So leave it. Leave the articulation

362
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519

Right there.
 

367
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,670
Right there.
So you this doesn't move. Now energy

368
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
So you this doesn't move. Now energy
 

369
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,269
So you this doesn't move. Now energy
passes through it

370
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
passes through it
 

371
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:28,310
passes through it
to that leg back there.

372
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320

 

373
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,470

00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
got to get a good grip, uh, Chris, so
 

507
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,710
got to get a good grip, uh, Chris, so
that you can drive into him. There you

508
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
that you can drive into him. There you
 

509
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,029
that you can drive into him. There you
go.

510
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:51,039
go.
 

511
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,630
go.
You got your little center arms.

512
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:54,640
You got your little center arms.
 

513
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,110
You got your little center arms.
This is where you want.

514
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
This is where you want.
 

515
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,789
This is where you want.
See how much difference

516
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799

 

517
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:20,710

Take the other side.

518
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720

 

519
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:40,470

Try to keep that elbow inside.

520
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480

 

521
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,830

This isn't loose.

522
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
This isn't loose.
 

523
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,029
This isn't loose.
Okay, this is what we want. Okay, try

524
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
Okay, this is what we want. Okay, try
 

525
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,830
Okay, this is what we want. Okay, try
again.

526
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840

 

527
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,750

Risk it. It's okay if we get pushed

528
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:53,760
Risk it. It's okay if we get pushed
 

529
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,669
Risk it. It's okay if we get pushed
over. We're learning.

530
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
over. We're learning.
 

531
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,630
over. We're learning.
So, see how your palm's not on there?

532
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640
So, see how your palm's not on there?
 

533
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,190
So, see how your palm's not on there?
Yeah. Because he's he's he's got some

534
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
Yeah. Because he's he's he's got some
 

535
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,750
Yeah. Because he's he's he's got some
weird angle on you. So, I'm shorter than

536
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
weird angle on you. So, I'm shorter than
 

537
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,990
weird angle on you. So, I'm shorter than
you. And he wants you to lift up. He

538
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
you. And he wants you to lift up. He
 

539
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,470
you. And he wants you to lift up. He
wants you to do it like that. Okay. So,

540
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
wants you to do it like that. Okay. So,
 

541
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,950
wants you to do it like that. Okay. So,
you just go like,

542
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
you just go like,
 

543
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,430
you just go like,
okay, you're just here like this. And

544
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440
okay, you're just here like this. And
 

545
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,270
okay, you're just here like this. And
you're pushing into him. He keeps

546
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
you're pushing into him. He keeps
 

547
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,990
you're pushing into him. He keeps
wanting to pick it up. I don't want him

548
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
wanting to pick it up. I don't want him
 

549
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,950
wanting to pick it up. I don't want him
to pick it up. I'm just down here.

550
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:20,960
to pick it up. I'm just down here.
 

551
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,230
to pick it up. I'm just down here.
Okay. Try it again.

552
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240

 

553
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,789

Don't pick it up.

554
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:28,799
Don't pick it up.
 

555
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:51,110
Don't pick it up.
Stay where you are.

556
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120

 

557
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:59,350

Okay.

558
00:19:59,350 --> 00:19:59,360

 

559
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,789

Why do you think that I can shake this

560
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
Why do you think that I can shake this
 

561
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,190
Why do you think that I can shake this
hand and not be pushed over?

562
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
hand and not be pushed over?
 

563
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,430
hand and not be pushed over?
Why do you think?

564
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440

 

565
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,990

Exactly. Has nothing to do with what

566
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
Exactly. Has nothing to do with what
 

567
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,590
Exactly. Has nothing to do with what
we're doing. Okay.

568
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
we're doing. Okay.
 

569
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,789
we're doing. Okay.
And but at the beginning

570
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
And but at the beginning
 

571
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,990
And but at the beginning
you're going to you're going to

572
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,000
you're going to you're going to
 

573
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,990
you're going to you're going to
overshoot because we're not coordinated.

574
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000
overshoot because we're not coordinated.
 

575
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,710
overshoot because we're not coordinated.
And I I say make that mistake. Flex

576
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
And I I say make that mistake. Flex
 

577
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,789
And I I say make that mistake. Flex
freaking everything. And then you start

578
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
freaking everything. And then you start
 

579
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,390
freaking everything. And then you start
realizing don't need that. Don't need

580
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400
realizing don't need that. Don't need
 

581
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,990
realizing don't need that. Don't need
that. Don't need that. Okay. So

582
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,000

 

583
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,310

he he's driving.

584
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
he he's driving.
 

585
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,630
he he's driving.
I don't need that. I don't need this.

586
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:44,640
I don't need that. I don't need this.
 

587
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,789
I don't need that. I don't need this.
I don't need I don't need any of that

588
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,799
I don't need I don't need any of that
 

589
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,470
I don't need I don't need any of that
stuff right now. I'm having you lock

590
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
stuff right now. I'm having you lock
 

591
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,669
stuff right now. I'm having you lock
your spine. You see? But he's driving,

592
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:51,679
your spine. You see? But he's driving,
 

593
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,590
your spine. You see? But he's driving,
right? You're driving, right? And I

594
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,600
right? You're driving, right? And I
 

595
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,149
right? You're driving, right? And I
don't need any of the I don't need any

596
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:56,159
don't need any of the I don't need any
 

597
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,190
don't need any of the I don't need any
of it. Just change what's happening.

598
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,200
of it. Just change what's happening.
 

599
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,270
of it. Just change what's happening.
Okay. So,

600
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,280
Okay. So,
 

601
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,590
Okay. So,
why this is important is because right

602
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,600
why this is important is because right
 

603
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,870
why this is important is because right
now when I flex everything, I can't move

604
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:10,880
now when I flex everything, I can't move
 

605
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,110
now when I flex everything, I can't move
and I need to be able to move. And

606
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,120
and I need to be able to move. And
 

607
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,990
and I need to be able to move. And
that's where the second drill comes in.

608
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
that's where the second drill comes in.
 

609
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,230
that's where the second drill comes in.
But influence. It's not as complicated

610
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
But influence. It's not as complicated
 

611
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,070
But influence. It's not as complicated
as this,

612
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080
as this,
 

613
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,310
as this,
but you're going to shift your weight.

614
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,320
but you're going to shift your weight.
 

615
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,230
but you're going to shift your weight.
It's a cultivation field, so it's very

616
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,240
It's a cultivation field, so it's very
 

617
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,909
It's a cultivation field, so it's very
simple. So, we're on the back foot. I

618
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:29,919
simple. So, we're on the back foot. I
 

619
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,909
simple. So, we're on the back foot. I
leave everything exactly where it is,

620
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919
leave everything exactly where it is,
 

621
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,029
leave everything exactly where it is,
and I go to the front foot.

622
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:35,039
and I go to the front foot.
 

623
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,230
and I go to the front foot.
See, I did that. If you're if you're

624
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
See, I did that. If you're if you're
 

625
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,950
See, I did that. If you're if you're
over flex, you're like,

626
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960
over flex, you're like,
 

627
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,230
over flex, you're like,
"All right." And what you're going to do

628
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
"All right." And what you're going to do
 

629
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,310
"All right." And what you're going to do
is under flex and then you got pushed

630
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
is under flex and then you got pushed
 

631
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,990
is under flex and then you got pushed
over. Okay? So that's what drill two is

632
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,000
over. Okay? So that's what drill two is
 

633
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,190
over. Okay? So that's what drill two is
working on.

634
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,200
working on.
 

635
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,870
working on.
You go to the back foot. Cool. And now

636
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:54,880
You go to the back foot. Cool. And now
 

637
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,350
You go to the back foot. Cool. And now
move to the front foot without the

638
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
move to the front foot without the
 

639
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,549
move to the front foot without the
rotation, without the push. Okay. When

640
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
rotation, without the push. Okay. When
 

641
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,510
rotation, without the push. Okay. When
you're the watch,

642
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
you're the watch,
 

643
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,029
you're the watch,
he does not absorb the energy. He is a

644
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
he does not absorb the energy. He is a
 

645
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,390
he does not absorb the energy. He is a
good barbell. Okay.

646
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:10,400
good barbell. Okay.
 

647
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,470
good barbell. Okay.
So there. And then I just move. See how

648
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,480
So there. And then I just move. See how
 

649
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,789
So there. And then I just move. See how
he keeps pushing? He keeps his arm

650
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:16,799
he keeps pushing? He keeps his arm
 

651
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,310
he keeps pushing? He keeps his arm
extended. Okay? Usually the person goes

652
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,320
extended. Okay? Usually the person goes
 

653
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,149
extended. Okay? Usually the person goes
like this. We don't want that. We want

654
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
like this. We don't want that. We want
 

655
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,110
like this. We don't want that. We want
the barbell to stay rigid the entire

656
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
the barbell to stay rigid the entire
 

657
00:22:25,120 --> 00:23:10,789
the barbell to stay rigid the entire
time. Okay? All right. Try

658
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:10,799

 

659
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:19,669

Keep your feet flat.

660
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:19,679

 

661
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,350

But that that's what we're working on.

662
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,360
But that that's what we're working on.
 

663
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:31,590
But that that's what we're working on.
You see?

664
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600

 

665
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,750

And don't pull. Don't pull them because

the opposite. So, yes, our hand

816
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:15,679
the opposite. So, yes, our hand
 

817
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,310
the opposite. So, yes, our hand
is at this level. And yes, his center of

818
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,320
is at this level. And yes, his center of
 

819
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,190
is at this level. And yes, his center of
gravity is at that level. His center of

820
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,200
gravity is at that level. His center of
 

821
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,870
gravity is at that level. His center of
gravity is not here. It's in here. Okay.

822
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:26,880
gravity is not here. It's in here. Okay.
 

823
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,870
gravity is not here. It's in here. Okay.
So, when I move myself at that

824
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:28,880
So, when I move myself at that
 

825
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,389
So, when I move myself at that
structure, I move his center

826
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:34,399
structure, I move his center
 

827
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,710
structure, I move his center
when I do this.

828
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
when I do this.
 

829
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,149
when I do this.
I'm not going to come up in the

where I'm touching I move the center.

834
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:46,399
where I'm touching I move the center.
 

835
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,269
where I'm touching I move the center.
Okay. So, what would be the difference?

836
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:49,279
Okay. So, what would be the difference?
 

837
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,310
Okay. So, what would be the difference?
If we go if we're going slow, if I'm up

838
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
If we go if we're going slow, if I'm up
 

839
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,710
If we go if we're going slow, if I'm up
in his shoulders, you'll see that the

840
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:54,720
in his shoulders, you'll see that the
 

841
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,710
in his shoulders, you'll see that the
slack go there. If I'm in his center,

842
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
slack go there. If I'm in his center,
 

843
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,630
slack go there. If I'm in his center,
you'll because the body's going to be

844
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:00,640
you'll because the body's going to be
 

845
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,430
you'll because the body's going to be
unified. The shoulders aren't leading.

846
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:03,440
unified. The shoulders aren't leading.
 

847
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,630
unified. The shoulders aren't leading.
You see that difference? Okay. So, I

848
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:06,640
You see that difference? Okay. So, I
 

849
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,870
You see that difference? Okay. So, I
know it's heavy. I know that if I do

850
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
know it's heavy. I know that if I do
 

851
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,389
know it's heavy. I know that if I do
that, I'm going to lose the structure.

852
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:10,399
that, I'm going to lose the structure.
 

853
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,870
that, I'm going to lose the structure.
But that's part of the drill. Push into

854
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:12,880
But that's part of the drill. Push into
 

855
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:53,990
But that's part of the drill. Push into
the center. Okay. Try

856
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,000

 

857
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,669

Oh,

858
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:55,679
Oh,
 

859
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,990
Oh,
you you you went like that. You're going

860
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,000
you you you went like that. You're going
 

861
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,789
you you you went like that. You're going
like this. Okay. You want to in this

862
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:00,799
like this. Okay. You want to in this
 

863
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,070
like this. Okay. You want to in this
drill, you want to keep the same

864
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,080
drill, you want to keep the same
 

865
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,269
drill, you want to keep the same
structure. Just moving it from one

866
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:05,279
structure. Just moving it from one
 

867
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,950
structure. Just moving it from one
midfoot to the other with the same

868
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:06,960
midfoot to the other with the same
 

869
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:16,389
midfoot to the other with the same
structure. That's it. That's the drill.

870
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:16,399

 

871
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,549

Just move it to the other. Don't go

872
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
Just move it to the other. Don't go
 

873
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,230
Just move it to the other. Don't go
around the center.

874
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,240

 

875
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,070

Change.

876
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,080
Change.
 

877
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,070
Change.
You with someone light, go with someone

878
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,080
You with someone light, go with someone
 

879
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,110
You with someone light, go with someone
heavy with someone heavy. Sure, I'll go

880
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
heavy with someone heavy. Sure, I'll go
 

881
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,630
heavy with someone heavy. Sure, I'll go
with someone light.

882
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:34,640

 

883
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,269

Less, right? What? What do we do? I'm

884
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:37,279
Less, right? What? What do we do? I'm
 

885
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,070
Less, right? What? What do we do? I'm
trying to learn to lift. I'll use less

886
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,080
trying to learn to lift. I'll use less
 

887
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,870
trying to learn to lift. I'll use less
weight. I'll get the boosted. Okay. So,

888
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:42,880
weight. I'll get the boosted. Okay. So,
 

889
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,669
weight. I'll get the boosted. Okay. So,
that's work more on that. Am I doing the

890
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:45,679
that's work more on that. Am I doing the
 

891
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,509
that's work more on that. Am I doing the
movement the the the the um pointers

892
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:49,519
movement the the the the um pointers
 

893
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,230
movement the the the the um pointers
that I was skipping? And I stop testing

894
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
that I was skipping? And I stop testing
 

895
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,630
that I was skipping? And I stop testing
myself with that I project them or not.

896
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:54,640
myself with that I project them or not.
 

897
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:10,149
myself with that I project them or not.
Okay. Try again.

898
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:10,159

 

899
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:38,069

Lock your body. Okay.

900
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:38,079

 

901
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,950

Try not to use your arm. Keep the same

902
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:40,960
Try not to use your arm. Keep the same
 

903
00:34:40,960 --> 00:35:00,550
Try not to use your arm. Keep the same
angle. Keep the same angle.

904
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:00,560

 

905
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,230

Bring your elbow inside your shoulder

906
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,240
Bring your elbow inside your shoulder
 

907
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,990
Bring your elbow inside your shoulder
line.

908
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,000

 

909
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,710

Went a little over the center. Went back

910
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:10,720
Went a little over the center. Went back
 

911
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,069
Went a little over the center. Went back
down.

912
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:14,079

 

913
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:29,349

Don't rotate. That's a different shape.

914
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:29,359

 

915
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,990

Okay, two pointers.

916
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,000

 

917
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,630

Don't waste 50% of your time.

918
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:38,640
Don't waste 50% of your time.
 

919
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,310
Don't waste 50% of your time.
So

920
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:40,320
So
 

921
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,390
So
when I push, I have the same spine.

922
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
when I push, I have the same spine.
 

923
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,190
when I push, I have the same spine.
I have the same ground pop. And I'm

924
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,200
I have the same ground pop. And I'm
 

925
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,990
I have the same ground pop. And I'm
pushing with that. I'm not pushing with

926
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,000
pushing with that. I'm not pushing with
 

927
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,670
pushing with that. I'm not pushing with
this.

928
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:53,680

 

929
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,750

I move, I push, he absorbs,

930
00:35:59,750 --> 00:35:59,760
I move, I push, he absorbs,
 

931
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,310
I move, I push, he absorbs,
he comes back. And I keep that same

932
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,320
he comes back. And I keep that same
 

933
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,430
he comes back. And I keep that same
organization.

934
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:09,440

 

935
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,990

I had it in the beginning. It comes

936
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,000
I had it in the beginning. It comes
 

937
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,069
I had it in the beginning. It comes
forward. I changed it.

938
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:16,079
forward. I changed it.
 

939
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,750
forward. I changed it.
Had it in the beginning. It goes

940
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,760
Had it in the beginning. It goes
 

941
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,270
Had it in the beginning. It goes
forward. I changed it.

942
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,280
forward. I changed it.
 

943
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,990
forward. I changed it.
I changed it a little. I held it for a

944
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,000
I changed it a little. I held it for a
 

945
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,990
I changed it a little. I held it for a
little and I took it off.

946
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,000

 

947
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,990

What I did

948
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,000

 

949
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,870

is I teach the people to do this and

950
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:36,880
is I teach the people to do this and
 

951
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,829
is I teach the people to do this and
people statistically

952
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:39,839
people statistically
 

953
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,589
people statistically
here. It's going to be weird, but it's

954
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:41,599
here. It's going to be weird, but it's
 

955
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,190
here. It's going to be weird, but it's
going to make sense because I'm not

956
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200
going to make sense because I'm not
 

957
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,829
going to make sense because I'm not
finding him. I'm learning a skill. Okay.

958
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:47,839
finding him. I'm learning a skill. Okay.
 

959
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,630
finding him. I'm learning a skill. Okay.
So, the more projectable I become, the

960
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:52,640
So, the more projectable I become, the
 

961
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,349
So, the more projectable I become, the
more projecting I can be. Okay? So,

962
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:57,359
more projecting I can be. Okay? So,
 

963
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,150
more projecting I can be. Okay? So,
in all of these where I let energy leak

964
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,160
in all of these where I let energy leak
 

965
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,510
in all of these where I let energy leak
out, I'm not projectable.

966
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:03,520
out, I'm not projectable.
 

967
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,109
out, I'm not projectable.
But that would have been the same thing

968
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,119
But that would have been the same thing
 

969
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,829
But that would have been the same thing
where I'm trying to project. So I'm

970
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:07,839
where I'm trying to project. So I'm
 

971
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,069
where I'm trying to project. So I'm
wasting time. So you want to make

972
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:10,079
wasting time. So you want to make
 

973
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,150
wasting time. So you want to make
yourself projectable

974
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,160
yourself projectable
 

975
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,109
yourself projectable
because oh and I'll keep that

976
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:15,119
because oh and I'll keep that
 

977
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,829
because oh and I'll keep that
organization until that force entirely

978
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:17,839
organization until that force entirely
 

979
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,630
organization until that force entirely
disappears out of my body on its own. I

980
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
disappears out of my body on its own. I
 

981
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,870
disappears out of my body on its own. I
will not take it out of my body. Do you

982
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:22,880
will not take it out of my body. Do you
 

983
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,069
will not take it out of my body. Do you
understand? You guys understand? So, I'm

984
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:26,079
understand? You guys understand? So, I'm
 

985
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,589
understand? You guys understand? So, I'm
not I'm not doing He goes

986
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:31,599
not I'm not doing He goes
 

987
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,790
not I'm not doing He goes
I didn't do that,

988
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:34,800
I didn't do that,
 

989
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,069
I didn't do that,
but I didn't go I'm off balance. Let me

990
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:38,079
but I didn't go I'm off balance. Let me
 

991
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,390
but I didn't go I'm off balance. Let me
absorb it.

992
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,400
absorb it.
 

993
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,510
absorb it.
I let myself be projectable. Boom.

994
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,520

 

995
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,550

Okay. Now, I take it off. All right. If

996
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:48,560
Okay. Now, I take it off. All right. If
 

997
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,550
Okay. Now, I take it off. All right. If
I'm going into the wall or I'm going

998
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:50,560
I'm going into the wall or I'm going
 

999
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,950
I'm going into the wall or I'm going
into someone else, I'll take it off. But

1000

The weight shifting still has to happen,
 

1125
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,950

going to get the same kind of prolonged,
 

1131
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,470
going to get the same kind of prolonged,
let's call it now, sluggish

that the one who's most projectable will

1162
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:50,240
that the one who's most projectable will
 

1163
00:44:50,240 --> 00:45:06,550
that the one who's most projectable will
project the

1164
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:06,560

 

1165
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,670

And you want them to go out more. What

1166
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:09,680
And you want them to go out more. What
 

1167
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,390
And you want them to go out more. What
do you have to do? Bring them in more.

1168
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:12,400
do you have to do? Bring them in more.
 

1169
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,670
do you have to do? Bring them in more.
Okay.

1170
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:15,680

 

1171
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:22,230

Got to watch the organization.

1172
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:22,240

 

1173
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,510

Come. Come more in.

1174
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:25,520
Come. Come more in.
 

1175
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,430
Come. Come more in.
You're on the front foot. You staying on

1176
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:27,440
You're on the front foot. You staying on
 

1177
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:44,330
You're on the front foot. You staying on
that bracing angle.

1178
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:44,340

 

1179
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,230

[Applause]

1180
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:48,240

 

1181
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,550

Don't let your arm go in your mouth.

1182
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:54,560

 

1183
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,950

Don't let your arm go in your mouth.

1184
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:56,960
Don't let your arm go in your mouth.
 

1185
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:13,430
Don't let your arm go in your mouth.
Your belly.

1186
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,440

 

1187
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,829

Okay. I don't I don't try to if I try to

1188
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:17,839
Okay. I don't I don't try to if I try to
 

1189
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,349
Okay. I don't I don't try to if I try to
push him, I'll usually wind up and I'll

1190
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:21,359
push him, I'll usually wind up and I'll
 

1191
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,829
push him, I'll usually wind up and I'll
usually extend.

1192
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:23,839
usually extend.
 

1193
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,990
usually extend.
When you feel like you want to push him,

1194
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:26,000
When you feel like you want to push him,
 

1195
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,589
When you feel like you want to push him,
I remember it's like you should have

1196
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:27,599
I remember it's like you should have
 

1197
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,950
I remember it's like you should have
gone down. No, he goes where he goes.

1198
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:30,960
gone down. No, he goes where he goes.
 

1199
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,710
gone down. No, he goes where he goes.
Okay.

1200
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:32,720
Okay.
 

1201
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,069
Okay.
Bigger people, more yawn, absorbs more,

1202
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:36,079
Bigger people, more yawn, absorbs more,
 

1203
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,430
Bigger people, more yawn, absorbs more,
takes longer. Okay. So, let's say I

1204
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:39,440
takes longer. Okay. So, let's say I
 

1205
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,550
takes longer. Okay. So, let's say I
going with you.

1206
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:42,560
going with you.
 

1207
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,790
going with you.
Wait, I go with Chris. Little sluggish.

1208
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:46,800
Wait, I go with Chris. Little sluggish.
 

1209
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,710
Wait, I go with Chris. Little sluggish.
Little sluggish. You see that? He came

1210
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:48,720
Little sluggish. You see that? He came
 

1211
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,230
Little sluggish. You see that? He came
in a little more. That meant he went out

1212
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:52,240
in a little more. That meant he went out
 

1213
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,470
in a little more. That meant he went out
a little later. There's nothing wrong

1214
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:54,480
a little later. There's nothing wrong
 

1215
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,950
a little later. There's nothing wrong
with that. The mechanics are mechanics.

1216
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:56,960
with that. The mechanics are mechanics.
 

1217
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,109
with that. The mechanics are mechanics.
The center his center is still being

1218
00:46:59,109 --> 00:46:59,119
The center his center is still being
 

1219
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,950
The center his center is still being
seized. Okay, there's more yaw. There's

1220
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
seized. Okay, there's more yaw. There's
 

1221
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,190
seized. Okay, there's more yaw. There's
going to be more yin. That's going to

1222
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:05,200
going to be more yin. That's going to
 

1223
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,430
going to be more yin. That's going to
delay it because it's taking more time.

1224
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:07,440
delay it because it's taking more time.
 

1225
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,069
delay it because it's taking more time.
Okay, just be patient. Stick to the

1226
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:10,079
Okay, just be patient. Stick to the
 

1227
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:24,470
Okay, just be patient. Stick to the
mechanics.

1228
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:24,480

 

1229
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:38,630

More again.

1230
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:38,640

 

1231
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,910

That's all right. That was in the

1232
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:39,920
That's all right. That was in the
 

1233
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,710
That's all right. That was in the
ballpark.

1234
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:42,720
ballpark.
 

1235
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,750
ballpark.
Let him go again. Four more.

1236
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,760

 

1237
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,790

Good.

1238
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:50,800

 

1239
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,630

We were ahead of them.

1240
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:54,640

 

1241
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:23,750

We unwe.

1242
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:23,760

 

1243
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,230

No, you're still doing two.

1244
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:28,240

 

1245
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:45,430

Got it.

1246
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:45,440

 

1247
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,030

That's it.

1248
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,040

 

1249
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,549

You're changing your shape. Thanks.

1250
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:54,559

 

1251
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,270

too much.

1252
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:57,280
too much.
 

1253
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,349
too much.
Okay.

1254
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:01,359

 

1255
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:04,069

Um

1256
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:04,079
Um
 

1257
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,870
Um
when I'm doing,

1258
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:06,880
when I'm doing,
 

1259
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,109
when I'm doing,
for example,

1260
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:09,119
for example,
 

1261
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,349
for example,
we um

1262
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:11,359
we um
 

1263
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,270
we um
we did this stuff, right? We did the

1264
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:13,280
we did this stuff, right? We did the
 

1265
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,870
we did this stuff, right? We did the
adhesion

1266
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:14,880
adhesion
 

1267
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,950
adhesion
and that's what I did here.

1268
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:20,960

 

1269
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,190

Today we did the displacement

1270
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:25,200
Today we did the displacement
 

1271
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,589
Today we did the displacement
right

1272
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:29,599

 

1273
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,910

just like I'm not using anatomical

1274
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:31,920
just like I'm not using anatomical
 

1275
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,790
just like I'm not using anatomical
structures to move him.

1276
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:34,800
structures to move him.
 

1277
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,750
structures to move him.
Same thing here.

1278
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:37,760
Same thing here.
 

1279
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,790
Same thing here.
This is the same exact thing as his

1280
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:40,800
This is the same exact thing as his
 

1281
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,750
This is the same exact thing as his
young energy coming in and hitting the

1282
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:43,760
young energy coming in and hitting the
 

1283
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,230
young energy coming in and hitting the
ground. Okay. So his when I when I feel

1284
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:48,240
ground. Okay. So his when I when I feel
 

1285
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,589
ground. Okay. So his when I when I feel
him, it's the same thing.

1286
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:51,599
him, it's the same thing.
 

1287
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,630
him, it's the same thing.
which is why you see that

1288
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:54,640
which is why you see that
 

1289
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,829
which is why you see that
kind of effect. Okay, you understand?

1290
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:57,839
kind of effect. Okay, you understand?
 

1291
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,910
kind of effect. Okay, you understand?
Um,

1292
00:49:59,910 --> 00:49:59,920
Um,
 

1293
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,630
Um,
that's the these two ways are the only

1294
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:02,640
that's the these two ways are the only
 

1295
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,430
that's the these two ways are the only
two ways I move unless something went

1296
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:05,440
two ways I move unless something went
 

1297
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,190
two ways I move unless something went
way wrong. So, they they have to make it

1298
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:09,200
way wrong. So, they they have to make it
 

1299
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,670
way wrong. So, they they have to make it
go wrong. Okay, which doesn't happen in

1300
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:11,680
go wrong. Okay, which doesn't happen in
 

1301
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,510
go wrong. Okay, which doesn't happen in
Khan because they don't resist or

1302
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:13,520
Khan because they don't resist or
 

1303
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:18,470
Khan because they don't resist or
assist. Okay. Um but in Khon something I

1304
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:18,480
assist. Okay. Um but in Khon something I
 

1305
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,990
assist. Okay. Um but in Khon something I
want

1306
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:20,000
want
 

1307
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,270
want
to come towards me is going to adhere

1308
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:23,280
to come towards me is going to adhere
 

1309
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,910
to come towards me is going to adhere
through it. Okay. Something that's going

1310
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:25,920
through it. Okay. Something that's going
 

1311
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,230
through it. Okay. Something that's going
to go away from me is going to be

1312
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:28,240
to go away from me is going to be
 

1313
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,109
to go away from me is going to be
closely projected through these two

1314
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:31,119
closely projected through these two
 

1315
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,430
closely projected through these two
engines. It's the same engine but

1316
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:33,440
engines. It's the same engine but
 

1317
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,150
engines. It's the same engine but
different y values are being put out.

1318
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:36,160
different y values are being put out.
 

1319
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,549
different y values are being put out.
You guys understand? Okay. So that

1320
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:40,559
You guys understand? Okay. So that
 

1321
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,309
You guys understand? Okay. So that
is what we're working on in a very

1322
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:44,319
is what we're working on in a very
 

1323
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:48,069
is what we're working on in a very
simplified form. I don't have to even do

1324
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:48,079
simplified form. I don't have to even do
 

1325
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:53,670
simplified form. I don't have to even do
tension. You see and inversely though by

1326
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:53,680
tension. You see and inversely though by
 

1327
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,390
tension. You see and inversely though by
what I just said if I'm not doing

1328
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:56,400
what I just said if I'm not doing
 

1329
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,950
what I just said if I'm not doing
tension with these two hinges I'm not

1330
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:00,960
tension with these two hinges I'm not
 

1331
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,950
tension with these two hinges I'm not
doing

1332
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960
doing
 

1333
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,790
doing
I'm doing something else. Okay. Um, so

1334
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:06,800
I'm doing something else. Okay. Um, so
 

1335
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,910
I'm doing something else. Okay. Um, so
yeah, this is so marshal that this is

1336
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:09,920
yeah, this is so marshal that this is
 

1337
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,470
yeah, this is so marshal that this is
stupid. That's what you'll hear from a

1338
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:12,480
stupid. That's what you'll hear from a
 

1339
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,190
stupid. That's what you'll hear from a
lot of people like who's going to drive

1340
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:15,200
lot of people like who's going to drive
 

1341
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,190
lot of people like who's going to drive
and and you know or they might be

1342
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:17,200
and and you know or they might be
 

1343
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,150
and and you know or they might be
thinking um

1344
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:20,160
thinking um
 

1345
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,950
thinking um
and let's let's the critics will do it

1346
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:22,960
and let's let's the critics will do it
 

1347
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,270
and let's let's the critics will do it
but some of Tai Chi people for example

1348
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:25,280
but some of Tai Chi people for example
 

1349
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,150
but some of Tai Chi people for example
the Tai Chi people will be I'm going to

1350
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:28,160
the Tai Chi people will be I'm going to
 

1351
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,150
the Tai Chi people will be I'm going to
just stand still and project you out.

1352
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:32,160
just stand still and project you out.
 

1353
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,470
just stand still and project you out.
No you're not. No you're freaking not.

1354
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:34,480
No you're not. No you're freaking not.
 

1355
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,670
No you're not. No you're freaking not.
Okay. Um, so it might not even be

1356
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:39,680
Okay. Um, so it might not even be
 

1357
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,710
Okay. Um, so it might not even be
in uh in China or whatever how I

1358
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:44,720
in uh in China or whatever how I
 

1359
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,270
in uh in China or whatever how I
generate force motion. Do you

1360
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,280
generate force motion. Do you
 

1361
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,150
generate force motion. Do you
understand? But the force I'm generating

1362
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:50,160
understand? But the force I'm generating
 

1363
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,270
understand? But the force I'm generating
is generated through this. Okay. So here

1364
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:55,280
is generated through this. Okay. So here
 

1365
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,630
is generated through this. Okay. So here
here I had, you know, a

1366
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:58,640
here I had, you know, a
 

1367
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,870
here I had, you know, a
a co projection on his leg, right? But

1368
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:02,880
a co projection on his leg, right? But
 

1369
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,630
a co projection on his leg, right? But
it could be the strike. So instead of

1370
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:04,640
it could be the strike. So instead of
 

1371
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,190
it could be the strike. So instead of
just shoulder shoulder and hip kind of

1372
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:07,200
just shoulder shoulder and hip kind of
 

1373
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,309
just shoulder shoulder and hip kind of
thing that the energy that I hit here

1374
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:10,319
thing that the energy that I hit here
 

1375
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,870
thing that the energy that I hit here
goes into the ground. I absorb it and it

1376
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:12,880
goes into the ground. I absorb it and it
 

1377
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,589
goes into the ground. I absorb it and it
comes back out. You get what I'm talking

1378
00:52:15,589 --> 00:52:15,599
comes back out. You get what I'm talking
 

1379
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,670
comes back out. You get what I'm talking
about? And that's just that's just how

1380
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:17,680
about? And that's just that's just how
 

1381
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,349
about? And that's just that's just how
boom how I hit. His body did exactly

1382
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:21,359
boom how I hit. His body did exactly
 

1383
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,950
boom how I hit. His body did exactly
what you saw is happening here. Okay. So

1384
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:24,960
what you saw is happening here. Okay. So
 

1385
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,150
what you saw is happening here. Okay. So
this is obviously not a Marshall drill.

1386
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,160
this is obviously not a Marshall drill.
 

1387
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,829
this is obviously not a Marshall drill.
It's not going to be a one to one

1388
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:29,839
It's not going to be a one to one
 

1389
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,990
It's not going to be a one to one
transformation into it.

1390
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:32,000
transformation into it.
 

1391
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,829
transformation into it.
purposefully simplifies to

1392
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:35,839
purposefully simplifies to
 

1393
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:39,589
purposefully simplifies to
just get back. Okay, that's all we're

1394
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:39,599
just get back. Okay, that's all we're
 

1395
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,910
just get back. Okay, that's all we're
doing right now. Um, so I say this one,

1396
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:43,920
doing right now. Um, so I say this one,
 

1397
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,950
doing right now. Um, so I say this one,
I'm going to continue that great

1398
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:46,960
I'm going to continue that great
 

1399
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,470
I'm going to continue that great
question because there's a lot of

1400
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:48,480
question because there's a lot of
 

1401
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,670
question because there's a lot of
questions on that day. What do you mean

1402
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:49,680
questions on that day. What do you mean
 

1403
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,030
questions on that day. What do you mean
by cultivation field? What do you mean

1404
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:51,040
by cultivation field? What do you mean
 

1405
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,030
by cultivation field? What do you mean
by application?

1406
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:53,040
by application?
 

1407
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,270
by application?
Um, but also to free you from a marshall

1408
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:57,280
Um, but also to free you from a marshall
 

1409
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,430
Um, but also to free you from a marshall
end. Okay? Because your marshall then

1410
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,440
end. Okay? Because your marshall then
 

1411
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,270
end. Okay? Because your marshall then
you might think I want to send somebody

1412
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:03,280
you might think I want to send somebody
 

1413
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,870
you might think I want to send somebody
flying. I want to be able to send them

1414
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:04,880
flying. I want to be able to send them
 

1415
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,750
flying. I want to be able to send them
flying. And now what we end up doing is

1416
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:09,760
flying. And now what we end up doing is
 

1417
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,910
flying. And now what we end up doing is
something else because you can achieve

1418
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:11,920
something else because you can achieve
 

1419
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,190
something else because you can achieve
flying without this engine. You

1420
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:15,200
flying without this engine. You
 

1421
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,670
flying without this engine. You
understand? So you I can go like that.

1422
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:19,680
understand? So you I can go like that.
 

1423
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,950
understand? So you I can go like that.
He went flying but that's not the engine

1424
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:22,960
He went flying but that's not the engine
 

1425
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,990
He went flying but that's not the engine
that I want. Okay? Does that make sense?

1426
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:26,000
that I want. Okay? Does that make sense?
 

1427
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,630
that I want. Okay? Does that make sense?
So you got to free your mind.

1428
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:28,640
So you got to free your mind.
 

1429
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,390
So you got to free your mind.
and you're trying to line up and you get

1430
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:30,400
and you're trying to line up and you get
 

1431
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,349
and you're trying to line up and you get
hip rotation. All right, you get your or

1432
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:33,359
hip rotation. All right, you get your or
 

1433
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,750
hip rotation. All right, you get your or
you're trying to extend and you get this

1434
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:35,760
you're trying to extend and you get this
 

1435
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,270
you're trying to extend and you get this
rotation or I'm trying to go here, you

1436
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:39,280
rotation or I'm trying to go here, you
 

1437
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,309
rotation or I'm trying to go here, you
see? Or I want him to go back. I want

1438
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:42,319
see? Or I want him to go back. I want
 

1439
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,870
see? Or I want him to go back. I want
him to go that way. So I but I'm not

1440
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:44,880
him to go that way. So I but I'm not
 

1441
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,190
him to go that way. So I but I'm not
going to go this way. You see? You get

1442
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:47,200
going to go this way. You see? You get
 

1443
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,270
going to go this way. You see? You get
it? So you got to free your mind and

1444
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:49,280
it? So you got to free your mind and
 

1445
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,030
it? So you got to free your mind and
just say what what is it? What the

1446
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:51,040
just say what what is it? What the
 

1447
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,549
just say what what is it? What the
teacher say I'm trying to do? That is

1448
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:52,559
teacher say I'm trying to do? That is
 

1449
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,390
teacher say I'm trying to do? That is
all I'm doing. If I can't figure it out,

1450
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:56,400
all I'm doing. If I can't figure it out,
 

1451
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,109
all I'm doing. If I can't figure it out,
who cares? you will figure it out later.

1452
00:53:59,109 --> 00:53:59,119
who cares? you will figure it out later.
 

1453
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,069
who cares? you will figure it out later.
Just like I told you with Maya, I don't

1454
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:02,079
Just like I told you with Maya, I don't
 

1455
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,230
Just like I told you with Maya, I don't
care. I will teach her how to fight if

1456
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:04,240
care. I will teach her how to fight if
 

1457
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,710
care. I will teach her how to fight if
she wants to go down that route later.

1458
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:06,720
she wants to go down that route later.
 

1459
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,710
she wants to go down that route later.
But she's playing the game exactly like

1460
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:08,720
But she's playing the game exactly like
 

1461
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,990
But she's playing the game exactly like
the game was taught. There's no Maya is

1462
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,000
the game was taught. There's no Maya is
 

1463
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,349
the game was taught. There's no Maya is
not thinking at all. I'm ready for

1464
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:15,359
not thinking at all. I'm ready for
 

1465
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,750
not thinking at all. I'm ready for
multiple attacks. You know, May is just

1466
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:17,760
multiple attacks. You know, May is just
 

1467
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,710
multiple attacks. You know, May is just
playing a game trying to keep her flag

1468
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:20,720
playing a game trying to keep her flag
 

1469
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,109
playing a game trying to keep her flag
safe and get a fight. That is all she's

1470
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:23,119
safe and get a fight. That is all she's
 

1471
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,630
safe and get a fight. That is all she's
doing.

1472
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:24,640
doing.
 

1473
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,910
doing.
I I reference this book often, but if

1474
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:27,920
I I reference this book often, but if
 

1475
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,109
I I reference this book often, but if
you haven't read uh Enders Game,

1476
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:31,119
you haven't read uh Enders Game,
 

1477
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,270
you haven't read uh Enders Game,
it's very much like Enders Game. So,

1478
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:33,280
it's very much like Enders Game. So,
 

1479
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,710
it's very much like Enders Game. So,
this is a sci-fi book where

1480
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:36,720
this is a sci-fi book where
 

1481
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,430
this is a sci-fi book where
um the human race and the future is at

1482
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:39,440
um the human race and the future is at
 

1483
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,150
um the human race and the future is at
war with an alien race. They need to

1484
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:42,160
war with an alien race. They need to
 

1485
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,589
war with an alien race. They need to
have great generals. And what they do is

1486
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:45,599
have great generals. And what they do is
 

1487
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,069
have great generals. And what they do is
they take these kids that show high

1488
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:48,079
they take these kids that show high
 

1489
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,790
they take these kids that show high
intelligence and they just teach them

1490
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:50,800
intelligence and they just teach them
 

1491
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,510
intelligence and they just teach them
games. And the games get a little more

1492
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:53,520
games. And the games get a little more
 

1493
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,910
games. And the games get a little more
competitive a little more, but at first

1494
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:55,920
competitive a little more, but at first
 

1495
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,510
competitive a little more, but at first
they're just silly games and the kids

1496
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,520
they're just silly games and the kids
 

1497
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,750
they're just silly games and the kids
just trying to win the games. Okay. And

1498
00:54:59,750 --> 00:54:59,760
just trying to win the games. Okay. And
 

1499
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,790
just trying to win the games. Okay. And
then later the character realizes,

1500
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:02,800
then later the character realizes,
 

1501
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,750
then later the character realizes,
"Holy there's a war. It's like

1502
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:05,760
"Holy there's a war. It's like
 

1503
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,910
"Holy there's a war. It's like
that game and he's putting it all

1504
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:07,920
that game and he's putting it all
 

1505
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,470
that game and he's putting it all
together." Okay. So, same kind of

1506
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:10,480
together." Okay. So, same kind of
 

1507
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,589
together." Okay. So, same kind of
concept here. All right.

1508
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:13,599
concept here. All right.
 

1509
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,069
concept here. All right.
Any comments, questions, observations on

1510
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:16,079
Any comments, questions, observations on
 

1511
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,670
Any comments, questions, observations on
what you felt, what you felt from

1512
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:17,680
what you felt, what you felt from
 

1513
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,069
what you felt, what you felt from
someone else?

1514
00:55:20,069 --> 00:55:20,079
someone else?
 

1515
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,670
someone else?
I went over it again with some of you.

1516
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:21,680
I went over it again with some of you.
 

1517
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,190
I went over it again with some of you.
You want to comment on what that felt

1518
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:23,200
You want to comment on what that felt
 

1519
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,470
You want to comment on what that felt
like, comment on that. Um, but let's

1520
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:26,480
like, comment on that. Um, but let's
 

1521
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:32,390
like, comment on that. Um, but let's
bring it up to the conscious level.

1522
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:32,400

 

1523
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,470

You stand up.

1524
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:34,480
You stand up.
 

1525
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:40,470
You stand up.
Okay.

1526
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:40,480

 

1527
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,750

It seems like it shouldn't be possible,

1528
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:43,760
It seems like it shouldn't be possible,
 

1529
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,589
It seems like it shouldn't be possible,
but it seems to defy what I originally

1530
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:47,599
but it seems to defy what I originally
 

1531
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,270
but it seems to defy what I originally
look at.

1532
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
look at.
 

1533
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,870
look at.
Makes sense, but just looking at

1534
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:52,880
Makes sense, but just looking at
 

1535
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,750
Makes sense, but just looking at
that guy and bounce off one leg.

1536
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:57,760
that guy and bounce off one leg.
 

1537
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,109
that guy and bounce off one leg.
Yeah, initially it doesn't make sense.

1538
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:01,119
Yeah, initially it doesn't make sense.
 

1539
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,549
Yeah, initially it doesn't make sense.
Here's how I again I don't care how it

1540
00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:04,559
Here's how I again I don't care how it
 

1541
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,109
Here's how I again I don't care how it
did it job. Okay. And again, the

1542
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:07,119
did it job. Okay. And again, the
 

1543
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:08,870
did it job. Okay. And again, the
ultimate thing is to change the

1544
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:08,880
ultimate thing is to change the
 

1545
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,910
ultimate thing is to change the
consciousness that is working there. But

1546
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:11,920
consciousness that is working there. But
 

1547
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,750
consciousness that is working there. But
for this you're like, okay, what the

1548
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:13,760
for this you're like, okay, what the
 

1549
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,349
for this you're like, okay, what the
 is going on? To me, it's a

1550
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:15,359
is going on? To me, it's a
 

1551
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,950
is going on? To me, it's a
rebounding.

1552
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:16,960
rebounding.
 

1553
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,190
rebounding.
So you throw something at greater mass,

1554
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:21,200
So you throw something at greater mass,
 

1555
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,349
So you throw something at greater mass,
it's going to eventually bounce off of

1556
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:23,359
it's going to eventually bounce off of
 

1557
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:29,510
it's going to eventually bounce off of
that. Okay. So to me, um, like what if I

1558
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:29,520
that. Okay. So to me, um, like what if I
 

1559
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,230
that. Okay. So to me, um, like what if I
were like, what's it feel like? It feels

1560
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:32,240
were like, what's it feel like? It feels
 

1561
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,870
were like, what's it feel like? It feels
like when you push a beach ball into the

1562
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:34,880
like when you push a beach ball into the
 

1563
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,510
like when you push a beach ball into the
surface of the pool, like you push push

1564
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:37,520
surface of the pool, like you push push
 

1565
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,670
surface of the pool, like you push push
push push and like it's getting harder

1566
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:39,680
push push and like it's getting harder
 

1567
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,230
push push and like it's getting harder
to push it and when you let go, it comes

1568
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,240
to push it and when you let go, it comes
 

1569
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:48,309
to push it and when you let go, it comes
flying back. Feels like that. Um, so as

1570
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:48,319
flying back. Feels like that. Um, so as
 

1571
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:51,270
flying back. Feels like that. Um, so as
he has more y, I can feel like that the

1572
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,280
he has more y, I can feel like that the
 

1573
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,190
he has more y, I can feel like that the
beach ball's getting he's going like

1574
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:53,200
beach ball's getting he's going like
 

1575
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,030
beach ball's getting he's going like
that. And all I got to do is not freak

1576
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:55,040
that. And all I got to do is not freak
 

1577
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,829
that. And all I got to do is not freak
out. That's exactly what I want. Just be

1578
00:56:57,829 --> 00:56:57,839
out. That's exactly what I want. Just be
 

1579
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,150
out. That's exactly what I want. Just be
patient. And then just going to hit the

1580
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:00,160
patient. And then just going to hit the
 

1581
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,710
patient. And then just going to hit the
ground. I'm just going to put that out.

1582
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:02,720
ground. I'm just going to put that out.
 

1583
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,670
ground. I'm just going to put that out.
Okay. Um,

1584
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:05,680
Okay. Um,
 

1585
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:11,349
Okay. Um,
I think there might even be some innate

1586
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:11,359
I think there might even be some innate
 

1587
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,990
I think there might even be some innate
elasticity in the spine. just the way

1588
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:14,000
elasticity in the spine. just the way
 

1589
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,309
elasticity in the spine. just the way
the spine works and forces going in

1590
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:16,319
the spine works and forces going in
 

1591
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:19,270
the spine works and forces going in
there. Do you know I imagine I could see

1592
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:19,280
there. Do you know I imagine I could see
 

1593
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,190
there. Do you know I imagine I could see
this. I would never go now. Okay, maybe

1594
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:23,200
this. I would never go now. Okay, maybe
 

1595
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,910
this. I would never go now. Okay, maybe
there's some uh not not necessarily

1596
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:27,920
there's some uh not not necessarily
 

1597
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,349
there's some uh not not necessarily
of me doing like a wave kind of thing,

1598
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:31,359
of me doing like a wave kind of thing,
 

1599
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,670
of me doing like a wave kind of thing,
but the force itself is doing a wave

1600
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:33,680
but the force itself is doing a wave
 

1601
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,430
but the force itself is doing a wave
thing just to the structure and the

1602
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:35,440
thing just to the structure and the
 

1603
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,230
thing just to the structure and the
angle of the spine. You see that? So

1604
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:38,240
angle of the spine. You see that? So
 

1605
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,030
angle of the spine. You see that? So
when it loads, it comes back up. Almost

1606
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,040
when it loads, it comes back up. Almost
 

1607
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,750
when it loads, it comes back up. Almost
has like a bow effect maybe. I don't

1608
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:43,760
has like a bow effect maybe. I don't
 

1609
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,270
has like a bow effect maybe. I don't
know.

1610
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:45,280
know.
 

1611
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,230
know.
I don't know.

1612
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:48,240
I don't know.
 

1613
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,309
I don't know.
But I think it's weirder

1614
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:52,319

 

1615
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,950

to think

1616
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:54,960
to think
 

1617
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,349
to think
that with all these hinges and

1618
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:57,359
that with all these hinges and
 

1619
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,789
that with all these hinges and
articulations and fluids and vacuums in

1620
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:00,799
articulations and fluids and vacuums in
 

1621
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:05,190
articulations and fluids and vacuums in
my body that I should act like a board.

1622
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:05,200
my body that I should act like a board.
 

1623
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,349
my body that I should act like a board.
Do you get what I'm saying? like you you

1624
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:07,359
Do you get what I'm saying? like you you
 

1625
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,150
Do you get what I'm saying? like you you
you hit the top, I'm supposed to go

1626
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:10,160
you hit the top, I'm supposed to go
 

1627
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,589
you hit the top, I'm supposed to go
flying. Like a board would do that. That

1628
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:13,599
flying. Like a board would do that. That
 

1629
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,109
flying. Like a board would do that. That
would be really weird. Let's say you're

1630
00:58:15,109 --> 00:58:15,119
would be really weird. Let's say you're
 

1631
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,109
would be really weird. Let's say you're
trying to build a building. You're going

1632
00:58:17,109 --> 00:58:17,119
trying to build a building. You're going
 

1633
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,750
trying to build a building. You're going
to want structural integrity, but you

1634
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:19,760
to want structural integrity, but you
 

1635
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,390
to want structural integrity, but you
come to me with a board that's all

1636
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:22,400
come to me with a board that's all
 

1637
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,510
come to me with a board that's all
slinky and fluidly. I'm like, dude, that

1638
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:25,520
slinky and fluidly. I'm like, dude, that
 

1639
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,470
slinky and fluidly. I'm like, dude, that
can't that can't act like a lever,

1640
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:28,480
can't that can't act like a lever,
 

1641
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,349
can't that can't act like a lever,
right? But somehow we that makes sense

1642
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:31,359
right? But somehow we that makes sense
 

1643
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:34,230
right? But somehow we that makes sense
to us. Like, you're you're a lever. No,

1644
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:34,240
to us. Like, you're you're a lever. No,
 

1645
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,670
to us. Like, you're you're a lever. No,
I'm not a lever. I just weird thing

1646
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:37,680
I'm not a lever. I just weird thing
 

1647
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,190
I'm not a lever. I just weird thing
today,

1648
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:39,200
today,
 

1649
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,750
today,
you know, when we were playing that uh

1650
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:41,760
you know, when we were playing that uh
 

1651
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,710
you know, when we were playing that uh
the game on Monday with the kids. Um

1652
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:44,720
the game on Monday with the kids. Um
 

1653
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,549
the game on Monday with the kids. Um
this is reminding me of that. I was

1654
00:58:46,549 --> 00:58:46,559
this is reminding me of that. I was
 

1655
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:50,230
this is reminding me of that. I was
pretty impressed. um especially when the

1656
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:50,240
pretty impressed. um especially when the
 

1657
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,630
pretty impressed. um especially when the
the boundaries became shorter because

1658
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:52,640
the boundaries became shorter because
 

1659
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,950
the boundaries became shorter because
what a lot of us started doing was try

1660
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:54,960
what a lot of us started doing was try
 

1661
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,910
what a lot of us started doing was try
to push each other out of the borders

1662
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:57,920
to push each other out of the borders
 

1663
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,390
to push each other out of the borders
and virtually everyone was unpushable

1664
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:00,400
and virtually everyone was unpushable
 

1665
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,950
and virtually everyone was unpushable
outable but they were able to ground it

1666
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,960
outable but they were able to ground it
 

1667
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,950
outable but they were able to ground it
and I don't know whether what the

1668
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:04,960
and I don't know whether what the
 

1669
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,190
and I don't know whether what the
mechanism was but obviously the energy

1670
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:07,200
mechanism was but obviously the energy
 

1671
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,190
mechanism was but obviously the energy
was going down and then they were

1672
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:09,200
was going down and then they were
 

1673
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,910
was going down and then they were
redirecting the energy into the pusher

1674
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:11,920
redirecting the energy into the pusher
 

1675
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,549
redirecting the energy into the pusher
to allow them to not be pushed out but

1676
00:59:14,549 --> 00:59:14,559
to allow them to not be pushed out but
 

1677
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,349
to allow them to not be pushed out but
to shake around to yeah to get enough of

1678
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:17,359
to shake around to yeah to get enough of
 

1679
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,430
to shake around to yeah to get enough of
the energy off of them to go to go

1680
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:19,440
the energy off of them to go to go
 

1681
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,390
the energy off of them to go to go
around it. Yeah. Again, that got pretty

1682
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:22,400
around it. Yeah. Again, that got pretty
 

1683
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,630
around it. Yeah. Again, that got pretty
narrow. You wouldn't think that everyone

1684
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:24,640
narrow. You wouldn't think that everyone
 

1685
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:29,750
narrow. You wouldn't think that everyone
would go fine, but no one lever has

1686
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:29,760
would go fine, but no one lever has
 

1687
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,390
would go fine, but no one lever has
to do something to us to act. Okay. So,

1688
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:34,400
to do something to us to act. Okay. So,
 

1689
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,789
to do something to us to act. Okay. So,
you know what they always say in law

1690
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:36,799
you know what they always say in law
 

1691
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,349
you know what they always say in law
enforcement, you know, you have this

1692
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:39,359
enforcement, you know, you have this
 

1693
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,990
enforcement, you know, you have this
terrible crash and they'll go, they'll

1694
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:42,000
terrible crash and they'll go, they'll
 

1695
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,589
terrible crash and they'll go, they'll
go like the person not a scratch. Don't

1696
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:45,599
go like the person not a scratch. Don't
 

1697
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,230
go like the person not a scratch. Don't
go, oh, drunk as not broke as

1698
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:48,240
go, oh, drunk as not broke as
 

1699
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,470
go, oh, drunk as not broke as
 cuz they were all loose, right? As

1700
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:50,480
cuz they were all loose, right? As
 

1701
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,309
cuz they were all loose, right? As
opposed to getting that tension and now

1702
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:54,319
opposed to getting that tension and now
 

1703
00:59:54,319 --> 01:00:02,440
opposed to getting that tension and now
acts like a lever on that. Okay. Um,

1704
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:02,450

 

1705
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:03,990

[Applause]

1706
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:04,000
[Applause]
 

1707
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,549
[Applause]
again, I would task myself with just do

1708
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:06,559
again, I would task myself with just do
 

1709
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,870
again, I would task myself with just do
the metrics until I get the experience

1710
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:08,880
the metrics until I get the experience
 

1711
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,710
the metrics until I get the experience
rather than trying to go. It is like a

1712
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:12,720
rather than trying to go. It is like a
 

1713
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,630
rather than trying to go. It is like a
like a bouncing ball in water.

1714
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640
like a bouncing ball in water.
 

1715
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,190
like a bouncing ball in water.
Just stick to the metrics. Okay. All

1716
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,200
Just stick to the metrics. Okay. All
 

1717
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,390
Just stick to the metrics. Okay. All
right. Any other comments? Especially if

1718
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:22,400
right. Any other comments? Especially if
 

1719
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,470
right. Any other comments? Especially if
I went with you, whether it was just the

1720
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:24,480
I went with you, whether it was just the
 

1721
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,589
I went with you, whether it was just the
pushing drill or the progression drill,

1722
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:27,599
pushing drill or the progression drill,
 

1723
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,870
pushing drill or the progression drill,
any of them. I mean, it felt like

1724
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:30,880
any of them. I mean, it felt like
 

1725
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,390
any of them. I mean, it felt like
almost.

1726
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:32,400
almost.
 

1727
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,710
almost.
Yeah. So, I did one quick one on on you

1728
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:34,720
Yeah. So, I did one quick one on on you
 

1729
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,950
Yeah. So, I did one quick one on on you
in the corner. Boom. And it's it's

1730
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:36,960
in the corner. Boom. And it's it's
 

1731
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,510
in the corner. Boom. And it's it's
instantaneous like that. We talked about

1732
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:39,520
instantaneous like that. We talked about
 

1733
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,470
instantaneous like that. We talked about
that earlier, right? It's not this long

1734
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:42,480
that earlier, right? It's not this long
 

1735
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,390
that earlier, right? It's not this long
dragged out thing. Um, there wasn't a

1736
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:46,400
dragged out thing. Um, there wasn't a
 

1737
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,870
dragged out thing. Um, there wasn't a
lot of oomph in me. There was none like

1738
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:48,880
lot of oomph in me. There was none like
 

1739
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,069
lot of oomph in me. There was none like
that. But you come in and you're like,

1740
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:50,079
that. But you come in and you're like,
 

1741
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,069
that. But you come in and you're like,
"What the Okay, now again in that." And

1742
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:54,079
"What the Okay, now again in that." And
 

1743
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,870
"What the Okay, now again in that." And
now I'm your spine's already tilting.

1744
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:56,880
now I'm your spine's already tilting.
 

1745
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,390
now I'm your spine's already tilting.
You see? And now I my double leg. I'd

1746
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:00,400
You see? And now I my double leg. I'd
 

1747
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,910
You see? And now I my double leg. I'd
rather do the double leg on someone

1748
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:01,920
rather do the double leg on someone
 

1749
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,670
rather do the double leg on someone
that's going like that than someone

1750
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:03,680
that's going like that than someone
 

1751
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,109
that's going like that than someone
who's here.

1752
01:01:07,109 --> 01:01:07,119

 

1753
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:11,030

Um, very similar to I'd rather be tenagi

1754
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:11,040
Um, very similar to I'd rather be tenagi
 

1755
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,190
Um, very similar to I'd rather be tenagi
at someone that's trying to get the grip

1756
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:13,200
at someone that's trying to get the grip
 

1757
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,630
at someone that's trying to get the grip
than someone who has a solid grip. Okay.

1758
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:16,640
than someone who has a solid grip. Okay.
 

1759
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,470
than someone who has a solid grip. Okay.
I'd rather I'd rather shoot somebody

1760
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:18,480
I'd rather I'd rather shoot somebody
 

1761
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,630
I'd rather I'd rather shoot somebody
with a hatchet when there's a bar

1762
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:20,640
with a hatchet when there's a bar
 

1763
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:25,109
with a hatchet when there's a bar
between me and I go, okay, that's a much

1764
01:01:25,109 --> 01:01:25,119
between me and I go, okay, that's a much
 

1765
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,990
between me and I go, okay, that's a much
easier shot than

1766
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:28,000
easier shot than
 

1767
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,910
easier shot than
Okay, now thank you. That That's a lot

1768
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:31,920
Okay, now thank you. That That's a lot
 

1769
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,349
Okay, now thank you. That That's a lot
reducing my Okay. All right. Uh, we'll

1770
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:35,359
reducing my Okay. All right. Uh, we'll
 

1771
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,400
reducing my Okay. All right. Uh, we'll
keep working on it. Right.
