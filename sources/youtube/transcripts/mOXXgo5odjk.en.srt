example um you should continually try to
 

65
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,389
example um you should continually try to
release muscle tension um more and more

66
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:35,399
release muscle tension um more and more
 

67
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:37,990

the body and then two continually try to
 

73
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,190
the body and then two continually try to
reduce a movement of any kind uh to get

74
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
reduce a movement of any kind uh to get

okay um so this one is for Karen and
Noah we were watching your videos and I

80
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,000
Noah we were watching your videos and I
 

81
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,990
Noah we were watching your videos and I
put them to my dasi to see how much

82
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
put them to my dasi to see how much
 

83
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,469
put them to my dasi to see how much
they're processing what I'm teaching

84
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
they're processing what I'm teaching
 

85
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,029
they're processing what I'm teaching
them and I think they landed uh very uh

86
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:10,039
them and I think they landed uh very uh
 

87
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,229
them and I think they landed uh very uh
accurately on the pointers that I would

88
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
accurately on the pointers that I would
 

89
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,309
accurately on the pointers that I would
give to you and so these are the

90
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
give to you and so these are the
 

91
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,390
give to you and so these are the
pointers I'd give to you and they were

92
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
pointers I'd give to you and they were
 

93
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,630
pointers I'd give to you and they were
able to come up with them as well okay

94
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:19,640
able to come up with them as well okay
 

95
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,750
able to come up with them as well okay
and um what we want to point out is that

96
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:24,760
and um what we want to point out is that
 

97
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,910
and um what we want to point out is that
there's several drills in the set and

98
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
there's several drills in the set and
 

99
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,470
there's several drills in the set and
while there's overlap they don't all do

100
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
while there's overlap they don't all do
 

101
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,630
while there's overlap they don't all do
the same thing okay um and also let's

102
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
the same thing okay um and also let's
 

103
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,550
the same thing okay um and also let's
note that the drill set is a beginner

104
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:39,560
note that the drill set is a beginner
 

105
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,790
note that the drill set is a beginner
Set uh and so there's stuff to do after

106
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
Set uh and so there's stuff to do after
 

107
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,630
Set uh and so there's stuff to do after
that uh they're not the end all by any

108
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:45,640
that uh they're not the end all by any
 

109
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,390
that uh they're not the end all by any
means it's just how do I get people not

110
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:49,400
means it's just how do I get people not
 

111
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,990
means it's just how do I get people not
on my mat committed to me uh to learn

112
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
on my mat committed to me uh to learn
 

113
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,990
on my mat committed to me uh to learn
that there's something else out there

114
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
that there's something else out there
 

115
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,110
that there's something else out there
than what they've been told by Emperors

116
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
than what they've been told by Emperors
 

117
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,589
than what they've been told by Emperors
who don't wear close that that's what

118
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
who don't wear close that that's what
 

119
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,149
who don't wear close that that's what
that drill set is okay um

120
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:07,159
that drill set is okay um
 

121
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,910
that drill set is okay um
so you have to do all of them you can't

122
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:10,920
so you have to do all of them you can't
 

123
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,350
so you have to do all of them you can't
just do the first one or the first two

124
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:14,360
just do the first one or the first two
 

125
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,470
just do the first one or the first two
or the first three you have to get to

126
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:17,480
or the first three you have to get to
 

127
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,830
or the first three you have to get to
the last one I think it goes up to six

128
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
the last one I think it goes up to six
 

129
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,350
the last one I think it goes up to six
or seven okay uh because each one does

130
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
or seven okay uh because each one does
 

131
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,670
or seven okay uh because each one does
something different and you should do

132
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
something different and you should do
 

133
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,550
something different and you should do
each one the way it is prescribed there

134
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:29,560
each one the way it is prescribed there
 

135
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,550
each one the way it is prescribed there
not not trying to do the same thing for

136
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:31,560
not not trying to do the same thing for
 

137
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,550
not not trying to do the same thing for
each one okay so um what we noticed is

138
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
each one okay so um what we noticed is
 

139
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,350
each one okay so um what we noticed is
that the first let me say this Karen

140
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
that the first let me say this Karen
 

141

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,390
attention to the tension in the lower
legs and the feet and then for both of

162
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:09,400
legs and the feet and then for both of
 

163
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,429
legs and the feet and then for both of
you I would try to get uh reducing the

164
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:12,439
you I would try to get uh reducing the
 

165
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,749
you I would try to get uh reducing the
arm movement okay try to get rid of

166
00:04:15,749 --> 00:04:15,759
arm movement okay try to get rid of
 

167
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,390
arm movement okay try to get rid of
that then pull out the generic pointer I

168
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
that then pull out the generic pointer I
 

169
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,909
that then pull out the generic pointer I
gave in the last several videos uh

170
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:22,919
gave in the last several videos uh

recently posted your person has to push

172
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:26,680
recently posted your person has to push
 

173
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,270
recently posted your person has to push
they have to be

174
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:28,280
they have to be
 

175
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,310
they have to be
driving um they can't be ready to go

176
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
driving um they can't be ready to go
 

177
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,350
driving um they can't be ready to go
backwards okay

178
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
backwards okay
 

179
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,629
backwards okay
so if we understand that each drill is

180
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
so if we understand that each drill is
 

181
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,870
so if we understand that each drill is
different and we understand those things

182
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:41,880
different and we understand those things
 

183
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,070
different and we understand those things
now we can see how is each drill

184
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
now we can see how is each drill
 

185
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,830
now we can see how is each drill
different okay so we do have uh for

186
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:48,840
different okay so we do have uh for
 

187
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,870
different okay so we do have uh for
example this a static drill right and uh

188
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
example this a static drill right and uh
 

189
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,749
example this a static drill right and uh
something to note here not not really of

00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
something to note here not not really of

00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,280
this but this you should you have to pay
 

193
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,990
this but this you should you have to pay
attention that I'm wearing socks on the

00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
attention that I'm wearing socks on the
 

195
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,430
attention that I'm wearing socks on the
mat and there's no friction here is

there's no bracing angle okay I'm I'm
I'm I'm on ice gapes when we're doing

200
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
I'm I'm on ice gapes when we're doing
 

201
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,550
I'm I'm on ice gapes when we're doing
this stuff okay but force is going to go

202
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:11,560
this stuff okay but force is going to go
 

203
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,230
this stuff okay but force is going to go
down not not backwards on me so force is

204
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,240
down not not backwards on me so force is
 

205
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,469
down not not backwards on me so force is
down okay so we have the ones where

206
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:17,479
down okay so we have the ones where
 

207
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,350
down okay so we have the ones where
we're static and I release the tension

208
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,360
we're static and I release the tension
 

209
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,189
we're static and I release the tension
paying particular attention to the back

foot we have another one where I come
 

213
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,270
foot we have another one where I come
onto the back foot and then shift onto

onto the back foot and then shift onto
 

215
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,590
onto the back foot and then shift onto
the front foot that's just what that one

216
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:32,600
the front foot that's just what that one
 

217
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,990
the front foot that's just what that one
is boom and then shift on to the front

is boom and then shift on to the front
 

219
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,029
is boom and then shift on to the front
foot that is all that is then we have

on that catch one my hands don't
 

231
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,749
on that catch one my hands don't
catch and that

00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,350
this young conflict scoot
back then it'll

256
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
back then it'll
 

257
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,670
back then it'll
work uh Chris is driving where if I

258
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:38,680
work uh Chris is driving where if I
 

259
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,029
work uh Chris is driving where if I
catch and he's going to push me back if

260
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:42,039
catch and he's going to push me back if
 

261
00:07:42,039 --> 00:08:07,990
catch and he's going to push me back if
I catch extra

262
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000

 

263
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,350

and then try to project on him I go

264
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
and then try to project on him I go
 

265
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,790
and then try to project on him I go
backwards okay so um I'll make that

266
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:15,800
backwards okay so um I'll make that
 

267
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,749
backwards okay so um I'll make that
point as the UK but I think Chris made

268
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
point as the UK but I think Chris made
 

269
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,909
point as the UK but I think Chris made
that point um when you

270
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:20,919
that point um when you
 

271
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,390
that point um when you
go into uh drill

272
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
go into uh drill

seven you're catching externally but it

seven you're catching externally but it
 

277
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,149
seven you're catching externally but it
only works because Noah only penetrated

278
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
only works because Noah only penetrated
 

279
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,790
only works because Noah only penetrated
to here but there's no spinal

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:47,800
work but so spiral
 

289
00:08:47,800 --> 00:09:19,509

00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:22,399
so I can't go
 

293
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:47,509
so I can't go
here if you

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,069
if you is truly spinally displacing the
catch is

298
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:52,079
catch is
 

299
00:09:52,079 --> 00:10:10,790

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
is
 

303
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,990
is
internal now between this last

304
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,000
internal now between this last
 

305
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,150
internal now between this last
one and the catch one here you do have

306
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,160
one and the catch one here you do have
 

307
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,910
one and the catch one here you do have
the internal one where you are going

308
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:22,920
the internal one where you are going
 

309
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,750
the internal one where you are going
towards

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:24,760
towards
 

311
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:43,030
towards
him there's no

00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040

 

313
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,470

there's no way you can externally catch

314
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
there's no way you can externally catch
 

315
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,509
there's no way you can externally catch
on that one talk so in other words I

316
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:50,519
on that one talk so in other words I
 

317
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,870
on that one talk so in other words I
can't have my hands going because I'm

318
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
can't have my hands going because I'm
 

319
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,550
can't have my hands going because I'm
going to get jammed if he's still

320
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560
going to get jammed if he's still
 

321
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,949
going to get jammed if he's still
pushing at

322
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:55,959
pushing at
 

323
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,230
pushing at
me so it's it's a internal

324
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
me so it's it's a internal
 

325
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:19,670

327
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,790

and and that is the one that you take

328
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
and and that is the one that you take
 

329
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,590
and and that is the one that you take
into this

330
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:24,600
into this
 

331
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:44,670
into this
one internal

332
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:44,680

 

333
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,190

the internal catch not an external catch

334
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,200
the internal catch not an external catch
 

335
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,750
the internal catch not an external catch
so to help bring this to the

336
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:50,760
so to help bring this to the
 

337
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,350
so to help bring this to the
surface um I would do the one where

338
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
surface um I would do the one where
 

339
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:12,509
surface um I would do the one where
you're going forward

340
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:12,519

 

341
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:15,670

and uh I would do the last one and

342
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
and uh I would do the last one and
 

343
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,750
and uh I would do the last one and
making sure that no is actually finally

344
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:18,760
making sure that no is actually finally
 

345
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:40,829
making sure that no is actually finally
displacing

346
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:40,839

 

347
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:43,710

so that you can't externally go to a

348
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:43,720
so that you can't externally go to a
 

349
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,710
so that you can't externally go to a
neutral

350
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
neutral
 

351
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,189
neutral
y okay we don't want that in this drill

352
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:49,199
y okay we don't want that in this drill
 

353
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:51,430
y okay we don't want that in this drill
St okay so

354
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
St okay so
 

355
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,030
St okay so
again uh there there is an external

356
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
again uh there there is an external
 

357
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,870
again uh there there is an external
catch it's not with my arms

358
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:57,880
catch it's not with my arms
 

359
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,509
catch it's not with my arms
though no that one I catch onto the back

360
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
though no that one I catch onto the back
 

361
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,350
though no that one I catch onto the back
foot okay catch onto the back foot

362
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:04,360
foot okay catch onto the back foot
 

363
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,870
foot okay catch onto the back foot
that's the one I'm not saying however we

364
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
that's the one I'm not saying however we
 

365
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,350
that's the one I'm not saying however we
don't do these these ex these external

366
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:10,360
don't do these these ex these external
 

367
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,990
don't do these these ex these external
catches we do do that okay it's just not

368
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,000
catches we do do that okay it's just not
 

369
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,949
catches we do do that okay it's just not
in the

370
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:13,959
in the
 

371
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,870
in the
drill in the drill set and then as you

372
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
drill in the drill set and then as you
 

373
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,949
drill in the drill set and then as you
move

374
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:17,959
move
 

375
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:20,350
move
forward there is

376
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:20,360
forward there is
 

377
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,509
forward there is
one where you're going

378
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
one where you're going
 

379
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,230
one where you're going
forward and it is impossible to

380
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
forward and it is impossible to
 

381
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,110
forward and it is impossible to
externally catch that

382
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,120
externally catch that
 

383
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,269
externally catch that
one so um and the reason why is the the

384
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:34,279
one so um and the reason why is the the
 

385
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:38,030
one so um and the reason why is the the
catch or the conflict resolution it

386
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,040
catch or the conflict resolution it
 

387
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,110
catch or the conflict resolution it
happens inside it doesn't happen on the

388
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
happens inside it doesn't happen on the
 

389
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,230
happens inside it doesn't happen on the
outside because we're going to do

390
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,240
outside because we're going to do
 

391
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,230
outside because we're going to do
something else with the

392
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,240
something else with the
 

393
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,829
something else with the
outside um meaning uh I'm not going to

394
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:52,839
outside um meaning uh I'm not going to
 

395
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:54,990
outside um meaning uh I'm not going to
go here and then find Center this is

396
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,000
go here and then find Center this is
 

397
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,910
go here and then find Center this is
something we're working on with with our

398
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:56,920
something we're working on with with our
 

399
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,150
something we're working on with with our
dishing here so they they will do an

400
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
dishing here so they they will do an
 

401
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,030
dishing here so they they will do an
external heel then they'll find Center

402
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
external heel then they'll find Center
 

403
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,910
external heel then they'll find Center
okay and we don't want that we want

obviously get out of the way and then
 

585
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,909
obviously get out of the way and then
you can push again on the center that

586

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:16,710
you can push again on the center that
you're

588

660
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,080
just like I'm here but I can move his
 

661
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,909
just like I'm here but I can move his
Center it it doesn't matter I can be up

662
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:35,919
Center it it doesn't matter I can be up
 

663
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,630
Center it it doesn't matter I can be up
high and I can still move his

664
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:39,640
high and I can still move his
 

665
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,990
high and I can still move his
Center are you go and move his move his

666

Center are you go and move his move his
 

667
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,950
Center are you go and move his move his
Center that CES the center so

668
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
Center that CES the center so
 

669
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,190
Center that CES the center so
likewise I know my hand is at shoulder

670
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:50,200
likewise I know my hand is at shoulder
 

671
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,590
likewise I know my hand is at shoulder
height but I don't push at his

672
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600

 

673
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,669

shoulder I have to push at his

674
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
shoulder I have to push at his
 

675
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,549
shoulder I have to push at his
Center that's what I'm

676
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:03,559

 

677
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,750

doing so

678
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
doing so
 

679
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,149
doing so
sees move

680
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:09,159
sees move
 

681
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:11,990
sees move
Center then I let him back in when I let

682
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
Center then I let him back in when I let
 

683
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,110
Center then I let him back in when I let
him back in I don't do another external

00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,120

 

685
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,549

deviation sees Center and then I'm

686
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:21,559
deviation sees Center and then I'm
 

687
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,390
deviation sees Center and then I'm
moving

688
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:23,400
moving
 

689
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:50,230
moving
in what I'm doing

690
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240

 

691
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,590

doing I move

692
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:52,600
doing I move
 

693
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,630
doing I move
him that same Center but I move it into

694
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:57,640
him that same Center but I move it into
 

695
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,549
him that same Center but I move it into
the in the the outward spiral so I don't

696
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
the in the the outward spiral so I don't
 

697
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,669
the in the the outward spiral so I don't
just get out of the way come around him

698
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:04,679
just get out of the way come around him
 

699
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:09,830
just get out of the way come around him
no I turn him one way Center turns and I

700
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
no I turn him one way Center turns and I
 

701
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,269
no I turn him one way Center turns and I
turn him the other

702
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:14,279

 

703
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:19,310

way just that transition part wh

704
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:19,320
way just that transition part wh
 

705
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,070
way just that transition part wh
Center and

706
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,080
Center and
 

707
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,269
Center and
then

708
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:26,279

 

709
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,789

Center not get out out of the way and

710
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:29,799
Center not get out out of the way and
 

711
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:33,590
Center not get out out of the way and
then he

712
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600

 

713
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,269

HS boom

714
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:38,279

 

715
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,710

Center next

716
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,720
Center next
 

717
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,430
Center next
part khole requires a back break

718
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,440
part khole requires a back break
 

719
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,630
part khole requires a back break
fall so he has to be going

720
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640
fall so he has to be going
 

721
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,310
fall so he has to be going
forward so this move doesn't go

722
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,320

 

723
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,269

here do the technical part Center

724
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:00,279

 

725
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:39,710

boom move he goes this way

726
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:39,720

 

727
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:57,230

this

728
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,240

 

729
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:35,669

way e

730
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:35,679

 

731
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,230

so if we do this

732
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
so if we do this
 

733
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,789
so if we do this
se you can

734
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:40,799
se you can
 

735
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,990
se you can
see what this drill is doing more aside

736
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,000
see what this drill is doing more aside
 

737
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,789
see what this drill is doing more aside
from all those things so yes it's an

738
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:46,799
from all those things so yes it's an
 

739
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,110
from all those things so yes it's an
extension of the cyu drill set then the

740
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:50,120
extension of the cyu drill set then the
 

741
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,590
extension of the cyu drill set then the
iy drill set but it is the arm patterns

742
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,600
iy drill set but it is the arm patterns
 

743
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,350
iy drill set but it is the arm patterns

on his head makes him go forward and
 

767
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,070
on his head makes him go forward and
then

um but you can get very close to it um
 

795
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,750

eventually get there because you learn a

800
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
eventually get there because you learn a
 

801
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,830
eventually get there because you learn a
lot about uh your ability to internalize

802
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:43,840
lot about uh your ability to internalize
 

803
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,870
lot about uh your ability to internalize
y aspect if you can displace somebody's

804
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
y aspect if you can displace somebody's
 

805
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,190
y aspect if you can displace somebody's
base with your base do you see it's not

806
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:50,200
base with your base do you see it's not
 

807
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,990
base with your base do you see it's not
so easy um because of the force

808
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,000
so easy um because of the force
 

809
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,029
so easy um because of the force
equations that are involved in base

810
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:56,039
equations that are involved in base
 

811
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:59,389
equations that are involved in base
displacement so basically to displace a

812
00:29:59,389 --> 00:29:59,399
displacement so basically to displace a
 

813
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,789
displacement so basically to displace a
base you're going through the heaviest

814
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:01,799
base you're going through the heaviest
 

815
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:06,190
base you're going through the heaviest
part of that person um and that'll tell

816
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:06,200
part of that person um and that'll tell
 

817
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,350
part of that person um and that'll tell
you how good you are at internalizing

818
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:08,360
you how good you are at internalizing
 

819
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,110
you how good you are at internalizing
yangong or whether you're just

820
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,120
yangong or whether you're just
 

821
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,549
yangong or whether you're just
contesting because you're not going to

822
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:12,559
contesting because you're not going to
 

823
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,230
contesting because you're not going to
be you you basically you're I don't

824
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,240
be you you basically you're I don't
 

825
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,269
be you you basically you're I don't
weigh I don't weigh more than Chris so

826
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:18,279
weigh I don't weigh more than Chris so
 

827
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:22,549
weigh I don't weigh more than Chris so
to displace Chris is I can't outy him

828
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559
to displace Chris is I can't outy him
 

829
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,149
to displace Chris is I can't outy him
it's not possible okay and so you learn

830
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:25,159
it's not possible okay and so you learn
 

831
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,269
it's not possible okay and so you learn
