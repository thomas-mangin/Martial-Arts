so you have to have the yin yield but

72
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,060
so you have to have the yin yield but
 

73
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,929
so you have to have the yin yield but
your Yin yield is going here

74
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:50,939
your Yin yield is going here
 

75
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,749
your Yin yield is going here
and it's mostly from him

81
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,429

and you start to move him

82
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:04,439
and you start to move him
 

83
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,850
and you start to move him
this way I'm going to ask you to uh

84
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:07,860
this way I'm going to ask you to uh
 

85
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,850
this way I'm going to ask you to uh
reference his shoulder

86
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:10,860
reference his shoulder
 

87
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,410
reference his shoulder
you see that so not not here

88
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:15,420
you see that so not not here

reference his shoulder
 

91
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,170
reference his shoulder
see that his shoulder is traveling in

92
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:21,180
see that his shoulder is traveling in
 

93
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,190
see that his shoulder is traveling in
space which it's gonna do when you go

94
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
space which it's gonna do when you go
 

95
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,830
space which it's gonna do when you go
here you see it's just you're making

96
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
here you see it's just you're making
 

97
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,830
here you see it's just you're making
sure that this hand is not keeping his

98
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:30,840
sure that this hand is not keeping his
 

99
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,250
sure that this hand is not keeping his
shoulder there but that it too is

100
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:34,260
shoulder there but that it too is
 

101
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,910
shoulder there but that it too is
assisting that his shoulders move see

102
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
assisting that his shoulders move see
 

103
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,790
assisting that his shoulders move see
and that will stop his sin his Center

104
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
and that will stop his sin his Center
 

105
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,770
and that will stop his sin his Center
won't be squatty

106
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:42,780
won't be squatty
 

107
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,210
won't be squatty
you see

108
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,220
you see
 

109
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,210
you see
his head his spine is stilted but his

110
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:47,220
his head his spine is stilted but his
 

111
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,430
his head his spine is stilted but his
Center barely moved because you kept it

112
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
Center barely moved because you kept it
 

113
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:57,290
Center barely moved because you kept it
in place now home

114
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:57,300

 

115
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,089

now you're going to pay attention to the

116
00:02:59,089 --> 00:02:59,099
now you're going to pay attention to the
 

117
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,809
now you're going to pay attention to the
young shoulder it keeps moving with the

118
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:02,819
young shoulder it keeps moving with the
 

119
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:14,449
young shoulder it keeps moving with the
in hand

121
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,949

and that happens because this hand

122
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
and that happens because this hand
 

123
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,710
and that happens because this hand
first does

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:31,980
there is a little then around
 

129
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,509
there is a little then around
just like this one actually goes first a

okay let's try again

okay let's try again
is there a point during the technique

146

is there a point during the technique
 

147
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,770
is there a point during the technique
where the yin arm is no longer doing

00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,010
then you can look for this this hand so
he's trying to cook you projection

336
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,020
he's trying to cook you projection
 

337

he's trying to cook you projection
I'm not healed and I'm here just resting

come up these things
 

343
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:55,970
come up these things
that you have it

344
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:55,980

so as I'm here I'm not

348
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:10,500
so as I'm here I'm not
 

349

353
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,530
match that give me on value and that

355
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,690

356
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:26,700
so a lot of times depending on what they
 

357
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,570

to here
 

361
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,829
to here
do you see but I I'm he's touching me

362
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
do you see but I I'm he's touching me
 

363
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,470
do you see but I I'm he's touching me
here so that's what I adhere to that

364
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
here so that's what I adhere to that
 

365
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,210
here so that's what I adhere to that
that part

366
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:41,220

 

367
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:59,630

but I'm not pressing down

368
00:09:59,630 --> 00:09:59,640

 

369
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,810

that time my arm did it

370
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:02,820
that time my arm did it
 

371
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,290
that time my arm did it
at that time my arm got over the top

372
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:06,300
at that time my arm got over the top
 

373
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,210
at that time my arm got over the top
you see

374
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:08,220
you see
 

375
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,150
you see
and that's where the adhesion is

376
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,160
and that's where the adhesion is
 

377
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,670
and that's where the adhesion is
here

378
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:16,680

 

379
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,850

so you have to resist

380
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:19,860
so you have to resist
 

381
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,509
so you have to resist
uh the throwing of him

382
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
uh the throwing of him
 

383
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,329
uh the throwing of him
as you said initially you get greedy and

384
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:26,339
as you said initially you get greedy and
 

385
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,910
as you said initially you get greedy and
you're like oh yeah I got him you have

386
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:28,920
you're like oh yeah I got him you have
 

387
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,829
you're like oh yeah I got him you have
to resist that and you're just doing the

388
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839
to resist that and you're just doing the
 

389
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,030
to resist that and you're just doing the
relationship

390
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,040
relationship
 

391
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,130

so

392
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:34,140
so
 

393
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,370
so
you do have a physical component and

394
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:37,380
you do have a physical component and
 

395
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,009
you do have a physical component and
I've asked you there but you also have

396
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:40,019
I've asked you there but you also have
 

397
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,410
I've asked you there but you also have
this energetic component

398
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:42,420
this energetic component
 

399
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,590
this energetic component
and when I do the energetic components

400
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
and when I do the energetic components
 

401
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,470
and when I do the energetic components
although the I key adhesion

402
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
although the I key adhesion
 

403
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,470
although the I key adhesion
is happening out here

404
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:51,480
is happening out here
 

405
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,550
is happening out here
the source of it is in my body

406
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:55,560
the source of it is in my body
 

407
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,970
the source of it is in my body
so his young energy

408
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:58,980
so his young energy
 

409
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,850
so his young energy
is going to go into my body

410
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:01,860
is going to go into my body
 

411
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,910
is going to go into my body
and I'm going to rotate it with the yin

412
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:04,920
and I'm going to rotate it with the yin
 

413
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,449
and I'm going to rotate it with the yin
energy coming from the ground

414
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:07,459
energy coming from the ground
 

415
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:12,889
energy coming from the ground
and that what I let back out is equal to

416
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:12,899
and that what I let back out is equal to
 

417
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,670
and that what I let back out is equal to
whatever is on this hand

418
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:16,680

 

419
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,030

so in my mind when I'm practicing I

420
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,040
so in my mind when I'm practicing I
 

421
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,210
so in my mind when I'm practicing I
don't do uh

422
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:22,220
don't do uh

429
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,190

430
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:34,200

431
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,949

at the end like notice how relaxed the

at the end like notice how relaxed the

I guess what I'm trying to say there is
 

469
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,650
I guess what I'm trying to say there is
notice that I'm getting the effect

470
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:05,660
notice that I'm getting the effect

and hence the effect is energetic okay

and hence the effect is energetic okay
 

477
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:22,250

gravity outside his base of support but
 

509
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,610
gravity outside his base of support but
uh you have to move past that

510
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:19,620
uh you have to move past that
 

511
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,290
uh you have to move past that
um so the first thing before we get to

512
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:24,300
um so the first thing before we get to
 

513
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,690
um so the first thing before we get to
the answer to your question if it's not

514
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:26,700
the answer to your question if it's not
 

515
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,050
the answer to your question if it's not
relaxed what is it is let's stay still

516
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:30,060
relaxed what is it is let's stay still
 

517
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,329
relaxed what is it is let's stay still
uh physical

518
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:32,339
uh physical
 

519
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,470
uh physical
and let's note that uh suareza

520
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
and let's note that uh suareza
 

521
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,670
and let's note that uh suareza
is training that

522
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
is training that
 

523
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,230
is training that
isolates out

524
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
isolates out
 

525
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,050
isolates out
the midfoot point on the bottom of your

526
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,060
the midfoot point on the bottom of your
 

527
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:50,269
the midfoot point on the bottom of your
foot and zeros in on the quad okay so

528
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:50,279
foot and zeros in on the quad okay so
 

529
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:54,949
foot and zeros in on the quad okay so
you don't want to uh stay here there's

530
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
you don't want to uh stay here there's
 

531
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,470
you don't want to uh stay here there's
going to be movement

532
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:57,480
going to be movement
 

533
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,050
going to be movement
in the quad

534
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,060
in the quad
 

535
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,470
in the quad
okay let's some of us uh let's just

536
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:03,480
okay let's some of us uh let's just
 

537
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,050
okay let's some of us uh let's just
that's all you're going to do so I want

538
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,060
that's all you're going to do so I want
 

539
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,449
that's all you're going to do so I want
you to again I'm giving you a reference

540
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:08,459
you to again I'm giving you a reference
 

541
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:12,110
you to again I'm giving you a reference
point uh just like that's not kokudosa

542
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,120
point uh just like that's not kokudosa
 

543
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,110
point uh just like that's not kokudosa
but that's my reference point in whether

544
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
but that's my reference point in whether
 

545
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,509
but that's my reference point in whether
I had a young young Clash or not did the

546
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
I had a young young Clash or not did the
 

547
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,030
I had a young young Clash or not did the
shoulder keep moving diagonally forward

548
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,040
shoulder keep moving diagonally forward
 

549
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,030
shoulder keep moving diagonally forward
into the angle of disturbance okay so my

550
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
into the angle of disturbance okay so my
 

551
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,850
into the angle of disturbance okay so my
reference point here is the seams

552
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:25,860
reference point here is the seams
 

553
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,110
reference point here is the seams
between my legs and my pelvis I don't

554
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,120
between my legs and my pelvis I don't
 

555
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,189
between my legs and my pelvis I don't
want them to stay here in Cesar they

556
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:34,199
want them to stay here in Cesar they
 

557
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:39,949
want them to stay here in Cesar they
will move open and close Okay so as I'm

558
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:39,959
will move open and close Okay so as I'm
 

559
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,110
will move open and close Okay so as I'm
going to this way

560
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,120
going to this way
 

561
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,810
going to this way
they again because there's Yang and Yin

562
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:44,820
they again because there's Yang and Yin
 

563
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,389
they again because there's Yang and Yin
they're gonna open and close one way and

564
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:47,399
they're gonna open and close one way and
 

565
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,750
they're gonna open and close one way and
then open and close the other way okay

566
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:49,760
then open and close the other way okay
 

567
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,030
then open and close the other way okay
so if I would like for you to look at

568
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
so if I would like for you to look at
 

569
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,329
so if I would like for you to look at
the scenes that forget him forget my

570
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:56,339
the scenes that forget him forget my
 

571
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:00,350
the scenes that forget him forget my
hand work okay so you're gonna see

572
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:00,360
hand work okay so you're gonna see
 

573
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,350
hand work okay so you're gonna see
that if I throw that way first

574
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
that if I throw that way first
 

575
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,710
that if I throw that way first
first they go this way and then they go

576
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
first they go this way and then they go
 

577
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,470
first they go this way and then they go
that way okay so you're you're looking

578
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:09,480
that way okay so you're you're looking
 

579
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:20,990
that way okay so you're you're looking
for that whoa

580
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,000

 

581
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,430

oh

582
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:22,440
oh
 

583
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,129
oh
I I'm consciously

584
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:25,139
I I'm consciously
 

585
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,590
I I'm consciously
uh working that that's the whole point

586
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
uh working that that's the whole point
 

587
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,810
uh working that that's the whole point
of suareza okay

588
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:29,820
of suareza okay
 

589
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,710
of suareza okay
at if you're if you got that down

590
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:33,720
at if you're if you got that down
 

591
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,110
at if you're if you got that down
then what I want you to do

592
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,120
then what I want you to do
 

593
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,350
then what I want you to do
is take the time then and the tanden is

594
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
is take the time then and the tanden is
 

595
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,650
is take the time then and the tanden is
where it's

596
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:42,660

 

597
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,590

it's not a place

598
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
it's not a place
 

599
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,590
it's not a place
where that heaven

600
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:48,600
where that heaven
 

601
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,249
where that heaven
Chi and the Earth Chi meet

602
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:52,259
Chi and the Earth Chi meet
 

603
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,509
Chi and the Earth Chi meet
where they meet is the time death okay

604
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
where they meet is the time death okay
 

605
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,790
where they meet is the time death okay
so you're going to uh start to move that

606
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:01,800
so you're going to uh start to move that
 

607
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,930
so you're going to uh start to move that
tons in

608
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:02,940
tons in
 

609
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,970
tons in
and it is going to that energy is going

610
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:07,980
and it is going to that energy is going
 

611
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,309
and it is going to that energy is going
to go

612
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
to go
 

613
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,850
to go
out first with the quad so it's going to

614
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:13,860
out first with the quad so it's going to
 

615
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,990
out first with the quad so it's going to
rotate

616
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,000
rotate
 

617
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,449
rotate
this way

618
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:17,459
this way
 

619
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,909
this way
it's going to rotate up

620
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
it's going to rotate up
 

621
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,429
it's going to rotate up
that's what gets his Center up it's

622
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:22,439
that's what gets his Center up it's
 

623
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,429
that's what gets his Center up it's
going to rotate back the other way and

624
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
going to rotate back the other way and
 

625
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,189
going to rotate back the other way and
then down rotate forward

626
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:28,199
then down rotate forward
 

627
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,490
then down rotate forward
okay so I'm doing as I'm doing the

628
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:31,500
okay so I'm doing as I'm doing the
 

629
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,590
okay so I'm doing as I'm doing the
technique and he's pushing I'm going

630
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
technique and he's pushing I'm going
 

631
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,630
technique and he's pushing I'm going
it's going to rotate out

632
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:35,640
it's going to rotate out
 

633
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,150
it's going to rotate out
it's going to rotate up it's going to

634
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
it's going to rotate up it's going to
 

635
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,150
it's going to rotate up it's going to
rotate in and then rotate down that

636
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:41,160
rotate in and then rotate down that
 

637
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,350
rotate in and then rotate down that
energy so home

638
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
energy so home
 

639
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,490
energy so home
[Music]

640
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:46,500

 

641
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,510

you there's

642
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
you there's
 

643
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,450
you there's
[Music]

[Music]
and so you can't inverse it first move

646
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:52,799
and so you can't inverse it first move
 

647
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,310
and so you can't inverse it first move
your quad then then move your energy the

648
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,320
your quad then then move your energy the
 

649
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,169
your quad then then move your energy the
same way there's no way you can

650
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:57,179
same way there's no way you can
 

651
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,450
same way there's no way you can
reconcile the young John Clash without

652
00:17:59,450 --> 00:17:59,460
reconcile the young John Clash without
 

653
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,029
reconcile the young John Clash without
that shoulder coming forward okay but it

654
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:02,039
that shoulder coming forward okay but it
 

655
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,890
that shoulder coming forward okay but it
doesn't mean you're doing everything but

656
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:03,900
doesn't mean you're doing everything but
 

657
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,770
doesn't mean you're doing everything but
that has to be there so as I'm doing the

658
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:06,780
that has to be there so as I'm doing the
 

659
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,070
that has to be there so as I'm doing the
technique I that those three or four of

660
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
technique I that those three or four of
 

661
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,310
technique I that those three or four of
you in the dojo you're gonna work on

662
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,320
you in the dojo you're gonna work on
 

663
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,730
you in the dojo you're gonna work on
feeling those

664
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:15,740
feeling those
 

665
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,650
feeling those
and you're gonna rotate it that's what's

666
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:18,660
and you're gonna rotate it that's what's
 

667
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:30,529
and you're gonna rotate it that's what's
rotating okay

668
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:30,539

 

669
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,289

for others you're gonna actually work

670
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:33,299
for others you're gonna actually work
 

671
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:39,110
for others you're gonna actually work
