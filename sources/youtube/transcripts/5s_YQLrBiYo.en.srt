when I began teaching I had studied

270
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
when I began teaching I had studied
 

271
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,670
when I began teaching I had studied
martial arts for a long time I was right

272
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
martial arts for a long time I was right
 

273
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,610
martial arts for a long time I was right
around 200 pounds in great physical

274
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:52,620
around 200 pounds in great physical
 

275
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,450
around 200 pounds in great physical
shape and in my 30s the problem was I

276
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:56,460
shape and in my 30s the problem was I
 

277
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,730
shape and in my 30s the problem was I
was often being asked to teach people

278
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:58,740
was often being asked to teach people
 

279
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,129
was often being asked to teach people
who were much smaller than me and less

280
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:01,139
who were much smaller than me and less
 

281
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,010
who were much smaller than me and less
skilled than me how to defend themselves

skilled than me how to defend themselves
 

283
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,409
skilled than me how to defend themselves
so as a teacher how was I going to teach

284
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:06,419
so as a teacher how was I going to teach
 

285
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,390
so as a teacher how was I going to teach
these people to deal with people who

286
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
these people to deal with people who
 

287
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,670
these people to deal with people who
were physically much greater than them

288
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:10,680
were physically much greater than them
 

289
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,029
were physically much greater than them
at first the answer may seem simple well

290
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:14,039
at first the answer may seem simple well
 

291
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,129
at first the answer may seem simple well
train them to be as capable and skilled

292
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:16,139
train them to be as capable and skilled
 

293
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,249
train them to be as capable and skilled
as you are and they'll be fine but many

294
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:19,259
as you are and they'll be fine but many
 

295
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,110
as you are and they'll be fine but many
of my students were already past the

296
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
of my students were already past the
 

297
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,270
of my students were already past the
prime of their life and many of them

298
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
prime of their life and many of them
 

299
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,430
prime of their life and many of them
would never be the same size I was no

300
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
would never be the same size I was no
 

301
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,710
would never be the same size I was no
matter how hard they trained and a great

302
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:27,720
matter how hard they trained and a great
 

303
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,170
matter how hard they trained and a great
number of them didn't have the time to

304
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,180
number of them didn't have the time to
 

305
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,809
number of them didn't have the time to
become as skilled as I had so how could

306
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:32,819
become as skilled as I had so how could
 

307
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,210
become as skilled as I had so how could
I help these students I guess I could

308
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:35,220
I help these students I guess I could
 

309
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,770
I help these students I guess I could
have Shrugged my shoulders and said

310
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:36,780
have Shrugged my shoulders and said
 

311
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,570
have Shrugged my shoulders and said
sorry you're not cut out to be able to

312
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:38,580
sorry you're not cut out to be able to
 

313
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,490
sorry you're not cut out to be able to
defend yourself but that didn't sit

314
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:40,500
defend yourself but that didn't sit
 

315
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,890
defend yourself but that didn't sit
right with me I wanted to know if I

316
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:42,900
right with me I wanted to know if I
 

317
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,809
right with me I wanted to know if I
could actually train these people to

318
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:44,819
could actually train these people to
 

319
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,670
could actually train these people to
deal with someone much larger than them

320
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:46,680
deal with someone much larger than them
 

321
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,790
deal with someone much larger than them
so I began looking at other places for

322
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:49,800
so I began looking at other places for
 

323
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,230
so I began looking at other places for
these answers

324
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,240
these answers
 

325
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,890
these answers
then I realized something very important

326
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:53,900
then I realized something very important
 

327
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,409
then I realized something very important
fighting is always difficult and risky

328
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:57,419
fighting is always difficult and risky
 

329
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,650
fighting is always difficult and risky
and ideal self-defense wouldn't involve

330
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:00,660
and ideal self-defense wouldn't involve
 

331
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,089
and ideal self-defense wouldn't involve
fighting at all

332
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:05,099

 

333
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:07,610

in fact the word fight was the wrong

334

in fact the word fight was the wrong
 

335
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,589
in fact the word fight was the wrong
word for what I was now interested in

336
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
word for what I was now interested in
 

337
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,129
word for what I was now interested in
but as a martial artist fight was the

338
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:13,139
but as a martial artist fight was the
 

339
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,469
but as a martial artist fight was the
only word I could conceive of to get it

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,370
what I was looking for
the word fight defines so much of what

344
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:19,380
the word fight defines so much of what
 

345
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,290
the word fight defines so much of what
we do as martial artists that we really

346
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:21,300
we do as martial artists that we really
 

347
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,990
we do as martial artists that we really
can't see beyond it and that's very

348
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
can't see beyond it and that's very
 

349
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,969
can't see beyond it and that's very
dangerous for someone who's truly

350
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:25,979
dangerous for someone who's truly
 

351
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,790

interested in self-defense

352
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
interested in self-defense

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,490
interested in self-defense
I needed a new way to think about the

354
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:31,500
I needed a new way to think about the
 

355
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,770
I needed a new way to think about the
kinds of skills I wanted outside of

356
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:33,780
kinds of skills I wanted outside of
 

357
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,790
kinds of skills I wanted outside of
fighting

358
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
fighting
 

359
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,430
fighting
eventually I realized that everything I

360
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
eventually I realized that everything I
 

361
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,110
eventually I realized that everything I
wanted to know was included in the word

362
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
wanted to know was included in the word
 

363
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,450
wanted to know was included in the word
conflict

364
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:41,460
conflict
 

365
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,390
conflict
while conflict includes fighting it also

366
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
while conflict includes fighting it also
 

367
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,629
while conflict includes fighting it also
allowed for skills outside of fighting I

368
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:47,639
allowed for skills outside of fighting I
 

369
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,270
allowed for skills outside of fighting I
eventually came to understand that there

370
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,280
eventually came to understand that there
 

371
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,089
eventually came to understand that there
were many more skills to conflict other

372
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:53,099
were many more skills to conflict other
 

373
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,029
were many more skills to conflict other
than fighting skills and that this new

374
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:56,039
than fighting skills and that this new
 

375
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,430
than fighting skills and that this new
way of thinking allowed many new skills

376
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:58,440
way of thinking allowed many new skills
 

377
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,189
way of thinking allowed many new skills
that were equal to or even greater than

378

that were equal to or even greater than
 

379
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,050

about what are called conflict
resolution systems and I also created a

resolution systems and I also created a
 

393
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,749
