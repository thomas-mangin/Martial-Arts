1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:14,150

all right so this is the tar

2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160

 

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,749

you hear that

4
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:15,759
you hear that
 

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,390
you hear that
do you hear that did it did it

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
do you hear that did it did it
 

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:27,910
do you hear that did it did it
and sometimes just

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:27,920

 

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,790

that's what you should hear

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
that's what you should hear
 

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,670
that's what you should hear
not

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:35,680

 

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,190

not that

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200

 

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,229

so

16
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239

 

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,389

this is really good all right

18
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
this is really good all right
 

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,510
this is really good all right
so it could be a lot worse but if you go

20
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
so it could be a lot worse but if you go
 

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,750
so it could be a lot worse but if you go
there so when you've got the taranuchi

22
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
there so when you've got the taranuchi
 

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,510
there so when you've got the taranuchi
so if you put your kenneth when you've

24
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
so if you put your kenneth when you've
 

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,229
so if you put your kenneth when you've
got the taranucci

26
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
got the taranucci
 

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,470
got the taranucci
you should look at your ken

28
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
you should look at your ken
 

29
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,069
you should look at your ken
and as you cut it down because it's

30
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
and as you cut it down because it's
 

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,430
and as you cut it down because it's
rubber

32
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
rubber
 

33
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,869
rubber
it might jump

34
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
it might jump
 

35
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,349
it might jump
to the left

36
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
to the left
 

37
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,670
to the left
it might jump to the right so these are

38
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
it might jump to the right so these are
 

39
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,870
it might jump to the right so these are
all things that if you've got a

40
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
all things that if you've got a
 

41
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,149
all things that if you've got a
tabernucci or you try at any stage these

42
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
tabernucci or you try at any stage these
 

43
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,350
tabernucci or you try at any stage these
are things you'll see or you'll get

44
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
are things you'll see or you'll get
 

45
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,190
are things you'll see or you'll get
you'll get this

46
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
you'll get this
 

47
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,109
you'll get this
the thing to do is

48
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119

 

49
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,910

you sense you said you squeeze it like

50
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
you sense you said you squeeze it like
 

51
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,469
you sense you said you squeeze it like
like ringing water out of a towel

52
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
like ringing water out of a towel
 

53
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,950
like ringing water out of a towel
at the very end so you go

54
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
at the very end so you go
 

55
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,469
at the very end so you go
squeeze

56
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479

 

57
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,590

you then

58
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
you then
 

59
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,390
you then
have a little injection going forward

60
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400

 

61
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,789

all right so you don't just

62
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
all right so you don't just
 

63
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,469
all right so you don't just
cut it down

64
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
cut it down
 

65
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,830
cut it down
but you

66
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
but you
 

67
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,630
but you
squeeze you feel the difference in the

68
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
squeeze you feel the difference in the
 

69
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,670
squeeze you feel the difference in the
all right so if you just go down

70
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
all right so if you just go down
 

71
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,109
all right so if you just go down
as that

72
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
as that
 

73
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,270
as that
if you go forward

74
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
if you go forward
 

75
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,630
if you go forward
it's that

76
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
it's that
 

77
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,870
it's that
has more power in going forward because

78
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
has more power in going forward because
 

79
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,789
has more power in going forward because
it becomes like a slice

80
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
it becomes like a slice
 

81
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,109
it becomes like a slice
all right so it mustn't go to the left

82
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
all right so it mustn't go to the left
 

83
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,510
all right so it mustn't go to the left
it mustn't go to the right

84
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
it mustn't go to the right
 

85
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,789
it mustn't go to the right
it mustn't

86
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
it mustn't
 

87
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,670
it mustn't
bounce

88
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680

 

89
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,109

i used to have a

90
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
i used to have a
 

91
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,070
i used to have a
a young student 19 years of age

92
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
a young student 19 years of age
 

93
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,710
a young student 19 years of age
he used to hit the tar and keep in it

94
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
he used to hit the tar and keep in it
 

95
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,510
he used to hit the tar and keep in it
and you could see the tar sort of feed

96
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
and you could see the tar sort of feed
 

97
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,750
and you could see the tar sort of feed
most people that hit the target sort of

98
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
most people that hit the target sort of
 

99
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,630
most people that hit the target sort of
like took them back

100
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
like took them back
 

101
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,430
like took them back
so that what you then take from it is

102
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
so that what you then take from it is
 

103
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,869
so that what you then take from it is
you now use the bounce from the tyre

104
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
you now use the bounce from the tyre
 

105
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,229
you now use the bounce from the tyre
and this is really what we've been

106
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
and this is really what we've been
 

107
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,869
and this is really what we've been
talking about this morning in aikido we

108
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
talking about this morning in aikido we
 

109
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,990
talking about this morning in aikido we
used like i was timing with the partner

110
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
used like i was timing with the partner
 

111
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,550
used like i was timing with the partner
when i hit that

112
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
when i hit that
 

113
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,550
when i hit that
i'm going to use the energy

114
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
i'm going to use the energy
 

115
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,869
i'm going to use the energy
to get the ken up there

116
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879

 

117
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,949

if i go like that and now mechanically

118
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
if i go like that and now mechanically
 

119
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,229
if i go like that and now mechanically
do this

120
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
do this
 

121
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,350
do this
this is what i call basic school

122
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360

 

123
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,030

you feel the difference in the power

124
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040

 

125
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,150

so

126
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
so
 

127
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,790
so
you have to work out

128
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800

 

129
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,470

are you out of breath

130
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
are you out of breath
 

131
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,790
are you out of breath
you know did you put everything into the

132
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
you know did you put everything into the
 

133
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,229
you know did you put everything into the
cat

134
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
cat
 

135
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,949
cat
or

136
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959

 

137
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,710

or can you use the power that the first

138
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
or can you use the power that the first
 

139
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,949
or can you use the power that the first
one gave you so the taranuchi is not

140
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
one gave you so the taranuchi is not
 

141
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,030
one gave you so the taranuchi is not
just the tile that you whack away

142
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
just the tile that you whack away
 

143
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,949
just the tile that you whack away
thinking it's going to make your hips

144
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
thinking it's going to make your hips
 

145
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,550
thinking it's going to make your hips
strong

146
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
strong
 

147
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,789
strong
and then somebody asked me about in the

148
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:24,799
and then somebody asked me about in the
 

149
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,229
and then somebody asked me about in the
31 carter 5 6 7 8.

150
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
31 carter 5 6 7 8.
 

151
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,949
31 carter 5 6 7 8.
if i take this energy

152
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959

 

153
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,470

and you can do in the 31 carter

154
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
and you can do in the 31 carter
 

155
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,030
and you can do in the 31 carter
without going like this

156
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
without going like this
 

157
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,229
without going like this

158
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239

seven

162
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640

seven
eight

164
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
eight
 

165
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,190
eight
you know one's mechanical physical the

166
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
you know one's mechanical physical the
 

167
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,670
you know one's mechanical physical the
other one is energized

168
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680

 

169
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,910

and then you you start learning

170
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
and then you you start learning
 

171
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,949
and then you you start learning
hypogeary different directions

172
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
hypogeary different directions
 

173
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,990
hypogeary different directions
because

174
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
because
 

175
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,229
because
you know i was talking about sensing

176
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
you know i was talking about sensing
 

177
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,910
you know i was talking about sensing

him
it's almost like i had to go

376
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
it's almost like i had to go
 

377
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,670
it's almost like i had to go
well this is just this is just my this

378
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
well this is just this is just my this
 

379
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,670
well this is just this is just my this
is just my hand you know

380
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
is just my hand you know
 

381
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,070
is just my hand you know
but if i go with my mind

382
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080

 

383
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,030

it's almost like you're pushing air

384
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
it's almost like you're pushing air
 

385
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,550
it's almost like you're pushing air
that's the only way i could describe it

386
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
that's the only way i could describe it
 

387
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,829
that's the only way i could describe it
to you it's like i'm pushing air and if

388
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
to you it's like i'm pushing air and if
 

389
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,590
to you it's like i'm pushing air and if
you do this with your hands you can

390
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
you do this with your hands you can
 

391
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,110
you do this with your hands you can
actually feel what i mean about

392
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
actually feel what i mean about
 

393
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,750
actually feel what i mean about
condensing air

394
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
condensing air
 

395
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,870
condensing air
so you know you can try it by all means

396
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
so you know you can try it by all means
 

397
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,949
so you know you can try it by all means
you know i don't always talk about this

398
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
you know i don't always talk about this
 

399
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,350
you know i don't always talk about this
stuff sometimes i do but if you can feel

400
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
stuff sometimes i do but if you can feel
 

401
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,430
stuff sometimes i do but if you can feel
this condensing of air between your two

402
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
this condensing of air between your two
 

403
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,190
this condensing of air between your two
hands

404
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
hands
 

405
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,430
hands
is it condensing air or is it condensing

406
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
is it condensing air or is it condensing
 

407
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,910
is it condensing air or is it condensing
your energy

408
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
your energy
 

409
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,509
your energy
so when i do this it's a measured point

410
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
so when i do this it's a measured point
 

411
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,870
so when i do this it's a measured point
over him

412
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
over him
 

413
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,910
over him
and

414
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
and
 

415
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,910
and
it's a measured point i mustn't go

416
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
it's a measured point i mustn't go
 

417
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,750
it's a measured point i mustn't go
further

418
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
further
 

419
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,590
further
or else

420
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
or else
 

421
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,389
or else
the space will be too great

422
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399

 

423
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,670

too complicated really isn't it

424
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
too complicated really isn't it
 

425
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,470
too complicated really isn't it
but uh

426
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480

 

427
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,910

yeah

how's that sense he's been able to go
 

445
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,430
how's that sense he's been able to go
how can he control that how can he get

446
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
how can he control that how can he get
 

447
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,269
how can he control that how can he get
them

448
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
them
 

449
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,509
them
how can he make that per you know this

450
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
how can he make that per you know this
 

451
