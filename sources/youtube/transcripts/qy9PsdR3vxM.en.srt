00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
not in his hands do you see that or
 

103
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,509
not in his hands do you see that or
because I'm out of range say yes it's

104
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:54,519
because I'm out of range say yes it's
 

105
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,670
because I'm out of range say yes it's
too obvious okay but if I'm over here

too obvious okay but if I'm over here
 

107
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,589
too obvious okay but if I'm over here
and I'm uh aing just down on his hands

108
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599

109
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,070
and I'm uh aing just down on his hands
then it's not in his Center okay or if

move your bad body mechanics faster

138

move your bad body mechanics faster
 

139

that's not what I mean okay so you can
 

141
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,589
that's not what I mean okay so you can
do this slowly and in fact I think you

142
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:50,599
do this slowly and in fact I think you
 

143
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,509
do this slowly and in fact I think you
have to because of the nature of the

144
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
have to because of the nature of the
 

145
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,190
have to because of the nature of the
time and you don't want to break each

146

okay um me meaning if I can if he can't

150
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
okay um me meaning if I can if he can't
 

151
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,509
okay um me meaning if I can if he can't
do the aemi I have to be able

152
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:04,519
do the aemi I have to be able
 

153
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,750
do the aemi I have to be able
to take the injury part out of it okay

154
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
to take the injury part out of it okay
 

155
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,069
to take the injury part out of it okay
do do you guys understand is in the same

156
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:12,079
do do you guys understand is in the same
 

157
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,270
do do you guys understand is in the same
way if uh I ski and he's going to do

158
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:16,280
way if uh I ski and he's going to do
 

159
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,110
way if uh I ski and he's going to do
that application timing not the

160
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,120
that application timing not the
 

161
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,189
that application timing not the
embryonic timing on the kuchi we go and

162
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:22,199
embryonic timing on the kuchi we go and
 

163
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,909
embryonic timing on the kuchi we go and
if I mess up on my thing he doesn't

164
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:24,919
if I mess up on my thing he doesn't
 

165
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:26,950
if I mess up on my thing he doesn't
crack me in the head do do you

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:15,560
I don't I don't go like
 

241
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,830
I don't I don't go like
this I could have pass through that

head okay let's try to get in part one

252
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:50,039
head okay let's try to get in part one
 

253
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,909

but I don't block on the machia tush

254
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
but I don't block on the machia tush
 

255
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,950
but I don't block on the machia tush
you're not block you cannot there's no

256
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:55,960
you're not block you cannot there's no
 

257
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,790
you're not block you cannot there's no
blocking in AO okay so I don't ever want

258
00:06:59,790 --> 00:06:59,800
blocking in AO okay so I don't ever want
 

259
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,710
blocking in AO okay so I don't ever want
to go here but that's not going to work

260
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:01,720
to go here but that's not going to work
 

261
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,830
to go here but that's not going to work
in real

262
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840

life let's see how slow we can go okay

264
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840

265
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,270
life let's see how slow we can go okay
it'll even slower than that okay so my

266
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:10,280
it'll even slower than that okay so my
 

267
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,670
it'll even slower than that okay so my
angle he's he's going the right timing

268
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
angle he's he's going the right timing
 

269
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,070
angle he's he's going the right timing
but slower so he's mov

270
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,080
but slower so he's mov
 

271
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,710

here boom that's the embryonic training

276
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,120

Boom my attack
 

281
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,270
Boom my attack
is on the HS do you see that or maybe

282
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
is on the HS do you see that or maybe
 

283
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,510
is on the HS do you see that or maybe
somewhere around here and then you slide

284
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
somewhere around here and then you slide
 

285
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,990
somewhere around here and then you slide
down to the hands okay so try to watch

286
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,000
down to the hands okay so try to watch
 

287
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,550
down to the hands okay so try to watch
how I'm doing that my Joe never makes

288
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
how I'm doing that my Joe never makes
 

289
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,149
how I'm doing that my Joe never makes
contact here but it does pass through

290
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:47,159
contact here but it does pass through
 

291
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:50,830
contact here but it does pass through
here it makes contact there that's the

292
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:50,840
here it makes contact there that's the
 

293
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:58,309
here it makes contact there that's the
first Contact so we're

294
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319

 

295
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,430

different that's different okay all
 

299
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,710
different that's different okay all
right try it

300
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:05,720
right try it
 

301
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,070
right try it
again okay so many times in part five of

00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
again okay so many times in part five of
 

303
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,950
again okay so many times in part five of
the Gateway video especially in the

teacher highlights I repeatedly

306
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:14,680
teacher highlights I repeatedly
 

307
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,830
teacher highlights I repeatedly
emphasize that if the strike hits you

308
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:16,840
emphasize that if the strike hits you
 

309
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,589
emphasize that if the strike hits you
it's not the end of the world you keep

310
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:18,599
it's not the end of the world you keep
 

311
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,950
it's not the end of the world you keep
moving the target you yield the target

312
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:21,960
moving the target you yield the target
 

313
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,430
moving the target you yield the target
okay it's no different than if he threw

314
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:24,440
okay it's no different than if he threw
 

315
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,510
okay it's no different than if he threw
a punch at my face I don't keep it there

316
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
a punch at my face I don't keep it there
 

317
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,309
a punch at my face I don't keep it there
he goes you'll see me roll roll my face

318
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
he goes you'll see me roll roll my face
 

319
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,990
he goes you'll see me roll roll my face
okay so my uh Mr Pig my Kad teacher

320
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,000
okay so my uh Mr Pig my Kad teacher
 

321
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,550
okay so my uh Mr Pig my Kad teacher
that's that to him that was angle

322
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:37,560
that's that to him that was angle
 

323
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,630
that's that to him that was angle
deviation let the guy hit you and roll

324
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
deviation let the guy hit you and roll
 

325
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,550
deviation let the guy hit you and roll
roll take off that energy because he was

326
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:43,560
roll take off that energy because he was
 

327
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,590
roll take off that energy because he was
right where he wanted him to be for his
