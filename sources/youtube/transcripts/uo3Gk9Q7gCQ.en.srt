1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,510

so

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,520
so
 

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,710
so
right into that hip pocket

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:06,720
right into that hip pocket
 

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,830
right into that hip pocket
and then pressure has to come from this

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:09,840
and then pressure has to come from this
 

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,870
and then pressure has to come from this
vector otherwise you don't have a pin so

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:12,880
vector otherwise you don't have a pin so
 

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,589
vector otherwise you don't have a pin so
here i have like a joint manipulation

10
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,599
here i have like a joint manipulation
 

11
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,910
here i have like a joint manipulation
but he can slide out to his

12
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
but he can slide out to his
 

13
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,029
but he can slide out to his
uh right go see

14
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
uh right go see
 

15
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,910
uh right go see
so you have to move in a way that the

16
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:23,920
so you have to move in a way that the
 

17
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,950
so you have to move in a way that the
vector is going

18
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
vector is going
 

19
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,109
vector is going
this way and that's with this step here

20
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
this way and that's with this step here
 

21
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,590
this way and that's with this step here
then you have a pin

22
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600

 

23
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,150

right into place and you see it's going

24
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,160
right into place and you see it's going
 

25
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,830
right into place and you see it's going
this way

26
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840

 

27
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,150

okay

28
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
okay
 

29
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:58,389
okay

00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399

 

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,510

okay so he counters it here take this

32
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
okay so he counters it here take this
 

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,310
okay so he counters it here take this
opening here

34
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320

 

35
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:20,870

boom thumb leads kind of reverse naked

36
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880

 

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:52,830

you'll hit empty space come back

38
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840

 

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:06,830

backwards

40
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840

 

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:20,830

so

42
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840

 

43
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,480

so

44
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,490

okay so uh she she's letting go at the

48
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
okay so uh she she's letting go at the
 

49
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,790
okay so uh she she's letting go at the
bottom

50
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
bottom
 

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,229
bottom
and she's dropping her elbow inside okay

52
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
and she's dropping her elbow inside okay
 

53
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,470
and she's dropping her elbow inside okay
so people do that but that opens up

54
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
so people do that but that opens up

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:58,070

she opens up on the bottom like that

58
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080

you'll just follow the in space you see

you'll just follow the in space you see
 

63
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:05,910

pushing it's going to cut off you see it

66
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
pushing it's going to cut off you see it
 

67
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,830
pushing it's going to cut off you see it
comes around

00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
comes around
 

69
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,509

00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519

 

71
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:20,149

it's going to cut off

73
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:33,270

and you just add your movement

we're going to do a joint manipulation

00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
we're going to do a joint manipulation
 

81
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,430
we're going to do a joint manipulation
on his on his head so i'm not turning

82
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
on his on his head so i'm not turning
 

83
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,550
on his on his head so i'm not turning
his head

84

there is a kind of you feel how that
tightens there so here

it's going to turn him but i'm going to

90

it's going to turn him but i'm going to
 

91
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,550
it's going to turn him but i'm going to
tighten it right in there then that's

92
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
tighten it right in there then that's
 

93
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,149
tighten it right in there then that's
