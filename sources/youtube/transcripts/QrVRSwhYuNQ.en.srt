a consequence of that is they are

484
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:11,530
a consequence of that is they are
 

485
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,390
a consequence of that is they are
transferable from fixated movement like

486
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:16,400
transferable from fixated movement like
 

487
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,970
transferable from fixated movement like
grips to ballistic movement like strikes

488
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:18,980
grips to ballistic movement like strikes
 

489

this school and that those movements
 

509
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,440
this school and that those movements
because they are part of that universal

they do
for from fixated movement to ballistic

516
00:12:59,530 --> 00:12:59,540
for from fixated movement to ballistic
 

517
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,620
for from fixated movement to ballistic
movement okay so everything we do for a

518
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:02,630
movement okay so everything we do for a

okay so you make sure you understand
 

535
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,760
okay so you make sure you understand
that about your own training we're not

536
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:27,770
that about your own training we're not
 

537
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,220

just learning wrist grabs so I can't

538
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,230
just learning wrist grabs so I can't
 

539
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,800
just learning wrist grabs so I can't
just come up with a solution that only

540
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:32,810
just come up with a solution that only
 

541
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,370
just come up with a solution that only
works for a wrist strap
