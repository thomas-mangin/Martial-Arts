29
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,710

all right so there's there's multiple

30
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
all right so there's there's multiple
 

31
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,350
all right so there's there's multiple
skills in

32
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,360
skills in
 

33
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,469
skills in
here uh

34
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
here uh
 

35
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,870
here uh
um so we

36
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
um so we
 

37
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,950
um so we
have um what what I call external skills

38
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
have um what what I call external skills
 

39
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,510
have um what what I call external skills
so we know how I Define the internal

40
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
so we know how I Define the internal
 

41
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,510
so we know how I Define the internal
okay so if I'm not doing that definition

42
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,520
okay so if I'm not doing that definition
 

43
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,629
okay so if I'm not doing that definition
of internal then you're doing external

44
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
of internal then you're doing external
 

45
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,909
of internal then you're doing external
okay so you you will have some paries

46
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
okay so you you will have some paries
 

47
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,189
okay so you you will have some paries
you see you have some

48
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:52,199
you see you have some
 

49
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,589
you see you have some
paries um if I if I if I have his Center

50
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599
paries um if I if I if I have his Center
 

51
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,430
paries um if I if I if I have his Center
you see and you can feel I'm not moving

52
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
you see and you can feel I'm not moving
 

53
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,589
you see and you can feel I'm not moving
it right now but if you try to move it

54
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:04,599
it right now but if you try to move it
 

55
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,070
it right now but if you try to move it
you feel the the the stick there you

56
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
you feel the the the stick there you
 

57
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,830
you feel the the the stick there you
see go back to where you were here I am

58
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:10,840
see go back to where you were here I am
 

59
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,790
see go back to where you were here I am
again from the camera it looks like I'm

60
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:13,800
again from the camera it looks like I'm
 

61
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,749
again from the camera it looks like I'm
touch I'm just touching you I'm just

62
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
touch I'm just touching you I'm just
 

63
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,909
touch I'm just touching you I'm just
touching you but then you can see and

64
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:18,919
touching you but then you can see and
 

65
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:21,909
touching you but then you can see and
then you would feel like I there's

66
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
then you would feel like I there's
 

67
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,749
then you would feel like I there's
something there okay and I can of course

68
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:24,759
something there okay and I can of course
 

69
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,990
something there okay and I can of course
use it you see and then as you feel that

70
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,000
use it you see and then as you feel that
 

71
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,070
use it you see and then as you feel that
something there there then you'll try to

72
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,080
something there there then you'll try to
 

73
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,189
something there there then you'll try to
get out of it you see and so that will

74
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
get out of it you see and so that will
 

75
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,469
get out of it you see and so that will
be where maybe a Parry will come in you

76
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:35,479
be where maybe a Parry will come in you
 

77
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,110
be where maybe a Parry will come in you
see that so it starts at at the adhesion

78
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
see that so it starts at at the adhesion
 

79
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,950
see that so it starts at at the adhesion
level the seizure level and then as you

80
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:41,960
level the seizure level and then as you
 

81
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,629
level the seizure level and then as you
escape it there's a following level that

82
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
escape it there's a following level that
 

83
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,950
escape it there's a following level that
will take me now next to the

84
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
will take me now next to the
 

85
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,710
will take me now next to the
next in this case C you see okay do you

86
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
next in this case C you see okay do you
 

87
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,270
next in this case C you see okay do you
get it so that following That's What I

88
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
get it so that following That's What I
 

89
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,270
get it so that following That's What I
Call

90
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:54,280
Call
 

91
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,110
Call
following and it's very similar if I do

92
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
following and it's very similar if I do
 

93
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,469
following and it's very similar if I do
the following without any internal

94
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
the following without any internal
 

95
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,909
the following without any internal
it kind of looks like

96
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919

 

97
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,869

this

98
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:09,879
this
 

99
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,469
this
okay following alone isn't what we do

100
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
okay following alone isn't what we do
 

101
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,070
okay following alone isn't what we do
it's more that I might have to follow

102
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,080
it's more that I might have to follow
 

103
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,670
it's more that I might have to follow
every once in a while you get it as

104
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
every once in a while you get it as
 

105
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,950
every once in a while you get it as
opposed to I follow

106
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:21,960
opposed to I follow
 

107
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,029
opposed to I follow
follow uh martially if I follow follow

108
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
follow uh martially if I follow follow
 

109
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,550
follow uh martially if I follow follow
eventually you're you're going to get

110
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:27,560
eventually you're you're going to get
 

111
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,510
eventually you're you're going to get
hit in the chest if you're only follow

112
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
hit in the chest if you're only follow
 

113
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,070
hit in the chest if you're only follow
following okay um and then there's no

114
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,080
following okay um and then there's no
 

115
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,230
following okay um and then there's no
energetic component to it if you're just

116
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:35,240
energetic component to it if you're just
 

117
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,670
energetic component to it if you're just
following anyways but martially

118
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
following anyways but martially
 

119
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,710
following anyways but martially
supplementing a actual iy

120
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:43,720
supplementing a actual iy
 

121
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,550
supplementing a actual iy
seizure with following then that's

122
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
seizure with following then that's
 

123
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,590
seizure with following then that's
something you have to do that okay so

124
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
something you have to do that okay so
 

125
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,310
something you have to do that okay so
you have to be careful that you're not

126
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:51,320
you have to be careful that you're not
 

127
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,550
you have to be careful that you're not
just on the outside and you keep going

128
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:53,560
just on the outside and you keep going
 

129
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,829
just on the outside and you keep going
like this kind of stuff you see even

130
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
like this kind of stuff you see even
 

131
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,509
like this kind of stuff you see even
though I'm touching it so at at Conta

132
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
though I'm touching it so at at Conta
 

133
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,389
though I'm touching it so at at Conta
back I already have you in that then you

134
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:02,399
back I already have you in that then you
 

135
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,590
back I already have you in that then you
try to I try to do something and you try

136
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:04,600
try to I try to do something and you try
 

137
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,949
try to I try to do something and you try
to get out of it

138
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
to get out of it
 

139
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,470
to get out of it
see and there's a mixture of following

140
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
see and there's a mixture of following
 

141
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,069
see and there's a mixture of following
where I am touching you and wherever

142
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:13,079
where I am touching you and wherever
 

143
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,829
where I am touching you and wherever
your hand goes I try to stay with it do

144
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
your hand goes I try to stay with it do
 

145
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,190
your hand goes I try to stay with it do
you see okay but unlike just straight

146
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:20,200
you see okay but unlike just straight
 

147
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,829
you see okay but unlike just straight
following like let's say I'm here and

148
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:22,839
following like let's say I'm here and
 

149
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,750
following like let's say I'm here and
you try to go around it then I'm on this

150
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,760
you try to go around it then I'm on this
 

151
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,590
you try to go around it then I'm on this
adhesion and you can't do that on the on

152
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
adhesion and you can't do that on the on
 

153
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,990
adhesion and you can't do that on the on
just pure following okay and then your

154
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,000
just pure following okay and then your
 

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,110
just pure following okay and then your
following skill gets

156
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
following skill gets
 

157
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,150
following skill gets
butter let's say I I use the adhesion to

158
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
butter let's say I I use the adhesion to
 

159
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,590
butter let's say I I use the adhesion to
get that tilt you see I'm going to have

160
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:40,600
get that tilt you see I'm going to have
 

161
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,870
get that tilt you see I'm going to have
a much easier time following a dude

162
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
a much easier time following a dude
 

163
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,389
a much easier time following a dude
that's trying to get there as opposed to

164
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
that's trying to get there as opposed to
 

165
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,030
that's trying to get there as opposed to
we're here and you're going around to

166
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
we're here and you're going around to
 

167
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,910
we're here and you're going around to
you see so as I get you off balance it's

168
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:52,920
you see so as I get you off balance it's

external I'm just following the limb so
 

289
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,110

internal you for example I know I'm
 

301
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,710
internal you for example I know I'm
either C which is a projection or I know

302
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:39,720
either C which is a projection or I know
 

303
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,910
either C which is a projection or I know
that I'm adhering if you pay attention

an adhering has some sort of pulling
 

307
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,309
an adhering has some sort of pulling
aspect to it like she can't pull away or

or I can move her forward towards me you
 

311
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,670
or I can move her forward towards me you
see that you you don't really have an

312
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:54,680
see that you you don't really have an
 

313
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,150
see that you you don't really have an
adhesion if the two things aren't

314
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,160

 

315
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,749

pulling against each other it's just two

316
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:02,759
pulling against each other it's just two
 

317
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,949
pulling against each other it's just two
pieces of tape lying on each other isn't

318
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
pieces of tape lying on each other isn't
 

319
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,710
pieces of tape lying on each other isn't
really adhesion you see there's a

320
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:07,720
really adhesion you see there's a
 

321
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,189
really adhesion you see there's a
there's a a aspect of it that I need the

322
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
there's a a aspect of it that I need the
 

323
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,590
there's a a aspect of it that I need the
adhesion otherwise they'd come apart

324
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
adhesion otherwise they'd come apart
 

325
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,590
adhesion otherwise they'd come apart
okay so in order to project something

326
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:18,600
okay so in order to project something
 

327
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,949
okay so in order to project something
move something away from me it can't be

328
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:21,959
move something away from me it can't be
 

329
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,870
move something away from me it can't be
her arm has to be her Center and in

330
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:25,880
her arm has to be her Center and in
 

331
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,549
her arm has to be her Center and in
order to adhere something it has to be

332
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:29,559

something it's it's that's why it
 

533
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,149
something it's it's that's why it
doesn't ever look like it he comes

534
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:40,159
doesn't ever look like it he comes
 

535
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,430
doesn't ever look like it he comes
around here

536
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:44,440

 

537
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,990

here what what was that a block a throw

538
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,000
here what what was that a block a throw
 

539
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,549
here what what was that a block a throw
was it both was it neither one you see

540
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:51,559
was it both was it neither one you see
 

541
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:54,870
was it both was it neither one you see
and now you have the the tetralemma it

542
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880
and now you have the the tetralemma it
 

543
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,870
and now you have the the tetralemma it
was a block it was a throw it was both a

544
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:57,880
was a block it was a throw it was both a
 

545
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,510
was a block it was a throw it was both a
block and thow and because it was both

546
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:00,520
block and thow and because it was both
 

547
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,470
block and thow and because it was both
it can't be neither either I don't know

548
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:02,480
it can't be neither either I don't know
 

549
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,110
it can't be neither either I don't know
what the hell it

550
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,120
what the hell it
 

551
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,430
what the hell it
was okay so as as you're working for

552
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:08,440
was okay so as as you're working for
 

553
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,549
was okay so as as you're working for
your Ledges maybe I don't know how I

554
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
your Ledges maybe I don't know how I
 

555
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,029
your Ledges maybe I don't know how I
don't think you could think of it on the

556
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:12,039
don't think you could think of it on the
 

557
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:14,390
don't think you could think of it on the
fly but sometimes you guys are getting

558
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
fly but sometimes you guys are getting
 

559
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,510
fly but sometimes you guys are getting
in a prolonged stuck on the ledge and I

560
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:17,520
in a prolonged stuck on the ledge and I
 

561
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,110
in a prolonged stuck on the ledge and I
think you might have enough time for the

562
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,120
think you might have enough time for the
 

563
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,390
think you might have enough time for the
intellect to go let me change this and

564
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:23,400
intellect to go let me change this and
 

565
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,470
intellect to go let me change this and
let me move the ledge that they're

566
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:25,480
let me move the ledge that they're
 

567
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,630
let me move the ledge that they're
trying to use against me okay and see

568
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:28,640
trying to use against me okay and see
 

569
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,590
trying to use against me okay and see
See it'll change things you'll get out

570
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:30,600
See it'll change things you'll get out
 

571
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,310
See it'll change things you'll get out
of those those looks like two Rams

572
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:33,320
of those those looks like two Rams
 

573
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,430
of those those looks like two Rams
budding heads you guys are locked horns

574
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
budding heads you guys are locked horns
 

575
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,510
budding heads you guys are locked horns
it's like oh if you lock to me then I

576
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:38,520
it's like oh if you lock to me then I
 

577
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:57,310
it's like oh if you lock to me then I
move you move see that's the idea

578
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:57,320

 

579
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:29,190

okay for

580
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200

 

581
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,230

so let's think about it a little

582
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,240
so let's think about it a little
 

583
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,789
so let's think about it a little
differently so I know that from where

584
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:33,799
differently so I know that from where
 

585
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,070
differently so I know that from where
I'm touching i e can either push or pull

586
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,080
I'm touching i e can either push or pull
 

587
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,029
I'm touching i e can either push or pull
on your Center just

588
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:39,039
on your Center just
 

589
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,510
on your Center just
to keep it simple okay right and that's

590
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:42,520
to keep it simple okay right and that's
 

591
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,269
to keep it simple okay right and that's
a difference between the external

592
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:44,279
a difference between the external
 

593
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,310
a difference between the external
following I'm not touching your center

594
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,320
following I'm not touching your center
 

595
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,950
following I'm not touching your center
from your extremity

596
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:48,960
from your extremity
 

597
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,950
from your extremity
okay um and in this drill you're task

598
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:54,960

 

599
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,750

with um repositioning the Cent so the C

600
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
with um repositioning the Cent so the C
 

601
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,269
with um repositioning the Cent so the C
the center is in one place right and

602
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:02,279
the center is in one place right and
 

603
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:06,990
the center is in one place right and
then I'm I'm repositioning it from the

604
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,000
then I'm I'm repositioning it from the
 

605
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,789
then I'm I'm repositioning it from the
extremity okay how it is repositioned

606
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:10,799
extremity okay how it is repositioned
 

607
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,230
extremity okay how it is repositioned
from the uh its initial position is not

608
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,240
from the uh its initial position is not
 

609
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,789
from the uh its initial position is not
I don't ever choose

610
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:17,799
I don't ever choose
 

611
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:21,669
I don't ever choose
it just like because if I choose it I'm

612
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:21,679
it just like because if I choose it I'm
 

613
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,590
it just like because if I choose it I'm
going to choose it through the

614
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600
going to choose it through the
 

615
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,350
going to choose it through the
dichotomous Mind through the ego

616
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
dichotomous Mind through the ego
 

617
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,630
dichotomous Mind through the ego
tripartite you see and just like that

618
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:28,640
tripartite you see and just like that
 

619
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,710
tripartite you see and just like that
ledge you know the the the the he's shut

620
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:31,720
ledge you know the the the the he's shut
 

621
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,350
ledge you know the the the the he's shut
me down by that

622
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,360
me down by that
 

623
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,269
me down by that
bicep uh hold and it's like no he's not

624
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:36,279
bicep uh hold and it's like no he's not
 

625
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:39,430
bicep uh hold and it's like no he's not
he's making himself glal do you get it

626
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:39,440
he's making himself glal do you get it
 

627
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,070
he's making himself glal do you get it
just by thinking about it differently or

628
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
just by thinking about it differently or
 

629
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,710
just by thinking about it differently or
experiencing it differently

630
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
experiencing it differently
 

631
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,950
experiencing it differently
okay and so likewise any way that you

632
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960
okay and so likewise any way that you
 

633
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,630
okay and so likewise any way that you
make this Center move from its initial

634
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:51,640
make this Center move from its initial
 

635
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,789
make this Center move from its initial
position is the drill okay so you have

636
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:53,799
position is the drill okay so you have
 

637
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:57,510
position is the drill okay so you have
to be careful that as she's trying to do

638
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:57,520
to be careful that as she's trying to do
 

639
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,990
to be careful that as she's trying to do
this that I I only go that you see I

640
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,000
this that I I only go that you see I
 

641
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,909
this that I I only go that you see I
only go that you see cuz that's it

642
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:06,919
only go that you see cuz that's it
 

643
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,669
only go that you see cuz that's it
too because when I do this I don't have

644
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:10,679
too because when I do this I don't have
 

645
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,430
too because when I do this I don't have
you I follow till I get here now I touch

646
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:14,440
you I follow till I get here now I touch
 

647
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,909
you I follow till I get here now I touch
the center you see and then now I can

648
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:16,919
the center you see and then now I can
 

649
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:19,110
the center you see and then now I can
project but what we want to do is touch

650
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,120
project but what we want to do is touch
 

651
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,470
project but what we want to do is touch
the center from the

652
