to go so they're not going to take the

542
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:13,720
to go so they're not going to take the
 

543
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,069
to go so they're not going to take the
dive so you have to do a fuller range of

dive so you have to do a fuller range of
 

545
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,710
dive so you have to do a fuller range of

control over their body and those pins
 

603
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,230
control over their body and those pins
so they should be continue to keep

604
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
so they should be continue to keep
 

605
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,150
so they should be continue to keep
moving do do you understand that so you

606
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
moving do do you understand that so you
 

607
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,309
moving do do you understand that so you
you would have to use one of the other

608
00:15:58,309 --> 00:15:58,319
you would have to use one of the other
 

609
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:59,350
you would have to use one of the other
pins

610
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
pins
 

611
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,470
pins
that you've used that are actual pins

612
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480
that you've used that are actual pins
 

613
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,150
that you've used that are actual pins
okay does that make sense you don't so I

614
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,160
okay does that make sense you don't so I
 

615
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,990
okay does that make sense you don't so I
don't want to see you go down and do one

616
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
don't want to see you go down and do one
 

617
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,230
don't want to see you go down and do one
of the Keon pins because Yuka is just

618
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:11,240
of the Keon pins because Yuka is just
 

619
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,470
of the Keon pins because Yuka is just
lying there they they should be able to

620
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:13,480
lying there they they should be able to
 

621
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,910
lying there they they should be able to
keep moving okay so that means if you

622
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
keep moving okay so that means if you
 

623
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,829
keep moving okay so that means if you
want them there you have to do one of

624
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
want them there you have to do one of
 

625
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,710
want them there you have to do one of
the other pins

626
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:23,720

 

627
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,990

okay going on from this last one so you

628
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,000
okay going on from this last one so you
 

629
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,670
okay going on from this last one so you
heard me say Fuller rain of motion but

630
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:30,680
heard me say Fuller rain of motion but
 

631
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,710
heard me say Fuller rain of motion but
did you feel the acceleration come

632
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:33,720
did you feel the acceleration come
 

633
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,509
did you feel the acceleration come
on

634
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
on
 

635
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,990
on
okay that is a form of

636
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,000
okay that is a form of
 

637
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,670
okay that is a form of
contestation what you want to do instead

638
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:42,680
contestation what you want to do instead
 

639
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,949
contestation what you want to do instead
is every let's let's give a

640
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:47,959
is every let's let's give a
 

641
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,990
is every let's let's give a
mathematical

642
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
mathematical
 

643
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,269
mathematical
um perspective to it so here's the UK's

644
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:54,279
um perspective to it so here's the UK's
 

645
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,069
um perspective to it so here's the UK's
upright posture and they're going to go

646
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
upright posture and they're going to go
 

647
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,590
upright posture and they're going to go
to a 90 okay so every one of these

648
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:02,600
to a 90 okay so every one of these
 

649
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,590
to a 90 okay so every one of these
degrees you can start manipulating it as

650
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:06,600
degrees you can start manipulating it as
 

651
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,110
degrees you can start manipulating it as
you move it around into the kazushi

652
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
you move it around into the kazushi
 

653
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,990
you move it around into the kazushi
patterns either the front inward or the

654
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,000
patterns either the front inward or the
 

655
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,630
patterns either the front inward or the
back outward so to speak okay as opposed

656
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
back outward so to speak okay as opposed
 

657
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,150
back outward so to speak okay as opposed
to you go straight down and now you got

658
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,160
to you go straight down and now you got
 

659
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,429
to you go straight down and now you got
to try to accelerate them you see if you

660
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:22,439
to try to accelerate them you see if you
 

661
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,949
to try to accelerate them you see if you
blend incrementally with each one of

662
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:25,959
blend incrementally with each one of
 

663
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,029
blend incrementally with each one of
those you can get the body tilt

664
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
those you can get the body tilt
 

665
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,990
those you can get the body tilt
that takes them into the kazushi

666
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:31,000
that takes them into the kazushi
 

667
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,669
that takes them into the kazushi
patterns and you don't have to

668
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
patterns and you don't have to
 

669
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,270
patterns and you don't have to
accelerate them okay so look for this

670
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,280
accelerate them okay so look for this
 

671

the first mind can't make those

680
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:53,400
the first mind can't make those
 

681
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,909
the first mind can't make those
adjustments like that it cannot function

682
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
adjustments like that it cannot function
 

683
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,909
adjustments like that it cannot function
at the speed of life it it understands

684
00:17:58,909 --> 00:17:58,919
at the speed of life it it understands
 

685
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,350
at the speed of life it it understands
beginning middle end that's about it

686
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
beginning middle end that's about it
 

687
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,789
beginning middle end that's about it
okay and really just beginning end okay

okay and really just beginning end okay
 

689
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,750
okay and really just beginning end okay
so let's try it again and not have to

690
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:06,760
so let's try it again and not have to
 

691
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,549
so let's try it again and not have to
speed up okay in fact you can go quite

692
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:09,559
speed up okay in fact you can go quite
 

693
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:13,350
speed up okay in fact you can go quite
slow and still keep UK moving still get

694
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
slow and still keep UK moving still get
 

695
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,270
slow and still keep UK moving still get
them in a kazushi without letting them

696
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:16,280
them in a kazushi without letting them
 

697
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,909
them in a kazushi without letting them
regain all that kind of stuff because

698
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:18,919
regain all that kind of stuff because
 

699
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:22,070
regain all that kind of stuff because
you just keep uh adjusting each one of

700
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
you just keep uh adjusting each one of
 

701
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,470
you just keep uh adjusting each one of
those degrees into the kazushi patterns

702
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:25,480
those degrees into the kazushi patterns
 

703
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,310
those degrees into the kazushi patterns
okay let's try it

704
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,320
okay let's try it
 

705
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,990
okay let's try it
again

706
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000

 

707
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,029

so tell me if this is not

708
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
so tell me if this is not
 

709
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,110
so tell me if this is not
true when you have only access to the

710
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,120
true when you have only access to the
 

711
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,830
true when you have only access to the
first

712
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:42,840

 

713
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,230

mind the iido you do is first mind

714
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:47,240
mind the iido you do is first mind
 

715
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,870
mind the iido you do is first mind
iido the iido will

716
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
iido the iido will
 

717
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,990

second
 

721
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,710
second
mind and first mind iido is a

00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:58,720
mind and first mind iido is a
 

723
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,430
mind and first mind iido is a
contradiction it's

724
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
contradiction it's
 

725
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,310
contradiction it's
oxymoronic there's only really iido from

726
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
oxymoronic there's only really iido from
 

727

729
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:14,669

l so the the techniques are not the

730
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:14,679

 

731
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:17,630

739
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,230

does it will take the technique and

740
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:29,240
does it will take the technique and
 

741
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,110
does it will take the technique and
you'll experience it through the first
