but understand the block
 

37
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,049
but understand the block
is Young

38
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:03,059
is Young

okay so the only reason that a block can

44
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,140
okay so the only reason that a block can
 

45
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,469
okay so the only reason that a block can
exist

46
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
exist
 

47
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,810
exist
is I

and
 

67
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,170
and
an internal

68
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,180

 

69
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,010

reconciliation

70
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,020
reconciliation
 

71
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,550
reconciliation
so here

72
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560

 

73
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,649

this

74
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:00,659
this
 

75
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,910
this
gets changed to Young

76
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:04,920

 

77
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,449

versus Yin

78
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:08,459

 

79
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:17,990

okay

80

externally yield and it becomes yet
 

89
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,070
externally yield and it becomes yet
one more time

90
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
one more time
 

91
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,250
one more time
so I would like to have a

92
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:37,260

behind him stay there please
and you could do it with one arm

102
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:52,860
and you could do it with one arm
 

103
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,770
and you could do it with one arm
she's that energy

104
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:54,780
she's that energy
 

105
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,210
she's that energy
see

see
 

107
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:21,830
see
so Ah that's yum yum oh I yields

108
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840

 

109
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,850

this is low skill

110
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:25,860

 

111
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,309

it's in the art but it's low skill okay

112
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:31,319

 

113
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,830

the other one

115
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,110

is Young

116
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,120

 

117
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,050

goes inside

118
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,060

 

119
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:55,550

it's internalized

120
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:55,560

 

121
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,670

okay and when he goes internal it goes

122
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680
okay and when he goes internal it goes
 

123
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,990
okay and when he goes internal it goes
down

124
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
down
 

125
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,390
down
to the Earth

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:31,460
bigger than his energy so comparatively
 

139
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,090
bigger than his energy so comparatively
big young makes this actually Yin

140

153
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:09,409

or his energy goes down

154
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:09,419

 

155
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,330

his energy is going inside me and I

164
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,100
his energy is going inside me and I
 

165
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,010
his energy is going inside me and I
bounce it off

166
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,020
bounce it off
 

167
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,230
bounce it off
and I can move them because they become

168
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:27,240
and I can move them because they become
 

169
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,790

higher skill

174
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:52,680

 

175
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,629

three

176
00:05:59,629 --> 00:05:59,639

 

177
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:06,230

do both

178
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240

 

179
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,529

highest yeah

180
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:12,539

 

181
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:27,230

okay

183
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,370

so

184
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:28,380
so
 

185
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,909
so
let's look at something

186
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919

 

187
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,890

in the internal

188
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:33,900
in the internal
 

189
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,510
in the internal
aspect

190
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520

arms
okay so we'll do equal for example any

226
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:22,680
okay so we'll do equal for example any
 

227
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,809
okay so we'll do equal for example any
block

228
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:23,819
block
 

229
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,909

you both
boom touch

242
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:50,360

 

243
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,210

use both you see

244

where we touch

246
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520

 

247
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,610

so his

248
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:13,620
so his
 

249
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,390
so his
his block is not a block

250
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:17,400
his block is not a block
 

251
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,670
his block is not a block
it's more control point

252
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
it's more control point
 

253
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,029
it's more control point
if I internalize it okay so let's try it

254
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
if I internalize it okay so let's try it
 

255
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,369
if I internalize it okay so let's try it
from Egypt

256
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:25,379
from Egypt
 

257
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,730
from Egypt
Point number one whenever whenever it

258
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:28,740
Point number one whenever whenever it
 

259
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,909
Point number one whenever whenever it
touches you internalize then it's not a

260
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
touches you internalize then it's not a
 

261
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,949
touches you internalize then it's not a
block okay

262
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:33,959
block okay
 

263
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,709
block okay
so Gary touch

264
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
so Gary touch
 

265
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,010
so Gary touch
you said that I internalize you see well

266
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,020
you said that I internalize you see well
 

267
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,649
you said that I internalize you see well
that yeah I internalize okay that I'm

268
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:42,659
that yeah I internalize okay that I'm
 

269
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,050
that yeah I internalize okay that I'm
not over here jerking his arm around

270
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,060
not over here jerking his arm around
 

271
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,630
not over here jerking his arm around
okay so let's say he blocks the arm

272
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
okay so let's say he blocks the arm
 

273
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,230
okay so let's say he blocks the arm
you see and his whole body

274
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
you see and his whole body
 

275
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,750
you see and his whole body
guess internalized

276
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:56,760
guess internalized
 

277
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,090
guess internalized
so we'll have him block

278
00:08:59,090 --> 00:08:59,100
so we'll have him block
 

279
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,370
so we'll have him block
the arm

280
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:00,380
the arm
 

281
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,430
the arm
ah the whole body whole body will move

282
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:04,440
ah the whole body whole body will move
 

283
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,389
ah the whole body whole body will move
okay lock the arm whole body

so if you pay attention

286
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
so if you pay attention
 

287
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,710
so if you pay attention
if you look at his body

288
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720

 

289
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,430

When I Come Around Here look at his

whatever you touch
 

371
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,610
whatever you touch
you internalize

372
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:01,620
you internalize
 

373
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,250
you internalize
and then you use you either Coke you

374
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,260
and then you use you either Coke you
 

375
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,290
and then you use you either Coke you
project or ID adhere Okay so

376
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:09,300
project or ID adhere Okay so
 

377
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:16,250
project or ID adhere Okay so
here the first one boom it's an adhesion

378
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,260

 

379
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,710

the third one too is an adhesion

380
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:21,720

 

381
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,410

the second one was the Coq

382
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:24,420
the second one was the Coq
 

383
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,750
the second one was the Coq
boom

384
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:26,760
boom
 

385
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,470
boom
okay okay but if he

386
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
okay okay but if he
 

387
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,810
okay okay but if he
comes in blocks

388
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:32,820
comes in blocks
 

389
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,430
comes in blocks
right

390
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:34,440
right
 

391
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,670
right
um he's oh let's look at this Vector

392
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
um he's oh let's look at this Vector
 

393
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,490
um he's oh let's look at this Vector
okay let go

394
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:40,500
okay let go
 

395
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,870
okay let go
stand up

396
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:41,880
stand up
 

397
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,910
stand up

399
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,470
and correct your posture
over here

400
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:45,480
over here
 

401
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,970
over here
do you see

402
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:46,980
do you see
 

403
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,329
do you see
that that's what he's doing there okay

404
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:49,339
that that's what he's doing there okay
 

405
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:53,350
that that's what he's doing there okay
so I'm not going

406
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360

 

407
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,170

it's inside and I've moved his butt

408
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:57,180
it's inside and I've moved his butt
 

409
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,030
it's inside and I've moved his butt
inside

410
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
inside
 

411
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,810
inside
and he's pushing pushing pushing I'm not

412
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:02,820
and he's pushing pushing pushing I'm not
 

413
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,790
and he's pushing pushing pushing I'm not
going

414
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:03,800
going
 

415
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,550
going
that's yum yum inside

416
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:07,560
that's yum yum inside
 

417
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,850
that's yum yum inside
through

418
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:10,860

 

419
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,210

okay the internal whatever touches me

420
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,220
okay the internal whatever touches me
 

421
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,190
okay the internal whatever touches me
gets internalized

422
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200

 

423
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,590

Point number two

424
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
Point number two
 

425
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,750
Point number two
whatever

426
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
whatever
 

427
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,269
whatever
you internalize

428
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:26,279
you internalize
 

429
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,750
you internalize
you take into the kazushi pattern

430
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
you take into the kazushi pattern
 

431
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,670
you take into the kazushi pattern
okay so there's two kazushi patterns

432
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
okay so there's two kazushi patterns
 

433
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,310
okay so there's two kazushi patterns
with eight manifestations

434
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:37,320
with eight manifestations
 

435
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,329
with eight manifestations
so we'll just deal with the two

436
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:41,339
so we'll just deal with the two
 

437
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,870
so we'll just deal with the two
front inward

438

439
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,350

and back outward

440
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:48,360

 

441
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,509

Okay so

442
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:50,519
Okay so
 

443
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,610
Okay so
front inward

444
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:52,620
front inward
 

445
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,290
front inward
you're going to have give me a person

446
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:57,300

 

447
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,470

over here I'll tell you what to do

448
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
over here I'll tell you what to do
 

449
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,350
over here I'll tell you what to do
the front inward there's four energies

450
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
the front inward there's four energies
 

451
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,250
the front inward there's four energies
it's going to be in

452
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:07,260
it's going to be in
 

453
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,230
it's going to be in
and down

454
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:09,240
and down
 

455
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,790
and down
okay

456
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
okay
 

457
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,889
okay
so she's doing two energies in

458
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:15,899

 

459
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,590

and down and in okay

460
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:18,600
and down and in okay
 

461
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,829
and down and in okay
then the out the other one

462
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
then the out the other one
 

463
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,050
then the out the other one
is going to be up

464
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:24,060
is going to be up
 

465
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,670
is going to be up
up

466
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
up
 

467
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,110
up
and out okay so on the count of three

468
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,120
and out okay so on the count of three
 

469
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,269

00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:36,590
you'll go
down and in I'll go up and out one two

same thing

480
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:46,920

 

481
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,730

501
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,710

so if you look at the ikyo

502
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:15,720
so if you look at the ikyo
 

503
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,530
so if you look at the ikyo
he's doing the front inward

504
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:18,540
he's doing the front inward
 

505
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,949

the internal
 

549
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,129
the internal
with the external back outward position

550
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:34,139
with the external back outward position
 

551
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,050
with the external back outward position
the block

552
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,060
the block
 

553
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:41,150
the block
helps the throat okay let's try it

554
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,160
helps the throat okay let's try it
 

555
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,790
helps the throat okay let's try it
so let's go back a step

556
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:43,800
so let's go back a step
 

557
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,090
so let's go back a step
and he had his block

558
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,100
and he had his block
 

559
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,629
and he had his block
so here I don't have the kazushi pattern

560
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
so here I don't have the kazushi pattern
 

561
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,949
so here I don't have the kazushi pattern
do you see that I just have the internal

562
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
do you see that I just have the internal
 

563
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,269
do you see that I just have the internal
it'll work

564
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:56,279
it'll work
 

565
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,310
it'll work
it'll work

566
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
it'll work
 

567
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,749
it'll work
it'll work

568
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
it'll work
 

569
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,030
it'll work
but it works better

570
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,040
but it works better
 

571
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,030
but it works better
if I start the pattern because he's

572
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,040
if I start the pattern because he's
 

573
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,329
if I start the pattern because he's
behind it do you see that he's behind

574
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:08,339
behind it do you see that he's behind
 

575
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,329
behind it do you see that he's behind
the the resistance angle so then it

576
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:11,339
the the resistance angle so then it
 

577
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,850
the the resistance angle so then it
works better

578
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:13,860
works better
 

579
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,309
works better
do you guys understand that so you can't

580
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319
do you guys understand that so you can't
 

581
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,490
do you guys understand that so you can't
do it internally he blocks

582
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:19,500
do it internally he blocks
 

583
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,689
do it internally he blocks
but you combine the two and this works

584
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:23,699
but you combine the two and this works
 

585
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,350
but you combine the two and this works
better okay because he loses mechanical

586
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360
better okay because he loses mechanical
 

587
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,350
better okay because he loses mechanical
advantage due to the external kazushi

588
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:30,360
advantage due to the external kazushi
 

589
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,690
advantage due to the external kazushi
pattern

590
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:32,700
pattern
 

591
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,610
pattern
same thing here

592
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:34,620
same thing here
 

593
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,890
same thing here
if I go here

594
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:36,900
if I go here
 

595
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,049
if I go here
out any blocks

596
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:39,059
out any blocks
 

597
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,230
out any blocks
I can do this internally

598
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
I can do this internally
 

599
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,310
I can do this internally
you see

600
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,320
you see
 

601
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,490
you see
he has a very strong block there you see

602
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:46,500
he has a very strong block there you see
 

603
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,010
he has a very strong block there you see
that but I can do it

604
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,020
that but I can do it
 

605
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,590
that but I can do it
internally

606
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
internally
 

607
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,890
internally
it'll work

608
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:54,900

 

609
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,470

but it's not Aikido

610
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:57,480
but it's not Aikido
 

611
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,810
but it's not Aikido
it said

612
00:17:59,810 --> 00:17:59,820
it said
 

613
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,630
it said
I'm going to add here here

614
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
I'm going to add here here
 

615
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,110
I'm going to add here here
is a part where he's touching me and I

616
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,120
is a part where he's touching me and I
 

617
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,289
is a part where he's touching me and I
make that

618
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:09,299

 

619
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,450

go back

620
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:11,460
go back
 

621
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,810
go back
so I haven't moved yet I haven't entered

622
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:14,820
so I haven't moved yet I haven't entered
 

623
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,669
so I haven't moved yet I haven't entered
yet

624
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:18,679

 

625
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:21,289

Gary's touching me

626
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:21,299
Gary's touching me
 

627
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:29,570
Gary's touching me
so I adhered there to hit Center

628
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:29,580

 

629
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,090

so at this point

630
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,100
so at this point
 

631
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,510
so at this point
my arm is not where he can block it

632
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
my arm is not where he can block it
 

633
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,970
my arm is not where he can block it
do you see my arm is over here

634
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:37,980
do you see my arm is over here
 

635
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,830
do you see my arm is over here
block my arm

636
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
block my arm
 

637
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,610
block my arm
say like just like the other one it

638
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:43,620
say like just like the other one it
 

639
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,310
say like just like the other one it
makes his Center go higher

640
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
makes his Center go higher
 

641
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,130
makes his Center go higher
and now makes him easier

642
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,140
and now makes him easier
 

643
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,090
and now makes him easier
to go backwards do you understand

644
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,100
to go backwards do you understand
 

645
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,049
to go backwards do you understand
so first you have to fix this part

646
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:57,059
so first you have to fix this part
 

647
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,250
so first you have to fix this part
two

648
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:58,260
two
 

649
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,270
two
he's going backwards before I enter

650
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:02,280
he's going backwards before I enter
 

651
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,250
he's going backwards before I enter
to make a block

652
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,260
to make a block
 

653
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,890
to make a block
he's not going backwards and I try to

654
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:06,900
he's not going backwards and I try to
 

655
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,570
he's not going backwards and I try to
enter young young

656
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:11,580

 

657
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,090

here

658
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:13,100
here
 

659
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,350
here
internalizes energy

660
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
internalizes energy
 

661
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,529
internalizes energy
and make it Yin

662
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:18,539
and make it Yin
 

663
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,510
and make it Yin
then I would enter there

664
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:20,520
then I would enter there
 

665
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,890
then I would enter there
do you understand

666
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:21,900
do you understand
 

667
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,590
do you understand
so next drill

668
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:24,600
so next drill
 

669
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,730
so next drill
who he let go

670
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:28,740
who he let go
 

671
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,510
who he let go
you'll get him going backwards now he

672
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:32,520
you'll get him going backwards now he
 

673
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,830
you'll get him going backwards now he
can't young my young he's going in okay

674
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
can't young my young he's going in okay
 

675
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,710
can't young my young he's going in okay
try Okay so the adhesion

676
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:39,720
try Okay so the adhesion
 

677
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,190
try Okay so the adhesion
is on here on this face

678
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200
is on here on this face
 

679
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,850
is on here on this face
on my inside of my arm not my elbow

680
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:46,860
on my inside of my arm not my elbow
 

681
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,190
on my inside of my arm not my elbow
underneath him not my elbow in front of

682
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
underneath him not my elbow in front of
 

683
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,289
underneath him not my elbow in front of
his face

684
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:51,299
his face
 

685
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,029
his face
on this side

686
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
on this side
 

687
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,570
on this side
this side

688
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:56,580

 

689
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,450

okay

690
00:19:59,450 --> 00:19:59,460

 

691
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,789

so here

692
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:01,799
so here
 

693
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,750
so here
let's say he pulls with two hands now

694
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:04,760
let's say he pulls with two hands now
 

695
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,850
let's say he pulls with two hands now
it's just gonna make it worse because I

696
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:07,860
it's just gonna make it worse because I
 

697
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,690
it's just gonna make it worse because I
if the hand's not important

698
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:11,700

 

699
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,690

his Center will go higher because he has

700
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:14,700
his Center will go higher because he has
 

701
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,110
his Center will go higher because he has
more mass at the top

702
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,120

 

703
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,390

so I come around he grabs two hands

704
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
so I come around he grabs two hands
 

705
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,270
so I come around he grabs two hands
doesn't matter

706
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,280
doesn't matter
 

707
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,850
doesn't matter
he could do it later

708
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:25,860
he could do it later
 

709
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,230
he could do it later
so he'll grab there do you see don't put

710
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240
so he'll grab there do you see don't put
 

711
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,630
so he'll grab there do you see don't put
your arm out there that's Yang Yang

712
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
your arm out there that's Yang Yang
 

713
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,270
your arm out there that's Yang Yang
okay he grabs there it doesn't matter

714
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
okay he grabs there it doesn't matter
 

715
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,850
okay he grabs there it doesn't matter
so you try to grab a little later

716
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:40,860

 

717
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,990

just makes the fall easier okay so now

718
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,000
just makes the fall easier okay so now
 

719
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,350
just makes the fall easier okay so now
okay we'll try that but don't let your

720
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,360
okay we'll try that but don't let your
 

721
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,230
okay we'll try that but don't let your
mind go to his second hand keep the

722
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:51,240
mind go to his second hand keep the
 

723
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,990
mind go to his second hand keep the
feeling internalize his new touch Point

724
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000
feeling internalize his new touch Point
 

725
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,049
feeling internalize his new touch Point
okay let's try it the common mistakes

726
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:57,059
okay let's try it the common mistakes
 

727
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,510
okay let's try it the common mistakes
common mistakes

728
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
common mistakes
 

729
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,590
common mistakes
no

730
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:00,600
no
 

731
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,990
no
you go like this

732
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:03,000
you go like this
 

733
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,830
you go like this
here

734
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:06,840

 

735
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,930

so feel feel the adhesion on you got it

736
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:11,940
so feel feel the adhesion on you got it
 

737
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,409
so feel feel the adhesion on you got it
okay watch how that is gonna get

738
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:15,419
okay watch how that is gonna get
 

739
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,750
okay watch how that is gonna get
increased

740
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760
increased
 

741
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,350
increased
you see that right so here I keep his

742
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
you see that right so here I keep his
 

743
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,430
you see that right so here I keep his
balance

744
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:22,440
balance
 

745
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,930
balance
over here

746
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:23,940
over here
 

747
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,690
over here
take his balance

748
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:26,700
take his balance
 

749
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,669
take his balance
so don't bend your arm

750
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:28,679
so don't bend your arm
 

751
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,770
so don't bend your arm
you're bending your arm because you're

752
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:30,780
you're bending your arm because you're
 

753
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,330
you're bending your arm because you're
doing an external manipulation

754
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:35,340

 

755
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,610

internal manipulation it goes this way

756
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:40,620

 

757
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,350

it's this way

758
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:42,360
it's this way
 

759
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,610
it's this way
not here

760
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:46,620

 

761
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:52,130

I want a lot of energy in the spiral

762
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:52,140
I want a lot of energy in the spiral
 

763
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,490
I want a lot of energy in the spiral
so this is less energy

764
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:55,500
so this is less energy
 

765
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,790
so this is less energy
big energy

766
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:56,800
big energy
 

767
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,210
big energy

this way down okay
 

771
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,090
this way down okay
so never here

772
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:08,100

 

773
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,430

you can see I'm pushing on him because

774
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:10,440
you can see I'm pushing on him because
 

775
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,490
you can see I'm pushing on him because
he never gets going backwards no your

776
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:13,500
he never gets going backwards no your
 

777
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,010
he never gets going backwards no your
hair you're pushy he's not going

778
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:16,020
hair you're pushy he's not going
 

779
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,930
hair you're pushy he's not going
backwards yet he has to go all the way

780
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:20,940

 

781
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,210

okay try it again don't bend your elbow

785
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,549

this shape goes this way

786
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:31,559
this shape goes this way
 

787
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,710
this shape goes this way
boom

788
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:33,720
boom
 

789

boom
boom not like this

792
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:37,860
boom not like this
 

793
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,710
boom not like this
okay try it again so internally I use

794
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
okay try it again so internally I use
 

795
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,510
okay try it again so internally I use
the adhesion here but also here

796
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
the adhesion here but also here
 

797
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,390
the adhesion here but also here
to take him into the pattern

798
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
to take him into the pattern
 

799
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,149
to take him into the pattern
you see the pattern

800
00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:53,159
you see the pattern
 

801
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,310
you see the pattern
and the pattern

802
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:55,320
and the pattern
 

803
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,830
and the pattern
now harmonizes

804
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:57,840
now harmonizes
 

805
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,930
now harmonizes
yin and yang

806
00:22:59,930 --> 00:22:59,940
yin and yang
 

807
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,169
yin and yang
got it because he's going that way

808
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:03,179
got it because he's going that way
 

809
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,810
got it because he's going that way
so he's gone that way when he pushes on

810
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:05,820
so he's gone that way when he pushes on
 

811
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,930
so he's gone that way when he pushes on
it he's just pushing himself away

812
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:08,940
it he's just pushing himself away
 

813
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,230
it he's just pushing himself away

817
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,810
hindering me okay so I go and he'll push
on me and he'll go back more that way

818
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:20,820
on me and he'll go back more that way
 

819
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,090
on me and he'll go back more that way
that's our next drill you gotta kind of

820
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:23,100
that's our next drill you gotta kind of
 

821
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,409
that's our next drill you gotta kind of
wait till the end okay so boom pop

822
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:27,419
wait till the end okay so boom pop
 

823
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:30,350
wait till the end okay so boom pop
okay he'll push him because he's going

824
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:30,360
okay he'll push him because he's going
 

825
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,570
okay he'll push him because he's going
that way and he'll push himself that way

826
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:32,580
that way and he'll push himself that way
 

827
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,669
that way and he'll push himself that way
okay try it

828
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:34,679
okay try it
 

829
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,130
okay try it
so now

830
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:37,140
so now
 

831
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,350
so now
if he touched me early I would

832
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,360
if he touched me early I would
 

833
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,810
if he touched me early I would
internalize it it would become part of

834
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:41,820
internalize it it would become part of
 

835
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,590
internalize it it would become part of
the kazushi if he touched me late it

836
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,600
the kazushi if he touched me late it
 

837
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,870
the kazushi if he touched me late it
will accelerate him into the pattern

838
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:47,880
will accelerate him into the pattern
 

839
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,529
will accelerate him into the pattern
more okay

840
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:51,539

 

841
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:55,010

next thing is a martial concept

842
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,020
next thing is a martial concept
 

843
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,370
next thing is a martial concept
do not ask everything

844
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:58,380
do not ask everything
 

845
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,610
do not ask everything
of a single tactic

846
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:01,620
of a single tactic
 

847
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,430
of a single tactic
your tactics build on each other you

848
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:04,440
your tactics build on each other you
 

849
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,390
your tactics build on each other you
have redundancy in your tactics okay so

850
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,400
have redundancy in your tactics okay so
 

851
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,029
have redundancy in your tactics okay so
my only goal

852
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:11,039
my only goal
 

853
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,890
my only goal
here

854

is that right there
 

857
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,909
is that right there
that's it that's all I want out of the

858
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:19,919
that's it that's all I want out of the
 

859
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:20,750
that's it that's all I want out of the
arm

arm
 

861
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,789
arm
this tilt

862
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799
this tilt
 

863
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,789
this tilt
and energy going that way that's all I

864
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:25,799
and energy going that way that's all I
 

865
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:30,350
and energy going that way that's all I
want I don't want that part

866
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,360
want I don't want that part
 

867
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,590
want I don't want that part
that's not cook you whole

868
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
that's not cook you whole
 

869
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,549
that's not cook you whole
so I go I'll do it slow

I would get we'll do
whoa tilt give him some balance then

934
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:13,320
whoa tilt give him some balance then
 

935
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,010
whoa tilt give him some balance then
you'll just move move

936
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:16,020
you'll just move move
 

937
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,750
you'll just move move
in turning

938
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:20,760

 

939
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,029

projective

940
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
projective
 

941
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,730
projective
and then

942
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:25,740
and then
 

943
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,610
and then
turn and projects

944
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:28,620
turn and projects
 

945
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,330
turn and projects
okay try it yeah okay so now you put

946
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:32,340
okay try it yeah okay so now you put
 

947
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,090
okay try it yeah okay so now you put
down after you project

948
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:35,100
down after you project
 

949
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,970
down after you project
the head will get light again and it'll

950
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:37,980
the head will get light again and it'll
 

951
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,730
the head will get light again and it'll
start to fall so you stay up with the

952
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:40,740
start to fall so you stay up with the
 

953
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,549
start to fall so you stay up with the
head but I'm not shoving the head

954
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:43,559
head but I'm not shoving the head
 

955
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,890
head but I'm not shoving the head
he's already he was already going that

956
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:45,900
he's already he was already going that
 

957
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,669
he's already he was already going that
way

958
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:46,679
way
 

959
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:48,950
way
and then he's gonna already be falling

960
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960
and then he's gonna already be falling
 

961
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,010
and then he's gonna already be falling
when I do the bottom part and then I

962
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:52,020
when I do the bottom part and then I
 

963
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,769
when I do the bottom part and then I
just stay up with the head okay

964
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:54,779
just stay up with the head okay
 

965
00:26:54,779 --> 00:27:03,529
just stay up with the head okay
so you're putting it all together

966
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:03,539

 

967
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,710

and he can block now

968
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
and he can block now
 

969
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,070
and he can block now
okay but my advice

970
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,080
okay but my advice
 

971
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,990
okay but my advice
don't block

972
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
don't block
 

973
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,850
don't block
because your Center is going to be

974
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:13,860
because your Center is going to be
 

975
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,350
because your Center is going to be
really high

976
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:15,360
really high
 

977
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,470
really high
okay but you think you could try a block

978
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
okay but you think you could try a block
 

979
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,890
okay but you think you could try a block
okay so we'll try a block and you'll see

980
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:21,900
okay so we'll try a block and you'll see
 

981
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,130
okay so we'll try a block and you'll see
it won't do anything to me but it'll

982
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:25,140
it won't do anything to me but it'll
 

983
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:35,810
it won't do anything to me but it'll
make his it came worse okay

984
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:35,820

 

985
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,289

internal external utilization but I

986
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:39,299
internal external utilization but I
 

987
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,630
internal external utilization but I
don't that would be bad I would I would

988
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:41,640
don't that would be bad I would I would

emphasizing that now
because

1004
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:02,220
