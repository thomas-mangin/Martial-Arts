00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:11,159
here on by the fingers you see because
 

65
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,270
here on by the fingers you see because
the fulum is right here it's right here

the fulum is right here it's right here
 

67
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,030
the fulum is right here it's right here
underneath the Palm heel so I am about

68
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,040
underneath the Palm heel so I am about

to slide off so you don't you don't want

70
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
to slide off so you don't you don't want
 

71
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,469
to slide off so you don't you don't want
to get here like that and do like that

72
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:23,479
to get here like that and do like that
 

73
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,990
to get here like that and do like that
because your palm heals what's pushing

74
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
because your palm heals what's pushing
 

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,749
because your palm heals what's pushing
it and that fulcrum's about here okay

76
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
it and that fulcrum's about here okay
 

77
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,070
it and that fulcrum's about here okay
okay so if you take the

78
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,080
okay so if you take the
 

79
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,430
okay so if you take the
metacarpal and you know you have the

80
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
metacarpal and you know you have the
 

81
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,310
metacarpal and you know you have the
wrist

82
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
wrist
 

83
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,710
wrist
joint and I want the maximum

84
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
joint and I want the maximum
 

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,310
joint and I want the maximum
leverage so I want to use as much of the

86
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:43,320
leverage so I want to use as much of the
 

87
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,550
leverage so I want to use as much of the
metacarpal as

88
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:45,560
metacarpal as
 

89
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,830
metacarpal as
possible obviously this would be the

90
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
possible obviously this would be the
 

91
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,469
possible obviously this would be the
most right putting my palm heel pressure

92
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:51,479
most right putting my palm heel pressure
 

93
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,310
most right putting my palm heel pressure
right here that's the longest the

94
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:53,320
right here that's the longest the
 

95
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,790
right here that's the longest the
metacarpal is do you guys see that but

96
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
metacarpal is do you guys see that but
 

97
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,390
metacarpal is do you guys see that but
you're that much closer to slipping off

98
00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,400
you're that much closer to slipping off
 

99
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,749
you're that much closer to slipping off
you you understand you're you too much

100
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
you you understand you're you too much
 

101
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,390
you you understand you're you too much
your margin for error is too small so

102
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
your margin for error is too small so
 

103
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,909
your margin for error is too small so
when you come up here and you match the

104
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
when you come up here and you match the
 

105
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,350
when you come up here and you match the
fingers I'm right by the edge don't

106
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
fingers I'm right by the edge don't
 

107
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,230
fingers I'm right by the edge don't
match the fingers feel

108
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
match the fingers feel
 

109
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,150
match the fingers feel
instead where is a good solid base on

110
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
instead where is a good solid base on
 

111
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,710
instead where is a good solid base on
the metacarpal with that heel palm and

112
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
the metacarpal with that heel palm and
 

113
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,710
the metacarpal with that heel palm and
that's what I keep making go around okay

114
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
that's what I keep making go around okay
 

115
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,950
that's what I keep making go around okay
don't don't look to match the fingers

116
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
don't don't look to match the fingers
 

117
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,909
don't don't look to match the fingers
and slide up the fingers like that try

118
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:26,919
and slide up the fingers like that try
 

119
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,189
and slide up the fingers like that try
to

120
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:28,199
to
 

121
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,909
to
again just like if I if I'm doing

122
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:30,919
again just like if I if I'm doing
 

123
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:34,309
again just like if I if I'm doing
regular put guys I'm in that joint and

124
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:34,319
regular put guys I'm in that joint and
 

125
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,870
regular put guys I'm in that joint and
that elbow so this the second the

126
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
that elbow so this the second the
 

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,110
that elbow so this the second the
technique starts to come back I lock

128
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
technique starts to come back I lock
 

129
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,909
technique starts to come back I lock
that joint and I move his Center in

130
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:46,919
that joint and I move his Center in
 

131
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,830
that joint and I move his Center in
other words I'm not moving his arm

132
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
other words I'm not moving his arm
 

133
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,870
other words I'm not moving his arm
that's not what I'm doing okay so

134
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:51,880
that's not what I'm doing okay so
