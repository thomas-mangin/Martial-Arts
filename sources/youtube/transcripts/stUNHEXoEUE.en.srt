00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,309

notice that the uh weapon has this curve

2
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:05,319
notice that the uh weapon has this curve
 

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:07,350
notice that the uh weapon has this curve
you

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:07,360
you
 

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,789
you
see that's that's an energy line so as I

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:11,799
see that's that's an energy line so as I
 

7
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:13,829
see that's that's an energy line so as I
come around I don't want to lose contact

8
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:13,839
come around I don't want to lose contact
 

9
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,269
come around I don't want to lose contact
I'm going to keep contact come around

10
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:16,279
I'm going to keep contact come around
 

11
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:20,710
I'm going to keep contact come around
and I will be able when I hit the the

12
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,720
and I will be able when I hit the the
 

13
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,710
and I will be able when I hit the the
convex Apex of that curve that's where

14
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:23,720
convex Apex of that curve that's where
 

15
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,029
convex Apex of that curve that's where
I'm going to put my Apex of my curve and

16
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:28,039
I'm going to put my Apex of my curve and
 

17
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,190
I'm going to put my Apex of my curve and
that'll do the displacing for me

18
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:32,200

 

19
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,150

okay so

20
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
okay so
 

21
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,549
okay so
around and I can be pretty straight but

22
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:37,559
around and I can be pretty straight but
 

23
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,029

his boken is being

00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:41,039

 

25
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,069

displaced if you do it all early you see

26
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
displaced if you do it all early you see
 

27
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,950
displaced if you do it all early you see
it's in the way and I got to move it and

28
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:45,960
it's in the way and I got to move it and
 

29
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,430
it's in the way and I got to move it and
I got to take this angle over here so I

30
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:48,440
I got to take this angle over here so I
 

31
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,229
I got to take this angle over here so I
would like for you to feel just the the

32
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:51,239
would like for you to feel just the the
 

33
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,750
would like for you to feel just the the
energy of his of the curvature you

34
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:54,760
energy of his of the curvature you
 

35
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,470
energy of his of the curvature you
you'll feel the yin and that's where you

36
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
you'll feel the yin and that's where you
 

37
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,229
you'll feel the yin and that's where you
feel the you change to Y so you'll feel

38
00:00:59,229 --> 00:00:59,239
feel the you change to Y so you'll feel
 

39
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:04,910

it'll displace on its own without you

42
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:06,920
it'll displace on its own without you
 

43
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,789
it'll displace on its own without you
having to do anything drastic with your

having to do anything drastic with your
 

45
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,230
having to do anything drastic with your
hands okay try it

46
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:11,240

okay let's go so one thing you got to
 

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,270
okay let's go so one thing you got to
pay attention to is as he's coming in

74
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:26,280
pay attention to is as he's coming in

that shouldn't happen we're now

that shouldn't happen we're now
 

77
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,110
that shouldn't happen we're now
mismatched okay that there's no there's

78
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
mismatched okay that there's no there's
 

79
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,750
mismatched okay that there's no there's
no energy for me to get back on the Yang

80
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:34,760
no energy for me to get back on the Yang
 

81
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,949
no energy for me to get back on the Yang
side of this so he's going to do Yang

82
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
side of this so he's going to do Yang
 

83
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,470
side of this so he's going to do Yang
here he's going to just Place me it's

84
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
here he's going to just Place me it's
 

85
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,270
here he's going to just Place me it's
going to take a lot of muscle for me to

86
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:40,280
going to take a lot of muscle for me to
 

87
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,869
going to take a lot of muscle for me to
do that so as a metric you can use the

88
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:43,879
do that so as a metric you can use the
 

89
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,149
do that so as a metric you can use the
fact that he's coming around go sorry

90
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:47,159
fact that he's coming around go sorry
 

91
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,270
fact that he's coming around go sorry
he's coming around that our swords stay

92
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,280
he's coming around that our swords stay
 

93
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,309
he's coming around that our swords stay
even you see for most of it until I

even you see for most of it until I
 

95
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,869
even you see for most of it until I
decide to let him go by and that's when

96
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
decide to let him go by and that's when
 

97
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,430
decide to let him go by and that's when
I'm coming in okay don't let him

98
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:00,440
I'm coming in okay don't let him
 

99
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,949
I'm coming in okay don't let him
close the gap too

100

101
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,869

I'm coming around boom there he goes
he's coming back in I'm going to clear

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,110
okay so I'm going to do an an i adhesion
right so I'm going to get that pressure

148
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
right so I'm going to get that pressure
 

149
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,990
right so I'm going to get that pressure
there and then I'm going to be able to

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,000
there and then I'm going to be able to

move it got it
