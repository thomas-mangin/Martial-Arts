feel that right yeah there's one time
 

203
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,990
feel that right yeah there's one time
there was a failure too right this is

204
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
there was a failure too right this is
 

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,869
there was a failure too right this is
not enough strength

206
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
not enough strength
 

207
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,270
not enough strength
um

208
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
um
 

209
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,309

211
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,029
yin must proceed young
okay

212
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039

 

213
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,830

tencon and edemi are intimately

tencon and edemi are intimately
 

215
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,110
tencon and edemi are intimately
related okay

216
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
related okay
 

217
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,350

tangon doesn't mean when you do that one

218
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
tangon doesn't mean when you do that one
 

219

tangon doesn't mean when you do that one
foot maneuver where you make a circle

220
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
foot maneuver where you make a circle
 

221
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,709
foot maneuver where you make a circle
around yourself that's not what it means

222
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
around yourself that's not what it means
 

223
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,149
around yourself that's not what it means
that's eight type of tencon

224
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
that's eight type of tencon
 

225
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,909
that's eight type of tencon
to make that point we have another one

226
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
to make that point we have another one
 

227
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,230
to make that point we have another one
called we call it a shield tank in our

228
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
called we call it a shield tank in our
 

229
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,630
called we call it a shield tank in our
millions right this is a different tempo

230
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
millions right this is a different tempo
 

231
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,030
millions right this is a different tempo
there's lots of different templates

232
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040

 

233
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,750

so

234
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
so
 

235
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,790
so
yes he's coming in and yes i have to

236
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
yes he's coming in and yes i have to
 

237
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,190
yes he's coming in and yes i have to
send him into the

238
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
send him into the
 

239
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,470
send him into the
front

240
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
front
 

241
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,870
front
inward position true

242
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
inward position true
 

243
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,870
inward position true
okay

244
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880

 

245
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,190

but i could do that here

246
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200

 

247
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,269

and that would not be equal

248
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
and that would not be equal
 

249
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,030
and that would not be equal
it would do

250
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
it would do
 

251
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,670
it would do
front inward position but not equal okay

252
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
front inward position but not equal okay
 

253
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,750
front inward position but not equal okay
so ichio is going to have

254
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
so ichio is going to have
 

255
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,509
so ichio is going to have
this kind of shape to it

256
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519

 

257
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,590

you can think of it as

258
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600
you can think of it as
 

259
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,750
you can think of it as
somebody's coming in

260
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
somebody's coming in
 

261
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,590
somebody's coming in
yield and flank

00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
yield and flank
 

263
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,110
yield and flank
yield and flank okay

264
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120

 

265
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,030

if you just think of it as that it

266
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
if you just think of it as that it
 

267
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,630
if you just think of it as that it
it works on

268
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
it works on
 

269
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,190
it works on
almost any form of aggression yield in

270
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
almost any form of aggression yield in
 

271
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,350
almost any form of aggression yield in
flank yield then flying

272
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
flank yield then flying
 

273
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,710
flank yield then flying
okay yield and fine all the time

274
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
okay yield and fine all the time
 

275
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,310
okay yield and fine all the time
even if you had multiple forces

276
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
even if you had multiple forces
 

277
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,389
even if you had multiple forces
you had standing armies

278
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
you had standing armies
 

279
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,190
you had standing armies
and you yield to pull them into the

280
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
and you yield to pull them into the
 

281
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,750
and you yield to pull them into the
ambush and a flanking

282
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
ambush and a flanking
 

283
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,710

detail would kill them off
 

285
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,710
detail would kill them off
it's been used throughout history okay

286
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
it's been used throughout history okay
 

287
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,110
it's been used throughout history okay
you could even use it in business yield

288
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
you could even use it in business yield
 

289
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,470
you could even use it in business yield
and flank

290
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
and flank
 

291
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,069
and flank
yield and flag hey you're getting what

292
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
yield and flag hey you're getting what
 

293
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,550
yield and flag hey you're getting what
you're not no you're not

okay
so

298
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
so
 

299
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,430
so
let me attach the yield and flank

300
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
let me attach the yield and flank
 

301
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,870
let me attach the yield and flank

okay
 

307
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,710
okay
so instead of over here

308
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
so instead of over here
 

309
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,710
so instead of over here
and doing this

310
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
and doing this
 

311
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,710
and doing this
i'll do it in a way

312
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
i'll do it in a way
 

313
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,870
i'll do it in a way
that they feed each other

314
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:34,880
that they feed each other
 

315
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,750
that they feed each other
see

316
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
see
 

317
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,110
see
okay

318
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
okay
 

319
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,190
okay
what exactly does that mean well here i

320
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
what exactly does that mean well here i
 

321
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,790
what exactly does that mean well here i
will yield the flank

322
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
will yield the flank
 

323
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,990
will yield the flank
right but what can you tell

324
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
right but what can you tell
 

325
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,710
right but what can you tell
what can you feel that's freaking heavy

326
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
what can you feel that's freaking heavy
 

327
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,150
what can you feel that's freaking heavy
do you see that

328
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
do you see that
 

329
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,790
do you see that
so it it's going to help me determine

330
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
so it it's going to help me determine
 

331
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,110
so it it's going to help me determine
how far do you yield

332
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
how far do you yield
 

333
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,550
how far do you yield
got it how far do you heal

334
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
got it how far do you heal
 

335
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,590
got it how far do you heal
well

336
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
well
 

337
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,069
well

what you want to do
 

347
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,269
what you want to do
is to reconcile

348
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
is to reconcile
 

349
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,030
is to reconcile
that resistance point

350
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
that resistance point
 

351
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,630
that resistance point
you can do it all let's say i have no

352
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
you can do it all let's say i have no
 

353
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,069
you can do it all let's say i have no

i'll take it
 

357
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,150
i'll take it
but you'll just feel when that when that

358
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
but you'll just feel when that when that
 

359
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,790
but you'll just feel when that when that
pressure goes off okay

360
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
pressure goes off okay
 

361
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,870
pressure goes off okay
do you feel it decreasing you see can

362
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
do you feel it decreasing you see can
 

363
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,949
do you feel it decreasing you see can
you see it's decreasing as i move this

364
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:26,959

899
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,430

right and here is you i have reconciled

900
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,440
right and here is you i have reconciled
 

901
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,430
right and here is you i have reconciled
that energy

902
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,440
that energy
 

903
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,110
that energy
okay right

904
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,120
okay right
 

905
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,510
okay right
pretty light yes okay

906
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:51,520
pretty light yes okay
 

907
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,549
pretty light yes okay
but

908
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
but
 

909
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,909
but
if you take a new vector just stand up

910
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:55,919
if you take a new vector just stand up
 

911
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,669
if you take a new vector just stand up
and come over here

912
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:57,679
and come over here
 

913
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,269
and come over here
i really appreciate

914
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
i really appreciate
 

915
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,110
i really appreciate
i'm not following that

916
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,120
i'm not following that
 

917
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,230
i'm not following that
okay

918
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,240
okay
 

919
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,590
okay
it's not an external field

920
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:05,600
it's not an external field
 

921
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,950
it's not an external field
from a gui center

922
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:08,960

 

923
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,470

if you

924
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:10,480
if you
 

925
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,070
if you
i reconcile

926
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,080
i reconcile
 

927
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,950
i reconcile
okay

928
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960
okay
 

929
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,190
okay
and you come over here

930
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,200
and you come over here
 

931
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,830
and you come over here
and you push just change it you can

932
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:17,840
and you push just change it you can
 

933
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:30,780
and you push just change it you can
change

934
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:30,790

 

935
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:49,830

[Music]

936
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:49,840

 

937
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:59,280

is

938
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,290

 

939
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:03,430

940
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,440

 

941
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:13,510

so when i heal it's not out of weakness

942
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,520

 

943
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,470

so anywhere in the technique

944
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,480
so anywhere in the technique
 

945
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,870
so anywhere in the technique
right let's say

946
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:18,880
right let's say
 

947
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,430
right let's say
you feel the yield there okay so i got

948
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,440
you feel the yield there okay so i got
 

949
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,070
you feel the yield there okay so i got
there and the same thing

950
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,080
there and the same thing
 

951
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,669
there and the same thing
you push

952
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:25,679
you push
 

953
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,029
you push
it's not weak

954
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
it's not weak
 

955
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,990
it's not weak
it's ground you see yes

956
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,000
it's ground you see yes
 

957
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,389
it's ground you see yes
and i yield

958
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:34,399

 

959
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,990

okay

960
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,000
okay
 

961
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,149
okay
don't confuse that's the problem when

962
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:38,159
don't confuse that's the problem when
 

963
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,870
don't confuse that's the problem when
everything is external with no internal

964
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:40,880
everything is external with no internal
 

965
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,870
everything is external with no internal
it's weak

966
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
it's weak
 

967
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,470
it's weak
okay it might be a training step

968
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,480
okay it might be a training step
 

969
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,950
okay it might be a training step
but it's not practical and it's not the

970
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:48,960
but it's not practical and it's not the
 

971
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,549
but it's not practical and it's not the
heart okay get your ground vector

972
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:52,559
heart okay get your ground vector
 

973
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,510
heart okay get your ground vector
yield

974
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:53,520
yield
 

975
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,350
yield
yielding is not

976
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,360
yielding is not
 

977
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,110
yielding is not
think of yielding as tactical

978
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
think of yielding as tactical
 

979
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,950
think of yielding as tactical
repositioning

980
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960
repositioning
 

981
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:07,830
repositioning
it's not retreating

982
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:07,840

 

983
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,830

externally

984
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:09,840
externally
 

985
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,110
externally
i can stay here and let that energy pass

986
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,120
i can stay here and let that energy pass
 

987
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,269
i can stay here and let that energy pass
through me so he's pushed he's pushing

988
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:15,279
through me so he's pushed he's pushing
 

989
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,789
through me so he's pushed he's pushing
on but

990
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:16,799
on but
 

991
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,870
on but
you just let it pass through and bounce

992
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:18,880
you just let it pass through and bounce
 

993
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,750
you just let it pass through and bounce
it off the ground okay by releasing all

994
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:21,760
it off the ground okay by releasing all
 

995
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,750
it off the ground okay by releasing all
right

996
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:23,760
right
 

997
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,549
right
so

998
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:24,559
so
 

999
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,549
so
same thing here

1000
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559
same thing here
 

1001
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,669
same thing here
he's driving and you don't realize that

1002
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:29,679
he's driving and you don't realize that
 

1003
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,510
he's driving and you don't realize that
he's pounding he's making you feel

1004
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:31,520
he's pounding he's making you feel
 

1005
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,630
he's pounding he's making you feel
threatened

1006
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:32,640
threatened
 

1007
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,029
threatened
and you're pushing into him

1008
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:35,039
and you're pushing into him
 

1009
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,190
and you're pushing into him
and as a result

1010
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,200
and as a result
 

1011
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,430
and as a result
you're generating friction between the

1012
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440
you're generating friction between the
 

1013
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,590
you're generating friction between the
two surfaces you see

1014
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:41,600
two surfaces you see
 

1015
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,269
two surfaces you see
so

1016
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:43,279
so
 

1017
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,470
so
even though

1018
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:44,480
even though
 

1019
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,389
even though
you're kind of moving

1020
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:46,399
you're kind of moving
 

1021
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,269
you're kind of moving
as you get scared or you start to desire

1022
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:49,279
as you get scared or you start to desire
 

1023
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,389
as you get scared or you start to desire
the throw

1024
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:50,399
the throw
 

1025
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,190
the throw
you're pushing in but he's he can drive

1026
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,200
you're pushing in but he's he can drive
 

1027
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,630
you're pushing in but he's he can drive
let's just exaggerate his drive you see

1028
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,640
let's just exaggerate his drive you see
 

1029
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,909
let's just exaggerate his drive you see
and uh i'll just start releasing

1030
00:28:59,909 --> 00:28:59,919
and uh i'll just start releasing
 

1031
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,710
and uh i'll just start releasing
without any of the deviation do you see

1032
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:02,720
without any of the deviation do you see
 

1033
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,110
without any of the deviation do you see
that and so

1034
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,120
that and so
 

1035
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,110
that and so
first so you can see it on this side

1036
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,120
first so you can see it on this side
 

1037
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,990
first so you can see it on this side
okay

1038
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,000
okay
 

1039
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,549
okay
so again subconsciously there's all this

1040
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:10,559
so again subconsciously there's all this
 

1041
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,389
so again subconsciously there's all this
stuff and you're just creating more

1042
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
stuff and you're just creating more
 

1043
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,110
stuff and you're just creating more
friction but if you if you release you

1044
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,120
friction but if you if you release you
 

1045
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,669
friction but if you if you release you
just release release release

1046
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:17,679
just release release release
 

1047
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,750
just release release release
you get slippery because you don't

1048
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:19,760
you get slippery because you don't
 

1049
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,350
you get slippery because you don't
because relative to what i just

1050
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,360
because relative to what i just
 

1051
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,110
because relative to what i just
demonstrated you're not pressing the two

1052
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,120
demonstrated you're not pressing the two
 

1053
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,549
demonstrated you're not pressing the two
surfaces together okay so if we're doing

1054
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:26,559
surfaces together okay so if we're doing
 

1055
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,190
surfaces together okay so if we're doing
the movement it doesn't take a big thing

1056
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,200
the movement it doesn't take a big thing
 

1057
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,710
the movement it doesn't take a big thing
got released it's done

1058
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:32,720

 

1059
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,750

got it so maybe it's a guy uh coming in

1060
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:35,760
got it so maybe it's a guy uh coming in
 

1061
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,950
got it so maybe it's a guy uh coming in
to grab and punch

1062
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:38,960

 

1063
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,950

and you're in do you see because i don't

1064
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
and you're in do you see because i don't
 

1065
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,789
and you're in do you see because i don't
have all that time i just released right

1066
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:42,799
have all that time i just released right
 

1067
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,470
have all that time i just released right
away and i'm

1068
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:44,480
away and i'm
 

1069
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,789
away and i'm
i am responding but it looks more like i

1070
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:46,799
i am responding but it looks more like i
 

1071
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,510
i am responding but it looks more like i

so as you go to release

1074
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
so as you go to release
 

1075
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,789
so as you go to release
remember the internal aspects and not

1076
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
remember the internal aspects and not
 

1077
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,510
remember the internal aspects and not
just the external aspect because

1078
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:57,520
just the external aspect because
 

1079
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,149
just the external aspect because
again that's not the art because it's

1080
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:00,159
again that's not the art because it's
 

1081
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,430
again that's not the art because it's
not practical

1082
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:01,440
not practical
 

1083
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,230
not practical
okay let's try to try the other way okay

1084
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,240
okay let's try to try the other way okay
 

1085
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,070
okay let's try to try the other way okay
so this time we're on the homologous

1086
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080
so this time we're on the homologous
 

1087
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,029
so this time we're on the homologous
side right

1088
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:09,039

 

1089
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,470

because it's going to emphasize more of

1090
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:10,480
because it's going to emphasize more of
 

1091
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,710
because it's going to emphasize more of
the binding okay

1092
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:12,720
the binding okay
 

1093
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,789
the binding okay
so i i'm going to release release

1094
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:14,799
so i i'm going to release release
 

1095
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,909
so i i'm going to release release
release

1096
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:15,919
release
 

1097
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,870
release
and my external is going to be a turn

1098
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:18,880
and my external is going to be a turn
 

1099
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,350
and my external is going to be a turn
and if need be i'll take this step

1100
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,360
and if need be i'll take this step
 

1101
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,630
and if need be i'll take this step
but

1102
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:24,640
but
 

1103
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,950
but
i'm releasing releasing releasing this

1104
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:26,960
i'm releasing releasing releasing this
 

1105
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,310
i'm releasing releasing releasing this
is enough

1106
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:28,320
is enough
 

1107
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,230
is enough
okay

1108
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:30,240
okay
 

1109
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,549
okay
just that slightly okay

1110
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:32,559
just that slightly okay
 

1111
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,850
just that slightly okay
so i'll do the slight turn

1112
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:35,860
so i'll do the slight turn
 

1113
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:41,750
so i'll do the slight turn

keyhole he has spinal displacement so if
i'm not grounding when he comes in he's

i'm not grounding when he comes in he's
 

1135
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,750
i'm not grounding when he comes in he's

was still too great to send in another

was when we start taking them out of the

was when we start taking them out of the
 

1163
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,149
was when we start taking them out of the
front inward kazushi and we start going

00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
you see that
 

1169
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,870
you see that
usually people that do that version is

1170
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:58,880
usually people that do that version is
 

1171
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,190
usually people that do that version is
now they set up

1172
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,200
now they set up
 

1173
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,350
now they set up
the front inward kazushi from the guy

1174

the front inward kazushi from the guy
 

1175
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,149

who went down okay they don't let go

1182
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:11,600
and he gets up and then you go with him
 

1183
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,950

to me kihon is to not do what-ifs it's
 

1191
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,549
to me kihon is to not do what-ifs it's
fine to do what ifs but they're not kill

1192
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:24,559
fine to do what ifs but they're not kill
 

1193

00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,640
i would say that that would have you
 

1207
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,630
i would say that that would have you
fall out of e kill

00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:49,840
this with my yield you see and then my
 

1219
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,430

1223
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,509
but i'm over here
i've fallen out of the technique

1224
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:55,519
i've fallen out of the technique
 

1225
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,710
i've fallen out of the technique
okay

1226
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:56,720
okay
 

1227
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,389
okay
instead as he's going i'm still

you see that i'm not gonna go he's stuck
he's stuck because i'm pushing on it

okay let's try so uh
same thing yield and flank will not move

1260
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760
same thing yield and flank will not move
 

1261
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,389
same thing yield and flank will not move
from these abstract vectors and he's got

1262
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:40,399
from these abstract vectors and he's got
 

1263
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,990
from these abstract vectors and he's got
like a jab cross combination

1264
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,000
like a jab cross combination
 

1265
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,549
like a jab cross combination
and it'll be the same thing boom boom i
