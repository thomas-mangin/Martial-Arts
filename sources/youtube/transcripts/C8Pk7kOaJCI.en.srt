okay so uh when i attack that arm that
 

105
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,229
okay so uh when i attack that arm that
arm is straight

106
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
arm is straight
 

107
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,309
arm is straight
you see i have to picture

108
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
you see i have to picture
 

109
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,309
you see i have to picture
the kimura that i'm going to have at the

it's not a straight arm so if i come

114
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
it's not a straight arm so if i come
 

115
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,350
it's not a straight arm so if i come
here

116
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
here
 

117
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,309
here
and i go straight you're picturing

118
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
and i go straight you're picturing
 

119
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,830

it's on boom
 

345
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,509
it's on boom
next point if i do that his elbow

346
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
next point if i do that his elbow
 

347
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,630
next point if i do that his elbow
is ahead on the pistol

348
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
is ahead on the pistol
 

349
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,550
is ahead on the pistol
okay so this elbow goes to the final

350
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
okay so this elbow goes to the final
 

351
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,110
okay so this elbow goes to the final
spot

352
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
spot
 

353
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,470
spot
of the kimura or the nico pin

354
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
of the kimura or the nico pin
 

355
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,870
of the kimura or the nico pin
which is on the front side of my spine

356
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
which is on the front side of my spine
 

357
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,509
which is on the front side of my spine
so i go

358
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
so i go
 

359
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,790
so i go
one it's already there don't have it

360
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
one it's already there don't have it
 

361
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,389
one it's already there don't have it
over here

362
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
over here
 

363
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,710
over here
put it there then you start turning

364
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
put it there then you start turning
 

365
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,670
put it there then you start turning
around it and you see it's in position

366
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
around it and you see it's in position
 

367
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,670
around it and you see it's in position
so it's not over here

368
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680

 

369
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,670

so that's your marker one

370
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680

 

371
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,430

body put it on the front side of your

372
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
body put it on the front side of your
 

373
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,710
body put it on the front side of your
spine

374
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
spine
 

375
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:40,630
spine
then start going around the arm

376
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640

 

377
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,430

okay let's try it what were you tall at

378
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
okay let's try it what were you tall at
 

379
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,230
okay let's try it what were you tall at
the beginning

380
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
the beginning
 

381
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,069
the beginning
kind of feel free to walk around

382
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
kind of feel free to walk around
 

383
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,790
kind of feel free to walk around
because the pattern is not intuitive

384
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
because the pattern is not intuitive
 

385
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,710
because the pattern is not intuitive
over the decades of teaching

386
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
over the decades of teaching
 

387
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,710
over the decades of teaching
i've just seen so many students try to

388
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
i've just seen so many students try to
 

389
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,069
i've just seen so many students try to
paint the ending

390
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
paint the ending
 

391
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,190
paint the ending
try to do the obvious okay move the arm

392
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
try to do the obvious okay move the arm
 

393
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,590
try to do the obvious okay move the arm
in a way that's mechanically inferior

394
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
in a way that's mechanically inferior
 

395
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,110
in a way that's mechanically inferior
okay but then

396
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
okay but then
 

397
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,829
okay but then
you were told you shouldn't have to move

398
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
you were told you shouldn't have to move
 

399
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:08,550
you were told you shouldn't have to move
at all

400
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
at all
 

401
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,949
at all
do you remember that because if you now

402
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
do you remember that because if you now
 

403
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:11,910
do you remember that because if you now
have to do it

404
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
have to do it
 

405
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,470
have to do it
in two moves and that's not going to be

406
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
in two moves and that's not going to be
 

407
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,590
in two moves and that's not going to be
marshall

408
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
marshall
 

409
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,150
marshall
okay it should be in one move it goes

410
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
okay it should be in one move it goes
 

411
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,670
okay it should be in one move it goes
right from the throw

412
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
right from the throw
 

413
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,590
right from the throw
right into the movement okay so uh

414
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
right into the movement okay so uh
 

415
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,110
right into the movement okay so uh
you know and you don't have to go fast

416
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
you know and you don't have to go fast
 

417
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,790
you know and you don't have to go fast
to do that you just

418
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
to do that you just
 

419
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,269
to do that you just
are constantly thinking ahead so i'm

420
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
are constantly thinking ahead so i'm
 

421
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,030
are constantly thinking ahead so i'm
already picturing what i'm gonna do with

422
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
already picturing what i'm gonna do with
 

423
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,829
already picturing what i'm gonna do with
that arm

424
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
that arm
 

425
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,470
that arm
so i'm already picturing that elbow

426
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
so i'm already picturing that elbow
 

427
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,389
so i'm already picturing that elbow
going onto this hip

428
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
going onto this hip
 

429
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,110
going onto this hip
do you see that so as we come around

430
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
do you see that so as we come around
 

431
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,829
do you see that so as we come around
boom

432
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
boom
 

433
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,110
boom
it's in place you see

434
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
it's in place you see
 

435
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,550
it's in place you see
do you see how i did that hey you don't

436
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
do you see how i did that hey you don't
 

437
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,870
do you see how i did that hey you don't
have to go fast but what i'm trying to

438
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
have to go fast but what i'm trying to
 

439

say
 

441
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,670
say
is your boot is disconnected so you have

442
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
is your boot is disconnected so you have
 

443
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,350
is your boot is disconnected so you have
this space

444
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
this space
 

445
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,430
this space
you see okay then you gotta do the other

446
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
you see okay then you gotta do the other
 

447
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,710
you see okay then you gotta do the other
way you're gonna

448
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
way you're gonna
 

449
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,230
way you're gonna
bring your body to it

450
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
bring your body to it
 

451
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,629
bring your body to it
okay but now what some of you are doing

452
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:02,639
okay but now what some of you are doing
 

453
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,829
okay but now what some of you are doing
is still the

454
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
is still the
 

455
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,990
is still the
i brought my body there but i'm moving

456
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
i brought my body there but i'm moving
 

457
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,590
i brought my body there but i'm moving
like this

458
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
like this
 

459
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,350
like this
you see what were you supposed to do

460
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
you see what were you supposed to do
 

461
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,750
you see what were you supposed to do
here go around it

462
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
here go around it
 

463
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,910
here go around it
just like the closed guard one you go

464
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
just like the closed guard one you go
 

465
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,030
just like the closed guard one you go
around the arm

466
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
around the arm
 

467
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,150
around the arm
you don't paint the picture you see

468
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
you don't paint the picture you see
 

469
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,310
you don't paint the picture you see
you're bringing it like that and then

470
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320

 

471
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,269

and then that's not marshall okay you

472
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
and then that's not marshall okay you
 

473
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,949
and then that's not marshall okay you
got it

474
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
got it
 

475
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,190
got it
all right so let's try it again

476
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200

 

477
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:40,900

try not to have to walk go

478
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:40,910

 

479
00:12:40,910 --> 00:13:05,430

[Music]

480
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440

 

481
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,550

because it's not gonna work

482
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
because it's not gonna work
 

483
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,030
because it's not gonna work
you're not gonna be able to roll me over

484
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
you're not gonna be able to roll me over
 

485
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,710
you're not gonna be able to roll me over
that way go i'll show you what you want

486
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
that way go i'll show you what you want
 

487
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,269
that way go i'll show you what you want
go see how you're pulling me there you

488
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
go see how you're pulling me there you
 

489
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,470
go see how you're pulling me there you
see that

490
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
see that
 

491
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,470
see that
you want to try to get over this ledge

492
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
you want to try to get over this ledge
 

493
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,750
you want to try to get over this ledge
but this ledge is on that side of this

494
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
but this ledge is on that side of this
 

495
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,269
but this ledge is on that side of this
point of no return this center of

496
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
point of no return this center of
 

497
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,150
point of no return this center of
gravity

498
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
gravity
 

499
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,550
gravity
and then you have the friction of my

500
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
and then you have the friction of my
 

501
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,910
and then you have the friction of my
other arm

502
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
other arm
 

503
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,550
other arm
and without strength you can't overcome

504
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
and without strength you can't overcome
 

505
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,750
and without strength you can't overcome
the friction

506
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
the friction
 

507
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,550
the friction
or the weight so what what you're trying

508
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
or the weight so what what you're trying
 

509

or the weight so what what you're trying
to do is

510
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
to do is
 

511
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,870
to do is
use the bottom ribcage as your focal

512
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
use the bottom ribcage as your focal
 

513
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,430
use the bottom ribcage as your focal
point

514

see this part
you're trying to make it go like this

522
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
you're trying to make it go like this
 

523
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,629
you're trying to make it go like this
okay so she goes

524
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
okay so she goes
 

525
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,310
okay so she goes
she's going like this do you see

she's going like this do you see
 

527
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,030
she's going like this do you see
but that's a lot of weight she has to

528
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
but that's a lot of weight she has to
 

529
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,990
but that's a lot of weight she has to
lift that

530
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,000
lift that
 

531
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,069
lift that
and she has to overcome this friction

532
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
and she has to overcome this friction
 

533
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,350
and she has to overcome this friction
here and

534
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360

different okay
so i'm already picturing this elbow

550
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
so i'm already picturing this elbow
 

551
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,350
so i'm already picturing this elbow
going here okay so as i throw

552

going here okay so as i throw
 

553
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,710
going here okay so as i throw
i make that elbow boom right there

than them okay
 

569
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,509
than them okay
i am basically this technique is

570
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
i am basically this technique is
 

571
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,189
i am basically this technique is
happening on a radius

572
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
happening on a radius
 

573
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,069
happening on a radius
around the shoulder just just like the

574
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
around the shoulder just just like the
 

575
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,990
around the shoulder just just like the
camera from the closed guard

576
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
camera from the closed guard
 

577
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,320
camera from the closed guard
