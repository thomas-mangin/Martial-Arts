bent of the final pin okay and that's
 

65
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,789
bent of the final pin okay and that's
what allows this knee to drop to go

around it because if I do a straight arm

68
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
around it because if I do a straight arm
 

69
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,789
around it because if I do a straight arm

00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
okay so I need to bend to push down for
 

73
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,149
okay so I need to bend to push down for
you guys see that okay so I got to bend

74
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:37,159
you guys see that okay so I got to bend
