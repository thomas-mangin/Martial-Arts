1
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:09,500
We are about to visit the old town of Wakimachi

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,600
It is a street lined with old buildings that were involved in the commerce of Aizome,

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,900
which is the blue dye that was used for traditional clothes such as hakama.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,000
That place was the largest selling point in South Japan.

5
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,967
Let's go to see the old town.

6
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:46,567
This is the old town of Wakimachi.

7
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:51,833
The entire street is bordered by buildings that are over 100 years old.

8
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:57,800
Many of them are shops or storehouses for Aizome.

9
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:04,133
Aizome was the typical blue dye used for clothes in Japan.

10
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:10,267
These "Udatsu" protruding walls on both ends of the house's faÃ§ade are really specific to the region.

11
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:17,533
They were used to represent the success of the business [and protect against spread in case of fire].

12
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:23,600
We got the opportunity to visit one of these buildings and everything was still as it was 100 years ago.

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,333
So it makes this city very interesting because it has not changed much since the Edo era.

14
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,500
This is very rare in Japan.

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,867
All the Daito-ryu from Wakimachi comes from here.

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,467
It came from Hokkaido and travelled all the way down to here.

17
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:46,500
This place is the Hombu [head dojo] of Shikoku, the South of Japan.

18
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,367
Here is a typical house from the time, over 150 years ago.

19
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:36,500
This one is not a commercial house and therefore, it does not bear the Udatsu columns that we saw earlier.

20
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,400
It depends on the individual's conscience.

21
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:32,100
If one is magnanimous, then there is some consideration in the technique.

22
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,533
There is compassion.

23
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:37,700
So it is only down to a personal conviction?

24
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,700
Yes.

25
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,933
It depends on one's heart.

26
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:44,233
Yes.

27
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:57,233
If the compassion and the spirit of Takeda Sokaku, Nakatsu Sensei, and now Chiba Sensei were all a bit different,

28
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:07,933
can we conclude that the Daito-ryu is also different?

29
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,967
In the end, what are we talking about?

30
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:18,333
At each period, different things happen.

31
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:27,533
People's ideas evolve and the spirit changes according to what happens at the time.

32
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:37,367
If things did not change, no one would be interested, and these things would become irrelevant today.

33
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:41,433
So if war broke again, it would be different.

34
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,367
But the techniques wouldn't change right?

35
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,467
No they wouldn't change.

36
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:51,533
It is the spirit and the way to teach that can change.

37
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,300
This is the topic of the next question right?

38
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:02,033
What is the relation between Buddhism and Daito-ryu?

39
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,400
You mention Buddhism but it could be said of any other tradition.

40
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,967
The question could be the same for you right?

41
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:06,967
Yes.

42
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:19,700
What I always say is: "Do it calmly" because we have to produce nervous sensitivity.

43
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,533
We can't just do it by our own will; it has to be done collectively.

44
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,500
It is an important principle.

45
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,333
Only then, is it Buddhism.

46
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:37,967
The Buddhist character is "Wa" [litt: harmony, peace, softening]

47
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:40,767
Does this imply that there is no deep meaning to be found?

48
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:45,667
Not at all! On the contrary, there is a lot of depth in the meaning of "Wa".

49
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:51,200
One must achieve that "Wa", like in "Hei-Wa" [peace].

50
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,333
It is like in the song "To have peace, be ready for war".

51
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:59,667
This is the paradox we have to face to reach that peace.

52
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,733
This search for peace underlies this quest [of Daito-ryu].

53
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:45,700
The meaning of the "Sho-wa" era is "to make peace shine" and the meaning of "Hei-sei" is "to become peace".

54
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:58,100
So to go back to Aikido and Aiki-jujutsu, is there a difference of essence?

55
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:12,233
Aikido has "Michi", which means a path. This idea of path means that there is a spirit in "Ai".

56
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:26,567
Aikido is connected to the path of "Ai". We can think that it is spiritual or moral.

57
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:37,533
In "Ju-jutsu", "Ju" means "gentle", "soft", "tender".

58
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:42,700
"Jutsu" is the technique [a mean, a trick, an art].

59
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:51,267
It means that we are soft and we see the other as fundamentally soft too.

60
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:03,967
So teaching and learning is "Manabu" [in-depth study, same character as "Gaku", science].

61
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,400
Japanese language is difficult!

62
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,267
There is meaning inside meaning!

63
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:14,000
It's 8 a.m.

64
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,400
and although we where out last night, people are already training.

65
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,567
They are working on the points that we saw yesterday.

66
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,600
And this is taking place before the actual seminar.

67
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,433
So on top of the 5 hours of Daito-ryu with Chiba Sensei,

68
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:36,767
we also work amongst ourselves on the details.

69
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:40,533
It sums up to a lot of training in the weekend.

70
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:50,767
Hey Guillaume, how are you?

71
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:56,200
You asked me earlier about why are we coming all the way to Shikoku from Tokyo

72
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,833
I think that beyond learning Daito-ryu, it is really a question of depth.

73
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,533
There a re a lot of Sensei in Japan, in France and elsewhere

74
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:06,267
who teach things that are correct,

75
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:09,733
and I think that everyone teaches things that are correct, or try to teach correct things.

76
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:16,967
The issue is in the depth of teaching and how far we can gow in the techniques and details.

77
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:24,367
This is what we find here, we have access to a very deep technical knowledge.

78
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:30,667
It is not easy to learn all that because there are a lot of details

79
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:37,400
and until now, I have not found anybody else here in Japan who could teach to that level of details in Aikido, in Daito-ryu, etc.

80
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:45,967
I think that this is why we come here to see Chiba Sensei and Sato Sensei because with them, we truly get to the heart of Aiki.

81
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:48,167
That makes it really interesting.

82
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,833
See you later!

83
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,467
Good morning!

84
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,167
Good morning!

85
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:57,167
Like this, on the elbow,

86
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:01,167
so that it moves like this.

87
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,700
This is Ni-kajo.

88
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:13,633
There, go towards his chest.

89
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:23,500
It is in this motion only that all the sense of the technique resides.

90
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,467
Do a throwing movement in that direction,

91
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:33,733
and from that point, over there.

92
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:40,900
It is not a lack of goodwill, it is because are sizes are different.

93
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,733
And consequently, are arms length are different.

94
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:51,567
His [arm's] length is about half of his height.

95
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,533
So how are we supposed to do it?

96
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,567
You have to bring him there.

97
00:10:57,567 --> 00:11:00,833
Look at me, I don't move.

98
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:05,400
So do it this way.

99
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,967
If you do it like this, he can punch.

100
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:18,300
So do it like this instead, and then over there!

101
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:36,933
Regarding the techniques with weapons, how does it work in Daito-ryu?

102
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:41,600
The meaning of "Ki" in "Bu-Ki" is that of "tool", or "vessel" as in cookware.

103
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:50,200
Buki is the warrior's tool [the 8 direction strikes].

104
00:11:50,200 --> 00:12:01,800
When one uses the 8 directions upon other people, the Buddhist term is "Katsu", "to win".

105
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,500
KA!

106
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,567
The opponent is then paralyzed.

107
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,867
I throw my Kokyu at him.

108
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:20,100
My spirit is throwing something.

109
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,900
Something is getting out of me.

110
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,000
Does this mean that a weapon is not something that is separate from oneself?

111
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,600
This is because "Bu" does not mean to "fight" but "to stop the spear".

112
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,567
The "Bu" character is composed of two parts,

113
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:48,067
"Hoko", the "spear", and "Tomeru", "to stop".

114
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:56,200
Therefore, "Bu" means "to put an end to the fight".

115
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,633
As a consequence, the sword's purpose is not for killing.

116
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,867
What is beyond the mastery of a tool or an art?

117
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:16,800
You can generalize and anything can then become a tool, a weapon.

118
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:29,167
The whole person can become a tool or a specialized art.

119
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:35,000
Anything can develop as such from the extensions of one's body.

120
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,333
Even with simple chopsticks, I can target the eyes and turn them into weapons.

121
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:50,167
This leads us to "Tachi", the long-sword.

122
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:54,733
It represents what goes "beyond"

123
00:13:54,733 --> 00:14:08,100
The specialized object can take many forms. Anything will do and can be turned into a weapon.

124
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:22,400
So should we understand that in Daito-ryu, the study of weapons is not a separate curriculum in itself?

125
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,067
No, it is all the same thing.

126
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:33,333
When the attack comes, the hand is here to protect.

127
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:37,067
This can serve as well.

128
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:43,233
It means that anything can do to protect yourself.

129
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:49,167
This is why all of that is included in the scrolls over there.

130
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,700
This is why if I give an atemi like this,

131
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:09,167
in Daito-ryu, we can use Ura-Ken like this...

132
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:19,533
The hand position that we studied last time was like this...

133
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:25,967
I asked "Which one is omote?"

134
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:30,167
But I got no answer.

135
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,800
Really?

136
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,600
Yes, so I said: "What is Ura then?" But I got no answer either.

137
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,833
But usually we see that omote...

138
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:45,200
What is written here means "Gauntlet", the back of the hand, its shell.

139
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:55,567
"Kou" is the back of the hand and the palm is "Sho".

140
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:59,533
So there is no difference between Omote and Ura.

141
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:04,200
Omote is the back of the hand and Ura is the palm.

142
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,467
We can show Ura like this.

143
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:13,567
If we do that it means "no, not that".

144
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:22,833
So Omote and Ura are one and same thing. It is the same for the techniques.

145
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,833
It is like two sides of a coin isn't it?

146
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:39,033
There is a head and a tail but it is still the same coin.

147
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:50,067
And it is the same for the techniques.

148
00:16:52,500 --> 00:17:00,900
It means that if we are using the back of the hand, we are using a weapon.

149
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:06,733
But when we use the palm, it is to say "stop".

150
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:13,800
Even if you slap someone with the palm, it is not a big deal.

151
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,200
We even do it to ourselves like that!

152
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:24,267
We do like this to ourselves or to others.

153
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:29,633
You find this in Sumo too during the "Tsuppari" techniques.

154
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:33,533
But can't say these are weapons too?

155
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:36,700
Yes, this is why I said that the two aspects were the same thing.

156
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,000
Omote becomes a weapons and Ura can become one too.

157
00:17:40,000 --> 00:18:00,933
Look, when we wave our hand to say no, both sides are in action, we don't only wave the palm.

158
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:06,300
This is what it means.

159
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:18,233
What are the technical roots of weapons in Daito-ryu?

160
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:19,667
[Shingen Jiki] Shinkage [ryu]

161
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:23,200
Shinkage-ryu...

162
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:36,833
Regarding the Shinkage influence, the source comes from Aizu.

163
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:42,467
There are also a lot of techniques from Ono-ha Itto-ryu.

164
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:50,833
But there is Shinkage also.

165
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,967
Did you practice Shinkage-ryu?
