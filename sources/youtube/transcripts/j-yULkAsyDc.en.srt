00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,470
a bunch of teachers have kind of tried
to

00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
to
 

39
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,229
to
turn it into an unarmed system and

40
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
turn it into an unarmed system and
 

41
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,750
turn it into an unarmed system and
there's been a lot of discussion of

42
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
there's been a lot of discussion of
 

43
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,389
there's been a lot of discussion of
unarmed stuff but unarmed emphasis is

44
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
unarmed stuff but unarmed emphasis is
 

45
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,310
unarmed stuff but unarmed emphasis is
not really what aikido is about and

not really what aikido is about and

there's a number of historical reasons
 

49
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,430
there's a number of historical reasons
as to why

50
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
as to why
 

51
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,430
as to why
there's been an over emphasis on unarmed

52
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
there's been an over emphasis on unarmed
 

53
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,990
there's been an over emphasis on unarmed
things but by trying to understand

54
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
things but by trying to understand
 

55
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,110

aikido's technical syllabus as unarmed

56

aikido's technical syllabus as unarmed

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,950
aikido's technical syllabus as unarmed
you're doing yourself a great disservice

58
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
you're doing yourself a great disservice
 

59
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,149
you're doing yourself a great disservice
because

60
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
because
 

61
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,310
because
a lot of the techniques will seem like

62
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
a lot of the techniques will seem like
 

63
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,630
a lot of the techniques will seem like
they're not really necessary and so when

64
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
they're not really necessary and so when
 

65
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,630
they're not really necessary and so when
you're trying to hash out what aikido is

66
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
you're trying to hash out what aikido is
 

67
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,870
you're trying to hash out what aikido is
by not first approaching it as an armed

68
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
by not first approaching it as an armed
 

69
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,630
by not first approaching it as an armed
system it's going to be really really

70
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
system it's going to be really really
 

71
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,710
system it's going to be really really
complicated to understand now after

72
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
complicated to understand now after
 

73
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,950
complicated to understand now after
we've understood it as an armed system

74
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
we've understood it as an armed system
 

75
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,109
we've understood it as an armed system
we can start to understand that it

76
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
we can start to understand that it
 

77
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,749
we can start to understand that it
really doesn't actually matter if there

78
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
really doesn't actually matter if there
 

79
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,350
really doesn't actually matter if there
are weapons or not weapons because the

80
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
are weapons or not weapons because the
 

81
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,429
are weapons or not weapons because the
system's built in a way that that really

82
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
system's built in a way that that really
 

83
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,030
system's built in a way that that really
doesn't matter

84
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
doesn't matter
 

85
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,350
doesn't matter
but you first have to understand it in

86
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
but you first have to understand it in
 

87
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,950
but you first have to understand it in
the way i'm going to kind of provide now

88
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
the way i'm going to kind of provide now
 

89
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,390
the way i'm going to kind of provide now
so i'm going to go through a few forms

90
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
so i'm going to go through a few forms
 

91
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,030
so i'm going to go through a few forms
with you with a wakazashi with josh and

92

00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
all right okay let's think about um some
 

109
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,350

forms and how they might look like our

110
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
forms and how they might look like our
 

111
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,670

00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
stuff and that kind of doesn't exist in
 

121

very familiar with seeing but see it in
a slightly different way okay so if i

128
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
a slightly different way okay so if i
 

129
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,470

my belt and josh reached out to pull it
 

135
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,990
my belt and josh reached out to pull it

141
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,030
to grab it katate or he's going to grab
it yakute right now that should be

142
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
it yakute right now that should be
 

143
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,869
it yakute right now that should be
pretty evident if i had my hand out here

144
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
pretty evident if i had my hand out here
 

145

pretty evident if i had my hand out here
there's katate and there's gyakute so

146
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
there's katate and there's gyakute so
 

147

reached out and grabbed it
 

151
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,670
reached out and grabbed it
okay so here's

152
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
okay so here's
 

153
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,990
okay so here's
all right now what do i want to do well

154
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
all right now what do i want to do well
 

155
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,390
all right now what do i want to do well
i clearly don't want this guy holding my

156
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
i clearly don't want this guy holding my
 

157
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,790
i clearly don't want this guy holding my
sword so how could i get him off of it

158
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
sword so how could i get him off of it
 

159
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,350
sword so how could i get him off of it
well one way i could do that is step off

160
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
well one way i could do that is step off
 

161
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,990
well one way i could do that is step off
the line and shove his elbow off of my

162
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000

ikyo multeform boom there it is right
okay and that of course could go to i

172
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
okay and that of course could go to i

because it's going to go way off camera
 

177
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,790
because it's going to go way off camera
but that could also go all the way

but that could also go all the way
 

179
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,869
but that could also go all the way
through so let's say i go here and his

again that could go all the way down to

234
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
again that could go all the way down to
 

235
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,909
again that could go all the way down to
the ground or it could be done standing

the ground or it could be done standing
 

237
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,790
the ground or it could be done standing
to finish it up right there all right

238
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
to finish it up right there all right
 

239
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,670
to finish it up right there all right
let's say he gets this and he pulls the

240
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
let's say he gets this and he pulls the
 

241
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,230
let's say he gets this and he pulls the
weapon out right so he really pulls it

242
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
weapon out right so he really pulls it
 

243
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,629
weapon out right so he really pulls it
in there like that right well what can i

244
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
in there like that right well what can i
 

245
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,310
in there like that right well what can i
do with that as he pulls it in there i

246
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
do with that as he pulls it in there i
 

247
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,909
do with that as he pulls it in there i
can come over the top and we get a

248
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
can come over the top and we get a
 

249
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,950
can come over the top and we get a
kolkanage so now that kokunage is

250
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
kolkanage so now that kokunage is
 

251
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,670
kolkanage so now that kokunage is
gyakutedori kokunage right here i came

252
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
gyakutedori kokunage right here i came
 

253
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,710
gyakutedori kokunage right here i came
in here boom yakute ori kokunage right

254
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
in here boom yakute ori kokunage right
 

255
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,909
in here boom yakute ori kokunage right
and of course i could do it with the

256
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
and of course i could do it with the
 

257
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,510
and of course i could do it with the
over-the-shoulder version or other

258
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
over-the-shoulder version or other
 

259
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,430
over-the-shoulder version or other
versions if i wanted but that basically

260
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
versions if i wanted but that basically
 

261
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,510
versions if i wanted but that basically
idea comes from kokinagi because or

262
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
idea comes from kokinagi because or
 

263
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,350
idea comes from kokinagi because or
turns too cocky because he's pulling it

264
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
turns too cocky because he's pulling it
 

265
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,350
turns too cocky because he's pulling it
in right so as he pulls me in i just

266
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
in right so as he pulls me in i just
 

267
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,230
in right so as he pulls me in i just
enter right alongside it okay let's say

268
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
enter right alongside it okay let's say
 

269
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,629
enter right alongside it okay let's say
he pulls it and he clears my weapon

270
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
he pulls it and he clears my weapon
 

271
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,830
he pulls it and he clears my weapon
right so he actually gets it away from

272
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
right so he actually gets it away from
 

273
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,830
right so he actually gets it away from
me oh that's bad he's immediately going

274
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
me oh that's bad he's immediately going
 

275
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,189
me oh that's bad he's immediately going
to put it in the other hand and he's

276
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
to put it in the other hand and he's
 

277
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,790
to put it in the other hand and he's
going to attack me somehow right that's

278
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
going to attack me somehow right that's
 

279
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,029
going to attack me somehow right that's
what he's up to right so now we're

280
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
what he's up to right so now we're
 

281
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,909
what he's up to right so now we're
seeing techniques for yokomanuchi right

282
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
seeing techniques for yokomanuchi right
 

283
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,670
seeing techniques for yokomanuchi right
so let's say he pulled it out and

284
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
so let's say he pulled it out and
 

285
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,670
so let's say he pulled it out and
switched and comes yokomanuchi bang i

286
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
switched and comes yokomanuchi bang i
 

287
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,070
switched and comes yokomanuchi bang i
enter in there and we have one of our

288
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
enter in there and we have one of our
 

289
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,469
enter in there and we have one of our
basic defenses let's say

290
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
basic defenses let's say
 

291
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,150
basic defenses let's say
he was at a further distance so he kind

292
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
he was at a further distance so he kind
 

293
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,510
he was at a further distance so he kind
of hopped back further and so when he

294
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
of hopped back further and so when he
 

295
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,270
of hopped back further and so when he
comes in i have to cover more distance

296
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
comes in i have to cover more distance
 

297
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,189
comes in i have to cover more distance
boom there's another one of our entries

298
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
boom there's another one of our entries
 

299
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,270
boom there's another one of our entries
for yokomanuchi so now you see how

300
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
for yokomanuchi so now you see how
 

301
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,350
for yokomanuchi so now you see how
yokomanuchi directly comes off him

302
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
yokomanuchi directly comes off him
 

303
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,430
yokomanuchi directly comes off him
pulling the weapon free and coming to

304
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
pulling the weapon free and coming to
 

305
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,670
pulling the weapon free and coming to
get me all right what about further from

306
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
get me all right what about further from
 

307
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,629
get me all right what about further from
there so let's say he goes yokomanuchi

308
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
there so let's say he goes yokomanuchi
 

309
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,629
there so let's say he goes yokomanuchi
and i come here well what's he going to

310
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
and i come here well what's he going to
 

311
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,830
and i come here well what's he going to
do he's probably going to try and go

312
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
do he's probably going to try and go
 

313
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,150
do he's probably going to try and go
under this and cut my belly boom right

314
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
under this and cut my belly boom right
 

315
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,150
under this and cut my belly boom right
what's the aikido answer for that well

316
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
