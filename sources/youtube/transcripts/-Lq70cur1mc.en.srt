backwards go forwards so I've gone here

14
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:23,800
backwards go forwards so I've gone here
 

15
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,509
backwards go forwards so I've gone here
now I'm actually going back there but I

16

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:27,560
really want him to
 

19
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,950
really want him to
here so I chose this about a week ago

20
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
here so I chose this about a week ago
 

21
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,229
here so I chose this about a week ago
when I thought I'd like to

22
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:33,239
when I thought I'd like to
 

23
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,030
when I thought I'd like to
goach because it's following on really

24
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
goach because it's following on really
 

25
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,350
goach because it's following on really
from everything that I do you go I get

26
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,360
from everything that I do you go I get
 

27
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,430
from everything that I do you go I get
out of these distance and I

28
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
out of these distance and I
 

29
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,549
out of these distance and I
just I can pass it by

30
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
just I can pass it by
 

31
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,310
just I can pass it by
here I don't need to take it back into

32
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
here I don't need to take it back into
 

33
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:21,630
here I don't need to take it back into
him I pass it by here

34
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:21,640

 

35
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,550

so it's it's sort of going on what we

36
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:25,560
so it's it's sort of going on what we
 

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,389
so it's it's sort of going on what we
done before the AA

38
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:32,399

 

39
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:46,469

see making a a big distance

40
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479

 

41
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,149

now so I don't want you're watching when

42
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:49,159
now so I don't want you're watching when
 

43
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,510
now so I don't want you're watching when
I used to be student I used to

44
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
I used to be student I used to
 

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,069
I used to be student I used to
watch first legs and then can I look at

46
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
watch first legs and then can I look at
 

47
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,630
watch first legs and then can I look at
oh no I can't so so you have to pick

48
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
oh no I can't so so you have to pick
 

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,270
oh no I can't so so you have to pick
bits

50
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,280
bits
 

51
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,789
bits
work out what bit you want to work with

52
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
work out what bit you want to work with
 

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,630
work out what bit you want to work with
or what bit you thought you saw but why

54
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,640
or what bit you thought you saw but why
 

55
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,790
or what bit you thought you saw but why
is it different than

56
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:07,800
is it different than
 

57
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,910
is it different than
the the first one even with the move I

58
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:10,920
the the first one even with the move I
 

59
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,110
the the first one even with the move I
was about here in line with his

60
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,120
was about here in line with his
 

61
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,190
was about here in line with his
foot okay and then down there this one

62
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,200
foot okay and then down there this one
 

63
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,229
foot okay and then down there this one
you need to watch the

64
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:25,239

 

65
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:27,509

back puts

66
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:27,519
back puts
 

67
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,670
back puts
me so I'm actually

68
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:30,680
me so I'm actually
 

69
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:38,350
me so I'm actually
floting footwork

70
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,360

 

71
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,360

wise very
