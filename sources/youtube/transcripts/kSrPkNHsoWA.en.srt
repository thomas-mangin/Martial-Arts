00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,149

hi everyone alex gin here so in today's

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:02,159
hi everyone alex gin here so in today's
 

3
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,669
hi everyone alex gin here so in today's
video i'm gonna be talking about what an

4
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:03,679
video i'm gonna be talking about what an
 

5
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:04,630
video i'm gonna be talking about what an
isolation is

6
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:04,640
isolation is
 

7
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,389
isolation is
and not the quarantine kind make sure

8
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:06,399
and not the quarantine kind make sure
 

9
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,590
and not the quarantine kind make sure
you stick around to the end of the video

10
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,600
you stick around to the end of the video
 

11
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,870
you stick around to the end of the video
because i'll also be talking about the

12
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:08,880
because i'll also be talking about the
 

13
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,790
because i'll also be talking about the
martial applications of these movements

14
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
martial applications of these movements
 

15
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,070
martial applications of these movements
okay so let's get into it

16
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080

 

17
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,750

so i'll be explaining how an isolation

18
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,760
so i'll be explaining how an isolation
 

19
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,269
so i'll be explaining how an isolation
works with a staff club

20
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:21,279
works with a staff club
 

21
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,189
works with a staff club
and also a sword but to begin with i'm

22
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
and also a sword but to begin with i'm
 

23
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,630
and also a sword but to begin with i'm
going to explain the principles with

24
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
going to explain the principles with
 

25
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,910
going to explain the principles with
this ball and chain

26
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
this ball and chain
 

27
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,310
this ball and chain
i don't recommend you do this if you if

28
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
i don't recommend you do this if you if
 

29
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,429
i don't recommend you do this if you if
you haven't experienced this type of

30
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
you haven't experienced this type of
 

31
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,630
you haven't experienced this type of
thing before

32
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
thing before
 

33
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,709
thing before
as it's quite heavy so i suggest using

34
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
as it's quite heavy so i suggest using
 

35
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,830
as it's quite heavy so i suggest using
something like a

36
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
something like a
 

37
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,190
something like a
tennis ball and a sock if you want to

38
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
tennis ball and a sock if you want to
 

39
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,190
tennis ball and a sock if you want to
try this movement out so if i start off

40
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
try this movement out so if i start off
 

41
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,830
try this movement out so if i start off
this movement

42
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,840
this movement
 

43
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,110
this movement
by rotating around my wrist you can see

44
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
by rotating around my wrist you can see
 

45
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,510
by rotating around my wrist you can see
here

46
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
here
 

47
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,910
here
this is the pivot point as it as the

48
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
this is the pivot point as it as the
 

49
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,190
this is the pivot point as it as the
ball goes round

50
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
ball goes round
 

51
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,190
ball goes round
it's just all rotating around this one

52
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
it's just all rotating around this one
 

53
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,630
it's just all rotating around this one
point

54
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
point
 

55
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,069
point
however if i start to move my hand out

56
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
however if i start to move my hand out
 

57
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,830
however if i start to move my hand out
you can see the rotation point has now

58
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
you can see the rotation point has now
 

59
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,229
you can see the rotation point has now
changed and it's actually

60
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
changed and it's actually
 

61
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,670
changed and it's actually
in the middle of the chain

62
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
in the middle of the chain
 

63
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,029
in the middle of the chain
and that's because i'm pulling

64
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039

 

65
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,350

at an opposite force as the ball is

66
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
at an opposite force as the ball is
 

67
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,230
at an opposite force as the ball is
dropping

68
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
dropping
 

69
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,429
dropping
round so as the ball travels round

70
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
round so as the ball travels round
 

71
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,750
round so as the ball travels round
i'm giving it that little bit of a pull

72
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
i'm giving it that little bit of a pull
 

73
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,270
i'm giving it that little bit of a pull
and obviously this needs to change

74
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
and obviously this needs to change
 

75
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,109
and obviously this needs to change
depending on where the ball is obviously

76
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
depending on where the ball is obviously
 

77
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,190
depending on where the ball is obviously
at the top it becomes lighter

78
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
at the top it becomes lighter
 

79
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,070
at the top it becomes lighter
and then as it drops down gravity starts

80
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
and then as it drops down gravity starts
 

81
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,710
and then as it drops down gravity starts
to

82
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
to
 

83
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,749
to
pull it down further and then i've got

84
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
pull it down further and then i've got
 

85
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,710
pull it down further and then i've got
to give it that pull

86
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
to give it that pull
 

87
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,990
to give it that pull
in that counter direction so then you

88
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
in that counter direction so then you
 

89
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,910
in that counter direction so then you
start to get a movement where you're

90
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
start to get a movement where you're
 

91
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,149
start to get a movement where you're
following the ball round

92
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
following the ball round
 

93
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,710
following the ball round
we can actually then manipulate it much

94
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
we can actually then manipulate it much
 

95
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,990
we can actually then manipulate it much
easier

96
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
easier
 

97
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,910
easier
as we've got more control over the

98
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
as we've got more control over the
 

99
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,109
as we've got more control over the
object

100
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
object
 

101
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,710
object
so as it's spinning around as i can feel

102
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
so as it's spinning around as i can feel
 

103
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,149
so as it's spinning around as i can feel
the weight

104
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
the weight
 

105
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,510
the weight
so i'm pulling in the the equal amount

106
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
so i'm pulling in the the equal amount
 

107
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,910
so i'm pulling in the the equal amount
on the off in the opposite direction

108
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
on the off in the opposite direction
 

109
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,630
on the off in the opposite direction
i can then start to switch it so i start

110
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
i can then start to switch it so i start
 

111
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,310
i can then start to switch it so i start
to change the direction

112
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
to change the direction
 

113
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,429
to change the direction
in whichever way i want

114
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439

 

115
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,230

and that's because i've got that control

116
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240
and that's because i've got that control
 

117
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,550
and that's because i've got that control
where i'm just following the motion

118
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
where i'm just following the motion
 

119
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,590
where i'm just following the motion
wherever the ball goes i can then

120
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
wherever the ball goes i can then
 

121
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,429
wherever the ball goes i can then
go off on a tangent so if you think of

122
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
go off on a tangent so if you think of
 

123
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,749
go off on a tangent so if you think of
the circle is like this i can then shoot

124
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
the circle is like this i can then shoot
 

125
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,070
the circle is like this i can then shoot
off

126
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
off
 

127
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,630
off
whichever tangent i want so the most

128
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
whichever tangent i want so the most
 

129
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,229
whichever tangent i want so the most
obvious use of this movement is if you

130
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
obvious use of this movement is if you
 

131
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,990
obvious use of this movement is if you
applied it to something like a rope dart

132
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
applied it to something like a rope dart
 

133
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,990
applied it to something like a rope dart
or meteor where when it's spinning

134
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
or meteor where when it's spinning
 

135
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,589
or meteor where when it's spinning
around you're letting the movement

136
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
around you're letting the movement
 

137
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,150
around you're letting the movement
fire off into whichever direction you

138
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
fire off into whichever direction you
 

139
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,790
fire off into whichever direction you
want

140
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
want
 

141
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,869
want
now obviously this is just on a short

142
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
now obviously this is just on a short
 

143
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,710
now obviously this is just on a short
chain but the same would apply if it was

144
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
chain but the same would apply if it was
 

145
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,670
chain but the same would apply if it was
on a longer chain

146
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
on a longer chain
 

147
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,229
on a longer chain
using those same principles but how does

148
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
using those same principles but how does
 

149
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,550
using those same principles but how does
it also apply to the staffing sword

150
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
it also apply to the staffing sword
 

151
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,790
it also apply to the staffing sword
so if we take the staff one way to look

152
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
so if we take the staff one way to look
 

153
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,990
so if we take the staff one way to look
at it is to isolate

154
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
at it is to isolate
 

155
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,750
at it is to isolate
around a certain point for example where

156
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
around a certain point for example where
 

157
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,869
around a certain point for example where
my elbow is and rotate

158
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
my elbow is and rotate
 

159
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,390
my elbow is and rotate
around that one point and then you get

160
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
around that one point and then you get
 

161
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,589
around that one point and then you get
some effect that looks like this

162
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
some effect that looks like this
 

163
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,150
some effect that looks like this
now that is the same movement if we did

164
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
now that is the same movement if we did
 

165
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,270
now that is the same movement if we did
it with the club

166
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
it with the club
 

167
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,430
it with the club
i can isolate around my elbow

168
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440

 

169
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,949

and get that same effect with the club

170
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
and get that same effect with the club
 

171
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,149
and get that same effect with the club
same as with the staff so if i for

172
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
same as with the staff so if i for
 

173
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,229
same as with the staff so if i for
example take a figure eight motion

174
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
example take a figure eight motion
 

175
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,070
example take a figure eight motion
rather than rotating around my wrist

176
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
rather than rotating around my wrist
 

177
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,990
rather than rotating around my wrist
like i did with the

178
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
like i did with the
 

179
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,990
like i did with the
ball and chain i could pick another

180
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
ball and chain i could pick another
 

181
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,790
ball and chain i could pick another
point and move around that one point

182
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
point and move around that one point
 

183
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,070
point and move around that one point
and it creates this effect

184
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
and it creates this effect
 

185
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,790
and it creates this effect
with the stuff and essentially i'm

186
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
with the stuff and essentially i'm
 

187
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,070
with the stuff and essentially i'm
following

188
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
following
 

189
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,710
following
this side a bit like i did with the ball

190
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
this side a bit like i did with the ball
 

191
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,270
this side a bit like i did with the ball
and chain

192
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
and chain
 

193
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,430
and chain
when i was doing the isolation

194
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440

 

195
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,630

and it makes the staff feel really light

196
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640
and it makes the staff feel really light
 

197
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,589
and it makes the staff feel really light
when you're moving it round

198
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599

 

199
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,949

now for example we're looking at with

200
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
now for example we're looking at with
 

201
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,509
now for example we're looking at with
the sword and i take this motion where

202
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
the sword and i take this motion where
 

203
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,630
the sword and i take this motion where
i'm bringing it around

204
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
i'm bringing it around
 

205
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,030
i'm bringing it around
and get underneath the sword bring it

206
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
and get underneath the sword bring it
 

207
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,350
and get underneath the sword bring it
around now i'm following behind it

208
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
around now i'm following behind it
 

209
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,470
around now i'm following behind it
it now could turn into a downward thrust

210
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
it now could turn into a downward thrust
 

211
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,949
it now could turn into a downward thrust
or i could take it round to the other

212
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
or i could take it round to the other
 

213
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,949
or i could take it round to the other
side

214
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
side
 

215
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,789
side
it gives me that option so essentially

216
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
it gives me that option so essentially
 

217
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,670
it gives me that option so essentially
i'm creating a circle and then at any

218
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
i'm creating a circle and then at any
 

219
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,670
i'm creating a circle and then at any
point on that circle

220
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
point on that circle
 

221
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,270
point on that circle
you can go off on a tangent and thrust

222
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
you can go off on a tangent and thrust
 

223
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,630
you can go off on a tangent and thrust
so some of you might already be doing an

224
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
so some of you might already be doing an
 

225
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,470
so some of you might already be doing an
isolation without even realizing it

226
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
isolation without even realizing it
 

227
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,789
isolation without even realizing it
if we take the 15th suburi for example

228
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
if we take the 15th suburi for example
 

229
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,830
if we take the 15th suburi for example
this movement here

230
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
this movement here
 

231
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,110
this movement here
is a thrust that's actually going

232
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
is a thrust that's actually going
 

233
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,710
is a thrust that's actually going
off a tangent from a circle

234
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
off a tangent from a circle
 

235
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,790
off a tangent from a circle
when i was talking before about this

236
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
when i was talking before about this
 

237
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,830
when i was talking before about this
movement here

238
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840

 

239
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,110

see as it's moving around it's actually

240
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
see as it's moving around it's actually
 

241
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,390
see as it's moving around it's actually
going off

242
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
going off
 

243
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,749
going off
a tangent it's this circular motion

244
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
a tangent it's this circular motion
 

245
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,270
a tangent it's this circular motion
here so it's that same circular motion

246
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
here so it's that same circular motion
 

247
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,710
here so it's that same circular motion
but as it comes down it's turning into a

248
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
but as it comes down it's turning into a
 

249
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,830
but as it comes down it's turning into a
thrust

250
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
thrust
 

251
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,990
thrust
it's moving around that circle and then

252
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
it's moving around that circle and then
 

253
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,150
it's moving around that circle and then
shooting off at a tangent

254
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
shooting off at a tangent
 

255
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,510
shooting off at a tangent
so once you start to understand the

256
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
so once you start to understand the
 

257
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,790
so once you start to understand the
isolation there's so many other things

258
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
isolation there's so many other things
 

259
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,510
isolation there's so many other things
that you can explore such as anti-spins

260
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
that you can explore such as anti-spins
 

261
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,430
that you can explore such as anti-spins
however i'll cover that in another video
