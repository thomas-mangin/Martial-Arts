00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
and if that's what i'm dropping then i
 

181
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,909
and if that's what i'm dropping then i
drop that

182
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
drop that
 

183
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,270
drop that
where his dead angle

184
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280

 

185
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:19,029

no that's gonna be that way

186
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039

 

187
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,189

you need to make an x with the line of

188
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
you need to make an x with the line of
 

189
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,270
you need to make an x with the line of
attack okay you have to make a cross

190
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
attack okay you have to make a cross
 

191
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,110
attack okay you have to make a cross
it's diagonal

192
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
it's diagonal
 

193
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,390
it's diagonal
the problem

194
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
the problem
 

195
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,029
the problem
or the question you're asking is is

196
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
or the question you're asking is is
 

197
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,670
or the question you're asking is is
there a place where his elbow is going

198
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
there a place where his elbow is going
 

199
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,070
there a place where his elbow is going
either forward nor backwards where it

200
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
either forward nor backwards where it
 

201
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,510
either forward nor backwards where it
becomes easy to manipulate

202
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
becomes easy to manipulate
 

203
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,870
becomes easy to manipulate
into this

204
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
into this
 

205
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,350
into this
so that his ongoing energy

206
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
so that his ongoing energy
 

207
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,189
so that his ongoing energy
makes his

208
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
makes his
 

209
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,430
makes his
line of gravity fall outside his face

210
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
line of gravity fall outside his face
 

211
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,310
line of gravity fall outside his face
support that that is the technique okay

212
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
support that that is the technique okay
 

213
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,150
support that that is the technique okay
the technique is not over here

214
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
the technique is not over here
 

215
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,230
the technique is not over here
not the technique

216
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
not the technique
 

217
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,990
not the technique
you're working well let's call that the

218
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
you're working well let's call that the
 

219
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,469
you're working well let's call that the
sweet spot the wu-wei spot i don't have

220
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
sweet spot the wu-wei spot i don't have
 

221
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,590
sweet spot the wu-wei spot i don't have
to do anything it does it okay

222
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
to do anything it does it okay
 

223
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,350
to do anything it does it okay
so

224
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
so
 

225
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,870
so
as part of that wu-wei spot the length

226
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
as part of that wu-wei spot the length
 

227
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,590
as part of that wu-wei spot the length
of my arms

228
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
of my arms
 

229
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,110
of my arms
don't lengthen or shorten to get it it's

230
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
don't lengthen or shorten to get it it's
 

231
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,469
don't lengthen or shorten to get it it's
impossible now

232
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479

 

233
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,309

you see you're either too far too close

234
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
you see you're either too far too close
 

235
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,029
you see you're either too far too close
so the length of your arm stays the same

236
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
so the length of your arm stays the same
 

237
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,909
so the length of your arm stays the same
that's what he hits

238
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
that's what he hits
 

239
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,710
that's what he hits
you get it

240
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720

 

241
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:47,430

so that's part of the technique

242
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440

 

243
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,749

one length okay not

244
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
one length okay not
 

245
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,110
one length okay not
bending also not extending okay

246
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
bending also not extending okay
 

247
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,870
bending also not extending okay
try it

248
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
try it
 

249
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,309
try it
so that sweet spot

250
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
so that sweet spot
 

251
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,189
so that sweet spot
doesn't change even if i if i throw a

252
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
doesn't change even if i if i throw a
 

253
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,749
doesn't change even if i if i throw a
strike i have to make sure

254
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
strike i have to make sure
 

255
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,469
strike i have to make sure
that i don't lengthen my arms

256
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
that i don't lengthen my arms
 

257
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,629
that i don't lengthen my arms
or bend my arms

258
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639

 

259
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,110

it's not a matter again of space it's a

260
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
it's not a matter again of space it's a
 

261
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:27,350
it's not a matter again of space it's a
matter of timing okay

262
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360

 

263
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:38,150

figure it out

264
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160

 

265
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,309

you're coming in and stopping

266
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
you're coming in and stopping
 

267
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,230
you're coming in and stopping
come in

268
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
come in
 

269
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:55,110
come in
come in

270
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120

 

271
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:09,029

do your job

272
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039

 

273
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,469

okay

274
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479

 

275
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,550

there is an important point to make

276
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
there is an important point to make
 

277
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,189
there is an important point to make
about the way elbow

278
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199

 

279
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,589

if you're feeling powerful

280
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
if you're feeling powerful
 

281
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,510
if you're feeling powerful
that's not it

282
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
that's not it
 

283
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,430
that's not it
subjectively you feel powerful because

284
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
subjectively you feel powerful because
 

285
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,189
subjectively you feel powerful because
you feel your muscles

286
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
you feel your muscles
 

287
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,550
you feel your muscles
overcoming the resistance but that's

288
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
overcoming the resistance but that's
 

289
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,190
overcoming the resistance but that's
big man on keto okay

290
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
big man on keto okay
 

291
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,149
big man on keto okay
so again there is a sweet spot where

292
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
so again there is a sweet spot where
 

293
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,790
so again there is a sweet spot where
that elbow

294
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
that elbow
 

295
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,870
that elbow
doesn't take any energy do you get it

296
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
doesn't take any energy do you get it
 

297
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,469
doesn't take any energy do you get it
and that's what you're trying to feel

298
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
and that's what you're trying to feel
 

299
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,829
and that's what you're trying to feel
for okay

300
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
for okay
 

301
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,990
for okay
well let's put it this way if you feel

302
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
well let's put it this way if you feel
 

303
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,389
well let's put it this way if you feel
yourself overpowering that's not it so

304
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
yourself overpowering that's not it so
 

305
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,550
yourself overpowering that's not it so
feel for that okay it's not i don't

306
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
feel for that okay it's not i don't
 

307
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,150
feel for that okay it's not i don't
actually feel for this sweet spot okay

308
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
actually feel for this sweet spot okay
 

309
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,350
actually feel for this sweet spot okay
uh

310
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
uh
 

311
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,150
uh
and then the other thing is is that his

312
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160
and then the other thing is is that his
 

313
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,150
and then the other thing is is that his
energy is going it's going into that

314
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
energy is going it's going into that
 

315
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,750
energy is going it's going into that
ground path that's actually what i'm

316
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
ground path that's actually what i'm
 

317
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,110
ground path that's actually what i'm
feeling for this this uh

318
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
feeling for this this uh
 

319
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,590
feeling for this this uh
projection okay

320
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
projection okay
 

321
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,470
projection okay

it's here

340
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200

 

341
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,150

oh

342
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160

 

343
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,910

you guys here i'm not grabbing it okay

344
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
you guys here i'm not grabbing it okay
 

345
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,070
you guys here i'm not grabbing it okay
you're going to create an adhesion

346
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
you're going to create an adhesion
 

347
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:09,350
you're going to create an adhesion
this version pops out past

348
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360

 

349
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,230

okay let's try that version to emphasize

350
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
okay let's try that version to emphasize
 

351
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,230
okay let's try that version to emphasize
even though he's grabbing me

352
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
even though he's grabbing me
 

353
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,069
even though he's grabbing me
