00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
hydraulic your yourself down okay but
 

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,190
hydraulic your yourself down okay but
what's the why would you do

38
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,200

 

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,589

that okay yeah like let's say the the

40
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
that okay yeah like let's say the the
 

41
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,670
that okay yeah like let's say the the
the NOG is not slamming you down so you

42
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
the NOG is not slamming you down so you
 

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,630
the NOG is not slamming you down so you
stay connected so you don't just drop

44
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
stay connected so you don't just drop
 

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,670
stay connected so you don't just drop
right but if n is pushing you down

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:30,680
right but if n is pushing you down
 

47
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,150
right but if n is pushing you down
should you be hydraulic in your ass down

48
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
should you be hydraulic in your ass down
 

49
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,470

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
I have to be SL me
 

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,309
I have to be SL me
down I have to be able to ride that

62
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319

 

63
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,070

down she

64
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,080
down she
 

65
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,670
down she
determines what rate I go down at not

66
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
determines what rate I go down at not
 

67
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,470

me now some of you have tight arms and
 

69
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,149
me now some of you have tight arms and
shoulders still in need of

70
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
shoulders still in need of
 

71
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,509

development you have to move your

72
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
development you have to move your
 

73
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,830

BL so when she's tweaking my arm you

74
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
BL so when she's tweaking my arm you
 

75
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,070
BL so when she's tweaking my arm you
might find it better to try and lie this

76

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,869
you move where you need to move to not
get hurt okay all right let's look at

90
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:05,879
get hurt okay all right let's look at
 

91
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,069
get hurt okay all right let's look at
the grip here okay see see this grip

holding and then leveraging here there's
a leverage in each grip

106
