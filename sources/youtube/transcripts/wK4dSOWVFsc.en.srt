00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,549

[Music]

2
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559

 

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,390

So this is a buddo

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
So this is a buddo
 

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,029
So this is a buddo
and just to keep it simple is you're use

6
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:19,039
and just to keep it simple is you're use
 

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,150
and just to keep it simple is you're use
you're using martial arts training as a

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,160
you're using martial arts training as a
 

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,189
you're using martial arts training as a
technology of self.

10
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
technology of self.
 

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,390
technology of self.
Um the technology of self that we're

12
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
Um the technology of self that we're
 

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,990
Um the technology of self that we're
doing is silk road orient uh derived and

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
doing is silk road orient uh derived and
 

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,229
doing is silk road orient uh derived and
so it's a mysticism.

16
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239

 

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,430

There are other forms of mysticism where

18
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
There are other forms of mysticism where
 

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,190
There are other forms of mysticism where
you do not do martial arts at all

20
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
you do not do martial arts at all
 

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,510
you do not do martial arts at all
and there are other forms of mysticism

22
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
and there are other forms of mysticism
 

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,750
and there are other forms of mysticism
where you do not move at all.

24
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
where you do not move at all.
 

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,709
where you do not move at all.
So this begs the question

26
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
So this begs the question
 

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,470
So this begs the question
why do buudo

28
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480

 

29
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,510

Um,

30
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520

 

31
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,510

if you look within our practice,

32
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
if you look within our practice,
 

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,350
if you look within our practice,
it has

34
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360

 

35
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,870

drills or exercises

36
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
drills or exercises
 

37
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,270
drills or exercises
that are not marshall

38
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
that are not marshall
 

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,910
that are not marshall
and that do not move at all.

40
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920

 

41
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,950

And this is why I say for these reasons

42
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
And this is why I say for these reasons
 

43
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,950
And this is why I say for these reasons
that there are traditions that don't do

44
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
that there are traditions that don't do
 

45
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,630
that there are traditions that don't do
martial arts. There are traditions that

46
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
martial arts. There are traditions that
 

47
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,190
martial arts. There are traditions that
don't do movements and within within our

48
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
don't do movements and within within our
 

49
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,749
don't do movements and within within our
overall Buddha there are those actual

50
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
overall Buddha there are those actual
 

51
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,310
overall Buddha there are those actual
exercises and drills where you don't

52
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
exercises and drills where you don't
 

53
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,190
exercises and drills where you don't
move and you definitely aren't doing

54
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
move and you definitely aren't doing
 

55
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,550
move and you definitely aren't doing
martial stuff.

56
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
martial stuff.
 

57
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,429
martial stuff.
What what you have to understand is you

58
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
What what you have to understand is you
 

59
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,749
What what you have to understand is you
can do this technology of self

60
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
can do this technology of self
 

61
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,149
can do this technology of self
without having to be marshall without

62
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
without having to be marshall without
 

63
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,749
without having to be marshall without
doing the marshall.

64
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759

 

65
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,469

And I've said that many times. So

66
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
And I've said that many times. So
 

67
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,310
And I've said that many times. So
drill number one is a stillness silence

68
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
drill number one is a stillness silence
 

69
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,789
drill number one is a stillness silence
drill. That's your key practice.

70
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799

 

71
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,589

Um servitude.

72
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
Um servitude.
 

73
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,390
Um servitude.
I'm not fighting people. I'm serving

74
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
I'm not fighting people. I'm serving
 

75
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,070
I'm not fighting people. I'm serving
people

76
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
people
 

77
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,830
people
is the key on selfing practice.

78
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840

 

79
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,150

So again, it begs the question, why the

80
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
So again, it begs the question, why the
 

81
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,510
So again, it begs the question, why the
marshall?

82
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520

 

83
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,550

And the reason you do the marshall

84
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
And the reason you do the marshall
 

85
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,589
And the reason you do the marshall
is because the marshall is a

86
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
is because the marshall is a
 

87
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,589
is because the marshall is a
confirmation

88
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
confirmation
 

89
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,070
confirmation
exercise, a confirmation field.

90
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080

 

91
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,910

I don't think anybody alive today

92
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
I don't think anybody alive today
 

93
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,670
I don't think anybody alive today
should be surprised

94
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680

 

95
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,869

that while there are

96
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
that while there are
 

97
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,110
that while there are
mysticisms

98
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
mysticisms
 

99
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,589
mysticisms
that use silence and stillness and that

100
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:55,599
that use silence and stillness and that
 

101
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,430
that use silence and stillness and that
not do not have a marshall component.

102
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
not do not have a marshall component.
 

103
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,990
not do not have a marshall component.
There's a lot of [\h__\h] liars in those

104
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
There's a lot of [\h__\h] liars in those
 

105
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,990
There's a lot of [\h__\h] liars in those
traditions.

106
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
traditions.
 

107
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,190
traditions.
There's a lot of people that on the

108
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
There's a lot of people that on the
 

109
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,190
There's a lot of people that on the
outside

110
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
outside
 

111
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,990
outside
are saying and proclaiming one thing,

112
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
are saying and proclaiming one thing,
 

113
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,750
are saying and proclaiming one thing,
but on the inside are every bit as

114
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
but on the inside are every bit as
 

115
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,470
but on the inside are every bit as
demonpossessed as someone not

116
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
demonpossessed as someone not
 

117
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,550
demonpossessed as someone not
proclaiming their mysticism.

118
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
proclaiming their mysticism.
 

119
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,710
proclaiming their mysticism.
So, your Marshall

120
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
So, your Marshall
 

121
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,670
So, your Marshall
environment

122
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
environment
 

123
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,309
environment
is one wherein

124
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
is one wherein
 

125
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,750
is one wherein
we're going to put you to the test.

there's a
a line

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,189
[\h__\h] okay I'm going to do that later.
I'm gonna get to that later. Do you see

246
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
I'm gonna get to that later. Do you see
 

247
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:36,309
I'm gonna get to that later. Do you see
that's that's not the practice.

248
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319

 

249
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,510

But you can kind of get away with it, so

250
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
But you can kind of get away with it, so
 

251
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,270
But you can kind of get away with it, so
to speak.

to speak.
 

253
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,670
to speak.
You you you can think in your mind that

00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
You you you can think in your mind that
 

255
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,430
You you you can think in your mind that

257
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,430

But now you got a good reason. And

258
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
But now you got a good reason. And
 

259
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,350
But now you got a good reason. And
that's the ego tripartite mind. You got

260
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
that's the ego tripartite mind. You got
 

261
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,590
that's the ego tripartite mind. You got
a good reason now why I can't say yes

262
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:53,600
a good reason now why I can't say yes
 

263
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,710
a good reason now why I can't say yes

264
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
now, but I'll say yes in a little bit.
 

265
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,589
now, but I'll say yes in a little bit.
Do you see?

266
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
Do you see?
 

267
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,550
Do you see?
Well, there's no such window of

268
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
Well, there's no such window of
 

269
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,029
Well, there's no such window of
self-d delusion in the combative

270
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
self-d delusion in the combative
 

271
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,230
self-d delusion in the combative
engagement. It's over. It's over by the

272
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
engagement. It's over. It's over by the
 

273
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,830
engagement. It's over. It's over by the
time

274
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
time
 

275
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,430
time
your ego tripartite mind manipulates the

276
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
your ego tripartite mind manipulates the
 

277
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,189
your ego tripartite mind manipulates the
situation where you come out favorable.

278
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
situation where you come out favorable.
 

279
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,070
situation where you come out favorable.
Okay. You either released and unself or

280
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
Okay. You either released and unself or
 

281
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,550
Okay. You either released and unself or
you didn't.

282
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
you didn't.
 

283
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,749
you didn't.
So that that's why we do what we do. Why

284
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
So that that's why we do what we do. Why
 

285
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,990
So that that's why we do what we do. Why
there is a buddo?

286
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
there is a buddo?
 

287
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,189
there is a buddo?
Why there is a marshall aspect and also

288
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
Why there is a marshall aspect and also
 

289
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,870
Why there is a marshall aspect and also
why your marshall aspect itself

290
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880
why your marshall aspect itself
 

291
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,510
why your marshall aspect itself
cannot be based in delusion which means

292
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
cannot be based in delusion which means
 

293
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,550
cannot be based in delusion which means
why it must be functional practical real

294
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
why it must be functional practical real
 

295
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,469
why it must be functional practical real
and this is the real spiritual problem

296
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
and this is the real spiritual problem
 

297
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,150
and this is the real spiritual problem
with the choreographed ukare

298
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
with the choreographed ukare
 

299
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,070
with the choreographed ukare
I don't have a confirmation field in

300
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
I don't have a confirmation field in
 

301
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,430
I don't have a confirmation field in
there that's not going to tell me

302
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
there that's not going to tell me
 

303
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,990
there that's not going to tell me
anything and when I say that modern

304
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
anything and when I say that modern
 

305
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,309
anything and when I say that modern
ukami is a icipation of the ego

306
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
ukami is a icipation of the ego
 

307
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,110
ukami is a icipation of the ego
tripartite mind.

308
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
tripartite mind.
 

309
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,589
tripartite mind.
That's exactly what I mean. So modern

310
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
That's exactly what I mean. So modern
 

311
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,589
That's exactly what I mean. So modern
modern UKI

312
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
modern UKI
 

313
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,749
modern UKI
is just will to power dichotomy

314
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
is just will to power dichotomy
 

315
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,950
is just will to power dichotomy
uh delusion lying. Do you see? And so it

316
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
uh delusion lying. Do you see? And so it
 

317
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,629
uh delusion lying. Do you see? And so it
has no spiritual value.

318
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639

 

319
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,469

Does this make sense?

320
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479

 

321
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,150

So what I want to do here is

322
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
So what I want to do here is
 

323
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,189
So what I want to do here is
just briefly show you

324
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
just briefly show you
 

325
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,310
just briefly show you
um things that are should have been

326
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
um things that are should have been
 

327
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,550
um things that are should have been
obvious to anybody who's trying to

328
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
obvious to anybody who's trying to
 

329
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,750
obvious to anybody who's trying to
operate at this level of confirmation

330
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
operate at this level of confirmation
 

331
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,790
operate at this level of confirmation
but isn't because modern iikido has

332
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
but isn't because modern iikido has
 

333
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,230
but isn't because modern iikido has
assured it and replaced it with selfing

334
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
assured it and replaced it with selfing
 

335
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,910
assured it and replaced it with selfing
practices.

336
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
practices.
 

337
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,870

Okay. uh and one of those is a tami.

338
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
Okay. uh and one of those is a tami.
 

339

Okay. uh and one of those is a tami.
The idea is that if my technique stalls

340
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
The idea is that if my technique stalls
 

341
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,110
The idea is that if my technique stalls
then I do a tami and then I'm

346
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
And within that idea
 

347
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,110

351
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,030
kind of
substitutability

352
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040

beat the [\h__\h] out of you every time you
did it every time you did it. Okay, so

496
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
did it every time you did it. Okay, so
 

497
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,550
did it every time you did it. Okay, so
you had to learn how not to do it um

498
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
you had to learn how not to do it um
 

499
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,230
you had to learn how not to do it um
right there and then. And there was no

500
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
right there and then. And there was no
 

501
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,870
right there and then. And there was no
I'm doing it. You there was no I doing

502
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
I'm doing it. You there was no I doing
 

503
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,350
I'm doing it. You there was no I doing
it because you got the [\h__\h] beat out of

504
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
it because you got the [\h__\h] beat out of
 

505
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,030
it because you got the [\h__\h] beat out of
you and you're dead on the mat and the

506
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
you and you're dead on the mat and the
 

507
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,190
you and you're dead on the mat and the
40-year-old is walking out happy as can

508
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,200
40-year-old is walking out happy as can
 

509
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,910
40-year-old is walking out happy as can
be to go play tennis or whatever he was

00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
be to go play tennis or whatever he was
 

511
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,310
be to go play tennis or whatever he was
going to do. Okay.

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
going to do. Okay.
 

513
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,110
going to do. Okay.
Um,

514
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
Um,
 

515
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,190
Um,
and in that environment of all these

516
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
and in that environment of all these
 

517
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,910
and in that environment of all these
different people trying to get past

518
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920
different people trying to get past
 

519
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,790
different people trying to get past
style, which is not was not a new idea

520
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
style, which is not was not a new idea
 

521
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,590
style, which is not was not a new idea
to martial arts even then, everyone knew

522
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
to martial arts even then, everyone knew
 

523
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,150
to martial arts even then, everyone knew
about Bruce Lee and his protest against

524
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
about Bruce Lee and his protest against
 

525
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,030
about Bruce Lee and his protest against
style. Um,

526
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
style. Um,
 

527
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,870
style. Um,
people knew that. That's why my

528
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
people knew that. That's why my
 

529
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,590
people knew that. That's why my
instructor then had this open sparring.

530
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
instructor then had this open sparring.
 

531
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,389
instructor then had this open sparring.
You fight everybody. Uh, and that's why

532
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
You fight everybody. Uh, and that's why
 

533
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,470
You fight everybody. Uh, and that's why
everyone in there was borrowing and

534
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,480
everyone in there was borrowing and
 

535
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,430
everyone in there was borrowing and
stealing from each other uh, in the goal

536
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
stealing from each other uh, in the goal
 

537
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,470
stealing from each other uh, in the goal
to try to not get your ass kicked for an

538
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480
to try to not get your ass kicked for an
 

539
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,310
to try to not get your ass kicked for an
hour and a half or two hours. Okay.

540
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
hour and a half or two hours. Okay.
 

541
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,069
hour and a half or two hours. Okay.
Um,

542
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079

 

543
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,710

as a confirmation field, you you can

544
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
as a confirmation field, you you can
 

545
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,389
as a confirmation field, you you can
learn what is what is delusion, what is

546
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
learn what is what is delusion, what is
 

547
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,870
learn what is what is delusion, what is
not delusion.

548
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
not delusion.
 

549
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,350
not delusion.
As the cushion has no confirmation field

550
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
As the cushion has no confirmation field
 

551
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,990
As the cushion has no confirmation field
to it, you don't learn that. You get to

552
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
to it, you don't learn that. You get to
 

553
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,189
to it, you don't learn that. You get to
just say that. And as modern iikido has

554
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
just say that. And as modern iikido has
 

555
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,470
just say that. And as modern iikido has
no confirmation field to it, again, they

556
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,480
no confirmation field to it, again, they
 

557
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,509
no confirmation field to it, again, they
just say it. They don't confirm whether

558
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
just say it. They don't confirm whether
 

559
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,750
just say it. They don't confirm whether
it's true or not. So then they come up

560
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
it's true or not. So then they come up
 

561
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,949
it's true or not. So then they come up
with ego tripartite mind derived ideas

562
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
with ego tripartite mind derived ideas
 

563
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,509
with ego tripartite mind derived ideas
such as striking and throwing are

564
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
such as striking and throwing are
 

565
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,430
such as striking and throwing are
substitutable. They don't understand.

566
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
substitutable. They don't understand.
 

567
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,189
substitutable. They don't understand.
They're not substitutable. Okay.

568
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
They're not substitutable. Okay.
 

569
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,110
They're not substitutable. Okay.
If you remember in that environment and

570
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
If you remember in that environment and
 

571
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,990
If you remember in that environment and
in that history, what happened was is I

572
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
in that history, what happened was is I
 

573
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,990
in that history, what happened was is I
learned how to dominate mid-range

574
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
learned how to dominate mid-range
 

575
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,430
learned how to dominate mid-range
striking. But look, looking at it now is

576
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
striking. But look, looking at it now is
 

577
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,670
striking. But look, looking at it now is
that's all that happened. There was a

578
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
that's all that happened. There was a
 

579
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,389
that's all that happened. There was a
higher propensity towards mid-range

580
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
higher propensity towards mid-range
 

581
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,990
higher propensity towards mid-range
striking.

582
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
striking.
 

583
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,350
striking.
Um, not really because of style per se,

584
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
Um, not really because of style per se,
 

585
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,949
Um, not really because of style per se,
but just for the nature of the

586
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:44,959
but just for the nature of the
 

587
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,189
but just for the nature of the
environment. So, for example, there was

588
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
environment. So, for example, there was
 

589
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,949
environment. So, for example, there was
no weapons,

590
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
no weapons,
 

591
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,389
no weapons,
right? and there's no multiple

592
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
right? and there's no multiple
 

593
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,710
right? and there's no multiple
attackers. Well, then the safest thing

594
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
attackers. Well, then the safest thing
 

595
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,870
attackers. Well, then the safest thing
to do is stay in mid-range and dominate

596
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
to do is stay in mid-range and dominate
 

597
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,350
to do is stay in mid-range and dominate
mid-range until you gain initiative and

598
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
mid-range until you gain initiative and
 

599
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,910
mid-range until you gain initiative and
then you would go in for your takedowns

600
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
then you would go in for your takedowns
 

601
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,629
then you would go in for your takedowns
and your chokes and and whatever. Uh,

602
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
and your chokes and and whatever. Uh,
 

603
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,870
and your chokes and and whatever. Uh,
that wasn't Bruce's style, though. He

604
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
that wasn't Bruce's style, though. He
 

605
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,389
that wasn't Bruce's style, though. He
would just beat the [\h__\h] out of you for

606
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
would just beat the [\h__\h] out of you for
 

607
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,870
would just beat the [\h__\h] out of you for
mid-range striking, okay? He could do

608
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
mid-range striking, okay? He could do
 

609
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,750
mid-range striking, okay? He could do
that.

610
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
that.
 

611
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,829
that.
If we had put multiple people in there

612
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
If we had put multiple people in there
 

613
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,990
If we had put multiple people in there
and we put weapons, we wouldn't have

614
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,000
and we put weapons, we wouldn't have
 

615
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,509
and we put weapons, we wouldn't have
people inclined towards staying or

616
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
people inclined towards staying or
 

617
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,670
people inclined towards staying or
centering their

618
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
centering their
 

619
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,430
centering their
art around mid-range striking. Okay.

620
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440

 

621
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,430

But when I started dominating the

622
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
But when I started dominating the
 

623
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,269
But when I started dominating the
mid-range striking with Kempo,

624
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279
mid-range striking with Kempo,
 

625
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,870
mid-range striking with Kempo,
which gives you way more angles of

626
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
which gives you way more angles of
 

627
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,670
which gives you way more angles of
attack and way more targets

628
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
attack and way more targets
 

629
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,550
attack and way more targets
uh than dirty boxing would,

630
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,560
uh than dirty boxing would,
 

631
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,030
uh than dirty boxing would,
people started trying to get around

632
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,040
people started trying to get around
 

633
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,590
people started trying to get around
that. And the way they got around it was

634
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
that. And the way they got around it was
 

635
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,269
that. And the way they got around it was
just bum rush through mid-range

636
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
just bum rush through mid-range
 

637
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,910
just bum rush through mid-range
striking.

638
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:51,920
striking.
 

639
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,230
striking.
And

640
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
And
 

641
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,790
And
the reason that worked is because I

642
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
the reason that worked is because I
 

643
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,310
the reason that worked is because I
couldn't strike them while they're

644
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
couldn't strike them while they're
 

645
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,550
couldn't strike them while they're
bumrushing me.

646
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
bumrushing me.
 

647
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,749
bumrushing me.
And that tells you that you can't strike

648
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759
And that tells you that you can't strike
 

649
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,829
And that tells you that you can't strike
where you could throw. It just doesn't

650
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
where you could throw. It just doesn't
 

651
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,389
where you could throw. It just doesn't
happen. Okay? If you could strike, they

652
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
happen. Okay? If you could strike, they
 

653
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,310
happen. Okay? If you could strike, they
wouldn't be bumrushing you. Okay?

654
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,320
wouldn't be bumrushing you. Okay?
 

655
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,870
wouldn't be bumrushing you. Okay?
Um and so they're not interchangeable.

656
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
Um and so they're not interchangeable.
 

657
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,910
Um and so they're not interchangeable.
Why Iikido keeps positing that idea is

658
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
Why Iikido keeps positing that idea is
 

659
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,030
Why Iikido keeps positing that idea is
for the following reasons. One, they

660
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
for the following reasons. One, they
 

661
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,350
for the following reasons. One, they
don't understand that Kihon Waza is not

662
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
don't understand that Kihon Waza is not
 

663
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,310
don't understand that Kihon Waza is not
a self-defense technique. It is it is a

664
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,320
a self-defense technique. It is it is a
 

665
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,949
a self-defense technique. It is it is a
a form technology. And what I mean by

666
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
a form technology. And what I mean by
 

667
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,910
a form technology. And what I mean by
that is

668
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
that is
 

669
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,670
that is
these are mimmonic devices that allow

670
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
these are mimmonic devices that allow
 

671
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,430
these are mimmonic devices that allow
information to be passed through

672
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
information to be passed through
 

673
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,829
information to be passed through
history.

674
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
history.
 

675
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,150

So if you have a form for example a so a

680
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
So if you have a form for example a so a
 

681
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,030
So if you have a form for example a so a
solo form

682
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
solo form
 

683
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,030
solo form
um

684
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,040
um
 

685
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,949
um
you have all this hidden information in

686
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
you have all this hidden information in
 

687
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,750
you have all this hidden information in
the solo form that as you get more

688
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
the solo form that as you get more
 

689
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,630
the solo form that as you get more
understanding of the form you start

690
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:10,640
understanding of the form you start
 

691
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,150
understanding of the form you start
realizing

692
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160
realizing
 

693
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,390
realizing
um that for example that's not an inward

694
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
um that for example that's not an inward
 

695
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,669
um that for example that's not an inward
block and a reverse punch. So the short

696
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
block and a reverse punch. So the short
 

697
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,949
block and a reverse punch. So the short
form one in or short or long form one in

698
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
form one in or short or long form one in
 

699
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,270
form one in or short or long form one in
kempo was step back inward block and uh

700
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
kempo was step back inward block and uh
 

701
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,909
kempo was step back inward block and uh
reverse punch and you did it at all the

702
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:31,919
reverse punch and you did it at all the
 

703
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,310
reverse punch and you did it at all the
cardinal directions very much like hapo

704
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
cardinal directions very much like hapo
 

705
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,750
cardinal directions very much like hapo
giddy. Okay make understand

706
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
giddy. Okay make understand
 

707
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,990
giddy. Okay make understand
>> okay and so you as a beginner

708
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
>> okay and so you as a beginner
 

709
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,310
>> okay and so you as a beginner
>> you that you think that you had an

710
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,320
>> you that you think that you had an
 

711
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,909
>> you that you think that you had an
inward block. So he did a straight

712
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:45,919
inward block. So he did a straight
 

713
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,310
inward block. So he did a straight
punch, right? It would be right here.

714
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
punch, right? It would be right here.
 

715
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,350
punch, right? It would be right here.
And you would go here. Boom. Boom. Do do

716
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
And you would go here. Boom. Boom. Do do
 

717
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,750
And you would go here. Boom. Boom. Do do
you get the idea? And so you you think

718
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
you get the idea? And so you you think
 

719
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,590
you get the idea? And so you you think
you that's what the form is. Um and then

720
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:57,600
you that's what the form is. Um and then
 

721
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,990
you that's what the form is. Um and then
eventually you'd go to Mr. Parker. Like

722
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
eventually you'd go to Mr. Parker. Like
 

723
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,029
eventually you'd go to Mr. Parker. Like
I trained with Mr. Parker and then he

724
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:03,039
I trained with Mr. Parker and then he
 

725
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,950
I trained with Mr. Parker and then he
would have the master key to unlock this

726
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
would have the master key to unlock this
 

727
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,350
would have the master key to unlock this
mimmonic device that took information

728
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
mimmonic device that took information
 

729
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,990
mimmonic device that took information
and passed it through history. And you

730
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,000
and passed it through history. And you
 

731
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,549
and passed it through history. And you
you realize boom this is this was a

732
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:14,559
you realize boom this is this was a
 

733
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,950
you realize boom this is this was a
block a break on there then then

734
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
block a break on there then then
 

735
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,190
block a break on there then then
followed by a a rib shot. Do you see

736
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
followed by a a rib shot. Do you see
 

737
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,350
followed by a a rib shot. Do you see
that where no one saw that first cuz

738
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
that where no one saw that first cuz
 

739
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,510
that where no one saw that first cuz
everyone went here

740
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
everyone went here
 

741
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,470
everyone went here
right and then he would do the next time

742
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
right and then he would do the next time
 

743
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,150
right and then he would do the next time
that's actually a neck crank in there

744
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,160
that's actually a neck crank in there
 

745
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,230
that's actually a neck crank in there
and this on and they start putting it in

746
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
and this on and they start putting it in
 

747
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,710
and this on and they start putting it in
everywhere. Okay.

748
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
everywhere. Okay.
 

749
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,230
everywhere. Okay.
Um,

750
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
Um,
 

751
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,630
Um,
and then the fool thinks, "Oh, it's a

752
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:36,640
and then the fool thinks, "Oh, it's a
 

753
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,909
and then the fool thinks, "Oh, it's a
block or it's a break." Not realizing it

754
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
block or it's a break." Not realizing it
 

755
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,430
block or it's a break." Not realizing it
could be pretty much whatever you need

756
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
could be pretty much whatever you need
 

757
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,310
could be pretty much whatever you need
it to be. Um,

758
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
it to be. Um,
 

759
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,789
it to be. Um,
because it's just working on rotation

760
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799
because it's just working on rotation
 

761
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,870
because it's just working on rotation
and counter rotation. It's working on

762
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:48,880
and counter rotation. It's working on
 

763
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,029
and counter rotation. It's working on
forward and reverse motion and how they

764
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
forward and reverse motion and how they
 

765
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,510
forward and reverse motion and how they
complement each other. It's it's working

766
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
complement each other. It's it's working
 

767
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,350
complement each other. It's it's working
on these concepts. Do you see? Um, so if

768
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,360
on these concepts. Do you see? Um, so if
 

769
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,230
on these concepts. Do you see? Um, so if
you have a form and you're doing like uh

770
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,240
you have a form and you're doing like uh
 

771
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,470
you have a form and you're doing like uh
a technique uh like this, do you see?

772
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:06,480
a technique uh like this, do you see?
 

773
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,470
a technique uh like this, do you see?
And then you go here. It doesn't

774
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
And then you go here. It doesn't
 

775
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,750
And then you go here. It doesn't
necessarily mean that that's your line,

776
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
necessarily mean that that's your line,
 

777
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,029
necessarily mean that that's your line,
that's your story, that's your

778
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
that's your story, that's your
 

779
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,270
that's your story, that's your
narrative. When someone grabs you, you

780
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
narrative. When someone grabs you, you
 

781
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,669
narrative. When someone grabs you, you
step out and you punch him and then you

782
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:17,679
step out and you punch him and then you
 

783
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,430
step out and you punch him and then you
go here. It's just information like bop.

784
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,440
go here. It's just information like bop.
 

785
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,430
go here. It's just information like bop.
That could be the damn end of the

786
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
That could be the damn end of the
 

787
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,590
That could be the damn end of the
technique. Now the mimmonic device is

788
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,600
technique. Now the mimmonic device is
 

789
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,190
technique. Now the mimmonic device is
going to go okay when you're in this

790
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,200
going to go okay when you're in this
 

791
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,630
going to go okay when you're in this
situation. You have this much lean here

792
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:30,640
situation. You have this much lean here
 

793
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,350
situation. You have this much lean here
and he's here. That's when you can come

794
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
and he's here. That's when you can come
 

795
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,350
and he's here. That's when you can come
in and do it. It's not necessarily the

796
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,360
in and do it. It's not necessarily the
 

797
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,150
in and do it. It's not necessarily the
case that the strike meant to go with

798
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
case that the strike meant to go with
 

799
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,150
case that the strike meant to go with
the grappling. Do you get? It's just

800
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
the grappling. Do you get? It's just
 

801
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,390
the grappling. Do you get? It's just
here's more information that we can pass

802
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:42,400
here's more information that we can pass
 

803
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,470
here's more information that we can pass
down through space. Okay? And people

804
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
down through space. Okay? And people
 

805
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,150
down through space. Okay? And people
don't understand that about forms

806
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
don't understand that about forms
 

807
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,230
don't understand that about forms
training anymore. They don't understand

808
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
training anymore. They don't understand
 

809
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,070
training anymore. They don't understand
that pri prior civilizations

810
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
that pri prior civilizations
 

811
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,630
that pri prior civilizations
did not have uh databases and video

812
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
did not have uh databases and video
 

813
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,510
did not have uh databases and video
libraries and things like that and a lot

814
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,520
libraries and things like that and a lot
 

815
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,150
libraries and things like that and a lot
of it wasn't even written down. Uh you

816
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,160
of it wasn't even written down. Uh you
 

817
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,470
of it wasn't even written down. Uh you
just memorize this and then the

818
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
just memorize this and then the
 

819
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,830
just memorize this and then the
instructor pulls out the system for you

820
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:07,840
instructor pulls out the system for you
 

821
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,950
instructor pulls out the system for you
as you're practicing. Okay.

822
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
as you're practicing. Okay.
 

823
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,789
as you're practicing. Okay.
So,

824
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
So,
 

825
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,630
So,
I don't even know if O sensei understood

826
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
I don't even know if O sensei understood
 

827
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,789
I don't even know if O sensei understood
that to tell you the truth because for

828
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
that to tell you the truth because for
 

829
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,350
that to tell you the truth because for
example, I'm telling you the truth. You

830
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
example, I'm telling you the truth. You
 

831
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,110
example, I'm telling you the truth. You
can't do the strike where you would do

832
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,120
can't do the strike where you would do
 

833
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,590
can't do the strike where you would do
the throw. It's one or the one or the

834
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,600
the throw. It's one or the one or the
 

835
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,870
the throw. It's one or the one or the
other. Okay. Um, and he I don't know how

836
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
other. Okay. Um, and he I don't know how
 

837
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,669
other. Okay. Um, and he I don't know how
everyone that worked after him

838
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
everyone that worked after him
 

839
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,990
everyone that worked after him
got the delusion

840
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
got the delusion
 

841
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,710
got the delusion
without him not correcting them. Do Do

842
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
without him not correcting them. Do Do
 

843
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,789
without him not correcting them. Do Do
you get So, I don't did why didn't he

844
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:38,799
you get So, I don't did why didn't he
 

845
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,870
you get So, I don't did why didn't he
correct them? Maybe he didn't know.

846
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:40,880
correct them? Maybe he didn't know.
 

847
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,669
correct them? Maybe he didn't know.
Maybe by his time he's still doing

848
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:43,679
Maybe by his time he's still doing
 

849
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,149
Maybe by his time he's still doing
forms. But if you look at when he's

850
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:46,159
forms. But if you look at when he's
 

851
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,029
forms. But if you look at when he's
doing live training, he's not throwing

852
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,039
doing live training, he's not throwing
 

853
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,110
doing live training, he's not throwing
the ATM in there. He's just going on

854
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
the ATM in there. He's just going on
 

855
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,350
the ATM in there. He's just going on
with the throw. And no one goes

856
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
with the throw. And no one goes
 

857
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,029
with the throw. And no one goes
um no one says, "Where the [\h__\h] are the

858
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
um no one says, "Where the [\h__\h] are the
 

859
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,350
um no one says, "Where the [\h__\h] are the
strikes?

860
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360
strikes?
 

861
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,230
strikes?
Why aren't you doing the strikes?" Okay.

862
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240

 

863
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,750

So

864
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
So
 

865
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,510
So
to show how they're not

866
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
to show how they're not
 

867
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,750
to show how they're not
substitutable

868
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
substitutable
 

869
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,070
substitutable
and that they're one or the other even

870
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
and that they're one or the other even
 

871
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,950
and that they're one or the other even
if a form looks like it has it in there.

872
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
if a form looks like it has it in there.
 

873
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,070
if a form looks like it has it in there.
Uh we're going to do an exercise from uh

874
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,080
Uh we're going to do an exercise from uh
 

875
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,830
Uh we're going to do an exercise from uh
Rav's video. Okay. So we're doing the

876
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
Rav's video. Okay. So we're doing the
 

877
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,350
Rav's video. Okay. So we're doing the
oshidto. All right. And we have this

878
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
oshidto. All right. And we have this
 

879
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,110
oshidto. All right. And we have this
strike right here. Okay.

880
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
strike right here. Okay.
 

881
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,590
strike right here. Okay.
Uh,

882
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
Uh,
 

883
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,430
Uh,
he's coming around, right? Boom.

884
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
he's coming around, right? Boom.
 

885
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,549
he's coming around, right? Boom.
What do you What's it doing?

886
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
What do you What's it doing?
 

887
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,750
What do you What's it doing?
What's it do? It's stopping his motion.

888
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:45,760
What's it do? It's stopping his motion.
 

889
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,870
What's it do? It's stopping his motion.
Okay. And I need that centrifugal energy

890
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880
Okay. And I need that centrifugal energy
 

891
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,750
Okay. And I need that centrifugal energy
to uh

892
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
to uh
 

893
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,510
to uh
get my I adhesion and my spiral rotation

894
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520
get my I adhesion and my spiral rotation
 

895
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,990
get my I adhesion and my spiral rotation
of the fight. Do you understand? So if

896
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,000
of the fight. Do you understand? So if
 

897
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,750
of the fight. Do you understand? So if
if we come around here and I hit here

898
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
if we come around here and I hit here
 

899
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,190
if we come around here and I hit here
and he stops, well now you're in

900
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200
and he stops, well now you're in
 

901
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,070
and he stops, well now you're in
mid-range striking. Do you see? So

902
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,080
mid-range striking. Do you see? So
 

903
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,630
mid-range striking. Do you see? So
here's where

904
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:14,640
here's where
 

905
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,630
here's where
you would go on from there. That's what

906
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
you would go on from there. That's what
 

907
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,390
you would go on from there. That's what
you would do. The fight stopped. It's

908
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,400
you would do. The fight stopped. It's
 

909
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,789
you would do. The fight stopped. It's
now open again to mid-range striking.

910
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
now open again to mid-range striking.
 

911
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,950
now open again to mid-range striking.
Okay.

912
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:22,960
Okay.
 

913
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,110
Okay.
Um

914
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
Um
 

915
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,110
Um
but let's say he's coming around. Boom.

916
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,120
but let's say he's coming around. Boom.
 

917
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,789
but let's say he's coming around. Boom.
and come around for the hand.

918
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
and come around for the hand.
 

919
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,470
and come around for the hand.
>> Okay, he's coming around. Boom. And

920
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,480
>> Okay, he's coming around. Boom. And
 

921
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,830
>> Okay, he's coming around. Boom. And
where'd he go on that little strike? He

922
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
where'd he go on that little strike? He
 

923
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,310
where'd he go on that little strike? He
He went boom. Do you see that?

924
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320
He went boom. Do you see that?
 

925
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,750
He went boom. Do you see that?
>> And so his that energy is now counter to

926
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:45,760
>> And so his that energy is now counter to
 

927
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,789
>> And so his that energy is now counter to
this energy. Do you see that? So um

928
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:50,799
this energy. Do you see that? So um
 

929
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,909
this energy. Do you see that? So um
so as he's coming around

930
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:53,919
so as he's coming around
 

931
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:05,029
so as he's coming around
and um

932
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:05,039

 

933
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,110

take some things to heart now I'm not

934
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120
take some things to heart now I'm not
 

935
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,669
take some things to heart now I'm not
throwing it my hardest or my insides

936
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:09,679
throwing it my hardest or my insides
 

937
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,310
throwing it my hardest or my insides
will blow out but it sent him that way

938
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
will blow out but it sent him that way
 

939
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,390
will blow out but it sent him that way
it it's going to be crazy Now, as we'll

940
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
it it's going to be crazy Now, as we'll
 

941
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,789
it it's going to be crazy Now, as we'll
come back, you know, right here, just

942
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:20,799
come back, you know, right here, just
 

943
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,669
come back, you know, right here, just
right there. It's going to be crazy to

944
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
right there. It's going to be crazy to
 

945
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,190
right there. It's going to be crazy to
go like this. Do you see that? That's a

946
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200
go like this. Do you see that? That's a
 

947
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,110
go like this. Do you see that? That's a
yongyang clash there that you wouldn't

948
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,120
yongyang clash there that you wouldn't
 

949
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,070
yongyang clash there that you wouldn't
do that. Okay. Um, couple things. Why

950
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
do that. Okay. Um, couple things. Why
 

951
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,870
do that. Okay. Um, couple things. Why
does it look like it works?

952
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
does it look like it works?
 

953
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,549
does it look like it works?
One, we don't understand the need for

954
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
One, we don't understand the need for
 

955
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,110
One, we don't understand the need for
centrial centrifugal energy in adhesion

956
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
centrial centrifugal energy in adhesion
 

957
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,590
centrial centrifugal energy in adhesion
and cook in ike and ki. We don't we

958
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,600
and cook in ike and ki. We don't we
 

959
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,190
and cook in ike and ki. We don't we
don't even know about it. We're just

960
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
don't even know about it. We're just
 

961
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,789
don't even know about it. We're just
going to do linking. Okay. Uh two, we

962
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
going to do linking. Okay. Uh two, we
 

963
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,310
going to do linking. Okay. Uh two, we
actually can't throw the strike to

964
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
actually can't throw the strike to
 

965
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,070
actually can't throw the strike to
displace that guy. Okay. Um

966
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,080
displace that guy. Okay. Um
 

967
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,470
displace that guy. Okay. Um
and then three, we don't throw the

968
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:00,480
and then three, we don't throw the
 

969
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,789
and then three, we don't throw the
strike. So the guy's just there,

970
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:04,799
strike. So the guy's just there,
 

971
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,350
strike. So the guy's just there,
right? You're just here.

972
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
right? You're just here.
 

973
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,750
right? You're just here.
>> There's no displacement. Do do you see

974
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
>> There's no displacement. Do do you see
 

975
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,470
>> There's no displacement. Do do you see
that?

976
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,480
that?
 

977
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:18,789
that?
>> But displacement. Boom. And he's not

978
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:18,799

 

979
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,590

going the other way. Okay. So, throwing

980
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
going the other way. Okay. So, throwing
 

981
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,029
going the other way. Okay. So, throwing
it throwing it a little harder that

982
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,039
it throwing it a little harder that
 

983
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,350
it throwing it a little harder that
time. And you can see the effect of the

984
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,360
time. And you can see the effect of the
 

985
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,590
time. And you can see the effect of the
strike if it was an actual real strike

986
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,600
strike if it was an actual real strike
 

987
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,830
strike if it was an actual real strike
takes him out of the technique. Do do

988
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:31,840
takes him out of the technique. Do do
 

989
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,230
takes him out of the technique. Do do
you guys see that? Um, now if he uh if

990
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,240
you guys see that? Um, now if he uh if
 

991
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,669
you guys see that? Um, now if he uh if
you keep going really hard

992
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
you keep going really hard
 

993
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,870
you keep going really hard
>> for the other hand, Let me put it to you

994
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:44,880
>> for the other hand, Let me put it to you
 

995
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,630
>> for the other hand, Let me put it to you
as engineers. What do you think you're

996
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:46,640
as engineers. What do you think you're
 

997
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,909
as engineers. What do you think you're
going to see?

998
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:47,919
going to see?
 

999
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,710
going to see?
>> Strike.

1000
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,720
>> Strike.
 

1001
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,950
>> Strike.
>> The strike is going to be smothered. So,

1002
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:50,960
>> The strike is going to be smothered. So,
 

1003
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,710
>> The strike is going to be smothered. So,
the way to protect yourself on this

1004
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,720
the way to protect yourself on this
 

1005
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,870
the way to protect yourself on this
strike, just do the actual attack. Okay.

1006
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:58,880

 

1007
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,190

He started pushing on that side right

1008
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
He started pushing on that side right
 

1009
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,190
He started pushing on that side right
away. Okay. Um, hence they're not

1010
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,200
away. Okay. Um, hence they're not
 

1011
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,510
away. Okay. Um, hence they're not
interchangeable. If you were able to get

1012
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:07,520
interchangeable. If you were able to get
 

1013
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,110
interchangeable. If you were able to get
the strike, you're going to knock him

1014
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,120
the strike, you're going to knock him
 

1015
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,190
the strike, you're going to knock him
out of the technique and you should just

1016
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200
out of the technique and you should just
 

1017
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,950
out of the technique and you should just
go on with the other stuff. Okay, make

1018
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:14,960
go on with the other stuff. Okay, make
 

1019
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,269
go on with the other stuff. Okay, make
sense? Okay, so let's have you guys play

1020
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:17,279
sense? Okay, so let's have you guys play
 

1021
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,789
sense? Okay, so let's have you guys play
with

1022
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:18,799
with
 

1023
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,789
with
uh try to throw it. You're going to see

1024
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:20,799
uh try to throw it. You're going to see
 

1025
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,669
uh try to throw it. You're going to see
that's a lot of grounding. Okay. Um

1026
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:23,679
that's a lot of grounding. Okay. Um
 

1027
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,070
that's a lot of grounding. Okay. Um
because we actually don't do we don't

1028
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
because we actually don't do we don't
 

1029
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,070
because we actually don't do we don't
strike that way because it's still a

1030
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,080
strike that way because it's still a
 

1031
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,190
strike that way because it's still a
yongyang strike. Okay. That's a sucky

1032
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,200
yongyang strike. Okay. That's a sucky
 

1033
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,350
yongyang strike. Okay. That's a sucky
target also because the target

1034
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:35,360
target also because the target
 

1035
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,990
target also because the target
on terms of the weapon

1036
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
on terms of the weapon
 

1037
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,190
on terms of the weapon
is we'll just look at it here

1038
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,200
is we'll just look at it here
 

1039
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,950
is we'll just look at it here
is

1040
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
is
 

1041
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,149
is
up here on the chest area and he's on

1042
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:46,159
up here on the chest area and he's on
 

1043
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,909
up here on the chest area and he's on
the fleshy part of my arm. Okay,

1044
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
the fleshy part of my arm. Okay,
 

1045
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,029
the fleshy part of my arm. Okay,
>> that that is why it displays so much. If

1046
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:53,039
>> that that is why it displays so much. If
 

1047
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,430
>> that that is why it displays so much. If
you could ground if you could ground

1048

you could ground if you could ground
it's going to move move him. Okay. um

1050
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,200
it's going to move move him. Okay. um
 

1051
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,029

elbows to the front here. Your only

1052
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,039
elbows to the front here. Your only
 

1053
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,510
elbows to the front here. Your only
target is the is the solar plex is here

1054
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:05,520
target is the is the solar plex is here
 

1055
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,190
target is the is the solar plex is here
with the spear. Do you see that? So if I

1056
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,200
with the spear. Do you see that? So if I
 

1057
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,070
with the spear. Do you see that? So if I
I'll just do it a little light. Okay,

1058
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,080
I'll just do it a little light. Okay,
 

1059
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,390
I'll just do it a little light. Okay,
that's a soft target. That'll that'll

1060
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,400
that's a soft target. That'll that'll
 

1061
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,590
that's a soft target. That'll that'll
work. Okay, but this this one is very

1062
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
work. Okay, but this this one is very
 

1063
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,870
work. Okay, but this this one is very
much just like a shove because it got so

1064
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:20,880
much just like a shove because it got so
 

1065
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,110
much just like a shove because it got so
smothered by the target. And for that

1066
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
smothered by the target. And for that
 

1067
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,070
smothered by the target. And for that
reason, if you just attack, you'll

1068
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,080
reason, if you just attack, you'll
 

1069
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,470
reason, if you just attack, you'll
smother the strike. Okay. In other

1070
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,480
smother the strike. Okay. In other
 

1071
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,110
smother the strike. Okay. In other
words, if he if he's he's trying to

1072
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,120
words, if he if he's he's trying to
 

1073
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,590
words, if he if he's he's trying to
smother uh the You're fine. If he's

1074
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
smother uh the You're fine. If he's
 

1075
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,549
smother uh the You're fine. If he's
trying to smother that one. Got him. You

1076
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
trying to smother that one. Got him. You
 

1077
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:47,029
trying to smother that one. Got him. You
see?

1078
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:47,039

 

1079
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,549

So, that's the spear of my elbow on his

1080
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:50,559
So, that's the spear of my elbow on his
 

1081
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,350
So, that's the spear of my elbow on his
solar plexus. It It worked. Okay. Do you

1082
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,360
solar plexus. It It worked. Okay. Do you
 

1083
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,230
solar plexus. It It worked. Okay. Do you
got it? Um, so for those who don't know

1084
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,240
got it? Um, so for those who don't know
 

1085
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,310
got it? Um, so for those who don't know
what happened on on the first one, he

1086
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
what happened on on the first one, he
 

1087
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,950
what happened on on the first one, he
came head that way because you see it

1088
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:00,960
came head that way because you see it
 

1089
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,230
came head that way because you see it
closed it. That would be a miss. So on

1090
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,240
closed it. That would be a miss. So on
 

1091
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,149
closed it. That would be a miss. So on
the second rep, I knocked him on that

1092
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:06,159
the second rep, I knocked him on that
 

1093
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,470
the second rep, I knocked him on that
side and then boom, and then it goes

1094
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,480
side and then boom, and then it goes
 

1095
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,630
side and then boom, and then it goes
into the solar plex. Okay. Uh, but while

1096
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:12,640
into the solar plex. Okay. Uh, but while
 

1097
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,510
into the solar plex. Okay. Uh, but while
I got that opening,

1098
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,520
I got that opening,
 

1099
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,430
I got that opening,
you would capitalize upon it with

1100
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
you would capitalize upon it with
 

1101
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,590
you would capitalize upon it with
striking. You you wouldn't go Let's do

1102
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:19,600
striking. You you wouldn't go Let's do
 

1103
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,909
striking. You you wouldn't go Let's do
it slow. So I'm here and I hit that.

1104
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:21,919
it slow. So I'm here and I hit that.
 

1105
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,950
it slow. So I'm here and I hit that.
You're not going to go here.

we start training, uh
him coming around and smothering the

1116
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:39,039
him coming around and smothering the
 

1117
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,510
him coming around and smothering the
strike is exactly what those fighters

1118
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:41,520
strike is exactly what those fighters
 

1119
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,549
strike is exactly what those fighters
learn. Just press through mid-range

learn. Just press through mid-range
 

1121
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,350
learn. Just press through mid-range
striking and they start to smother

1122
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360
striking and they start to smother
 

1123
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,029
striking and they start to smother
stuff. Okay. So, what

1124
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:51,039
stuff. Okay. So, what
 

1125
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,710
stuff. Okay. So, what
like you're not going to like the strut.

1126
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,720
like you're not going to like the strut.
 

1127
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,070
like you're not going to like the strut.
You're I think what we're going to see

1128
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
You're I think what we're going to see
 

1129
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,149
You're I think what we're going to see
is you're going to get displaced because

1130
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:56,159
is you're going to get displaced because
 

1131
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,110
is you're going to get displaced because
you can't ground just like every modern

1132
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,120
you can't ground just like every modern
 

1133
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,269
you can't ground just like every modern
Iikido. That's that's not a that's not

1134
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:01,279
Iikido. That's that's not a that's not
 

1135
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,549
Iikido. That's that's not a that's not
an easy one to do to tell you the truth.

1136
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:04,559
an easy one to do to tell you the truth.
 

1137
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,029
an easy one to do to tell you the truth.
Um,

1138
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:07,039
Um,
 

1139
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,269
Um,
but you're still not going to like the

1140
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:09,279
but you're still not going to like the
 

1141
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,070
but you're still not going to like the
strike probably. So the the more you

1142
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,080
strike probably. So the the more you
 

1143
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,269
strike probably. So the the more you
hate the strike, just come in faster, do

1144
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:15,279
hate the strike, just come in faster, do
 

1145
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,350
hate the strike, just come in faster, do
the bum rushing, and you'll smother the

1146
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:17,360
the bum rushing, and you'll smother the
 

1147
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,230
the bum rushing, and you'll smother the
strike every single time. Okay? So,

1148
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240
strike every single time. Okay? So,
 

1149
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,990
strike every single time. Okay? So,
first like take a take a few and we're

1150
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,000
first like take a take a few and we're
 

1151
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,990
first like take a take a few and we're
probably going to see the naga move.

1152
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,000
probably going to see the naga move.
 

1153
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,230
probably going to see the naga move.
Okay? But after a while, maybe as soon

1154
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
Okay? But after a while, maybe as soon
 

1155
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,549
Okay? But after a while, maybe as soon
as you hate it or they're never going to

1156
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:32,559
as you hate it or they're never going to
 

1157
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,789
as you hate it or they're never going to
get it, then start smothering the strike

1158
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799
get it, then start smothering the strike
 

1159
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,029
get it, then start smothering the strike
by bum rushing through mid-range

1160
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
by bum rushing through mid-range
 

1161
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:48,549
by bum rushing through mid-range
striking. Okay. All right. Try it.

1162
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:48,559

 

1163
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,149

You gota you got to try to do it. You

1164
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:50,159
You gota you got to try to do it. You
 

1165
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,630
You gota you got to try to do it. You
got to try to do it.

1166
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,640
got to try to do it.
 

1167
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,710
got to try to do it.
Okay. So, here on Balchain, we don't

1168
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:54,720
Okay. So, here on Balchain, we don't
 

1169
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,190
Okay. So, here on Balchain, we don't
have enough force. There's zero effect

1170
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,200
have enough force. There's zero effect
 

1171
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,590
have enough force. There's zero effect
on it. Do do you see that? So, let's go

1172
00:28:59,590 --> 00:28:59,600
on it. Do do you see that? So, let's go
 

1173
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,029
on it. Do do you see that? So, let's go
again. You're going to try to get her.

1174
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:01,039
again. You're going to try to get her.
 

1175
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,070
again. You're going to try to get her.
You try to get her. Get her, B. No,

1176
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
You try to get her. Get her, B. No,
 

1177
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,110
You try to get her. Get her, B. No,
you're not. Okay. And and this was this

1178
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,120
you're not. Okay. And and this was this
 

1179
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,190
you're not. Okay. And and this was this
would be what would happen to most um

1180
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
would be what would happen to most um
 

1181
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,710
would be what would happen to most um
and when I say most I mean like 99.9%

1182
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:14,720
and when I say most I mean like 99.9%
 

1183
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,669
and when I say most I mean like 99.9%
of modern Iikido is they're not they

1184
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:17,679
of modern Iikido is they're not they
 

1185
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,430
of modern Iikido is they're not they
don't have the force they don't have the

1186
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:19,440
don't have the force they don't have the
 

1187
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,269
don't have the force they don't have the
force output to actually do what we

1188
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:23,279
force output to actually do what we
 

1189
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,870
force output to actually do what we
think

1190
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:24,880
think
 

1191
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,789
think
you're going to do. And what we think is

1192
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799
you're going to do. And what we think is
 

1193
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,350
you're going to do. And what we think is
you're going to be so incapacitated

1194
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:29,360
you're going to be so incapacitated
 

1195
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,070
you're going to be so incapacitated
that now I can manipulate you in that

1196
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,080
that now I can manipulate you in that
 

1197
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,389
that now I can manipulate you in that
moment of incapacitation. Do do you guys

1198
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:34,399
moment of incapacitation. Do do you guys
 

1199
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,470
moment of incapacitation. Do do you guys
understand that? That's that's what we

1200
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:36,480
understand that? That's that's what we
 

1201
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,269
understand that? That's that's what we
think is going to happen when modern

1202
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
think is going to happen when modern
 

1203
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,909
think is going to happen when modern
iikido explains a tami. Um in in law

1204
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:43,919
iikido explains a tami. Um in in law
 

1205
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,230
iikido explains a tami. Um in in law
enforcement we have the uh taser

1206
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,240
enforcement we have the uh taser
 

1207
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,070
enforcement we have the uh taser
and we teach to arrest under the

1208
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,080
and we teach to arrest under the
 

1209
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,549
and we teach to arrest under the
neuromuscular incapacitation

1210
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
neuromuscular incapacitation
 

1211
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,389
neuromuscular incapacitation
because the guy's body like right and

1212
00:29:58,389 --> 00:29:58,399
because the guy's body like right and
 

1213
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,789
because the guy's body like right and
when his body's like that you you kind

1214
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:00,799
when his body's like that you you kind
 

1215
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,950
when his body's like that you you kind
of move it around. Okay. Um, but there's

1216
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960
of move it around. Okay. Um, but there's
 

1217
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,750
of move it around. Okay. Um, but there's
no there's no incapacitation

1218
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:07,760
no there's no incapacitation
 

1219
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,630
no there's no incapacitation
on the sati on 99.9% of people is my

1220
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:12,640
on the sati on 99.9% of people is my
 

1221
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,549
on the sati on 99.9% of people is my
first point there. And on my second

1222
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:14,559
first point there. And on my second
 

1223
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,630
first point there. And on my second
point, if you could do it, it would just

1224
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:16,640
point, if you could do it, it would just
 

1225
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,830
point, if you could do it, it would just
move him out of the technique, not open

1226
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:19,840
move him out of the technique, not open
 

1227
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,909
move him out of the technique, not open
the technique. Okay. All right. So,

1228
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:21,919
the technique. Okay. All right. So,
 

1229
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,430
the technique. Okay. All right. So,
let's try it. So, that's one thing we

1230
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:23,440
let's try it. So, that's one thing we
 

1231
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,590
let's try it. So, that's one thing we
saw is that we just don't have the

1232
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,600
saw is that we just don't have the
 

1233
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,870
saw is that we just don't have the
capacity to actually infringe upon my

1234
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:28,880
capacity to actually infringe upon my
 

1235
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:44,950
capacity to actually infringe upon my
opponent. Okay. Go. Keep going.

1236
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:44,960

 

1237
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,430

And then she So you had the capacity and

1238
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,440
And then she So you had the capacity and
 

1239
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,430
And then she So you had the capacity and
it just moved her out of the technique.

1240
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
it just moved her out of the technique.
 

1241
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,630
it just moved her out of the technique.
Okay. And so you go, "Oh, let's uh

1242
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:54,640
Okay. And so you go, "Oh, let's uh
 

1243
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,350
Okay. And so you go, "Oh, let's uh
let's do the math though." Okay. Let's

1244
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,360
let's do the math though." Okay. Let's
 

1245
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,310
let's do the math though." Okay. Let's
do the physics. It's just physics. Um

1246
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:00,320
do the physics. It's just physics. Um
 

1247
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,510
do the physics. It's just physics. Um
cuz that's what's being confirmed. Uh

1248
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:03,520
cuz that's what's being confirmed. Uh
 

1249
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,029
cuz that's what's being confirmed. Uh
why did it knock her out of the

1250
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
why did it knock her out of the
 

1251
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,230
why did it knock her out of the
technique?

1252
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,240
technique?
 

1253
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,269
technique?
>> I have a lot more mass.

1254
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:07,279
>> I have a lot more mass.
 

1255
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,269
>> I have a lot more mass.
>> Yeah, he's a lot more mass than her. So

1256
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:09,279
>> Yeah, he's a lot more mass than her. So
 

1257
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,110
>> Yeah, he's a lot more mass than her. So
we up the mass

1258
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,120

 

1259
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,470

and we'll see what happens.

1260
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,480
and we'll see what happens.
 

1261
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,389
and we'll see what happens.
And he got displaced. Okay. So again,

1262
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:20,399
And he got displaced. Okay. So again,
 

1263
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,269
And he got displaced. Okay. So again,
99.9 and really that's just mathematical

1264
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:23,279
99.9 and really that's just mathematical
 

1265
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,630
99.9 and really that's just mathematical
probability. You know, it's got to be

1266
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:24,640
probability. You know, it's got to be
 

1267
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,230
probability. You know, it's got to be
someone [\h__\h] out. I don't know who

1268
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,240
someone [\h__\h] out. I don't know who
 

1269
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,190
someone [\h__\h] out. I don't know who
they are. Okay. I I've never seen them.

1270
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,200
they are. Okay. I I've never seen them.
 

1271
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,830
they are. Okay. I I've never seen them.
Okay. Uh I've seen them in even in

1272
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:31,840
Okay. Uh I've seen them in even in
 

1273
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,870
Okay. Uh I've seen them in even in
Kempo. There was only one or two people

1274
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:34,880

takes a kind of some balls right like
 

1351
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,909
takes a kind of some balls right like
because you're like that strike is there

if I run past that it's kind of
 

1361
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,630
if I run past that it's kind of

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:57,349
going to be smothered.
Yes, that's an exact Energy

00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:28,480
not going to get NMI. It's the exact
 

1405
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,910
not going to get NMI. It's the exact
opposite. Okay. Got it. Okay. So, uh

1406
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:33,920
opposite. Okay. Got it. Okay. So, uh

feel that did you see that? That was
 

1463
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,829

your hesitation there, Virginia. Okay.
This is what you didn't see in you don't

1466

This is what you didn't see in you don't
 

1467
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,990
This is what you didn't see in you don't
see in Ronin and Tristan because they

1471
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,870
don't want to get hit. Do you see that?
So, they're not going to protect

1472
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:18,880
So, they're not going to protect
 

1473
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,750
So, they're not going to protect
themselves from going out of the frying

just letting that energy
go where that energy wants to go.

go where that energy wants to go.
 

1537

go where that energy wants to go.
>> Yeah.

the I guess the falling architecture
 

1543
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,430
the I guess the falling architecture
>> like if if I tried to take it that way

1544
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:41,440
>> like if if I tried to take it that way
 

1545
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,030
>> like if if I tried to take it that way
you probably run that way.

1546
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,040
you probably run that way.
 

1547
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,829
you probably run that way.
>> Yeah.

1548
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
>> Yeah.
 

1549

to where there's a point of no return
 

1553
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,270
to where there's a point of no return
for him.

1554
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,280
for him.
 

1555
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,829
for him.
>> Yeah. He's gonna he's going to go it and

1556
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:53,839
>> Yeah. He's gonna he's going to go it and
 

1557
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,589
>> Yeah. He's gonna he's going to go it and
it's just natural. Okay. So we have we

1558
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:57,599
it's just natural. Okay. So we have we
 

1559
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,790
it's just natural. Okay. So we have we
have a senpai coohigh ranking here and

1560
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:00,800
have a senpai coohigh ranking here and
 

1561
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,670
have a senpai coohigh ranking here and
we rank that according to skill. Okay.

1562
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:03,680
we rank that according to skill. Okay.
 

1563
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,630
we rank that according to skill. Okay.
And we we know from training with each

1564
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:06,640
And we we know from training with each
 

1565
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,710
And we we know from training with each
other that out of this group he's the

1566
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:08,720
other that out of this group he's the
 

1567
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,950
other that out of this group he's the
highest at the internals. You guys kind

1568
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:10,960
highest at the internals. You guys kind
 

1569
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,790
highest at the internals. You guys kind
of trade places back and forth. You're

1570
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:12,800
of trade places back and forth. You're
 

1571
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,109
of trade places back and forth. You're
still trying to do things external.

1572
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:15,119
still trying to do things external.
 

1573
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,310
still trying to do things external.
Okay. And if we look at this allowance

1574
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:18,320
Okay. And if we look at this allowance
 

1575
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,030
Okay. And if we look at this allowance
like allow that to happen, he has an

1576
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,040
like allow that to happen, he has an
 

1577
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,190
like allow that to happen, he has an
easier time allowing it to happen and

1578
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:23,200
easier time allowing it to happen and
 

1579
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,109
easier time allowing it to happen and
it's just stupid effortless at that

1580
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:25,119
it's just stupid effortless at that
 

1581
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,750
it's just stupid effortless at that
point. Okay? And then we had to talk you

1582
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:27,760
point. Okay? And then we had to talk you
 

1583
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,390
point. Okay? And then we had to talk you
into doing it and then you guys are

1584
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:30,400
into doing it and then you guys are
 

1585
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,990
into doing it and then you guys are
pulling on their hands and trying to

1586
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,000
pulling on their hands and trying to
 

1587
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,910
pulling on their hands and trying to
make something happen. And now now the

1588
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:33,920
make something happen. And now now the
 

1589
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,790
make something happen. And now now the
technique is as bad as trying to smother

1590
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:36,800
technique is as bad as trying to smother
 

1591
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,190
technique is as bad as trying to smother
it. Okay? Why can't you manipulate it

1592
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:41,200
it. Okay? Why can't you manipulate it
 

1593
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,550
it. Okay? Why can't you manipulate it
and pull it? Uh because there's too much

1594
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:44,560
and pull it? Uh because there's too much
 

1595
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,030
and pull it? Uh because there's too much
force on it. trajectory in the same way

1596
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,040
force on it. trajectory in the same way
 

1597
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,829
force on it. trajectory in the same way
that there's too much force for that

1598
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:49,839
that there's too much force for that
 

1599
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,550
that there's too much force for that
strike to be viable. It gets smothered.

1600
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:52,560
strike to be viable. It gets smothered.
 

1601
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,630
strike to be viable. It gets smothered.
Okay? So, the same thing there's too

1602
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:54,640
Okay? So, the same thing there's too
 

1603
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,870
Okay? So, the same thing there's too
much force for you to try to change that

1604
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:56,880
much force for you to try to change that
 

1605
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,190
much force for you to try to change that
direction too radically. You're going to

1606
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,200
direction too radically. You're going to
 

1607
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,510
direction too radically. You're going to
lose connection on the grip and not

1608
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:01,520
lose connection on the grip and not
 

1609
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,510
lose connection on the grip and not
allow their attack to actually take

1610
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:03,520
allow their attack to actually take
 

1611
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,510
allow their attack to actually take
their balance as you are trying to take

1612
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:05,520
their balance as you are trying to take
 

1613
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,430
their balance as you are trying to take
their balance. Okay? There's just too

1614
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,440
their balance. Okay? There's just too
 

1615
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,109
their balance. Okay? There's just too
much force on it. Um, so this is why you

1616
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:11,119
much force on it. Um, so this is why you
 

1617
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,030
much force on it. Um, so this is why you
have to match the yong value, right? So

1618
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,040
have to match the yong value, right? So
 

1619
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,870
have to match the yong value, right? So
it's I call it you could say match the

1620
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:16,880
it's I call it you could say match the
 

1621
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,390
it's I call it you could say match the
yin. It doesn't matter. You're matching

1622
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:18,400
yin. It doesn't matter. You're matching
 

1623
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,950
yin. It doesn't matter. You're matching
the energetic value. I call it yong

1624
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:20,960
the energetic value. I call it yong
 

1625
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,790
the energetic value. I call it yong
because they're the coming in with yong

1626
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:22,800
because they're the coming in with yong
 

1627
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,870
because they're the coming in with yong
energy. So you have to match the yong

1628
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:24,880
energy. So you have to match the yong
 

1629
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,910
energy. So you have to match the yong
value which means I'm not pulling it but

1630
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:27,920
value which means I'm not pulling it but
 

1631
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,349
value which means I'm not pulling it but
if I go too weak it'll it'll collapse my

1632
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:31,359
if I go too weak it'll it'll collapse my
 

1633
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,710
if I go too weak it'll it'll collapse my
radius in this case my arm. Okay. Uh so

1634
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:34,720
radius in this case my arm. Okay. Uh so
 

1635
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,230
radius in this case my arm. Okay. Uh so
you guys are over yonging and the force

1636
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:38,240
you guys are over yonging and the force
 

1637
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,270
you guys are over yonging and the force
is too great for that. Okay. You can't

1638
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,280
is too great for that. Okay. You can't
 

1639
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,270
is too great for that. Okay. You can't
overy yong this force. You don't you

1640
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:43,280
overy yong this force. You don't you
 

1641
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,790
overy yong this force. You don't you
don't want to just let it be. Okay.

1642
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:46,800
don't want to just let it be. Okay.
 

1643
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,710
don't want to just let it be. Okay.
Uh any anything Andrew?

1644
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:50,720
Uh any anything Andrew?
 

1645
00:41:50,720 --> 00:42:00,630
Uh any anything Andrew?
>> Yeah.

1646
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:00,640

 

1647
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,349

>> Yep. Okay. And then um

1648
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:05,359
>> Yep. Okay. And then um
 

1649
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,349
>> Yep. Okay. And then um
Yeah. because you it'll get caught on

1650
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:07,359
Yeah. because you it'll get caught on
 

1651
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,550
Yeah. because you it'll get caught on
your head because you're trying to make

1652
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,560
your head because you're trying to make
 

1653
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,710
your head because you're trying to make
it do something else or you come out of

1654
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:10,720
it do something else or you come out of
 

1655
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,109
it do something else or you come out of
the grip. You can't continue the the

1656
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:13,119
the grip. You can't continue the the
 

1657
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,109
the grip. You can't continue the the
kazushi angle long enough for the

1658
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:15,119
kazushi angle long enough for the
 

1659
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,349
kazushi angle long enough for the
topsyturvy effect. Okay, all that kind

1660
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:17,359
topsyturvy effect. Okay, all that kind
 

1661
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,790
topsyturvy effect. Okay, all that kind
of stuff happens. All right. Um, now go

1662
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:20,800
of stuff happens. All right. Um, now go
 

1663
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,589
of stuff happens. All right. Um, now go
back to the selfing aspect. It takes a

1664
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:23,599
back to the selfing aspect. It takes a
 

1665
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,990
back to the selfing aspect. It takes a
lot of calming down. It takes a lot of I

1666
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,000
lot of calming down. It takes a lot of I
 

1667
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,230
lot of calming down. It takes a lot of I
don't feel attacked.

1668
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:28,240
don't feel attacked.
 

1669
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,309
don't feel attacked.
If you have a selfieing, you're going to

1670
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:30,319
If you have a selfieing, you're going to
 

1671
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,109
If you have a selfieing, you're going to
feel attacked. Okay? If you don't have a

1672
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:33,119
feel attacked. Okay? If you don't have a
 

1673
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,069
feel attacked. Okay? If you don't have a
selfie, you don't feel attacked and you

1674
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:36,079
selfie, you don't feel attacked and you
 

1675
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,069
selfie, you don't feel attacked and you
can just follow that path. If you don't

1676
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:38,079
can just follow that path. If you don't
 

1677
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,430
can just follow that path. If you don't
feel attacked, you won't try to

1678
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:39,440
feel attacked, you won't try to
 

1679
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,790
feel attacked, you won't try to
manipulate the yong energy. Okay. All

1680
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:42,800
manipulate the yong energy. Okay. All
 

1681
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,069
manipulate the yong energy. Okay. All
right.

1682
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:46,079

 

1683
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:46,870

>> Yeah.

1684
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:46,880
>> Yeah.
 

1685
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:57,510
>> Yeah.
>> One more thing.

1686
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:57,520

 

1687
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,790

>> Yeah.

1688
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:58,800
>> Yeah.
 

1689
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,390
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.

1690
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:00,400
>> Yeah.
 

1691
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,990
>> Yeah.
>> And that's what I'm talking. That's

1692
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,000
>> And that's what I'm talking. That's
 

1693
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,870
>> And that's what I'm talking. That's
that. So that's I I chalk that up as

1694
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:04,880
that. So that's I I chalk that up as
 

1695
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,510
that. So that's I I chalk that up as
fear. Not remember fear is not just

1696
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:07,520
fear. Not remember fear is not just
 

1697
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,510
fear. Not remember fear is not just
ghosts. I'm afraid of ghosts. But it's

1698
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:09,520
ghosts. I'm afraid of ghosts. But it's
 

1699
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,309
ghosts. I'm afraid of ghosts. But it's
the self that's coming in and now you

1700
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:12,319
the self that's coming in and now you
 

1701
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,109
the self that's coming in and now you
can't accept reality as it is. So you're

1702
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:15,119
can't accept reality as it is. So you're
 

1703
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,030
can't accept reality as it is. So you're
going to try to manipulate it. That's

1704
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,040
going to try to manipulate it. That's
 

1705
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,829
going to try to manipulate it. That's
the will to power. Do you see? But

1706
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:19,839
the will to power. Do you see? But
 

1707
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,750
the will to power. Do you see? But
that's not our art. That is the the

1708
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:23,760
that's not our art. That is the the
 

1709
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,870
that's not our art. That is the the
other side of nature. Okay. The demonic

1710
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:26,880
other side of nature. Okay. The demonic
 

1711
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,550
other side of nature. Okay. The demonic
side. Um, in dowist terms, it's wooue.

1712
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:32,560
side. Um, in dowist terms, it's wooue.
 

1713
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,950
side. Um, in dowist terms, it's wooue.
Uh, don't do anything. They do

1714
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:34,960
Uh, don't do anything. They do
 

1715
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,430
Uh, don't do anything. They do
something. Okay. You're trying to do

1716
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:37,440
something. Okay. You're trying to do
 

1717
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,030
something. Okay. You're trying to do
something. Not wooi. Okay. Um, and then

1718
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,040
something. Not wooi. Okay. Um, and then
 

1719
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,550
something. Not wooi. Okay. Um, and then
we see this. You're over yang in what is

1720
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:44,560
we see this. You're over yang in what is
 

1721
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,710
we see this. You're over yang in what is
already too high a yong and you can't do

1722
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:46,720
already too high a yong and you can't do
 

1723
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,670
already too high a yong and you can't do
it. Okay. Um, you want a second chance

1724
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:49,680
it. Okay. Um, you want a second chance
 

1725
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,670
it. Okay. Um, you want a second chance
at just letting just letting it go.

1726
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:51,680
at just letting just letting it go.
 

1727
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,550
at just letting just letting it go.
Okay. go back to your releasing drills

1728
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:54,560
Okay. go back to your releasing drills
 

1729
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,550
Okay. go back to your releasing drills
and don't get triggered by how much

1730
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:56,560
and don't get triggered by how much
 

1731
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,910
and don't get triggered by how much
force on the grab or anything

1732
00:43:59,910 --> 00:43:59,920
force on the grab or anything
 

1733
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,150
force on the grab or anything
and they're just going to go. Okay?

1734
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:02,160
and they're just going to go. Okay?
 

1735
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,230
and they're just going to go. Okay?
Don't you don't have to accelerate them.

1736
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:04,240
Don't you don't have to accelerate them.
 

1737
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,630
Don't you don't have to accelerate them.
They're coming in plenty hard and fast.

1738
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:06,640
They're coming in plenty hard and fast.
 

1739
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,670
They're coming in plenty hard and fast.

and then you could do it. But now what
 

1821
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,990
and then you could do it. But now what
you need to do is have a practice where

1822
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,000
you need to do is have a practice where
 

1823
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,829
you need to do is have a practice where
it never gets triggered and you don't

misnomer in modern IKEA is pain.
 

1841
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,109
misnomer in modern IKEA is pain.
Um, pain is relative,

1842
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:03,119
Um, pain is relative,
 

1843
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,550

but like every time you put your hand up
there, the modern Iikidoka treats it as

00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,200
there, the modern Iikidoka treats it as
 

1847
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,510
there, the modern Iikidoka treats it as
a universal generator of NMI, okay,

1848
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:15,520
a universal generator of NMI, okay,
 

1849
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,150
a universal generator of NMI, okay,
neuromuscular incapacitation.

1850
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:18,160
neuromuscular incapacitation.
 

1851
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,589
neuromuscular incapacitation.
And we know it's not true. It's

1852
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:19,599
And we know it's not true. It's
 

1853
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,670
And we know it's not true. It's
relative. It's relative to your skill,

1854
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:21,680
relative. It's relative to your skill,
 

1855

to weapon selection, target selection.
 

1857
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,349
to weapon selection, target selection.
It's not it. Okay? It only looks

1858
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:27,359
It's not it. Okay? It only looks
 

1859
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,430
It's not it. Okay? It only looks
universal because no one in Iikido

1860
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:29,440
universal because no one in Iikido
 

1861
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,309
universal because no one in Iikido
actually throws the strike. They just go

1862
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:32,319
actually throws the strike. They just go
 

1863
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,069
actually throws the strike. They just go
ahead and assume the effect. Okay?

1864
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:36,079
ahead and assume the effect. Okay?
 

1865
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,750
ahead and assume the effect. Okay?
Um pain is likewise relative. So first

1866
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:41,760
Um pain is likewise relative. So first
 

1867
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,109
Um pain is likewise relative. So first
to go back to unselfing pain is a

1868
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:45,119
to go back to unselfing pain is a
 

1869
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,190
to go back to unselfing pain is a
selfing experience.

1870
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:47,200
selfing experience.
 

1871
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,390
selfing experience.
Pain physical pain uh is not experienced

1872
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:52,400
Pain physical pain uh is not experienced
 

1873
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,230
Pain physical pain uh is not experienced
from the god mind. And this is why in

1874
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,240
from the god mind. And this is why in
 

1875
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,349
from the god mind. And this is why in
mystical traditions throughout history,

1876
00:47:59,349 --> 00:47:59,359
mystical traditions throughout history,
 

1877
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,630
mystical traditions throughout history,
the body is put under that kind of

1878
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
the body is put under that kind of
 

1879
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,870
the body is put under that kind of
stress where you go from discomfort to

1880
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:06,880
stress where you go from discomfort to
 

1881
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,390
stress where you go from discomfort to
self-mutilation.

1882
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:08,400
self-mutilation.
 

1883
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,829
self-mutilation.
Is there testing for this ability for

1884
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:11,839
Is there testing for this ability for
 

1885
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:16,230
Is there testing for this ability for
pain to go away? Okay. Um, some of you

1886
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:16,240
pain to go away? Okay. Um, some of you
 

1887
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,230
pain to go away? Okay. Um, some of you
have been close enough and long enough

1888
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240
have been close enough and long enough
 

1889
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,150
have been close enough and long enough
with me that you know that's exactly

1890
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:20,160
with me that you know that's exactly
 

1891
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,630
with me that you know that's exactly
what I do all the time. Um, trying to

1892
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:22,640
what I do all the time. Um, trying to
 

1893
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,109
what I do all the time. Um, trying to
deal. So for example, I've mentioned

1894
00:48:25,109 --> 00:48:25,119
deal. So for example, I've mentioned
 

1895
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,430
deal. So for example, I've mentioned
that night with the with the pain like I

1985
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,349
those things. They go right away. There
are things of the ego tripartite mind.

1986
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:33,359
are things of the ego tripartite mind.
 

1987
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,390
are things of the ego tripartite mind.
Okay. So pain is very relative. at the

1988
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
Okay. So pain is very relative. at the
 

1989
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,470
Okay. So pain is very relative. at the
top we have you're going to have

1990
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:38,480
top we have you're going to have
 

1991
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,589
top we have you're going to have
opponents who could release from that

1992
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:41,599
opponents who could release from that
 

1993
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,390
opponents who could release from that
and you won't have the NMI effect

1994
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:44,400
and you won't have the NMI effect
 

1995
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,109
and you won't have the NMI effect
because you're hurting them and that

1996
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,119
because you're hurting them and that
 

1997
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,190
because you're hurting them and that
could go anywhere from they'll let you

1998
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:49,200
could go anywhere from they'll let you
 

1999
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,790
could go anywhere from they'll let you
break whatever you think you're going to

2000
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:50,800
break whatever you think you're going to
 

2001
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,990
break whatever you think you're going to
break or the extra time in which you

2002
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:54,000
break or the extra time in which you
 

2003
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,030
break or the extra time in which you
didn't generate NMI they are out in the

2004
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,040
didn't generate NMI they are out in the
 

2005
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,470
didn't generate NMI they are out in the
stupidest of ways okay which is why

2006
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:00,480
stupidest of ways okay which is why
 

2007
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,670
stupidest of ways okay which is why
iikido does have joint locks but we are

2008
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:05,680
iikido does have joint locks but we are
 

2009
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,470
iikido does have joint locks but we are
not trying to induce pain from the joint

2010
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:08,480
not trying to induce pain from the joint
 

2011
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,510
not trying to induce pain from the joint
lock. We are controlling the center. You

2012
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,520
lock. We are controlling the center. You
 

2013
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,750
lock. We are controlling the center. You
understand that? So, go back to the Nico

2014
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:13,760
understand that? So, go back to the Nico
 

2015
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,790
understand that? So, go back to the Nico
videos. And I'm moving your body through

2016
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:16,800
videos. And I'm moving your body through
 

2017
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,910
videos. And I'm moving your body through
space. Okay? Um, if you can't release,

2018
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:21,920
space. Okay? Um, if you can't release,
 

2019
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,870
space. Okay? Um, if you can't release,

with that technique. There's no pain in
 

2025
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,870
with that technique. There's no pain in
that technique. Okay? It's not that

2026
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:32,880
that technique. Okay? It's not that
 

2027
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,790
that technique. Okay? It's not that
you're not cranking on it. It's just

2028
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:34,800
you're not cranking on it. It's just
 

2029
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,309
you're not cranking on it. It's just
it's not going to do what you think it's

2030
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:36,319
it's not going to do what you think it's
 

2031
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,750
it's not going to do what you think it's
going to do. Okay. So, here we have uh

2032
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:39,760
going to do. Okay. So, here we have uh
 

2033
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,510
going to do. Okay. So, here we have uh
the guy comes around and we have this.

2034
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:43,520
the guy comes around and we have this.
 

2035
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,309
the guy comes around and we have this.
You see, and then you have that that

2036
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:46,319
You see, and then you have that that
 

2037
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,309
You see, and then you have that that
that pain. Okay. Got got the idea.

2038
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:50,319
that pain. Okay. Got got the idea.
 

2039
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:54,710
that pain. Okay. Got got the idea.
Um and again, he stopped.

2040
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:54,720
Um and again, he stopped.
 

2041
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,470
Um and again, he stopped.
So, you stopped him. So, now you

2042
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:56,480
So, you stopped him. So, now you
 

2043
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,470
So, you stopped him. So, now you
generate the energetic problem that's

2044
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:58,480
generate the energetic problem that's
 

2045
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,630
generate the energetic problem that's
not there. Okay.

2046
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:00,640
not there. Okay.
 

2047
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,190
not there. Okay.

And it's all because I can move. Okay,
try it. Go.

Let him turn it. Let him get there. Be

2208
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:46,640
Let him turn it. Let him get there. Be
 

2209

>> All right. So that is why if we were
 

2217

>> All right. So that is why if we were
doing coming around uh we don't go back

2218
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:12,400
doing coming around uh we don't go back

2441
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,510
to B. Do do you understand that? So what
to demonstrate this if I am UK and I'm

2442
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:25,520
to demonstrate this if I am UK and I'm
 

2443

01:06:57,589 --> 01:06:57,599
fulfillment of my dichotomy, we must
 

2495
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:03,349
fulfillment of my dichotomy, we must
stop being him versus me and he must now

2524
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:47,280
I don't fight that value, but I'm
 

2525
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,910
I don't fight that value, but I'm
controlling it. So, at this point, you

2526
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:49,920
controlling it. So, at this point, you
 

2527
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,789
controlling it. So, at this point, you
you can do whatever you want to his

2528
01:07:52,789 --> 01:07:52,799
you can do whatever you want to his
 

2529
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,950
you can do whatever you want to his
center. Understood?

2530
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:54,960
center. Understood?
 

2531
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,910
center. Understood?

I'm going to work with the guy that's

2534
01:07:59,829 --> 01:07:59,839
I'm going to work with the guy that's
 

2535
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:03,270
I'm going to work with the guy that's
coming from the back. Okay?

2536
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:03,280
coming from the back. Okay?
 

2537
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:08,069
coming from the back. Okay?
We've now not dichomous at at contact.

2538
01:08:08,069 --> 01:08:08,079
We've now not dichomous at at contact.
 

2539
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:13,109
We've now not dichomous at at contact.
Here we go. And now I am or and he,

2540
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:13,119
Here we go. And now I am or and he,
 

2541
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,470
Here we go. And now I am or and he,
however you want to say it, we're moving

2542
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:16,480
however you want to say it, we're moving
 

2543
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,630
however you want to say it, we're moving
together, which he's not really

2544
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:18,640
together, which he's not really
 

2545
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:24,630
together, which he's not really
controlling the technique anymore.

2546
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:24,640

 

2547
01:08:24,640 --> 01:09:15,829

>> Okay. Got Got it.

2548
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:15,839

 

2549
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,229

Um,

2550
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:18,239
Um,
 

2551
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:20,229
Um,
let's let's talk about it for a second

2552
01:09:20,229 --> 01:09:20,239
let's let's talk about it for a second
 

2553
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,950
let's let's talk about it for a second
and maybe you could feel it. But what I

2554
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:22,960
and maybe you could feel it. But what I
 

2555
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,349
and maybe you could feel it. But what I
was trying to show is if I can go

2556
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:25,359
was trying to show is if I can go
 

2557
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,669
was trying to show is if I can go
anywhere from anything and move his

2558
01:09:27,669 --> 01:09:27,679
anywhere from anything and move his
 

2559
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,390
anywhere from anything and move his
center, it's clear that it's not that

2560
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:30,400
center, it's clear that it's not that
 

2561
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,950
center, it's clear that it's not that
we're not two things at that point.

2562
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:32,960
we're not two things at that point.
 

2563
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,990
we're not two things at that point.
Okay. Um so I could project I could have

2564
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:36,000
Okay. Um so I could project I could have
 

2565
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,829
Okay. Um so I could project I could have
projected out. I could have brought him

2566
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:37,839
projected out. I could have brought him
 

2567
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,550
projected out. I could have brought him
in front of me and I can control the

2568
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:40,560
in front of me and I can control the
 

2569
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,349
in front of me and I can control the
rate at which he's going around me. Two

2570
01:09:43,349 --> 01:09:43,359
rate at which he's going around me. Two
 

2571
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,390
rate at which he's going around me. Two
have become one. Okay. Got the communion

2572
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:46,400
have become one. Okay. Got the communion
 

2573
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,749
have become one. Okay. Got the communion
has happened. I has happened. Okay. Um,

2574
01:09:49,749 --> 01:09:49,759
has happened. I has happened. Okay. Um,
 

2575
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,910
has happened. I has happened. Okay. Um,
but I don't know how visible it is or

2576
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:51,920
but I don't know how visible it is or
 

2577
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,550
but I don't know how visible it is or
how how sensitive you are to feel it,

2578
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:54,560
how how sensitive you are to feel it,
 

2579
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,790
how how sensitive you are to feel it,
but to me that's logical. What What do

2580
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:56,800
but to me that's logical. What What do
 

2581
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,030
but to me that's logical. What What do
you got? What' you see? What' you feel?

2582
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,040
you got? What' you see? What' you feel?
 

2583
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:20,550
you got? What' you see? What' you feel?
What' you see?

2584
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:20,560

 

2585
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,950

Yeah. Not him. Okay. I've just communed

2586
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:22,960
Yeah. Not him. Okay. I've just communed
 

2587
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,510
Yeah. Not him. Okay. I've just communed
with his prescription. It's what you're

2588
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:25,520
with his prescription. It's what you're
 

2589
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,669
with his prescription. It's what you're
doing. Okay. And the fact that I could

2590
01:10:27,669 --> 01:10:27,679
doing. Okay. And the fact that I could
 

2591
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:30,630
doing. Okay. And the fact that I could
change the prescription is the is

2592
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:30,640
change the prescription is the is
 

2593
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,709
change the prescription is the is
evidentiary that we are in a communion

2594
01:10:32,709 --> 01:10:32,719
evidentiary that we are in a communion
 

2595
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:35,189
evidentiary that we are in a communion
state right now. Okay.

2596
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:35,199
state right now. Okay.
 

2597
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:37,030
state right now. Okay.
Um,

2598
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:37,040
Um,
 

2599
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:40,630
Um,
so it's not even by the time he gets

2600
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:40,640
so it's not even by the time he gets
 

2601
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,550
so it's not even by the time he gets
there, it's not the case that he got

2602
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:44,560
there, it's not the case that he got
 

2603
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,430
there, it's not the case that he got
himself there. Do do you understand? He

2604
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:47,440
himself there. Do do you understand? He
 

2605
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,669
himself there. Do do you understand? He
he's going to go there at that point at

2606
01:10:49,669 --> 01:10:49,679
he's going to go there at that point at
 

2607
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,430
he's going to go there at that point at
that point cuz I'm not going to let him

2608
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:51,440
that point cuz I'm not going to let him
 

2609
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,310
that point cuz I'm not going to let him
go any other place

2610
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:54,320
go any other place
 

2611
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,790
go any other place
while prescription wise he is going to

2612
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:56,800
while prescription wise he is going to
 

2613
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,270
while prescription wise he is going to
go there too. Too often the nag even

2614
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:01,280
go there too. Too often the nag even
 

2615
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,550
go there too. Too often the nag even
here will take advantage entirely of the

2616
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:04,560
here will take advantage entirely of the
 

2617
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,030
here will take advantage entirely of the
prescription and now you're trying to

2618
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:07,040
prescription and now you're trying to
 

2619
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,430
prescription and now you're trying to
find their center over here and that

2620
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:09,440
find their center over here and that
 

2621
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,189
find their center over here and that
just doesn't work and but it is

2622
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:13,199
just doesn't work and but it is

That's where you start plugandplay this

01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:32,960
That's where you start plugandplay this

Okay, Chris

2644
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:49,920

Ready, set, go. And trying to

01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:01,360

 

2649
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:18,790

emulate your capacity to already

2650
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:18,800

 

2651
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,590

one, two, three, rep four. That entire

01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:21,600
one, two, three, rep four. That entire

And without that, it seems like there's

And without that, it seems like there's

And without that, it seems like there's

01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:53,280
Yes. Very good, very good insight. Okay.
 

2681
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,390
Yes. Very good, very good insight. Okay.
So, in a way, it's kind of cheating. I

2682
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:56,400
So, in a way, it's kind of cheating. I
 

2683
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,430
So, in a way, it's kind of cheating. I
don't have perfect timing because I

2684
01:12:59,430 --> 01:12:59,440
don't have perfect timing because I
 

2685
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,310
don't have perfect timing because I
don't have a timing problem.

2686
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:02,320
don't have a timing problem.
 

2687
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,709
don't have a timing problem.
That's the way to solve it. Okay?

2688
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:04,719
That's the way to solve it. Okay?
 

2689
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,630
That's the way to solve it. Okay?
There's I don't I'm not I don't have to

2690
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:06,640
There's I don't I'm not I don't have to
 

2691
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,350
There's I don't I'm not I don't have to
be too early or too late. We're we're

2692
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:09,360
be too early or too late. We're we're
 

2693
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,590
be too early or too late. We're we're
together. Okay? There's no past,

2694
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:11,600
together. Okay? There's no past,
 

2695
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,430
together. Okay? There's no past,
present, there's no him, I Okay. All

2696
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:15,440
present, there's no him, I Okay. All
 

2697
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,669
present, there's no him, I Okay. All
right. So

2698
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:17,679
right. So
 

2699
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:22,070
right. So
when we're doing this technique,

2700
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:22,080
when we're doing this technique,
 

2701
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,030
when we're doing this technique,
energetics is just energetics. Again,

2702
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:25,040
energetics is just energetics. Again,
 

2703
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,709
energetics is just energetics. Again,
it's not uh electromagnetism.

2704
01:13:28,709 --> 01:13:28,719
it's not uh electromagnetism.
 

2705
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:31,350
it's not uh electromagnetism.
And let me be clear when I say NMI,

2706
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:31,360
And let me be clear when I say NMI,
 

2707
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,070
And let me be clear when I say NMI,
neuromuscular capacitation. What I mean

2708
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:34,080
neuromuscular capacitation. What I mean
 

2709
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,310
neuromuscular capacitation. What I mean
is there's no universal technique in

2710
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:36,320
is there's no universal technique in
 

2711
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,430
is there's no universal technique in
which the opponent becomes my slave and

2712
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:39,440
which the opponent becomes my slave and
 

2713
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,910
which the opponent becomes my slave and
lets me do everything. That that's not

2714
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:41,920
lets me do everything. That that's not
 

2715
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,950
lets me do everything. That that's not
real. So the chi people that have the

2716
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:44,960
real. So the chi people that have the
 

2717
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,430
real. So the chi people that have the
electromagnetism

2718
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:47,440
electromagnetism
 

2719
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,950
electromagnetism
and they do that in that

2720
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:50,960
and they do that in that
 

2721
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,750
and they do that in that
lack of ability

2722
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:53,760
lack of ability
 

2723
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,790
lack of ability
they can be totally manipulated by the

2724
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:56,800
they can be totally manipulated by the
 

2725
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,149
they can be totally manipulated by the
nag in ways that real fighters know that

2726
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:00,159
nag in ways that real fighters know that
 

2727
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:03,189
nag in ways that real fighters know that
that's not how it works. Okay. So

2728
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:03,199
that's not how it works. Okay. So
 

2729
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,590
that's not how it works. Okay. So
leading following is another one of

2730
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:05,600
leading following is another one of
 

2731
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,110
leading following is another one of
those examples. Okay. Instead, if you

2732
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:09,120
those examples. Okay. Instead, if you
 

2733
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,709
those examples. Okay. Instead, if you
realize that the connection that I'm

2734
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:12,719
realize that the connection that I'm
 

2735
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,070
realize that the connection that I'm
going to have here is going to have yin

2736
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:16,080
going to have here is going to have yin
 

2737
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,630
going to have here is going to have yin
and yang phases, too. It's not a

2738
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:18,640
and yang phases, too. It's not a
 

2739
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,590
and yang phases, too. It's not a
universal incapacitation of him where

2740
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:21,600
universal incapacitation of him where
 

2741
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,590
universal incapacitation of him where
once I touch him, uh, he's like that and

2742
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:25,600
once I touch him, uh, he's like that and
 

2743
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,590
once I touch him, uh, he's like that and
you you could do whatever. Do do you

2744
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:27,600
you you could do whatever. Do do you
 

2745
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,110
you you could do whatever. Do do you
understand? There's going to be a

2746
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:29,120
understand? There's going to be a
 

2747
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:34,149
understand? There's going to be a
yinface where the connection cannot be

2748
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:34,159
yinface where the connection cannot be
 

2749
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:37,910
yinface where the connection cannot be
maintained and achieve the same ends.

2750
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:37,920
maintained and achieve the same ends.
 

2751
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,709
maintained and achieve the same ends.
Um, does that make sense? Okay, it in a

2752
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:40,719
Um, does that make sense? Okay, it in a
 

2753
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:43,590
Um, does that make sense? Okay, it in a
yin-yang world that's a fact. But no, no

2754
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:43,600
yin-yang world that's a fact. But no, no
 

2755
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,830
yin-yang world that's a fact. But no, no
one wants to acknowledge that. They just

2756
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:45,840
one wants to acknowledge that. They just
 

2757
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,229
one wants to acknowledge that. They just
get incapacitated and you can move

2758
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:48,239
get incapacitated and you can move
 

2759
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:51,030
get incapacitated and you can move
however you want or even not touch them.

2760
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:51,040
however you want or even not touch them.
 

2761
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,750
however you want or even not touch them.
Do you see this all crazy stuff? Okay.

2762
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:53,760
Do you see this all crazy stuff? Okay.
 

2763
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,550
Do you see this all crazy stuff? Okay.
So, uh, as we're coming around here and

2764
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:56,560
So, uh, as we're coming around here and
 

2765
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,070
So, uh, as we're coming around here and
he's feeling the connection, he's

2766
01:14:58,070 --> 01:14:58,080
he's feeling the connection, he's
 

2767
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,630
he's feeling the connection, he's
feeling the connection. Then it's kind

2768
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:00,640
feeling the connection. Then it's kind
 

2769
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,229
feeling the connection. Then it's kind
of off here, isn't it, Sean?

2770
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:02,239
of off here, isn't it, Sean?
 

2771
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,390
of off here, isn't it, Sean?
>> Do you see that?

2772
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:04,400
>> Do you see that?
 

2773
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,110
>> Do you see that?
uh and there's nothing I can do to to

2774
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:07,120
uh and there's nothing I can do to to
 

2775
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,669
uh and there's nothing I can do to to
generate that center connection at that

2776
01:15:09,669 --> 01:15:09,679
generate that center connection at that
 

2777
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:13,110
generate that center connection at that
point. Okay? Uh

2778
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:13,120
point. Okay? Uh
 

2779
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:16,390
point. Okay? Uh
meaning when I'm here like this, okay?

2780
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:16,400
meaning when I'm here like this, okay?
 

2781
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,149
meaning when I'm here like this, okay?
And at this point, um

2782
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:20,159
And at this point, um
 

2783
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:22,310
And at this point, um
I I'll be I'll be here. I'll be in in

2784
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:22,320
I I'll be I'll be here. I'll be in in
 

2785
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,950
I I'll be I'll be here. I'll be in in
this kind of thing, right? But you know,

2786
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:24,960
this kind of thing, right? But you know,
 

2787
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,470
this kind of thing, right? But you know,
it's not in your center.

2788
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:26,480
it's not in your center.
 

2789
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,510
it's not in your center.
>> So he can move

2790
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:29,520
>> So he can move
 

2791
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,950
>> So he can move
any way he freaking wants. Do do you

2792
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:32,960
any way he freaking wants. Do do you
 

2793
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,110
any way he freaking wants. Do do you
understand? He can move any way he

2794
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:35,120
understand? He can move any way he
 

2795
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:39,030
understand? He can move any way he
freaking wants.

2796
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,040

 

2797
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,229

So that's why in the admin as you're

2798
01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:42,239
So that's why in the admin as you're
 

2799
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:44,149
So that's why in the admin as you're
coming around, you have to pick it up

2800
01:15:44,149 --> 01:15:44,159
coming around, you have to pick it up
 

2801
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,550
coming around, you have to pick it up
over here.

2802
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:46,560
over here.
 

2803
01:15:46,560 --> 01:16:07,270
over here.
Do you

2804
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:07,280

 

2805
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:11,750

do you understand? and he can't stop

2806
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:11,760
do you understand? and he can't stop
 

2807
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,910
do you understand? and he can't stop
because then I won't have the the

2808
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:13,920
because then I won't have the the
 

2809
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,990
because then I won't have the the
centrifugal energy to generate the

2810
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:16,000
centrifugal energy to generate the
 

2811
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,229
centrifugal energy to generate the
adhesion on the outside of his head.

2812
01:16:18,229 --> 01:16:18,239
adhesion on the outside of his head.
 

2813
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,630
adhesion on the outside of his head.
Okay? Does that does that make sense? So

2814
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:20,640
Okay? Does that does that make sense? So
 

2815
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,550
Okay? Does that does that make sense? So
you're you're going to you're going to

2816
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:22,560
you're you're going to you're going to
 

2817
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,790
you're you're going to you're going to
go he coming in. He's going to feel he's

2818
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:24,800
go he coming in. He's going to feel he's
 

2819
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,070
go he coming in. He's going to feel he's
going to feel that and he feels this.

2820
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:28,080
going to feel that and he feels this.
 

2821
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,470
going to feel that and he feels this.
Okay? And it's it just comes around.

2822
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:30,480
Okay? And it's it just comes around.
 

2823
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,709
Okay? And it's it just comes around.
Okay?

2824
01:16:34,709 --> 01:16:34,719

 

2825
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:38,630

If I grab his sleeve as in Robbie's

2826
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:38,640
If I grab his sleeve as in Robbie's
 

2827
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,070
If I grab his sleeve as in Robbie's
video, do you see that? It's just

2828
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:42,080
video, do you see that? It's just
 

2829
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,110
video, do you see that? It's just
energy.

2830
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:45,120

 

2831
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:48,390

There's too much energy leakage on the

2832
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:48,400
There's too much energy leakage on the
 

2833
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,910
There's too much energy leakage on the
sleeve.

2834
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:49,920
sleeve.
 

2835
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,270
sleeve.
Understand?

2836
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:51,280
Understand?
 

2837
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,310
Understand?
>> So, if he

2838
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:54,320
>> So, if he
 

2839
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,630
>> So, if he
pulls my sleeve, it's even higher on the

2840
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:56,640
pulls my sleeve, it's even higher on the
 

2841
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,910
pulls my sleeve, it's even higher on the
shoulder where you'd have more control.

2842
01:16:59,910 --> 01:16:59,920
shoulder where you'd have more control.
 

2843
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:04,149
shoulder where you'd have more control.
Uh, and as he's pulling it, then I can

2844
01:17:04,149 --> 01:17:04,159
Uh, and as he's pulling it, then I can
 

2845
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:07,750
Uh, and as he's pulling it, then I can
move all over the place.

2846
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:07,760
move all over the place.
 

2847
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,750
move all over the place.
>> Got it. I don't have to move where

2848
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:09,760
>> Got it. I don't have to move where
 

2849
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,229
>> Got it. I don't have to move where
you're telling me is. You can't make me

2850
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:12,239
you're telling me is. You can't make me
 

2851
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:14,390
you're telling me is. You can't make me
move where you're telling me because

2852
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:14,400
move where you're telling me because
 

2853
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,070
move where you're telling me because
there's no there's not going to be a

2854
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:16,080
there's no there's not going to be a
 

2855
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,390
there's no there's not going to be a
center to center connection with that

2856
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:18,400
center to center connection with that
 

2857
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,790
center to center connection with that
much energy leakage. Okay. Do do you

2858
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:20,800
much energy leakage. Okay. Do do you
 

2859
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,709
much energy leakage. Okay. Do do you
guys got that? So, uh, when he's coming

2860
01:17:24,709 --> 01:17:24,719
guys got that? So, uh, when he's coming
 

2861
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,390
guys got that? So, uh, when he's coming
around, okay, boom. And I go to the

2862
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:28,400
around, okay, boom. And I go to the
 

2863
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,350
around, okay, boom. And I go to the
sleeve. You got a couple things. You got

2864
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:31,360
sleeve. You got a couple things. You got
 

2865
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,149
sleeve. You got a couple things. You got
all that energy leakage. So, watch his

2866
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:34,159
all that energy leakage. So, watch his
 

2867
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:38,229
all that energy leakage. So, watch his
center. Do you see?

2868
01:17:38,229 --> 01:17:38,239

 

2869
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:41,189

Didn't do anything to it. Okay. And then

2870
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:41,199
Didn't do anything to it. Okay. And then
 

2871
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:45,590
Didn't do anything to it. Okay. And then
you always have the shoulder hinge. You

2872
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:45,600
you always have the shoulder hinge. You
 

2873
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,510
you always have the shoulder hinge. You
see? Okay. So, with between the energy

2874
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:49,520
see? Okay. So, with between the energy
 

2875
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,830
see? Okay. So, with between the energy
leakage of the sleeve and the energy

2876
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:51,840
leakage of the sleeve and the energy
 

2877
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,550
leakage of the sleeve and the energy
absorption of the shoulder, I could move

2878
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:54,560
absorption of the shoulder, I could move
 

2879
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,990
absorption of the shoulder, I could move
this thing pretty freaking far. in space

2880
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:58,000
this thing pretty freaking far. in space
 

2881
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,310
this thing pretty freaking far. in space
and never affect the center as long as

2882
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:00,320
and never affect the center as long as
 

2883
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,280
and never affect the center as long as
you stay relaxed. Okay,

2884
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:04,290
you stay relaxed. Okay,
 

2885
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:06,310
you stay relaxed. Okay,

that is just not going to work. Okay, so

2888
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,320
that is just not going to work. Okay, so
 

2889
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,390
that is just not going to work. Okay, so
when I

2890
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:12,400
when I
 

2891
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,350
when I
go to pull it

2892
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:15,360
go to pull it
 

2893
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:19,030
go to pull it
in with the way that he's staying still,

2894
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:19,040
in with the way that he's staying still,
 

2895
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,229
in with the way that he's staying still,
he could also move anywhere he wanted in

2896
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:22,239
he could also move anywhere he wanted in
 

2897
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,470
he could also move anywhere he wanted in
the capacity to stay still against my

2898
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:24,480
the capacity to stay still against my
 

2899
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:28,790
the capacity to stay still against my
movement. when I go to move it where I

2900
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:28,800
movement. when I go to move it where I
 

2901
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,390
movement. when I go to move it where I
feel tension like there, I can't control

2902
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:32,400
feel tension like there, I can't control
 

2903
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,030
feel tension like there, I can't control
where he's going to step. Do you

2904
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:35,040
where he's going to step. Do you
 

2905
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,750
where he's going to step. Do you
understand? So, you're going to uh

2906
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:37,760
understand? So, you're going to uh
 

2907
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,189
understand? So, you're going to uh
you're going to pull me around. So, it

2908
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:41,199
you're going to pull me around. So, it
 

2909
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:44,390
you're going to pull me around. So, it
looks like I got taken that way. Do you

2910
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:44,400
looks like I got taken that way. Do you
 

2911
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,910
looks like I got taken that way. Do you
understand?

2912
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:45,920
understand?
 

2913
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,310
understand?
He has that. And again, it's even more

2914
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:48,320
He has that. And again, it's even more
 

2915
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,550
He has that. And again, it's even more
control on the shoulder. Okay. See, he's

2916
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:50,560
control on the shoulder. Okay. See, he's
 

2917
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,149
control on the shoulder. Okay. See, he's
going and it looks like I'm going

2918
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:52,159
going and it looks like I'm going
 

2919
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,149
going and it looks like I'm going
around,

2920
01:18:54,149 --> 01:18:54,159
around,
 

2921
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:59,350
around,
but he can't stop me from

2922
01:18:59,350 --> 01:18:59,360
but he can't stop me from
 

2923
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,830
but he can't stop me from
moving any old way. Do Do you

2924
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:01,840
moving any old way. Do Do you
 

2925
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,270
moving any old way. Do Do you
understand?

2926
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:03,280
understand?
 

2927
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,630
understand?
>> Whereas when he's coming around, right,

2928
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:06,640
>> Whereas when he's coming around, right,
 

2929
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,870
>> Whereas when he's coming around, right,
and we're here,

2930
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:10,880

 

2931
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,830

he can't go the other ways. He's only

2932
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:13,840
he can't go the other ways. He's only
 

2933
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,870
he can't go the other ways. He's only
going to go that way. Okay? So, if

2934
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:16,880
going to go that way. Okay? So, if
 

2935
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,390
going to go that way. Okay? So, if
you're

2936
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:18,400
you're
 

2937
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,709
you're
if he pulled

2938
01:19:20,709 --> 01:19:20,719
if he pulled
 

2939
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:23,669
if he pulled
And the UK

2940
01:19:23,669 --> 01:19:23,679
And the UK
 

2941
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:28,950
And the UK
did what you saw him do. You did that.

2942
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:28,960
did what you saw him do. You did that.
 

2943
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,669
did what you saw him do. You did that.
Not not the nag. Do you guys understand

2944
01:19:31,669 --> 01:19:31,679
Not not the nag. Do you guys understand
 

2945
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:36,229
Not not the nag. Do you guys understand
that? And you don't want to do that. So

2946
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:36,239
that? And you don't want to do that. So
 

2947
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,709
that? And you don't want to do that. So
this is why I do these demonstrations.

2948
01:19:38,709 --> 01:19:38,719
this is why I do these demonstrations.
 

2949
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:43,030
this is why I do these demonstrations.
Okay. So we're here and we connect and

2950
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:43,040
Okay. So we're here and we connect and
 

2951
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:48,070
Okay. So we're here and we connect and
we let go and we tell him pull out that

2952
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:48,080
we let go and we tell him pull out that
 

2953
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,550
we let go and we tell him pull out that
way.

2954
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:50,560
way.
 

2955
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,990
way.
Okay, we tell him go forward.

2956
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:54,000
Okay, we tell him go forward.
 

2957
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,350
Okay, we tell him go forward.
>> We tell him go backwards.

2958
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:57,360
>> We tell him go backwards.
 

2959
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,110
>> We tell him go backwards.
>> Do you understand? So, do you feel the

2960
01:19:59,110 --> 01:19:59,120
>> Do you understand? So, do you feel the
 

2961
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,590
>> Do you understand? So, do you feel the
resistance? Okay, and that was without

2962
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:01,600
resistance? Okay, and that was without
 

2963
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,790
resistance? Okay, and that was without
motion. When you add the motion, let's

2964
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:04,800
motion. When you add the motion, let's
 

2965
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,470
motion. When you add the motion, let's
start walking.

2966
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:06,480
start walking.
 

2967
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,390
start walking.
>> And now you feel

2968
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:10,400
>> And now you feel
 

2969
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,270
>> And now you feel
less ability to change what vector he's

2970
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:13,280
less ability to change what vector he's
 

2971
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:17,030
less ability to change what vector he's
on and how he's moving through it. Okay.

2972
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:17,040
on and how he's moving through it. Okay.
 

2973
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,669
on and how he's moving through it. Okay.
The justification

2974
01:20:21,669 --> 01:20:21,679

 

2975
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:26,550

for this is following.

2976
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:26,560
for this is following.
 

2977
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:29,590
for this is following.
But following is not true. Following is

2978
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:29,600
But following is not true. Following is
 

2979
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,870
But following is not true. Following is
that selfing delusion. Okay? You need to

2980
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:32,880
that selfing delusion. Okay? You need to
 

2981
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,830
that selfing delusion. Okay? You need to
be made to move by that point in the

2982
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:35,840
be made to move by that point in the
 

2983
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,790
be made to move by that point in the
technique by nag from wherever they

2984
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:38,800
technique by nag from wherever they
 

2985
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,550
technique by nag from wherever they
touched you to wherever you go.

2986
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:42,560
touched you to wherever you go.
 

2987
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,070
touched you to wherever you go.
There's nothing you have to do as uk.

2988
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,080
There's nothing you have to do as uk.
 

2989
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:50,070
There's nothing you have to do as uk.
And so what you should do is

2990
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:50,080
And so what you should do is
 

2991
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,390
And so what you should do is
follow rule two.

2992
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:52,400
follow rule two.
 

2993
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:57,669
follow rule two.
He neither assists nor resist. Okay? Do

2994
01:20:57,669 --> 01:20:57,679
He neither assists nor resist. Okay? Do
 

2995
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:01,510
He neither assists nor resist. Okay? Do
so if if I can't move him there, he

2996
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:01,520
so if if I can't move him there, he
 

2997
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,189
so if if I can't move him there, he
shouldn't go. He shouldn't go. I have to

2998
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:05,199
shouldn't go. He shouldn't go. I have to
 

2999
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:08,950
shouldn't go. He shouldn't go. I have to
be able to move him there. Got it?

3000
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:08,960
be able to move him there. Got it?
 

3001
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:15,270
be able to move him there. Got it?
>> Okay. So again, this is about UK being

3002
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:15,280
>> Okay. So again, this is about UK being
 

3003
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,470
>> Okay. So again, this is about UK being
brave. So he's going and I'm just

3004
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:18,480
brave. So he's going and I'm just
 

3005
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:33,030
brave. So he's going and I'm just
standing.

3006
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:33,040

 

3007
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,709

Okay,

3008
01:21:34,709 --> 01:21:34,719
Okay,
 

3009
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:37,669
Okay,
I'm not being an ass, but I'm just

3010
01:21:37,669 --> 01:21:37,679
I'm not being an ass, but I'm just
 

3011
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:41,350
I'm not being an ass, but I'm just
standing. He's got to move. Then now he

3012
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:41,360
standing. He's got to move. Then now he
 

3013
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:44,070
standing. He's got to move. Then now he
could learn

3014
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:44,080
could learn
 

3015
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,870
could learn
where the technique actually is cuz he

3016
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:46,880
where the technique actually is cuz he
 

3017
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,430
where the technique actually is cuz he
did eventually move me. But you'll never

3018
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:49,440
did eventually move me. But you'll never
 

3019
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,750
did eventually move me. But you'll never
get to adima from that technique because

3020
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:51,760
get to adima from that technique because
 

3021
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:55,110
get to adima from that technique because
he went too down. Okay. All right. So

3022
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:55,120
he went too down. Okay. All right. So
 

3023
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,629
he went too down. Okay. All right. So
that's our discovery learning. Just

3024
01:21:56,629 --> 01:21:56,639
that's our discovery learning. Just
 

3025
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:00,310
that's our discovery learning. Just
stand still. Okay. Which is way less.

3026
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:00,320
stand still. Okay. Which is way less.
 

3027
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,470
stand still. Okay. Which is way less.
There's going to be way less energy you

3028
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:02,480
There's going to be way less energy you
 

3029
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,110
There's going to be way less energy you
can use when you had the forward

3030
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:05,120
can use when you had the forward
 

3031
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,590
can use when you had the forward
progress of the prescribed attack. When

3032
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:07,600
progress of the prescribed attack. When
 

3033
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,270
progress of the prescribed attack. When
you have the forward progress where

3034
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:09,280
you have the forward progress where
 

3035
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,990
you have the forward progress where
you're coming in to smother that strike,

3036
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:12,000
you're coming in to smother that strike,
 

3037
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,390
you're coming in to smother that strike,
there's no way that one wouldn't work.

3038
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:14,400
there's no way that one wouldn't work.
 

3039
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,350
there's no way that one wouldn't work.
Okay? But to get in the ballpark, just

3040
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:17,360
Okay? But to get in the ballpark, just
 

3041
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,830
Okay? But to get in the ballpark, just
stand still. Stay connected. Don't go

3042
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:19,840
stand still. Stay connected. Don't go
 

3043
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,550
stand still. Stay connected. Don't go
soupy. Stay connected. And he's got to

3044
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:22,560
soupy. Stay connected. And he's got to
 

3045
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,149
soupy. Stay connected. And he's got to
move your mass. Okay?

3046
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:26,159
move your mass. Okay?
 

3047
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:28,950
move your mass. Okay?
What he felt was, "Oh, I'm just yong

3048
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:28,960
What he felt was, "Oh, I'm just yong
 

3049
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,430
What he felt was, "Oh, I'm just yong
yonging." So, he's trying to find the

3050
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:31,440
yonging." So, he's trying to find the
 

3051
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,350
yonging." So, he's trying to find the
right angle. Well, that is closer to the

3052
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:33,360
right angle. Well, that is closer to the
 

3053
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,310
right angle. Well, that is closer to the
art than you yonging.

3054
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:36,320
art than you yonging.
 

3055
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:39,750
art than you yonging.
And you won't know that if the UK is

3056
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:39,760
And you won't know that if the UK is
 

3057
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,990
And you won't know that if the UK is
going to follow you. Okay. All right.

3058
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,000
going to follow you. Okay. All right.
 

3059
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:54,870
going to follow you. Okay. All right.
Try it.

3060
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:54,880

 

3061
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,110

>> You're just standing. Every step they

3062
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:57,120
>> You're just standing. Every step they
 

3063
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,189
>> You're just standing. Every step they
have to move you. Not you. You don't

3064
01:22:59,189 --> 01:22:59,199
have to move you. Not you. You don't
 

3065
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:02,229
have to move you. Not you. You don't
move yourself. Every step they have to

3066
01:23:02,229 --> 01:23:02,239
move yourself. Every step they have to
 

3067
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:21,270
move yourself. Every step they have to
move you. every step.

3068
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:21,280

 

3069
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,669

So what I mean by every step is don't

3070
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:23,679
So what I mean by every step is don't
 

3071
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,470
So what I mean by every step is don't
start falling because that's that lazy

3072
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:26,480
start falling because that's that lazy
 

3073
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,229
start falling because that's that lazy
uk.

3074
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:28,239
uk.
 

3075
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:32,229
uk.
Every step they have to move you.

3076
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:32,239
Every step they have to move you.
 

3077
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:35,750
Every step they have to move you.
Not just the first one. Every step.

3078
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:35,760
Not just the first one. Every step.
 

3079
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:41,430
Not just the first one. Every step.
Every step.

01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:49,120

 

3083
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,310

every step. Yes. That is going to make

3084
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:52,320
every step. Yes. That is going to make
 

3085
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,990
every step. Yes. That is going to make
Chris way better.

3086
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:56,000
Chris way better.
 

3087
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,910
Chris way better.
Don't Don't start falling like a

3088
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:57,920
Don't Don't start falling like a
 

3089
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,270
Don't Don't start falling like a
Federite. We don't have any energy here.

3090
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:01,280
Federite. We don't have any energy here.
 

3091
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,070
Federite. We don't have any energy here.
Every step you are being moved. Not

3092
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:04,080
Every step you are being moved. Not
 

3093
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,310
Every step you are being moved. Not
falling because they got momentum on

3094
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:06,320
falling because they got momentum on
 

3095
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,709
falling because they got momentum on
you.

3096
01:24:08,709 --> 01:24:08,719
you.
 

3097
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:14,310
you.
Every step. Now again. Now again. Yes.

3098
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:14,320
Every step. Now again. Now again. Yes.
 

3099
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,950
Every step. Now again. Now again. Yes.
Now again.

3100
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:16,960
Now again.
 

3101
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,390
Now again.
Good.

3102
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:20,400

 

3103
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:26,950

Every step you bended him too much.

3104
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:26,960

 

3105
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,790

You got to move his center, not his

3106
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:28,800
You got to move his center, not his
 

3107
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:39,750
You got to move his center, not his
head. So this is how we learn Idiag.

3108
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:39,760

 

3109
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:44,629

>> Good.

3110
01:24:44,629 --> 01:24:44,639

 

3111
01:24:44,639 --> 01:25:02,149

Follow the 90° rule

3112
01:25:02,149 --> 01:25:02,159

 

3113
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,950

90 degrees to that resistance forward on

3114
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:04,960
90 degrees to that resistance forward on
 

3115
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:10,790
90 degrees to that resistance forward on
the rotational spiral.

3116
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:10,800

 

3117
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,750

So what's happening is the self is

3118
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:13,760
So what's happening is the self is
 

3119
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,870
So what's happening is the self is
coming up and then you push on it. Okay.

3120
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:16,880
coming up and then you push on it. Okay.
 

3121
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:22,470
coming up and then you push on it. Okay.
So look here. Here we are. Okay. So I

3122
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:22,480
So look here. Here we are. Okay. So I
 

3123
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,950
So look here. Here we are. Okay. So I
have your vertical inertia the

3124
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:24,960
have your vertical inertia the
 

3125
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,189
have your vertical inertia the
resistance. Got that? So I'm going to go

3126
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:27,199
resistance. Got that? So I'm going to go
 

3127
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:31,030
resistance. Got that? So I'm going to go
90° to it. That's all I got. Do you see

3128
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:31,040
90° to it. That's all I got. Do you see
 

3129
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:34,310
90° to it. That's all I got. Do you see
that? That's it. You keep trying to do

3130
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:34,320
that? That's it. You keep trying to do
 

3131
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,870
that? That's it. You keep trying to do
it. That's where I got it. And now I'm

3132
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:36,880
it. That's where I got it. And now I'm
 

3133
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,669
it. That's where I got it. And now I'm
over yongiing because of that foot. Do

3134
01:25:39,669 --> 01:25:39,679
over yongiing because of that foot. Do
 

3135
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:40,629
over yongiing because of that foot. Do
you see that?

3136
01:25:40,629 --> 01:25:40,639
you see that?
 

3137
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:44,629
you see that?
>> So it's on that foot. So I turn and I go

3138
01:25:44,629 --> 01:25:44,639
>> So it's on that foot. So I turn and I go
 

3139
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,030
>> So it's on that foot. So I turn and I go
this way.

3140
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:47,040
this way.
 

3141
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,510
this way.
There's the foot again.

3142
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:49,520
There's the foot again.
 

3143
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,910
There's the foot again.
Uh turn again. 90°.

3144
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:53,920

 

3145
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,149

Okay. There's that foot again. Wait,

3146
01:25:56,149 --> 01:25:56,159
Okay. There's that foot again. Wait,
 

3147
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:58,149
Okay. There's that foot again. Wait,
I'll get there.

3148
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:58,159
I'll get there.

side. Okay. You're here like that and
 

3197
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,990
side. Okay. You're here like that and
you're traing them this way.

3198
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,000
you're traing them this way.
 

3199
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:30,470
you're traing them this way.
>> Yes.

3200

>> Okay. So, there's that foot, Chris. Do
you feel that foot? Okay. So, I got to

3204
01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:36,320
you feel that foot? Okay. So, I got to
 

3205
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,189
you feel that foot? Okay. So, I got to
move to get a new angle

3206
01:27:39,189 --> 01:27:39,199
move to get a new angle
 

3207
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:41,990
move to get a new angle
just off of it. There it is right there.

3208
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:42,000
just off of it. There it is right there.
 

3209
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,709
just off of it. There it is right there.
Okay. Then the heel is there. Do you see

3210
01:27:44,709 --> 01:27:44,719
Okay. Then the heel is there. Do you see
 

3211

Okay. Then the heel is there. Do you see
>> the heel is there? You feel it?

3212
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:47,520
>> the heel is there? You feel it?
 

3213
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:52,310
>> the heel is there? You feel it?
>> And I move again and I do another one.

3214
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:52,320
>> And I move again and I do another one.
 

3215
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:56,229
>> And I move again and I do another one.
Okay. And all you need is that. You

3216
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:56,239
Okay. And all you need is that. You
 

3217
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,310
Okay. And all you need is that. You
don't need the 360s we're doing. We're

3218
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:58,320
don't need the 360s we're doing. We're
 

3219
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:01,030
don't need the 360s we're doing. We're
just using that to prolongate

3220
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:01,040
just using that to prolongate
 

3221
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,870
just using that to prolongate
the skill development. 90 degree

3222
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:02,880
the skill development. 90 degree
 

3223
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,870
the skill development. 90 degree
fluctuation. Okay. All right. Try it

3224
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:04,880
fluctuation. Okay. All right. Try it
 

3225
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:14,070
fluctuation. Okay. All right. Try it
again.

3226
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:14,080

 

3227
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:18,310

Feel

3228
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:18,320

 

3229
01:28:18,320 --> 01:29:15,590

the foot turn.

3230
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:15,600

 

3231
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,709

Okay,

3232
01:29:18,709 --> 01:29:18,719

 

3233
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:21,750

Virginia. Let me

3234
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:21,760
Virginia. Let me
 

3235
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:27,270
Virginia. Let me
Okay, so

3236
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:27,280

 

3237
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:31,270

when I go there's her there's her heel

3238
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:31,280
when I go there's her there's her heel
 

3239
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,510
when I go there's her there's her heel
right now. That that's her foot right

3240
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:33,520
right now. That that's her foot right
 

3241
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:37,270
right now. That that's her foot right
now. Okay. And now I want you to to

3242
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:37,280
now. Okay. And now I want you to to
 

3243
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,149
now. Okay. And now I want you to to
fight that angle. Yep. There it is right

3244
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:40,159
fight that angle. Yep. There it is right
 

3245
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,910
fight that angle. Yep. There it is right
there. And then you feel the adhesion

3246
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:41,920
there. And then you feel the adhesion
 

3247
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,070
there. And then you feel the adhesion
got stickier. Do you see that? Because

3248
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,080
got stickier. Do you see that? Because
 

3249
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,149
got stickier. Do you see that? Because
because I'm doing the internals. Okay.

3250
01:29:46,149 --> 01:29:46,159
because I'm doing the internals. Okay.
 

3251
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:48,629
because I'm doing the internals. Okay.
It's not that she overpowers me. It's

3252
01:29:48,629 --> 01:29:48,639
It's not that she overpowers me. It's
 

3253
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,870
It's not that she overpowers me. It's
that that foot gets driven more into the

3254
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:50,880
that that foot gets driven more into the
 

3255
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,669
that that foot gets driven more into the
ground. Well, I want you to feel this.

3256
01:29:53,669 --> 01:29:53,679
ground. Well, I want you to feel this.
 

3257
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:56,149
ground. Well, I want you to feel this.
Okay. So, I go there. She got she

3258
01:29:56,149 --> 01:29:56,159
Okay. So, I go there. She got she
 

3259
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:59,030
Okay. So, I go there. She got she
grounded that foot already. Okay. And

3260
01:29:59,030 --> 01:29:59,040
grounded that foot already. Okay. And
 

3261
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:05,350
grounded that foot already. Okay. And
now when you resist, I just internalize.

3262
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:05,360
now when you resist, I just internalize.
 

3263
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,669
now when you resist, I just internalize.
It's not that she got back to where she

3264
01:30:07,669 --> 01:30:07,679
It's not that she got back to where she
 

3265
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:09,910
It's not that she got back to where she
was. It's not that I started trying

3266
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:09,920
was. It's not that I started trying
 

3267
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,790
was. It's not that I started trying
harder, but that foot got heavier. Do

3268
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:12,800
harder, but that foot got heavier. Do
 

3269
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,950
harder, but that foot got heavier. Do
you see that? And when that foot gets

3270
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:14,960
you see that? And when that foot gets
 

3271
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,950
you see that? And when that foot gets
heavier, the next 90° angle is going to

3272
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:18,960
heavier, the next 90° angle is going to
 

3273
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,990
heavier, the next 90° angle is going to
have a more pronounced effect. Okay? So,

3274
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:22,000
have a more pronounced effect. Okay? So,
 

3275
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,470
have a more pronounced effect. Okay? So,
make it light now. Make it light. Make

3276
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:24,480
make it light now. Make it light. Make
 

3277
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,350
make it light now. Make it light. Make
reconcile this energy here. Okay? And

3278
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:27,360
reconcile this energy here. Okay? And
 

3279
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,910
reconcile this energy here. Okay? And
I'll do try to try to release that leg a

3280
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:29,920
I'll do try to try to release that leg a
 

3281
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,950
I'll do try to try to release that leg a
little more. Lower the yong value even

3282
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:32,960
little more. Lower the yong value even
 

3283
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,990
little more. Lower the yong value even
more. There you go. Cool. Okay. Now the

3284
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:36,000
more. There you go. Cool. Okay. Now the
 

3285
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,189
more. There you go. Cool. Okay. Now the
yong value is lower and you're going to

3286
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:39,199
yong value is lower and you're going to
 

3287
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:41,590
yong value is lower and you're going to
see how indirect

3288
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:41,600
see how indirect
 

3289
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,030
see how indirect
the first 90° angle is to to this thing

3290
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:45,040
the first 90° angle is to to this thing
 

3291
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:50,229
the first 90° angle is to to this thing
that we get here.

3292
01:30:50,229 --> 01:30:50,239

 

3293
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:53,830

Okay. It kind of takes a while for the

3294
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:53,840
Okay. It kind of takes a while for the
 

3295
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:57,669
Okay. It kind of takes a while for the
center to go. Okay. So, we'll do now the

3296
01:30:57,669 --> 01:30:57,679
center to go. Okay. So, we'll do now the
 

3297
01:30:57,679 --> 01:30:59,590
center to go. Okay. So, we'll do now the
other one. You're going to do your

3298
01:30:59,590 --> 01:30:59,600
other one. You're going to do your
 

3299
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,910
other one. You're going to do your
thing. There's her foot. Then I want you

3300
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:01,920
thing. There's her foot. Then I want you
 

3301
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,629
thing. There's her foot. Then I want you
to charge it. Charge it. Cool. And then

3302
01:31:04,629 --> 01:31:04,639
to charge it. Charge it. Cool. And then
 

3303
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:07,110
to charge it. Charge it. Cool. And then
I do the same 90°. Look, her center goes

3304
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:07,120
I do the same 90°. Look, her center goes
 

3305
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,950
I do the same 90°. Look, her center goes
first.

3306
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:08,960
first.
 

3307
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:13,350
first.
Okay. You see that? So, which is why

3308
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:13,360
Okay. You see that? So, which is why
 

3309
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:16,070
Okay. You see that? So, which is why
it works. The high the more aggressive

3310
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:16,080
it works. The high the more aggressive
 

3311
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:19,110
it works. The high the more aggressive
you are, the more it's going to work

3312
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:19,120
you are, the more it's going to work
 

3313
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,350
you are, the more it's going to work
because the yong value goes up. As long

3314
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:21,360
because the yong value goes up. As long
 

3315
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,750
because the yong value goes up. As long
as I'm doing the Iikit tanden, you're

3316
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:23,760
as I'm doing the Iikit tanden, you're
 

3317
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,149
as I'm doing the Iikit tanden, you're
now more captured, not less captured.

3318
01:31:26,149 --> 01:31:26,159
now more captured, not less captured.
 

3319
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:28,470
now more captured, not less captured.
Okay? So, if you're coming in to smother

3320
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:28,480
Okay? So, if you're coming in to smother
 

3321
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:31,189
Okay? So, if you're coming in to smother
those strikes, boom, you're you're

3322
01:31:31,189 --> 01:31:31,199
those strikes, boom, you're you're
 

3323
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:33,510
those strikes, boom, you're you're
getting moved. Okay? Does that make

3324
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:33,520
getting moved. Okay? Does that make
 

3325
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:39,030
getting moved. Okay? Does that make
sense? But what was the assumption?

3326
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:39,040

 

3327
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,990

>> I can internalize her yong energy, okay?

3328
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:42,000
>> I can internalize her yong energy, okay?
 

3329
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,110
>> I can internalize her yong energy, okay?
And not come back and meet it and try to

3330
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:45,120
And not come back and meet it and try to
 

3331
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:48,149
And not come back and meet it and try to
push it. Okay? All right. Uh see where

3332
01:31:48,149 --> 01:31:48,159
push it. Okay? All right. Uh see where
 

3333
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,950
push it. Okay? All right. Uh see where
you get with that one. Try that one.

3334
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:50,960
you get with that one. Try that one.
 

3335
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,510
you get with that one. Try that one.
get to the first heel weight or the heel

3336
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:53,520
get to the first heel weight or the heel
 

3337
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,910
get to the first heel weight or the heel
the leg engaging and then have them

3338
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:55,920
the leg engaging and then have them
 

3339
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,870
the leg engaging and then have them
engage it more. Okay? See if you can

3340
01:31:58,870 --> 01:31:58,880
engage it more. Okay? See if you can
 

3341
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:18,470
engage it more. Okay? See if you can
ground that and then do the first 90°.

3342
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:18,480

 

3343
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,390

See, it's easier to move him now. It's

3344
01:32:20,390 --> 01:32:20,400
See, it's easier to move him now. It's
 

3345
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,510
See, it's easier to move him now. It's
much easier. Very good, Chris.

3346
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:23,520
much easier. Very good, Chris.
 

3347
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,510
much easier. Very good, Chris.
You got you got to internalize it. So,

3348
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:25,520
You got you got to internalize it. So,
 

3349
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:31,030
You got you got to internalize it. So,
you can't be moving before you move her.

3350
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:31,040

 

3351
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,070

>> Yes, that's it. And now it's like

3352
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:34,080
>> Yes, that's it. And now it's like
 

3353
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,550
>> Yes, that's it. And now it's like
cheating. Just like the timing the

3354
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:36,560
cheating. Just like the timing the
 

3355
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,590
cheating. Just like the timing the
timing trick is I don't I don't have a

3356
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:39,600
timing trick is I don't I don't have a
 

3357
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,590
timing trick is I don't I don't have a
timing problem. That's how I have

3358
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:41,600
timing problem. That's how I have
 

3359
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,350
timing problem. That's how I have
perfect timing. It's the same thing

3360
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:43,360
perfect timing. It's the same thing
 

3361
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:46,070
perfect timing. It's the same thing
here. If I internalize your resistance,

3362
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:46,080
here. If I internalize your resistance,
 

3363
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,790
here. If I internalize your resistance,
then I and I I'm going to have I tanden.

3364
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:48,800
then I and I I'm going to have I tanden.
 

3365
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,629
then I and I I'm going to have I tanden.
This does not take any strength at all.

3366
01:32:50,629 --> 01:32:50,639
This does not take any strength at all.
 

3367

And then he's going to up the yang
 

3377
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,390
And then he's going to up the yang
energy there. And you internalize that,

3378
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:04,400
energy there. And you internalize that,
 

3379
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,790
energy there. And you internalize that,
Andrew. And then take the 90 degrees to

3380
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:06,800
Andrew. And then take the 90 degrees to
 

3381

Now, the question is, did UK have to go

3432
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:54,000
Now, the question is, did UK have to go
 

3433
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,990
Now, the question is, did UK have to go
around?

3434
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:56,000
around?
 

3435
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,270
around?
Got got that. Or am I making them go

3436
01:34:59,270 --> 01:34:59,280
Got got that. Or am I making them go
 

3437
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,870
Got got that. Or am I making them go
around? Okay. And the other way of

3438
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:02,880
around? Okay. And the other way of
 

3439
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,350
around? Okay. And the other way of
asking that same question is could uk

3440
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:07,360
asking that same question is could uk
 

3441
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:12,070
asking that same question is could uk
just run straight out cuz if uk could

3442
01:35:12,070 --> 01:35:12,080
just run straight out cuz if uk could
 

3443
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,990
just run straight out cuz if uk could
then I wasn't making them run around me.

3444
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:16,000
then I wasn't making them run around me.
 

3445
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,950
then I wasn't making them run around me.
I was simply doing my culture of

3446
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:18,960
I was simply doing my culture of
 

3447
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,790
I was simply doing my culture of
following. Okay. Got it? Okay. So you

3448
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:22,800
following. Okay. Got it? Okay. So you
 

3449
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,910
following. Okay. Got it? Okay. So you
guys are going to come in. That hand's

3450
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:25,920
guys are going to come in. That hand's
 

3451
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,229
guys are going to come in. That hand's
not going to be there. And let's just

3452
01:35:28,229 --> 01:35:28,239
not going to be there. And let's just
 

3453
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:31,590
not going to be there. And let's just
see you run out of the technique. Okay,

3454
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:31,600
see you run out of the technique. Okay,
 

3455
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,669
see you run out of the technique. Okay,
go for it. And try to smother that elbow

3456
01:35:33,669 --> 01:35:33,679
