00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,350
positive so if you double pivot
you're not gonna get it knees to toe

190
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
you're not gonna get it knees to toe
 

191
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,990
you're not gonna get it knees to toe
drive okay let's go and breathe

192
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
drive okay let's go and breathe
 

193
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,670
drive okay let's go and breathe
okay so in terms of weight

194
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680
okay so in terms of weight
 

195
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,269
okay so in terms of weight
left foot right foot

196
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279

 

197
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,070

i'll be on the left foot you're going to

198
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
i'll be on the left foot you're going to
 

199
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,310
i'll be on the left foot you're going to
want a moment of the left foot

200
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
want a moment of the left foot
 

201
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,670
want a moment of the left foot
okay so if he if he comes into me and

202
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
okay so if he if he comes into me and
 

203
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,110
okay so if he if he comes into me and
i'm on the right foot it's

204
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
i'm on the right foot it's
 

205
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,750
i'm on the right foot it's
a little harder to ground vector if he

206
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
a little harder to ground vector if he
 

207
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,070
a little harder to ground vector if he
comes into me and on the left foot i can

208
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
comes into me and on the left foot i can
 

209
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,550
comes into me and on the left foot i can
do it

210
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
do it
 

211
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,590
do it
okay you have to account for that

212
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
okay you have to account for that
 

213
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,829
okay you have to account for that
that when you're here he's going he

214
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
that when you're here he's going he
 

215
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,710
that when you're here he's going he
might come this way

216
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
might come this way
 

217
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,190
might come this way
that's very much like when you go uh

218
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
that's very much like when you go uh
 

219
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,269
that's very much like when you go uh
coke you pull

220
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
coke you pull
 

221
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,470
coke you pull
right right foot

222
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
right right foot
 

223
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,389
right right foot
young phase rotate the left foot is

224
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
young phase rotate the left foot is
 

225
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,230
young phase rotate the left foot is
doing the ground vectoring

226
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
doing the ground vectoring
 

227
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,990
doing the ground vectoring
the left foot so not the right foot

228
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
the left foot so not the right foot
 

229
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,509
the left foot so not the right foot
not both feet not both feet

230
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
not both feet not both feet
 

231
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,550
not both feet not both feet
here so he pushes it goes into the

232
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
here so he pushes it goes into the
 

233
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,030
here so he pushes it goes into the
ground

234
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040

237
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,990

it's just a moment of surety

238
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
it's just a moment of surety
 

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,150
it's just a moment of surety
so right weight

240
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
so right weight
 

241
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,150
so right weight
boom left weight

00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
boom get that left foot
 

245
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,509
boom get that left foot
the outside foot the right foot in this

246
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
the outside foot the right foot in this
 

247
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,470
the outside foot the right foot in this
case

oh release the lower legs

270
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440

 

271
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,550

he has to come he has to come towards me

272
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560

 

273
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,389

if he's going away from me

274
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
if he's going away from me
 

275
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:28,870
if he's going away from me
that cd me

276
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
that cd me
 

277
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,630
that cd me
so if i

278
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
so if i
 

279
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,230
so if i
have to pull him

280
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240

 

281
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,829

that can't be right

282
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839

 

283
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,910

i wouldn't have to pull something that's

284
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
i wouldn't have to pull something that's
 

285
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,350
i wouldn't have to pull something that's
coming to me

286
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
coming to me
 

287
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,750
coming to me
that just has to be taken off the table

288
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760

 

289
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,389

you can have it where your uke tries to

290
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
you can have it where your uke tries to
 

291
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,069
you can have it where your uke tries to
counter

292
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
counter
 

293
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,069
counter
this position so maybe they're coming at

294
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
this position so maybe they're coming at
 

295
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,269
this position so maybe they're coming at
me

296
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
me
 

297
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,670
me
you see and he has his technique right

298
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
you see and he has his technique right
 

299
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,710
you see and he has his technique right
here

300
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720

 

301
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,550

or maybe he tries to reinforce his elbow

302
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
or maybe he tries to reinforce his elbow
 

303
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,110
or maybe he tries to reinforce his elbow
with his leg i can't go down

304
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120

 

305
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,949

that's going to create an opening for

306
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
that's going to create an opening for
 

307
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,230
that's going to create an opening for
ora

308
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240

 

309
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,430

you can also do it in kihon

310
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
you can also do it in kihon
 

311
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,710
you can also do it in kihon
when you lower the elbow his weight

312
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
when you lower the elbow his weight
 

313
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,150
when you lower the elbow his weight
starts to fall this way

314
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
starts to fall this way
 

315
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,509
starts to fall this way
because his leg swings out so his head

316
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
because his leg swings out so his head
 

317
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:40,790
because his leg swings out so his head
comes to me

318
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800

 

319
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,350

okay oh when you start to lower the

320
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
okay oh when you start to lower the
 

321
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,790
okay oh when you start to lower the
elbow

322
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
elbow
 

323
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,190
elbow
you're gonna see he comes this way and

324
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
you're gonna see he comes this way and
 

325
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,030
you're gonna see he comes this way and
it replicates

326
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
it replicates
 

327
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,150
it replicates
the ura opening okay

328
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
the ura opening okay
 

329
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,389
the ura opening okay
down not in down

330
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399

 

331
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,350

so for me beginner is i don't give them

332
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,360
so for me beginner is i don't give them
 

333
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,509
so for me beginner is i don't give them
the counter ability because they'll add

334
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
the counter ability because they'll add
 

335
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,350
the counter ability because they'll add
energy to the technique

336
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
energy to the technique
 

337
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,710
energy to the technique
and they'll fall harder okay so beginner

338
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
and they'll fall harder okay so beginner
 

339
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,389
and they'll fall harder okay so beginner
ura manifestation as it goes down

340
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
ura manifestation as it goes down
 

341
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,230
ura manifestation as it goes down
and you're gonna feel the energy go that

342
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
and you're gonna feel the energy go that
 

343
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:23,990
and you're gonna feel the energy go that
way okay

344
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,000

 

345
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,190

here it comes okay that's the energy i

346
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
here it comes okay that's the energy i
 

347
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,750
here it comes okay that's the energy i

with boom
 

351
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,230
with boom
down there i turn

352
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240

 

353
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,990

so when i when i go down and he starts

354
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
so when i when i go down and he starts
 

355
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,470
so when i when i go down and he starts
to

356
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
to
 

357
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,269
to
come here it's it is getting closer the

358
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
come here it's it is getting closer the
 

359
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,110
come here it's it is getting closer the
radius will get closer

360
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
radius will get closer
 

361
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,430
radius will get closer
so that that energy gets taken around

362
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
so that that energy gets taken around
 

363
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,870
so that that energy gets taken around
me i don't let it get closer

364
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880

721
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,149

and the same goes on this hand so

722
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:06,159
and the same goes on this hand so
 

723
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,190
and the same goes on this hand so
it's it's an adhesion that keeps that

724
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,200
it's it's an adhesion that keeps that
 

725
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,590
it's it's an adhesion that keeps that
hand from sliding

726
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:11,600
hand from sliding
 

727
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,430
hand from sliding
okay which makes me not have to grab it

728
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:15,440
okay which makes me not have to grab it
 

729
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,230
okay which makes me not have to grab it
i don't have to grab i already have

730
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
i don't have to grab i already have
 

731
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,029
i don't have to grab i already have
control

732
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:19,039
control
 

733
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,310
control
so he's in this ik adhesion and this

734
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
so he's in this ik adhesion and this
 

735
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,710
so he's in this ik adhesion and this
ik adhesion and even if he's static

736
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:26,720
ik adhesion and even if he's static
 

737
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,909
ik adhesion and even if he's static
right he's going to move even if he

738
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:29,919
right he's going to move even if he
 

739
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,110
right he's going to move even if he
pulls he's pulling out it just makes the

740
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,120
pulls he's pulling out it just makes the
 

741
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,070
pulls he's pulling out it just makes the
adhesion

742
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,080
adhesion
 

743
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,070
adhesion
uh stickier okay and if you don't have

744
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,080
uh stickier okay and if you don't have
 

745
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,590
uh stickier okay and if you don't have
that

746
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,600
that
 

747
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,870
that
you're going to have to rely on pulling

748
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
you're going to have to rely on pulling
 

749
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,269
you're going to have to rely on pulling
and then pulling doesn't work okay it

750
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:45,279
and then pulling doesn't work okay it
 

751
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,190
and then pulling doesn't work okay it
works in choreography okay

752
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
works in choreography okay
 

753
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,510
works in choreography okay
the second one is or the third one

754
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:53,520
the second one is or the third one
 

755
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,710
the second one is or the third one
uh when he hits the ground

756
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:56,720
uh when he hits the ground
 

757
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,830
uh when he hits the ground
on the energy comes up that is

758
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:00,840
on the energy comes up that is
 

759
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,789
on the energy comes up that is
projected out

760
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:04,799

 

761
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,789

yes it is guided it is redirected but

762
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:08,799
yes it is guided it is redirected but
 

763
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,510
yes it is guided it is redirected but
it's redirected with the projection

764
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:11,520
it's redirected with the projection
 

765
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,430
it's redirected with the projection
okay so saying he grab he grabbed

766
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,440
okay so saying he grab he grabbed
 

767
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,710
okay so saying he grab he grabbed
is redirected with the projection

768
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:18,720
is redirected with the projection
 

769
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,070
is redirected with the projection
okay so as i feel that

770
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,080
okay so as i feel that
 

771
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,350
okay so as i feel that
resistance right there he

772
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:25,360
resistance right there he
 

773
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,470
resistance right there he
hits that ground vector

774
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:28,480
hits that ground vector
 

775
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,269
hits that ground vector
coq projection moment that's what sends

776
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:31,279
coq projection moment that's what sends
 

777
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:31,510
coq projection moment that's what sends
him

778
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:31,520
him
 

779
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,389
him
out okay that is why the technique looks

780
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:36,399
out okay that is why the technique looks
 

781
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,310
out okay that is why the technique looks
instead of okay because he gave an

782
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
instead of okay because he gave an
 

783
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,190
instead of okay because he gave an
extra resistance and i internally

784
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,200
extra resistance and i internally
 

785
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,310
extra resistance and i internally
received it and then internally

786
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,320
received it and then internally
 

787
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,590
received it and then internally
projected it out okay so

788
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
projected it out okay so
 

789
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,029
projected it out okay so
as he's coming around that's what that

790
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,039
as he's coming around that's what that
 

791
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,830
as he's coming around that's what that
is

792
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:56,840
is
 

793
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:03,350
is
okay

794
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,360

 

795
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,909

and i carry it every time i feel this

796
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:05,919
and i carry it every time i feel this
 

797
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,909
and i carry it every time i feel this
energy the ground vectors boom

798
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:09,919

 

799
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,190

that's why it goes

800
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
that's why it goes
 

801
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,310
that's why it goes
different would be this

802
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,320

 

803
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,310

i don't need the ground vector in that

804
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:22,320
i don't need the ground vector in that
 

805
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,070
i don't need the ground vector in that
technique but i sure needed a lot of

806
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,080
technique but i sure needed a lot of
 

807
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,830
technique but i sure needed a lot of
weight and strength okay

808
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:27,840
weight and strength okay
 

809
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,710
weight and strength okay
so here i'm dropping with it there's no

810
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:30,720
so here i'm dropping with it there's no
 

811
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,470
so here i'm dropping with it there's no
way i'm projecting that

812
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:32,480
way i'm projecting that
 

813
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,070
way i'm projecting that
there's no way i'm projecting it

814
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,080

 

815
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,590

you're going to pay attention

816
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:41,600
you're going to pay attention
 

817
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,990
you're going to pay attention
i stayed out until he projected

818
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,000
i stayed out until he projected
 

819
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,389
i stayed out until he projected
boom there it is that's when i load

00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:53,600
i don't lower the lower hand i project
 

823
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,870
i don't lower the lower hand i project
to lower him

824
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:54,880
to lower him
 

825
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:06,830
to lower him
and i lower to stay with him

826
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:06,840

 

827
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,990
