a lot of Aikido we we fake that we we he
goes and we like that know only slow so

70
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,290
goes and we like that know only slow so
 

71
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,480
goes and we like that know only slow so
we want to go fast

72
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:01,490
we want to go fast
 

73
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,420
we want to go fast
eventually so I have to get used to the

74
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:04,430
eventually so I have to get used to the
 

75
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,850
eventually so I have to get used to the
idea that he blew the distal and that's

76
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:06,860
idea that he blew the distal and that's
 

77
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,059
idea that he blew the distal and that's
what happens do you understand

78
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:10,069
what happens do you understand
 

79
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:13,570
what happens do you understand
so this is drill one right I'm going to

80
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:13,580
so this is drill one right I'm going to
 

81
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,630
so this is drill one right I'm going to
push in and I keep walking

82
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:15,640
push in and I keep walking
 

83
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:30,089
push in and I keep walking
you gonna lift my balance

84
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:30,099

 

85
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:43,910

let yourself keep going in up out okay

86
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920

 

87
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,099

so I've already seen acts of

88
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:47,109
so I've already seen acts of
 

89
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:50,479
so I've already seen acts of
disengagement and that always leads to

90
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:50,489
disengagement and that always leads to
 

91
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,460
disengagement and that always leads to
disconnection okay what's the connection

92
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:53,470
disconnection okay what's the connection
 

93
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,410
disconnection okay what's the connection
that relationship between the

94
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:55,420
that relationship between the
 

95
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,449
that relationship between the
extremities of my body through the

96
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:57,459
extremities of my body through the
 

97
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,599
extremities of my body through the
center of my box okay so as I come in

98
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:00,609
center of my box okay so as I come in
 

99
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:03,599
center of my box okay so as I come in
you see that step right there that's the

100
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:03,609
you see that step right there that's the
 

101
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:04,649
you see that step right there that's the
disengagement

102
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:04,659
disengagement
 

103
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,559
disengagement
you didn't keep going in we see this a

104
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:07,569
you didn't keep going in we see this a
 

105
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,099
you didn't keep going in we see this a
lot all the time okay so so someone's

his math okay whenever I'm touching I
 

309
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,050
his math okay whenever I'm touching I
should go through that same organization

310
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:56,060
should go through that same organization
 

311
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,530
should go through that same organization
from his extremities through this Center

312

from his extremities through this Center
 

313
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,440
from his extremities through this Center
to the other extremity you see that when

314
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:02,450
to the other extremity you see that when
 

315
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,260
to the other extremity you see that when
I find the other extremity then I know I

316
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:05,270
I find the other extremity then I know I
 

317
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,350
I find the other extremity then I know I
will always have his his center whatever

318

I have to be able to feel his feet and
 

327
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,950
I have to be able to feel his feet and
that is going to allow me to not have oh

328
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:22,960
that is going to allow me to not have oh
 

329
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,320
that is going to allow me to not have oh
let go of me did not I have one foot and

330
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,330
let go of me did not I have one foot and
 

331
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,030
let go of me did not I have one foot and
I do a balance trick I have three feet

332
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,040
I do a balance trick I have three feet
 

333
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,010
I do a balance trick I have three feet
there's three feet all right I'm gonna

334
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,020
there's three feet all right I'm gonna
 

335
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,020
there's three feet all right I'm gonna
hang out here all day because I have a

336
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,030
hang out here all day because I have a
 

337
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,300
hang out here all day because I have a
better stance now than when I stand on

338
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:37,310
better stance now than when I stand on
 

339
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,910
better stance now than when I stand on
my own I am feeling his feet through

340
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
my own I am feeling his feet through
 

341
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,490
my own I am feeling his feet through
what he's touching you guys see that and

342
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:42,500
what he's touching you guys see that and
 

343
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,890
what he's touching you guys see that and
he's feeling my foot through what he's

344
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:44,900
he's feeling my foot through what he's
 

345
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,840
he's feeling my foot through what he's
touching and both of us are cutting

346
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:46,850
touching and both of us are cutting
 

347
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,700
touching and both of us are cutting
through our Center to that I'm not

348
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:48,710
through our Center to that I'm not
 

349
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,310
through our Center to that I'm not
leaning on him I'm just relating to him

350
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:53,320
leaning on him I'm just relating to him
 

351
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,100
leaning on him I'm just relating to him
okay so let's try and do that as you can

352
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,110
okay so let's try and do that as you can
 

353
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:05,050
okay so let's try and do that as you can
go another side note we don't want to

354
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:05,060
go another side note we don't want to
 

355
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,440
go another side note we don't want to
eat you to be an armbar can't control

356
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:08,450
eat you to be an armbar can't control
 

357
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,900
eat you to be an armbar can't control
someone by controlling their limb it's

358
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:10,910
someone by controlling their limb it's
 

359
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,870
someone by controlling their limb it's
low percentage but to control their body

360
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:15,880
low percentage but to control their body
 

361
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,990
low percentage but to control their body
thinking wrong think

362
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
thinking wrong think
 

363
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,840
thinking wrong think
till someone's body by gravity so we

364
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:20,850
till someone's body by gravity so we
 

365
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,970
till someone's body by gravity so we
don't want to do that also like always

366
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:22,980
don't want to do that also like always
 

367
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,009
don't want to do that also like always
we don't want to be on this stuff in

368
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:25,019
we don't want to be on this stuff in
 

369
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,309
we don't want to be on this stuff in
this linear XY axis world where he's at

370
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:28,319
this linear XY axis world where he's at
 

371
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:31,069
this linear XY axis world where he's at
12 on at 6 and then I go to 12 and maybe

372
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:31,079
12 on at 6 and then I go to 12 and maybe
 

373
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,110
12 on at 6 and then I go to 12 and maybe
I work on the diagonals that that's not

374
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
I work on the diagonals that that's not
 

375
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,379
I work on the diagonals that that's not
very sophisticated either ok so if we

376
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:36,389
very sophisticated either ok so if we
 

377
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:39,829
very sophisticated either ok so if we
get him in the last body posture he's

378
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
get him in the last body posture he's
 

379
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,449
get him in the last body posture he's
like this and we have again generated

380
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:44,459
like this and we have again generated
 

381
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:47,210
like this and we have again generated
that body posture that allows me to

382
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,220
that body posture that allows me to
 

383
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,150
that body posture that allows me to
affect his balance right so his head is

384
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
affect his balance right so his head is
 

385
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
affect his balance right so his head is
down and when I push this hip and rotate

386
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,170
down and when I push this hip and rotate
 

387
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,699
down and when I push this hip and rotate
him he will fall so you do your best

388
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:55,709
him he will fall so you do your best
 

389
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:58,249
him he will fall so you do your best
let go this side I'm going to have this

390
00:11:58,249 --> 00:11:58,259
let go this side I'm going to have this
 

391
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,410
let go this side I'm going to have this
head go this way and his hip go over

392
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:00,420
head go this way and his hip go over
 

393
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,449
head go this way and his hip go over
that way and then he loses the mountain

394
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:02,459
that way and then he loses the mountain
 

395
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:07,850
that way and then he loses the mountain
see that if we do it again and you're

396
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:07,860
see that if we do it again and you're
 

397
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,350
see that if we do it again and you're
going to be very athletic I'm going to

398
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
going to be very athletic I'm going to
 

399
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,879
going to be very athletic I'm going to
just push it that way and I don't want

400
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:10,889
just push it that way and I don't want
 

401
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:12,350
just push it that way and I don't want
you to follow when she got off if you

402
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,360
you to follow when she got off if you
 

403
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,280
you to follow when she got off if you
read everything you keep your balance

404
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,290
read everything you keep your balance
 

405
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,999
read everything you keep your balance
see that okay and you know what you do

406
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:20,009
see that okay and you know what you do
 

407
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:23,230
see that okay and you know what you do
whatever it takes to keep development

408
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:23,240
whatever it takes to keep development
 

409
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,019
whatever it takes to keep development
okay so this is always what we you get a

410
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:27,029
okay so this is always what we you get a
 

411
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:29,540
okay so this is always what we you get a
bit of diagonal the head goes one way

412
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:29,550
bit of diagonal the head goes one way
 

413
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,009
bit of diagonal the head goes one way
and the hip will go along the way in the

414
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:31,019
and the hip will go along the way in the
 

415
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,939
and the hip will go along the way in the
garbage ball okay so as they go to this

416
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:34,949
garbage ball okay so as they go to this
 

417
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:37,100
garbage ball okay so as they go to this
technique then I don't want to go like

418
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,110
technique then I don't want to go like
 

419
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,610
technique then I don't want to go like
this straight you see it's not going on

420
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:40,620
this straight you see it's not going on
 

421
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,329
this straight you see it's not going on
the third note I want to do what looks

422
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:44,339
the third note I want to do what looks
 

423
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:50,250
the third note I want to do what looks
obvious

424
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:50,260

 

425
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:57,060

so my pattern is in I'm sorry out in but

426
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,070
so my pattern is in I'm sorry out in but
 

427
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,960
so my pattern is in I'm sorry out in but
we're going to go that way

428
00:12:59,960 --> 00:12:59,970

 

429
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:11,450

boom here

430
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:11,460

 

431
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,630

and in my drill it should end up with

432
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:15,640
and in my drill it should end up with
 

433
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,990
and in my drill it should end up with
his elbow right in my store lines find

434
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,000
his elbow right in my store lines find
 

435
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,310
his elbow right in my store lines find
life right underneath me

436
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
life right underneath me
 

437
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:32,450
life right underneath me

as he's falling I controlling this elbow
it doesn't take any energy just have to

442
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:44,700
it doesn't take any energy just have to
 

443
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,350
it doesn't take any energy just have to
do it as he swallowed if you wait

444
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:50,360
do it as he swallowed if you wait
 

445
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,270
do it as he swallowed if you wait
there'll be a lot of external energy

446
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:53,280
there'll be a lot of external energy
 

447
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,670
there'll be a lot of external energy
from the centripetal energy of the

448
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
from the centripetal energy of the

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:05,670
spiral so our drill is down and it ends
 

451
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,880
spiral so our drill is down and it ends
up right under me that tells me I had

452
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:07,890
up right under me that tells me I had
 

453
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:18,980
up right under me that tells me I had
weight over his elbow okay let's try

454
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:18,990
weight over his elbow okay let's try
 

455
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,590
weight over his elbow okay let's try
that drill

456
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:20,600
that drill

go back and watch that young video of

470
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:39,459
go back and watch that young video of
 

471
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:41,369
go back and watch that young video of
the lower Yangtze okay

472
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:41,379
the lower Yangtze okay
 

473
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,879
the lower Yangtze okay
all right so you saw that I was doing it

474
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:44,889
all right so you saw that I was doing it
 

475
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:47,100
all right so you saw that I was doing it
with a finger so clearly though I'm not

476
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,110
with a finger so clearly though I'm not
 

477
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,919
with a finger so clearly though I'm not
using the arm to take him down okay

478
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:49,929
using the arm to take him down okay
 

479
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:53,579
using the arm to take him down okay
so we're gonna check for that so we need

480
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:53,589
so we're gonna check for that so we need
 

481
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:58,350
so we're gonna check for that so we need
to come to the ground that we found

482
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:58,360
to come to the ground that we found
 

483
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,739
to come to the ground that we found
about his wrist the other hand will do
