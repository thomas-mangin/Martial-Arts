let's say eight people like the the

76
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
let's say eight people like the the
 

77
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,550
let's say eight people like the the
the

78
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
the
 

79
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,710
the
amount of people i've chosen to

80
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
amount of people i've chosen to
 

81
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,429
amount of people i've chosen to
for this uh

82
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
for this uh
 

83
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,270
for this uh
program is is eight attackers

84
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
program is is eight attackers
 

85
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,870
program is is eight attackers
you're the ninth one

86
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880

 

87
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,910

so

88
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
so
 

89
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,109
so
with the class now being much smaller it

90
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
with the class now being much smaller it
 

91
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,429
with the class now being much smaller it
appears to be worldwide

92
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
appears to be worldwide
 

93
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,109
appears to be worldwide
you can do it on

94
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
you can do it on
 

95
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,950
you can do it on

and i suggest that you systematically
 

99

and i suggest that you systematically
start with a um very slow

100
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
start with a um very slow
 

101
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,790
start with a um very slow
and work through a process

102
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
and work through a process
 

103
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,949
and work through a process
a systematic process that you can

104
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
a systematic process that you can
 

105
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,710
a systematic process that you can
understand

106
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
understand
 

107
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,350
understand
you know make it a formula that you

108
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
you know make it a formula that you
 

109
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,390
you know make it a formula that you
finally work through and see how it

110
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
finally work through and see how it
 

111
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,430
finally work through and see how it
works

112
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
works
 

113
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,390
works

okay so that's the first one
 

207
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,069
okay so that's the first one
i'll just read it

208
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
i'll just read it
 

209
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,590
i'll just read it
you're you're the red dot by the way

210
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600

 

211
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,950

so

212
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
so
 

213
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,990
so
number one

214
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000

 

215
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,629

this person comes to you so they're the

216
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
this person comes to you so they're the
 

217
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,550
this person comes to you so they're the
first one to attack

218
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
first one to attack
 

219
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,150
first one to attack

you throw them you turn you throw them
 

221
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,870
you throw them you turn you throw them
to number two

222
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
to number two
 

223
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,950
to number two
hopefully you use them like a bowling

224
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
hopefully you use them like a bowling
 

225
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,990
hopefully you use them like a bowling
pit ball and it knocks the skittle down

226
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
pit ball and it knocks the skittle down
 

227
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,350
pit ball and it knocks the skittle down
it knocks them down or it it gives you

228
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
it knocks them down or it it gives you
 

229
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,310
it knocks them down or it it gives you
time

230
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
time
 

231
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,550
time
to um

232
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
to um
 

233
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,390
to um
be ready for the others

234
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400

 

235
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,230

okay so

236
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
okay so
 

237
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,230
okay so
they come at one

238
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
they come at one
 

239
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,710
they come at one
you throw to two

240
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
you throw to two
 

241
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,629
you throw to two
and three

242
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
and three
 

243
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,830
and three
is the next

244
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840
is the next
 

245
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,790
is the next
person to two

246
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800

 

247
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,430

and

248
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440

 

249
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,510

you can either throw them at two or

250
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
you can either throw them at two or
 

251
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,189
you can either throw them at two or
three depending on what you sense is the

252
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
three depending on what you sense is the
 

253
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,550
three depending on what you sense is the
threat

254
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560

 

255
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,350

this is going back just a little by

256
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
this is going back just a little by
 

257
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,790
this is going back just a little by
saying

258
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
saying
 

259
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,870
saying
you know you're in the middle

260
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
you know you're in the middle
 

261
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,550
you know you're in the middle
they're all there

262
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
they're all there
 

263
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,590
they're all there
whoever decides to attack you first

264
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
whoever decides to attack you first
 

265
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,150
whoever decides to attack you first
may not always be the closest person to

266
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
may not always be the closest person to
 

267
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,189
may not always be the closest person to
you but whoever attacks you first

268
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
you but whoever attacks you first
 

269
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,990
you but whoever attacks you first
is the one that you take so these

270
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
is the one that you take so these
 

271
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,749
is the one that you take so these
uh examples

272
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
uh examples
 

273
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,270
uh examples
are exactly what they say

274
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280

 

275
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,749

so after connecting

276
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
so after connecting
 

277
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,590
so after connecting
with three

278
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600

 

279
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,070

i'm just going back

280
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080

 

281
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,629

explain this one

282
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
explain this one
 

283
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,510
explain this one
you've thrown number one into two

284
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
you've thrown number one into two
 

285
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,550
you've thrown number one into two
you then you'll see the two-way hours

286
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
you then you'll see the two-way hours
 

287
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,990
you then you'll see the two-way hours
you then

288
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
you then
 

289
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,870
you then
yourself go to number three

290
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
yourself go to number three
 

291
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,029
yourself go to number three
okay you must go to number three do not

292
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
okay you must go to number three do not
 

293
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,870
okay you must go to number three do not
stand in the middle

294
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
stand in the middle
 

295
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,749
stand in the middle
or else you'll be defeated

296
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
or else you'll be defeated
 

297
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,629
or else you'll be defeated
once you go to number three

298
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
once you go to number three
 

299
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,029
once you go to number three
you are then

300
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039

 

301
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,590

on the outside of the circle

302
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600

 

303
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,270

okay

304
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
okay
 

305
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,070
okay
so

306
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
so
 

307
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,990
so
i'm hoping my words will explain

308
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
i'm hoping my words will explain
 

309
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,469
i'm hoping my words will explain
everything to you

310
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
everything to you
 

311
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,430
everything to you
in the cards

312
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440

 

313
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,629

you will go to number three and possibly

314
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
you will go to number three and possibly
 

315
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,830
you will go to number three and possibly
as

316
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
as
 

317
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,830
as
um

318
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
um
 

319
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,070
um
on the other side you've already from

320
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
on the other side you've already from
 

321
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,309
on the other side you've already from
one you've knocked over two or you've

322
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319
one you've knocked over two or you've
 

323
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,070
one you've knocked over two or you've
given them something to think about

324
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
given them something to think about
 

325
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,150
given them something to think about
they're on the floor trying to gather

326
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
they're on the floor trying to gather
 

327
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,430
they're on the floor trying to gather
themself or get out of the way

328
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
themself or get out of the way
 

329
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,550
themself or get out of the way
and three throw into number four because

330
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
and three throw into number four because
 

331
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,390
and three throw into number four because
you're on the outside they're the

332
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
you're on the outside they're the
 

333
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:28,150
you're on the outside they're the
closest one to you

334
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160

 

335
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,830

so now you're here on the outer part

336
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
so now you're here on the outer part
 

337
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,510
so now you're here on the outer part
of the circle

338
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
of the circle
 

339
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,550
of the circle
so even though they're wanting to attack

340
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
so even though they're wanting to attack
 

341
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,510
so even though they're wanting to attack
you

342
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
you
 

343
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,230
you
you have as much advantage as any of

344
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
you have as much advantage as any of
 

345
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,950
you have as much advantage as any of
them because you're on the outer circle

346
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
them because you're on the outer circle
 

347
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,350
them because you're on the outer circle
you may not about to run away at this

348
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
you may not about to run away at this
 

349
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,350
you may not about to run away at this
point even though you're out of the

350
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
point even though you're out of the
 

351
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,710
point even though you're out of the
threat

352
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
threat
 

353
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,869
threat
they might all start now deciding to

354
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
they might all start now deciding to
 

355
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,710
they might all start now deciding to
descend on you

356
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
descend on you
 

357
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,950
descend on you
so you have to become

358
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
so you have to become
 

359
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,390
so you have to become
a weaver where you weave in and out and

360
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
a weaver where you weave in and out and
 

361
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,670
a weaver where you weave in and out and
you go

362
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
you go
 

363
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,070
you go
from point four

364
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
from point four
 

365
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,629
from point four
again these are only examples you go

366
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
again these are only examples you go
 

367
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:15,430
again these are only examples you go
from point four

368
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440

 

369
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,990

to point five

370
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000

 

371
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,029

you must go from four to five very fast

372
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
you must go from four to five very fast
 

373
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,189
you must go from four to five very fast
because they're all going to be coming

374
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
because they're all going to be coming
 

375
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,270
because they're all going to be coming
at you at 0.4

376
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
at you at 0.4
 

377
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,709
at you at 0.4
but because you swiftly move to 0.5 you

378
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
but because you swiftly move to 0.5 you
 

379
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,630
but because you swiftly move to 0.5 you
then choose

380
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
then choose
 

381
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,630
then choose
like with number four

382
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
like with number four
 

383
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,790
like with number four
you and number three

384
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
you and number three
 

385
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,190
you and number three
you start choosing them you could think

386
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
you start choosing them you could think
 

387
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,589
you start choosing them you could think
that um

388
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
that um
 

389
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,990
that um
you be you've become the attack all of a

390
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
you be you've become the attack all of a
 

391
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,450
you be you've become the attack all of a
sudden but the point is

392
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:47,460
sudden but the point is
 

393
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,870

399
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,710
place so it's already been set in motion
so you then need to start weaving in and

400
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
so you then need to start weaving in and
 

401
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,509
so you then need to start weaving in and
out

out
 

403
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:05,430

you
like the other four

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
like the other four
 

425
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,269
like the other four
who are all standing still

you're on the outside but by then you've

430
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
you're on the outside but by then you've
 

431
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,550
you're on the outside but by then you've
gained speed in your movement and you're

432
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
gained speed in your movement and you're
 

433
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,190
gained speed in your movement and you're
you're swerving in and out so as they

at point five let's say the the closest

438
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,200
at point five let's say the the closest
 

439
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,509
at point five let's say the the closest
arrow for argument's sake

arrow for argument's sake
 

441
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:58,949
arrow for argument's sake
let me just put a six on there

442
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959

 

443
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,750

so

444
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
so
 

445
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,790
so
at

446
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
at
 

447
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,389
at
from five

448
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
from five
 

449
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,110
from five
they all come at you you actually charge

450
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
they all come at you you actually charge
 

451
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,829
they all come at you you actually charge
as fast as you can and go to six and

452
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
as fast as you can and go to six and
 

453
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,430
as fast as you can and go to six and
throw them into

454
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
throw them into
 

455
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,150
throw them into
seven or eight

456
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
seven or eight
 

457
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,030
seven or eight
or whoever's the biggest threat perhaps

458
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
or whoever's the biggest threat perhaps
 

459
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,670
or whoever's the biggest threat perhaps
one of the others that you threw earlier

460
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
one of the others that you threw earlier
 

461
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,190
one of the others that you threw earlier
has regained their self and they're

462
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
has regained their self and they're
 

463
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,310
has regained their self and they're
coming back at you

464
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320

 

465
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,630

so i'm hoping that that's explained

466
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
so i'm hoping that that's explained
 

467
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,750
so i'm hoping that that's explained
everything to you this goes into really

468
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
everything to you this goes into really
 

469
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,670
everything to you this goes into really
the finalization

470
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
the finalization
 

471
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,389
the finalization
where

472
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
where
 

473
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,470
where
they've all

474
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
they've all
 

475
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,630
they've all
been thrown

476
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
been thrown
 

477
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,150
been thrown
because this is

478
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
because this is
 

479
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,550
because this is
you must do all this at very high speed

480
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
you must do all this at very high speed
 

481
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,590
you must do all this at very high speed
and that's why again the level of

482
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
and that's why again the level of
 

483
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,230
and that's why again the level of
black belts i said about third or fourth

484
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
black belts i said about third or fourth
 

485
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,590
black belts i said about third or fourth
down really i put fourth down on here

486
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
down really i put fourth down on here
 

487
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,150
down really i put fourth down on here
okay so you you're there you can run

488

okay so you you're there you can run
away

490
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
away
 

491
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,910
away
to safety or get yourself out of

492
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
to safety or get yourself out of
 

493
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,470
to safety or get yourself out of
problems they're all in the heap

494
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
problems they're all in the heap
 

495
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,350

that's how you hopefully you've ever
 

499
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,550
that's how you hopefully you've ever
neutralized them all so they have no

500
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
neutralized them all so they have no
 

501
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,630
neutralized them all so they have no
threat to you

502
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
threat to you
 

503
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,590
threat to you

can go clockwise there's no problem it
 

681
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,030

just depends you know whatever way you

just depends you know whatever way you
 

683
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,590
just depends you know whatever way you
turn if you turn clockwise then keep

684

turn if you turn clockwise then keep
 

685
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,710
turn if you turn clockwise then keep
going clockwise you can turn clockwise

686
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
going clockwise you can turn clockwise
 

687
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,750
going clockwise you can turn clockwise
then turn anti-clockwise but the more

688
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
then turn anti-clockwise but the more
 

689
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,470
then turn anti-clockwise but the more
turning you do and the more confusing of

690
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,480
