what none of us are doing is two people

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:03,540
what none of us are doing is two people
 

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,170
what none of us are doing is two people
are supposed to become one

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:06,180
are supposed to become one
 

5
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,650
are supposed to become one
I want every time

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:09,660
I want every time
 

7
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,870
I want every time
for that to be there so I can do a

8
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:11,880
for that to be there so I can do a
 

9
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,890
for that to be there so I can do a
technique

10
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:12,900
technique
 

11
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,230
technique
I want it every time I don't want it now

12
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:15,240
I want it every time I don't want it now

00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:31,619

 

15
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,630

now I can pick my techniques now can I

16
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:35,640
now I can pick my techniques now can I
 

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,490
now I can pick my techniques now can I
but what am I doing different can

18
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:37,500
but what am I doing different can
 

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,770
but what am I doing different can
anybody see what I'm doing

20
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:39,780
anybody see what I'm doing

you with them I'm meeting him rather
than saying you come over and grab this

26
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
than saying you come over and grab this
 

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,850
than saying you come over and grab this
so what you're doing is you're doing

28
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:49,860
so what you're doing is you're doing
 

29
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,650
so what you're doing is you're doing
that and going nicely out to the side

30
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:51,660
that and going nicely out to the side
 

31
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,510
that and going nicely out to the side
and going on

32
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
and going on
 

33
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,729
and going on
he's worked out by now you've been five

34
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:55,739
he's worked out by now you've been five
 

35
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,069
he's worked out by now you've been five
minutes into the technique he's worked

36
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
minutes into the technique he's worked
 

37
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,930
minutes into the technique he's worked
out in the best to follow that way

38
00:00:59,930 --> 00:00:59,940
out in the best to follow that way
 

39
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,609
out in the best to follow that way
you've got a better training

40
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:04,619

 

41
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,830

that happens to us all without us even

42
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:06,840
that happens to us all without us even
 

43
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,109
that happens to us all without us even
knowing it

44
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
knowing it
 

45
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,330
knowing it
so what I'm doing differently is I'm

46
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:11,340
so what I'm doing differently is I'm
 

47
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,070
so what I'm doing differently is I'm
actually saying I'd like you to have

48
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,080
actually saying I'd like you to have
 

49
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,590
actually saying I'd like you to have
this and he's going oh that life's

50
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
this and he's going oh that life's
 

51
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,850
this and he's going oh that life's
quicker than I thought

52
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:16,860
quicker than I thought
 

53
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,850
quicker than I thought
but they are in contemplating this he

54
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:19,860
but they are in contemplating this he
 

55
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,649
but they are in contemplating this he
thought oh that arrived quicker than I

56
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:21,659
thought oh that arrived quicker than I
 

57
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,090
thought oh that arrived quicker than I
thought

58
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,100
thought
 

59
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,390
thought
so two people are becoming one

60
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:29,400

 

61
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,550

because I'm doing my little bit as well

62
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:31,560
because I'm doing my little bit as well
 

63
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,289
because I'm doing my little bit as well
as he's doing his

64
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:33,299
as he's doing his
 

65
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,749
as he's doing his
so every time

66
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
so every time
 

67
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,289
so every time
I will get the hand I needed

68
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:39,299
I will get the hand I needed
 

69
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:49,429
I will get the hand I needed
when I go this way

70
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439

 

71
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,310

all right so we'll try again

72
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
all right so we'll try again
 

73
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,490
all right so we'll try again
if you go too deep then you're giving up

74
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:55,500
if you go too deep then you're giving up
 

75
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,830
if you go too deep then you're giving up
some of your sanction your awareness

76
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
some of your sanction your awareness
 

77
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,289
some of your sanction your awareness
you're coming up too much if you don't

78
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:00,299
you're coming up too much if you don't
 

79
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,109
you're coming up too much if you don't
know enough you'll get stuck here and

80
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
know enough you'll get stuck here and
 

81
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,630
know enough you'll get stuck here and
you'll you'll be starting from a key on

82
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,640
you'll you'll be starting from a key on
 

83
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,150
you'll you'll be starting from a key on
a strong position it's okay but you've

84
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
a strong position it's okay but you've
 

85
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,370
a strong position it's okay but you've
got to do a strong techniques

86
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:10,380
got to do a strong techniques
 

87
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,089
got to do a strong techniques
any plans informed

88

any plans informed
 

89
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:18,050
any plans informed
you've got to meet him halfway

90
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,060
