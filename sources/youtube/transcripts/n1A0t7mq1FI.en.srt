00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,430

so for example we know at the

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,440
so for example we know at the
 

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,150
so for example we know at the
energetic component I'm going to spiral

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,160
energetic component I'm going to spiral
 

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,190
energetic component I'm going to spiral
rotate the lower

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,200

 

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,790

tonden that means I got

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
tonden that means I got
 

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,109
tonden that means I got
to spin it down spin it right spin it

10
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:20,119
to spin it down spin it right spin it
 

11
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:23,870
to spin it down spin it right spin it
left spin it up okay and the symbol for

12
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:23,880
left spin it up okay and the symbol for
 

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,470
left spin it up okay and the symbol for
that is

14
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:27,480

 

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,429

this at the physical Marshall level

16
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
this at the physical Marshall level
 

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,750
this at the physical Marshall level
this is also the symbol for a constant

18
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:34,760
this is also the symbol for a constant
 

19
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,590
this is also the symbol for a constant
90 90° fluctuation to the angle of

20
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
90 90° fluctuation to the angle of
 

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,350
90 90° fluctuation to the angle of
resistance so my patterns have to end

22
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:44,360
resistance so my patterns have to end
 

23
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,670
resistance so my patterns have to end
up or they will end up for both Marshal

24
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:48,680
up or they will end up for both Marshal
 

25
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,389
up or they will end up for both Marshal
and energetic

26
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
and energetic
 

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,310
and energetic
reasons tracing this figure eight and so

28
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
reasons tracing this figure eight and so
 

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,069
reasons tracing this figure eight and so
when we do the second part of EO you're

30
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:57,079
when we do the second part of EO you're
 

31
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,549
when we do the second part of EO you're
going to see how we did that so in this

32
00:00:59,549 --> 00:00:59,559
going to see how we did that so in this
 

33
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,430
going to see how we did that so in this
version

34
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
version
 

35
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,429
version
if uh for myi if UK is coming in this

36
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439
if uh for myi if UK is coming in this
 

37
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,830
if uh for myi if UK is coming in this
way and let's say my left hand is

38
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:08,840
way and let's say my left hand is
 

39
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,109
way and let's say my left hand is
forward and I'm going to start with this

40
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:12,119
forward and I'm going to start with this
 

41
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,830
forward and I'm going to start with this
kind of

42
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
kind of
 

43
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,630
kind of
shape but very quickly this part comes

44
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:17,640
shape but very quickly this part comes
 

45
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,149
shape but very quickly this part comes
around and I start making this figure

46
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:21,159
around and I start making this figure
 

47
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,270
around and I start making this figure
eight okay so here it is where I enter

48
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,280
eight okay so here it is where I enter
 

49
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,990
eight okay so here it is where I enter
and then they're going to come around me

50
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
and then they're going to come around me
 

51
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,670
and then they're going to come around me
again okay

52
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:30,680
again okay
 

53
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,870
again okay
and then because you have to keep that

54
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
and then because you have to keep that
 

55
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,910
and then because you have to keep that
shape you're going to do it again over

56
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
shape you're going to do it again over
 

57
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,910
shape you're going to do it again over
here okay you do it again over here so

58
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:38,920
here okay you do it again over here so
 

59
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,550
here okay you do it again over here so
you kind of have in this variation two

60
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:41,560
you kind of have in this variation two
 

61
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,510
you kind of have in this variation two
fig two figure eights going and this

62
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:44,520
fig two figure eights going and this
 

63
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:56,910
fig two figure eights going and this
this is where the technique will

64
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:56,920

 

65
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,510

end again from my me home and I goess

66
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,520
end again from my me home and I goess
 

67
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,109
end again from my me home and I goess
and now I have to go this way and I've

68
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
and now I have to go this way and I've
 

69
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,990
and now I have to go this way and I've
went this way I'm not going to pull him

70
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,000
went this way I'm not going to pull him
 

71
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,229
went this way I'm not going to pull him
over and I am not going to some people

72
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
over and I am not going to some people
 

73
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,830
over and I am not going to some people
think they're going around and not

74
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:14,840
think they're going around and not
 

75
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,070
think they're going around and not
pulling him but they're

76
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
pulling him but they're
 

77
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,990
pulling him but they're
not so when I step over here like

78
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,000
not so when I step over here like
 

79
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,790
not so when I step over here like
this I'm pulling

80
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800

 

81
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,430

him I have to half moon

82
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
him I have to half moon
 

83
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,070
him I have to half moon
always so my foot will come by the other

84
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,080
always so my foot will come by the other
 

85
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,309
always so my foot will come by the other
foot and now I do another Ed me over

86
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:39,319
foot and now I do another Ed me over
 

87
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:42,509
foot and now I do another Ed me over
here on that same

88
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:42,519
here on that same
 

89
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,229
here on that same
turn so over here I come by I have

90
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:47,239
turn so over here I come by I have
 

91
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:48,309
turn so over here I come by I have
another

92
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
another
 

93
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,309
another
entry then the technique ends you bring

94
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:51,319
entry then the technique ends you bring
 

95
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,589
entry then the technique ends you bring
your foot

96
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
your foot
 

97
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:04,710
your foot
over and you do Co Yoku

98
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720

 

99
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,030

two

100
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,040

 

101
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:43,310

three different

102
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:43,320

 

103
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:54,030

[Music]

104
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,040

 

105
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,470

try Okay so let's let's look at how I'm

106
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
try Okay so let's let's look at how I'm
 

107
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,030
try Okay so let's let's look at how I'm
moving so so this knee has to go to the

108
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,040
moving so so this knee has to go to the
 

109
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,710
moving so so this knee has to go to the
Yong which means my knee goes over my

110
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:07,720
Yong which means my knee goes over my
 

111
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,350
Yong which means my knee goes over my
toes and now I have a angle in my lower

112
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:12,360
toes and now I have a angle in my lower
 

113
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,189
toes and now I have a angle in my lower
leg that I can drive my hips

114
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:16,199
leg that I can drive my hips
 

115
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,189
leg that I can drive my hips
into so the same thing here knee to toes

116
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
into so the same thing here knee to toes
 

117
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,749
into so the same thing here knee to toes
then I can drive

118
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
then I can drive
 

119
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,430
then I can drive
in

120
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
in
 

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,029
in
out knee to

122
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:28,039
out knee to
 

123
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:41,070
out knee to
toes then I come in

124
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:41,080

 

125
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,270

here not here

126
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:44,280
here not here
 

127
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,710
here not here
so uh when I try to step I want you to

128
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:47,720
so uh when I try to step I want you to
 

129
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,990
so uh when I try to step I want you to
push push me over so here I

130
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,000
push push me over so here I
 

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,909
push push me over so here I
am kind I you have to go here then I can

132
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
am kind I you have to go here then I can
 

133
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,629
am kind I you have to go here then I can
do

134
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639

 

135
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:05,029

it same thing here he he pushes on me I

136
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
it same thing here he he pushes on me I
 

137
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,870
it same thing here he he pushes on me I
can't get over there can't get that foot

138
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:07,880
can't get over there can't get that foot
 

139
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,510
can't get over there can't get that foot
off so I have to go here first one here

140
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
off so I have to go here first one here
 

141
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:21,350
off so I have to go here first one here
and then around easy here here

142
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
and then around easy here here
 

143
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,590
and then around easy here here
down okay so bring that knee into y so

144
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
down okay so bring that knee into y so
 

145
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,710
down okay so bring that knee into y so
that you could

146
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:27,720
that you could
 

147
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,950
that you could
aumi okay now we'll look at the rate so

148
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
aumi okay now we'll look at the rate so
 

149
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,790
aumi okay now we'll look at the rate so
the rate is

150
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:35,800

 

151
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,390

constant whether it's slow or fast I'm

152
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:39,400
constant whether it's slow or fast I'm
 

153
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,390
constant whether it's slow or fast I'm
not going to go

154
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:41,400
not going to go
 

155
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,990
not going to go
here

156
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,000
here
 

157
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,350
here
stop then go you're having to stop

158
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:46,360
stop then go you're having to stop
 

159
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,070
stop then go you're having to stop
because you can't

160
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
because you can't
 

161
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,510
because you can't
ground the rate is constant I move at a

162
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
ground the rate is constant I move at a
 

163
00:05:51,520 --> 00:06:14,870
ground the rate is constant I move at a
constant rate

164
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880

either it's slow or
quick constant R okay the Keon they're

168
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
quick constant R okay the Keon they're
 

169
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,189
quick constant R okay the Keon they're
like I said they have like a mythical

170
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199

tell you a bunch of things all at once
hidden okay so for as I'm doing this

178
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:36,840
hidden okay so for as I'm doing this
 

179
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,670
hidden okay so for as I'm doing this
pattern that I have just the foot

180
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:38,680
pattern that I have just the foot
 

181
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,510
pattern that I have just the foot
pattern that's all I want to look at we

182
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
pattern that's all I want to look at we
 

183
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,870
pattern that's all I want to look at we
know I could snap the arm here

184
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
know I could snap the arm here
 

185
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,350
know I could snap the arm here
okay and uh as I come

186
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:48,360
okay and uh as I come
 

187
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,670
okay and uh as I come
around stay there just tap when you

188
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:50,680
around stay there just tap when you
 

189
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,870
around stay there just tap when you
don't like it okay so as I come around

190
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:53,880
don't like it okay so as I come around
 

191
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,710
don't like it okay so as I come around
I'm going to rip this shoulder off so on

192
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
I'm going to rip this shoulder off so on
 

193
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,150
I'm going to rip this shoulder off so on
this foot maneuver here

194
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
this foot maneuver here
 

195
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,830
this foot maneuver here
that one I have this chicken wing I just

196
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:04,840
that one I have this chicken wing I just
 

197
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,909
that one I have this chicken wing I just
pull the whole shoulder off

198
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
pull the whole shoulder off
 

199
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,390
pull the whole shoulder off
okay that's what you have here we let it

200
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
okay that's what you have here we let it
 

201
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,189
okay that's what you have here we let it
out in the keyone but it's there this

202
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
out in the keyone but it's there this
 

203
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,189
out in the keyone but it's there this
pressure here as I'm moving with my body

204
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:16,199
pressure here as I'm moving with my body
 

205
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,430
pressure here as I'm moving with my body
makes that

206
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
makes that
 

207
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,350
makes that
happen now you have another mythical

208
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
happen now you have another mythical
 

209
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,270
happen now you have another mythical
element I can break the arm at the other

210
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
element I can break the arm at the other
 

211
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,350
element I can break the arm at the other
angle so as I come this way you'll tap

212
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:28,360
angle so as I come this way you'll tap
 

213
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,350
angle so as I come this way you'll tap
when he doesn't like it

214
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:30,360
when he doesn't like it
 

215
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,150
when he doesn't like it
this one's going forward this one was

216
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:33,160
this one's going forward this one was
 

217
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,790
this one's going forward this one was
going back this way now this one's going

218
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
going back this way now this one's going
 

219
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,189
going back this way now this one's going
forward this way I can rip the shoulder

220
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
forward this way I can rip the shoulder
 

221
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,710
forward this way I can rip the shoulder
off at that angle too okay I'm going to

222
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
off at that angle too okay I'm going to
 

223
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,469
off at that angle too okay I'm going to
let him turn out a little turn with me

224
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
let him turn out a little turn with me
 

225
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,070
let him turn out a little turn with me
which I often let UK do that so I don't

226
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,080
which I often let UK do that so I don't
 

227
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,070
which I often let UK do that so I don't
rip the shoulder but here's that step

228
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
rip the shoulder but here's that step
 

229
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,869
rip the shoulder but here's that step
out and here's the break another break

230
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:55,879
out and here's the break another break
 

231
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,469
out and here's the break another break
this time go back

232
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
this time go back
 

233
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,430
this time go back
not from the top

234
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:02,440
not from the top
 

235
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,189
not from the top
down go back but this one's from the

236
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:06,199
down go back but this one's from the
 

237
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,550
down go back but this one's from the
inside this way right learn that too

238
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:11,560
inside this way right learn that too
 

239
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:20,189
inside this way right learn that too
okay then the c ends in

240
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:20,199

 

241
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,309

coku

242
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
coku
 

243
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,390
coku
additionally when I have Arm

244
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:25,400
additionally when I have Arm
 

245
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,469
additionally when I have Arm
Control on

246
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:27,479
Control on
 

247
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,830
Control on
somebody that meaning I'm controlling

248
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
somebody that meaning I'm controlling
 

249
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,670
somebody that meaning I'm controlling
the center from from the arm he can

250
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
the center from from the arm he can
 

251
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,190
the center from from the arm he can
either stop me from coming in you see

252
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,200
either stop me from coming in you see
 

253
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,230
either stop me from coming in you see
and so here's that

254
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
and so here's that
 

255
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,909
and so here's that
line I can't get there so when I move

256
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
line I can't get there so when I move
 

257
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,070
line I can't get there so when I move
over here it's not there anymore I I

258
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:47,080
over here it's not there anymore I I
 

259
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,470
over here it's not there anymore I I
went around the

260
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
went around the
 

261
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,030
went around the
resistance and let's say you're still

262
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
resistance and let's say you're still
 

263
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,190
resistance and let's say you're still
pushing that way then this is

264
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,200
pushing that way then this is
 

265
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,070
pushing that way then this is
easy I go around the resistance and this

266
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,080
easy I go around the resistance and this
 

267
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:05,269
easy I go around the resistance and this
allows the shoulder to go back down

268
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279

 

269
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,230

the other thing he can

270
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:07,240
the other thing he can
 

271
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,750
the other thing he can
do is he going to pull

272
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
do is he going to pull
 

273
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,230
do is he going to pull
in you see well this is why those braks

274
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,240
in you see well this is why those braks
 

275
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,590
in you see well this is why those braks
are so important okay so he goes to pull

276
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:16,600
are so important okay so he goes to pull
 

277
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,630
are so important okay so he goes to pull
in you're going with

278
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
in you're going with
 

279
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,829
in you're going with
it and this opens the door for a temi

280
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:22,839
it and this opens the door for a temi
 

281
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,750
it and this opens the door for a temi
because he has a Yin yield you see so I

282
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,760
because he has a Yin yield you see so I
 

283
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,150
because he has a Yin yield you see so I
don't want to be pulled by it I go with

284
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
don't want to be pulled by it I go with
 

285
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,750
don't want to be pulled by it I go with
it boom and I kick him right in the

286
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:32,760
it boom and I kick him right in the
 

287
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,870
it boom and I kick him right in the
face now I attack the center line

288
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
face now I attack the center line
 

289
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,790
face now I attack the center line
directly and now I can go back to the

290
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800

 

291
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,030

arm so all that is in there okay so

292
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,040
arm so all that is in there okay so
 

293
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,190
arm so all that is in there okay so
let's look for those

294
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:48,200
let's look for those
 

295
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,190
let's look for those
markers can you rip the shoulder out at

296
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
markers can you rip the shoulder out at
 

297
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,870
markers can you rip the shoulder out at
those two different angles can you break

298
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:55,880
those two different angles can you break
 

299
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,110
those two different angles can you break
the arm on the first one from the top on

300
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
the arm on the first one from the top on
 

301
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,350
the arm on the first one from the top on
the second one from the inside and then

302
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
the second one from the inside and then
 

303
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,710
the second one from the inside and then
can you kick that face then then the

304
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
can you kick that face then then the
 

305
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,030
can you kick that face then then the
last thing is just a tail end hey let's

306
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
last thing is just a tail end hey let's
 

307
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,590
last thing is just a tail end hey let's
do some cou hole all let's try so I'm

308
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
do some cou hole all let's try so I'm
 

309
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,750
do some cou hole all let's try so I'm
not showing the handw workk like I want

310
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:16,760
not showing the handw workk like I want
 

311
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,750
not showing the handw workk like I want
you to focus on the pattern and the

312
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:18,760
you to focus on the pattern and the
 

313
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,310
you to focus on the pattern and the
mechanics of the pattern okay the

314
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:21,320
mechanics of the pattern okay the
 

315
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,069
mechanics of the pattern okay the
handwork is very

316
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:23,079
handwork is very
 

317
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:25,949
handwork is very
particular so I got

318
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:25,959
particular so I got
 

319
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,870
particular so I got
probably 80 90% of the dishy here today

320
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:29,880
probably 80 90% of the dishy here today
 

321
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,030
probably 80 90% of the dishy here today
are not doing the hand workk okay it's

322
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,040
are not doing the hand workk okay it's
 

323
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,470
are not doing the hand workk okay it's
very particular I will say this because

324
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:35,480
very particular I will say this because
 

325
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,710
very particular I will say this because
it's such a common tendency and there's

326
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:37,720
it's such a common tendency and there's
 

327
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,230
it's such a common tendency and there's
no way you can get my hand workk until

328
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
no way you can get my hand workk until
 

329
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,269
no way you can get my hand workk until
you let go of this

330
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279
you let go of this
 

331
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,389
you let go of this
I do

332

down so as he's
 

337
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,870
down so as he's
pushing I'm going to

338
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:55,880
pushing I'm going to
 

339
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,829
pushing I'm going to
yield so I don't need any muscle to keep

340
00:10:59,829 --> 00:10:59,839
yield so I don't need any muscle to keep
 

341
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,430
yield so I don't need any muscle to keep
this in

342
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
this in
 

343
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,030
this in
place I yield and I bring his elbow

344
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,040

 

345
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,990

up now this hand generates this much

346
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
up now this hand generates this much
 

347
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,670
up now this hand generates this much
tilt by bringing his elbow to the other

348
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:16,680
tilt by bringing his elbow to the other
 

349
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,949
tilt by bringing his elbow to the other
side of my

350
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:17,959
side of my
 

351
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,069
side of my
head not by pushing him

352
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:21,079
head not by pushing him
 

353
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:24,350
head not by pushing him
away but by taking his elbow to the

354
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:24,360
away but by taking his elbow to the
 

355
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,590
away but by taking his elbow to the
other side of my head and now I just

356
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:28,600
other side of my head and now I just
 

357
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,790
other side of my head and now I just
lengthen the hand as I step

358
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
lengthen the hand as I step
 

359
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,790
lengthen the hand as I step
in and it takes no muscle to do any of

360
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
in and it takes no muscle to do any of
 

361
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,310
in and it takes no muscle to do any of
that you don't even need the

362
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:39,320
that you don't even need the
 

363
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,629
that you don't even need the
elbow and so when I come around this

364
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:42,639
elbow and so when I come around this
 

365
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,910
elbow and so when I come around this
thing I don't have to shove it down

366
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:44,920
thing I don't have to shove it down
 

367
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,509
thing I don't have to shove it down
here I don't have to shove it around

368
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
here I don't have to shove it around
 

369
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,350
here I don't have to shove it around
either I'm at the distal end of the

370
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:50,360
either I'm at the distal end of the
 

371
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,509
either I'm at the distal end of the
lever and I'm not pushing it down I'm

372
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
lever and I'm not pushing it down I'm
 

373
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,550
lever and I'm not pushing it down I'm
just not letting it come up so he tries

374
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:55,560
just not letting it come up so he tries
 

375
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,910
just not letting it come up so he tries
to come up you'll feel my sunk chees

376
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
to come up you'll feel my sunk chees
 

377
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,069
to come up you'll feel my sunk chees
and now I just work the distal end of

378
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
and now I just work the distal end of
 

379
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,710
and now I just work the distal end of
the lever

380
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
the lever
 

381
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,750
the lever
boom and I'm going around like this then

382
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:08,760
boom and I'm going around like this then
 

383
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,230
boom and I'm going around like this then
the same thing I don't want to drop it

384
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,240
the same thing I don't want to drop it
 

385
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,350
the same thing I don't want to drop it
where his strength is it keeps going

386
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
where his strength is it keeps going
 

387
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,829
where his strength is it keeps going
around on the

388
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
around on the
 

389
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,269
around on the
circle and it

390
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279

 

391
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:31,710

drops so there's none of this

392
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:31,720

 

393
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,990

I had your back

394
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,000

 

395
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,949

Sensei there's none of

396
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:39,959

 

397
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,230

this I don't have to do that I just keep

398
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,240
this I don't have to do that I just keep
 

399
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,550
this I don't have to do that I just keep
the

400
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:45,560

 

401
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:52,590

pow goes around me and I go around

402
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:52,600

 

403
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:16,350

this around me and I go around this

405
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,910

because what I'm really moving is his

406
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:20,920
because what I'm really moving is his
 

407
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:31,189
because what I'm really moving is his
body I'm moving the body

408
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:31,199

 

409
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:33,110

I move the

410
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
I move the
 

411
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,639
I move the
