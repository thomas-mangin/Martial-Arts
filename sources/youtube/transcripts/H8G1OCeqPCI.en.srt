75
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,950
getting it and that's the zero plus zero
method you're not getting anything out

76
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
method you're not getting anything out
 

77
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,590
method you're not getting anything out
of it you just

78
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:44,600

79
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,969
of it you just
swinging up and down

80
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:46,979
swinging up and down
 

81
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,490
