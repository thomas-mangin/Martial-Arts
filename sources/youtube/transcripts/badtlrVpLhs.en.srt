00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,550

all right so your keyhole was that

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:02,560
all right so your keyhole was that
 

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,870
all right so your keyhole was that
assumes a particular line

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:04,880
assumes a particular line
 

5
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,990
assumes a particular line
okay it's a particular mine

6
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,000
okay it's a particular mine
 

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,910
okay it's a particular mine
uh you're going from out of range to

8
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
uh you're going from out of range to
 

9
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,390
uh you're going from out of range to
within

10
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,400
within
 

11
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,630
within
range depending on what your

12
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
range depending on what your
 

13
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,550
range depending on what your
energy cue is so in this case you see

14
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
energy cue is so in this case you see
 

15
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,310
energy cue is so in this case you see
so if i bend my arm like this like this

16
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320
so if i bend my arm like this like this
 

17
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,230
so if i bend my arm like this like this
uh he can hit me with the other do you

18
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
uh he can hit me with the other do you
 

19
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,630
uh he can hit me with the other do you
see so there's a there's a particular

20
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640
see so there's a there's a particular
 

21
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,669
see so there's a there's a particular
range

22
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
range
 

23
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,110
range
and where continuity becomes viable

24
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
and where continuity becomes viable
 

25
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,549
and where continuity becomes viable
but then going past kataki

26
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
but then going past kataki
 

27
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,750
but then going past kataki
other things become but okay so

28
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
other things become but okay so
 

29
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,430
other things become but okay so
i i did this on my kotatsu dirty

30
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
i i did this on my kotatsu dirty

the same thing can happen to him if he

36
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
the same thing can happen to him if he
 

37
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,310
the same thing can happen to him if he
bends his arm on katata dirty he comes

00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
um if i launch my attacks from out here
 

55
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,830
um if i launch my attacks from out here
they're not viable i have to get

56
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840
they're not viable i have to get
 

57
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,950
they're not viable i have to get
to that sweet spot where i launch my

58
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
to that sweet spot where i launch my
 

59
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,990
to that sweet spot where i launch my
attack so

60
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
attack so
 

61
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,429
attack so
it's going to be outside

strength on him he goes
maybe i can get it but bigger stronger

260
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
maybe i can get it but bigger stronger
 

261
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,550
maybe i can get it but bigger stronger
i'm not gonna get it

262

coming really slowly again you could
 

335
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,990
coming really slowly again you could
just

336
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000

move out of the way
 

347
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,749
move out of the way
and now he goes slow again

348
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
and now he goes slow again
 

349
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,110
and now he goes slow again

same exact thing you see so you have to
train in hate this this attack

352
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
train in hate this this attack
 

353
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,230
train in hate this this attack
is is viable i get to the to my

354
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
is is viable i get to the to my
 

355
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,350
is is viable i get to the to my
range right

356
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360

 

357
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,990

that is a viable attack

358
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000

 

359
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,990

it's as viable as it's

360
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
it's as viable as it's
 

361
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,270
it's as viable as it's
say anything bible okay

362

say anything bible okay
 

363
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,550
say anything bible okay
this is not viable

364
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560

 

365
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,830

darn it nor is
i do one you deviate and now i'm back

368
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
i do one you deviate and now i'm back
 

369
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,110
i do one you deviate and now i'm back
there again

370
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
there again
 

371
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,630
there again
we're gonna we're gonna hook you we're

372
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
we're gonna we're gonna hook you we're

375
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,630
gonna right hook you left pokey
okay so as you do your thing

376
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
okay so as you do your thing
 

377
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,350
okay so as you do your thing
uh treat it as a viable attack so you're

378
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
uh treat it as a viable attack so you're
 

379
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,909
uh treat it as a viable attack so you're
here

380
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
here
 

381
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,949
here
and you go you're not

382
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
and you go you're not
 

383
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:58,070
and you go you're not
half-assing it after they deviate

384
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080

 

385
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,949

that's how you would address that okay

386
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
that's how you would address that okay
 

387
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:01,829
that's how you would address that okay
so

388
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
so
 

389
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,870
so
your attack is it's viable because

390
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
your attack is it's viable because
 

391
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,750
your attack is it's viable because
it's violence of action it preoccupies

392
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
it's violence of action it preoccupies
 

393
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,470
it's violence of action it preoccupies
him

394
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
him
 

395
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,509
him
uh even if even if he wanted to jab with

396
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
uh even if even if he wanted to jab with
 

397
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,870
uh even if even if he wanted to jab with
me running in

398
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:12,880
me running in
 

399
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,710
me running in
it doesn't do what it normal jab does

400
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
it doesn't do what it normal jab does
 

401
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,630
it doesn't do what it normal jab does
okay do you understand it gets jammed it

it again
okay and your

418
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
okay and your
 

419

movements create patterns okay so like
 

421
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,750
movements create patterns okay so like
last night's technique

422
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
last night's technique
 

423
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,190

and this is all spiral

426
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880

 

427
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,230

movements are all spirals so

428
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
movements are all spirals so
 

429
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,710
movements are all spirals so
in your overall macro movement

430
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
in your overall macro movement
 

431
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,110
in your overall macro movement
it's not going to be straight lines i'm

432

it's not going to be straight lines i'm
 

433
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,389

00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160

 

437
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,190

it's not going to be this way either

438
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
it's not going to be this way either
 

439
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,230
it's not going to be this way either
that's now a straight line so you go and

440
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
that's now a straight line so you go and
 

441
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,710
that's now a straight line so you go and
i go

i go
 

443
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,910
i go
this is straight line

of where he's at a macro level going to

460
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
of where he's at a macro level going to
 

461
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,670
of where he's at a macro level going to
start rotating

462
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
start rotating
 

463
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,949

467
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,389

then the fight's going to rotate you see

468
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
then the fight's going to rotate you see
 

469
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,550
then the fight's going to rotate you see
and it'll keep rotating with his energy

470
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
and it'll keep rotating with his energy
 

471
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,910
and it'll keep rotating with his energy
so if he continues

472
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:05,920
so if he continues
 

473
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,750
so if he continues
his movements it's going to keep i'm

474
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
his movements it's going to keep i'm
 

475
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,389
his movements it's going to keep i'm
going to keep it rotating

476
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
going to keep it rotating
 

477
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,670
going to keep it rotating
i'm going to avoid this

478
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
i'm going to avoid this
 

479
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,389
i'm going to avoid this
and i'm going to avoid these diagonals

480
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
and i'm going to avoid these diagonals
 

481
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,310
and i'm going to avoid these diagonals
and avoid these

482
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320

 

483
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,350

this fight is always rotating rotating

rotating okay got it
 

487
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:51,590
rotating okay got it
okay let's bring the rotation in now

488
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600

 

489
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,870

just as if he was
throwing a punch combination boom boom

492
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
throwing a punch combination boom boom
 

493
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,629

going like this
i don't move but does not have to move

510
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
i don't move but does not have to move
 

511
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,350
i don't move but does not have to move
okay

512
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
okay
 

513
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,629
okay
so he we're going he goes my hands don't

514
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
so he we're going he goes my hands don't
 

515
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,509
so he we're going he goes my hands don't
move

516
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
move
 

517
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,550
move
he goes my hands don't move if i don't

518
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
he goes my hands don't move if i don't
 

519
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,389
he goes my hands don't move if i don't
need to move them i don't move them

520
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
need to move them i don't move them
 

521
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,829
need to move them i don't move them
okay they're all always in an offensive

522
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:33,839
okay they're all always in an offensive
 

523
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,269
okay they're all always in an offensive
ready position

524
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:35,279
ready position
 

525
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,389
ready position
if you're clearing hands unnecessarily

526
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
if you're clearing hands unnecessarily
 

527
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,550
if you're clearing hands unnecessarily
they're not in an offensive position

528
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
they're not in an offensive position
 

529
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,870
they're not in an offensive position
okay so on that last one

530
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
okay so on that last one
 

531
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,990
okay so on that last one
if you feel it if he got a lot of lap

532
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
if you feel it if he got a lot of lap
 

533
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,949
if you feel it if he got a lot of lap
it was it's very tempting to knock it

534
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
it was it's very tempting to knock it
 

535
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:49,590
it was it's very tempting to knock it
off

536
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
off
 

537
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,030
off
you see but it'll come off with movement

538
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
you see but it'll come off with movement
 

539
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,990
you see but it'll come off with movement
and i get to keep my hands there okay so

540
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
and i get to keep my hands there okay so
 

541
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,870
and i get to keep my hands there okay so

spiraling has no mood

544
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279

 

545
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,590

okay let's try so i still happen

546
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
okay let's try so i still happen
 

547
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,350
okay let's try so i still happen
there's still no need and no advantage

548
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
there's still no need and no advantage
 

549
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,509
there's still no need and no advantage
to trying for a throw yet okay

550
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
to trying for a throw yet okay
 

551
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,629
to trying for a throw yet okay
start the flight rotating keep your

552
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
start the flight rotating keep your
 

553
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,430
start the flight rotating keep your
guard up

554
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440
guard up
 

555
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,470
guard up
ready to go punish anybody that

556
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
ready to go punish anybody that
 

557
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,670
ready to go punish anybody that
goes too slow please any hidden space

558
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
goes too slow please any hidden space
 

559
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,750
goes too slow please any hidden space
punish them um

560
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
punish them um
 

561
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,870
punish them um
now there's something about the

562
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
now there's something about the
 

563
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,750
now there's something about the
centrifuge the spiraling geometry you're

564
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
centrifuge the spiraling geometry you're
 

565
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,910
centrifuge the spiraling geometry you're
going to generate a lot of centrifugal

566
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
going to generate a lot of centrifugal
 

567
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,710
going to generate a lot of centrifugal
energy

568
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
energy
 

569
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,750
energy
okay and i will use that

570
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
okay and i will use that
 

571
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,590
okay and i will use that
before i start clearing limbs okay

572
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
before i start clearing limbs okay
 

573
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,230
before i start clearing limbs okay
so we'll slow it down so he can kind of

574
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
so we'll slow it down so he can kind of
 

575
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,430
so we'll slow it down so he can kind of
get it right

576
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
get it right
 

577
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,470
get it right
so we're over here see he got it's a

578
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480
so we're over here see he got it's a
 

579
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,910
so we're over here see he got it's a
pretty good hook you see and before i

580
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
pretty good hook you see and before i
 

581
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,230
pretty good hook you see and before i
start

582
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
start
 

583
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,189
start
clearing this limb or doing anything

584
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
clearing this limb or doing anything
 

585
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:57,990
clearing this limb or doing anything
with it

586
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,000
with it
 

587
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,230
with it
right i'm going to just keep using the

588
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
right i'm going to just keep using the
 

589
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,590
right i'm going to just keep using the
centrifugal energy

590
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600
centrifugal energy
 

591
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,870
centrifugal energy
so we were going this way do you see

592
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
so we were going this way do you see
 

593
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,629
so we were going this way do you see
so i use that energy to get it going

594
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
so i use that energy to get it going
 

595
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,710
so i use that energy to get it going
if he gets an uh even a better group

596
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
if he gets an uh even a better group
 

597
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,629
if he gets an uh even a better group
i'll come on the inside a little bit

598
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:12,639
i'll come on the inside a little bit
 

599
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,310
i'll come on the inside a little bit
you see if the fight is going this way

600
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
you see if the fight is going this way
 

601
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,389
you see if the fight is going this way
right he thinks it's going to go this

602
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
right he thinks it's going to go this
 

603
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,550
right he thinks it's going to go this
way you see that that's what he's going

604
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
way you see that that's what he's going
 

605
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,189
way you see that that's what he's going
to do

606
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
to do
 

607
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,189
to do
but i'm not going to do that so his

608
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
but i'm not going to do that so his
 

609
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,629
but i'm not going to do that so his
energy goes like this

610
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:24,639
energy goes like this
 

611
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,990
energy goes like this
and i keep it spinning keep it spinning

612
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
and i keep it spinning keep it spinning
 

613
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,150
and i keep it spinning keep it spinning
and you'll see oh gradually they start

614
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
and you'll see oh gradually they start
 

615
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,030
and you'll see oh gradually they start
to loosen

616
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
to loosen
 

617
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,069
to loosen
they're losing their grip okay uh keep

618
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
they're losing their grip okay uh keep
 

619
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,509
they're losing their grip okay uh keep
that fight rotate

620
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
that fight rotate
 

621
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,629
that fight rotate
they will go all keep rotating

622
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
they will go all keep rotating
 

623
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,829
they will go all keep rotating
before you do anything i'm going around

624
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839
before you do anything i'm going around
 

625
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,110
before you do anything i'm going around
rotating before you start dealing with

626
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
rotating before you start dealing with
 

627
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,829
rotating before you start dealing with
his limbs

628
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
his limbs
 

629
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,389
his limbs
okay try it again um

630
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
okay try it again um
 

631
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,430
okay try it again um
okay i still want to take away

632
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
okay i still want to take away
 

633
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,110
okay i still want to take away
the uh the advantages in his

634
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
the uh the advantages in his
 

635
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,150
the uh the advantages in his
offense okay um the next one is internal

636
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160
offense okay um the next one is internal
 

637
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,790
offense okay um the next one is internal
this makes the world the difference okay

638
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
this makes the world the difference okay
 

639
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,430
this makes the world the difference okay
uh

640
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
uh
 

641
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,670
uh
so let's say he's we're gonna just

642
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:09,680
so let's say he's we're gonna just
 

643
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,069
so let's say he's we're gonna just
demonstrate it mechanically okay

644
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
demonstrate it mechanically okay
 

645
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,509
demonstrate it mechanically okay
so uh push push you see

646
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
so uh push push you see
 

647
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,629
so uh push push you see
and uh what we have to do now is

648
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
and uh what we have to do now is
 

649
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,550
and uh what we have to do now is
cause a deviation an external deviation

650
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
cause a deviation an external deviation
 

651
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,269
cause a deviation an external deviation
you see and he's gonna he's gonna push

652
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
you see and he's gonna he's gonna push
 

653
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,110
you see and he's gonna he's gonna push
and i'm gonna relax

654
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
and i'm gonna relax
 

655
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,509
and i'm gonna relax
lucy i'm gonna relax and he will not

656
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
lucy i'm gonna relax and he will not
 

657
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,949
lucy i'm gonna relax and he will not
have the ledge

658
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
have the ledge
 

659
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,629
have the ledge
that we usually give him because when

660
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
that we usually give him because when
 

661
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,629
that we usually give him because when
you push on what's pushing on you

662
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:34,639
you push on what's pushing on you
 

663
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,870
you push on what's pushing on you
you create friction that gives him the

664
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
you create friction that gives him the
 

665
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,230
you create friction that gives him the
leverage that he needs

666
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
leverage that he needs
 

667
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,150
leverage that he needs
okay then you have to understand the

668
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
okay then you have to understand the
 

669
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,550
okay then you have to understand the
psychology of what's going on

670
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,560
psychology of what's going on
 

671
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,790
psychology of what's going on
is when we go back in the drill what

672
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
is when we go back in the drill what
 

673
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,910
is when we go back in the drill what
happens is as

674
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
happens is as
 

675
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,030
happens is as

watch what i'm doing to it
i just locked it in place

684
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399

 

685
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,949

so as you go we might have to do this a

686
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
so as you go we might have to do this a
 

687
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,710
so as you go we might have to do this a
little bit more dynamically

688
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
little bit more dynamically
 

689
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,110
little bit more dynamically
i'm going to be very relaxed and i get

690
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
i'm going to be very relaxed and i get
 

691
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,110
i'm going to be very relaxed and i get
very slippery

692
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
very slippery
 

693
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,949
very slippery
okay as opposed to i go in attempts like

694
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
okay as opposed to i go in attempts like
 

695
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,790
okay as opposed to i go in attempts like
this

696
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
this
 

697
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,269
this
i have to relax we're going

698
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
i have to relax we're going
 

699
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,389
i have to relax we're going
you get slippery release

700
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
you get slippery release
 

701
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,910
you get slippery release
boom slippery slippery i feel

702
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
boom slippery slippery i feel
 

703
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,629
boom slippery slippery i feel
oh and my body wants to clench but my

704
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
oh and my body wants to clench but my
 

705
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,150
oh and my body wants to clench but my
training does release

706
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
training does release
 

707
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,710
training does release
and then he loses the hooks okay all

708
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,720
and then he loses the hooks okay all
 

709
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,829
and then he loses the hooks okay all
right so let's bring that in

710
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
right so let's bring that in
 

711
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,629
right so let's bring that in
okay if you look at your keyhole

712
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639

 

713
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,590

you do that is your strategic concept

714
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
you do that is your strategic concept
 

715
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,910
you do that is your strategic concept
so if we take the technique again from

716
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
so if we take the technique again from
 

717
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,590
so if we take the technique again from
last night and i come around here you

718
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600
last night and i come around here you
 

719
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,949
last night and i come around here you
see there's his balance you see

720
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
see there's his balance you see
 

721
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,069
see there's his balance you see
there's non-contestation and there's his

722
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
there's non-contestation and there's his
 

723
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:56,949
there's non-contestation and there's his
balance

724
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
balance
 

725
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,590
balance
and that's where i find the throat

726
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600

 

727
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,990

i don't try that technique like this

728
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000

 

729
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,029

see that that's not gonna work okay

730
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
see that that's not gonna work okay
 

731
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,350
see that that's not gonna work okay
so same way here a guy that's perfectly

732
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
so same way here a guy that's perfectly
 

733
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,510
so same way here a guy that's perfectly
balanced and he's coming in

734
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
balanced and he's coming in
 

735
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,590
balanced and he's coming in
you're not going to go and do your

736
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
you're not going to go and do your
 

737
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,949
you're not going to go and do your
coconut

738
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
coconut
 

739
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,789
coconut
you have to figure out how do i

740
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:23,799
you have to figure out how do i
 

741
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,750
you have to figure out how do i
dynamically

742
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:25,760
dynamically
 

743
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,110
dynamically
create all that disadvantage that kihon

744
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120
create all that disadvantage that kihon
 

745
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,110
create all that disadvantage that kihon
already assumes is taking place okay

746
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
already assumes is taking place okay
 

747
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,310
already assumes is taking place okay
so these are the bare basics that i have

748
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
so these are the bare basics that i have
 

749
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,270
so these are the bare basics that i have
to do

750
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
to do
 

751
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,270
to do
when we took out the strikes to

752
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280
when we took out the strikes to
 

753
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,630
when we took out the strikes to
specialize on these

754
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
specialize on these
 

755
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,830
specialize on these
basics okay the strikes do a lot

756
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:43,840
basics okay the strikes do a lot
 

757
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,430
basics okay the strikes do a lot
in this in this realm okay so

758
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
in this in this realm okay so
 

759
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,830
in this in this realm okay so
if we're gonna we'll see where it'll

760
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
if we're gonna we'll see where it'll
 

761
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,510
if we're gonna we'll see where it'll
come up because if you get really good

762
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
come up because if you get really good
 

763
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,270
come up because if you get really good
at that

764
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
at that
 

765
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,830
at that
this next part you don't even have to do

766
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
this next part you don't even have to do
 

767
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,710
this next part you don't even have to do
the throws

768
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
the throws
 

769
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,190
the throws
but that's where we would do the throws

770
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
but that's where we would do the throws
 

771
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,070
but that's where we would do the throws
okay

772
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
okay
 

773
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,110
okay
so i'll i'll screw it up

774
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
so i'll i'll screw it up
 

775
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,390
so i'll i'll screw it up
okay so he's going he keeps going

776
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:06,400
okay so he's going he keeps going
 

777
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,190
okay so he's going he keeps going
he keeps going keeps going and that's

778
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,200
he keeps going keeps going and that's
 

779
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,590
he keeps going keeps going and that's
that's where i find kaiten nugget

780
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600
that's where i find kaiten nugget
 

781
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,630
that's where i find kaiten nugget
you see at that point

782
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
you see at that point
 

783
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,110
you see at that point
as opposed to i could not get here

784
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,120

turn me turning turn it right here
okay that's where you'll find python

810
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
okay that's where you'll find python
 

811
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,789
okay that's where you'll find python
okay so

812
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:00,799
okay so
 

813
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,590
okay so
you're going to do the same drills

814
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
you're going to do the same drills
 

815
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,029
you're going to do the same drills
