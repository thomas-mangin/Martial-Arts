00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,550

all right um when I do for example

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:06,560
all right um when I do for example
 

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,669
all right um when I do for example
Cho um H my energy and his energy is

4
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:11,679
Cho um H my energy and his energy is
 

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,669
Cho um H my energy and his energy is
permeating my body and then I am

6
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:14,679
permeating my body and then I am
 

7
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,950
permeating my body and then I am
internally redirecting it down to the

00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:16,960
internally redirecting it down to the
 

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,070
internally redirecting it down to the
ground and that doesn't change once I

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,080
ground and that doesn't change once I
 

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,029
ground and that doesn't change once I
start the yin movement in the yin

12
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:24,039
start the yin movement in the yin
 

13
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:27,509
start the yin movement in the yin
yield so for example what I mean by that

14
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
yield so for example what I mean by that
 

15
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,429
yield so for example what I mean by that
is if I stop so here

16
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
is if I stop so here
 

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,750
is if I stop so here
he can't he can't push me over and a a

lot of more people can do that but it's

20
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
lot of more people can do that but it's
 

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,830
lot of more people can do that but it's
done cosmetically or externally and that

22
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:39,840
done cosmetically or externally and that

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,029
I have a bracing angle which will be
evident if he lets go

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,029
me is the energy is going down so when
he lets go there's no flow that way it

32
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
he lets go there's no flow that way it
 

33
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,509
he lets go there's no flow that way it
comes up

34
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:57,519

okay so it's not skill alignment and

36
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:00,920
okay so it's not skill alignment and
 

37
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,710
okay so it's not skill alignment and
bracing angle even as I go to the yin

okay this energy is going down to the

42
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
okay this energy is going down to the
 

43
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,310
okay this energy is going down to the
ground Vector so maybe you're over here

44
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:17,320
ground Vector so maybe you're over here
 

45
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,749
ground Vector so maybe you're over here
and you can see if he pushes this this

46
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:20,759
and you can see if he pushes this this
 

47
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,310
and you can see if he pushes this this
should not be possible from an external

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,430
that is one way of understanding this
meaning if you do this and you have a

85
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,710

00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:51,959
okay so I'm one way of looking at it is

00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,110
okay so I'm one way of looking at it is
I am

according to the change of the technique
 

107
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,990
according to the change of the technique
but giving it at the same

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,350
where what angle his energy is at it
doesn't it's not that I'm consciously

118
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
doesn't it's not that I'm consciously
 

119
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,869
doesn't it's not that I'm consciously
continually

it it's more that I become just per able
 

127
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,550
it it's more that I become just per able
okay so for example um we've we've

128
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:35,560
okay so for example um we've we've
 

129
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,470
okay so for example um we've we've
demonstrated this before so here here is

130
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
demonstrated this before so here here is
 

131
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,509
demonstrated this before so here here is
that weird angle but if you

132
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519
that weird angle but if you

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,589
that weird angle but if you
got he'll take this angle so camera has

got he'll take this angle so camera has
 

135
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,229
got he'll take this angle so camera has
to come over

136
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
to come over
 

137
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,990
to come over
here it's say it's not going to be like

00:08:58,509 --> 00:08:58,519
quadriceps you want stronger legs squat
 

331
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,230
quadriceps you want stronger legs squat
Dead lip right you want that performance

332
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:03,240
Dead lip right you want that performance
 

333
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,389
Dead lip right you want that performance
output and

334
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
output and
 

335
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,509
output and
therefore it also doesn't matter or

336
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:10,519
therefore it also doesn't matter or
 

337
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,430
therefore it also doesn't matter or
let's

338
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
let's
 

339
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,550
let's
say the heavier subito is not more

340
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:15,560
say the heavier subito is not more
 

341
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,110
say the heavier subito is not more
relevant in regards to strength

342
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
relevant in regards to strength
 

343
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,310
relevant in regards to strength
right it's going to increase the energy

344
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:23,320
right it's going to increase the energy
 

345
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,150
right it's going to increase the energy
at which I'm operating at and therefore

346
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
at which I'm operating at and therefore
 

347
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,430
at which I'm operating at and therefore
be more of a window into how permeable I

348
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
be more of a window into how permeable I
 

349
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,990
be more of a window into how permeable I
am okay so for

example

352
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
example
 

353
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,509
example
um if someone

354
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519

 

355
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,910

is

356
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920

 

357
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,750

and if Priscilla is here if I am only

358
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:50,760
and if Priscilla is here if I am only
 

359
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,990
and if Priscilla is here if I am only
somewhat semi-

permeable uh and she's trying to push me

362
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
permeable uh and she's trying to push me
 

363
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,350
permeable uh and she's trying to push me
over I you kind of uh game it I'm

364
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:00,360
over I you kind of uh game it I'm
 

365
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,069
over I you kind of uh game it I'm
have a little flexion I'm holding

366
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
have a little flexion I'm holding
 

367
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,509
have a little flexion I'm holding
flexion in my leg and it'll kind of work

368
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
flexion in my leg and it'll kind of work
 

369
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,870
flexion in my leg and it'll kind of work
you

370
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:07,880

 

371
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,470

see you get someone stronger you

372
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
see you get someone stronger you
 

373
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,590
see you get someone stronger you
increase the amount of energy and it'll

374
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:12,600
increase the amount of energy and it'll
 

375
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,630
increase the amount of energy and it'll
expose that it's not working okay

376
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:15,640
expose that it's not working okay
 

377
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,990
expose that it's not working okay
likewise when I had two people pushing

378
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
likewise when I had two people pushing
 

379
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,389
likewise when I had two people pushing
at different vectors it's going to be

380
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
at different vectors it's going to be
 

381
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,670
at different vectors it's going to be
more telling whether I'm permeable or

382
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:22,680
more telling whether I'm permeable or
 

383
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,430
more telling whether I'm permeable or
not okay so for example rain will come

384
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
not okay so for example rain will come
 

385
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,470
not okay so for example rain will come
out and uh say there over here and

386
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
out and uh say there over here and
 

387
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,430
out and uh say there over here and
you're going to push on

388
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
you're going to push on
 

389
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,590
you're going to push on
her and so the energy that is passing

390
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:36,600
her and so the energy that is passing
 

391
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,790
her and so the energy that is passing
through ground ground ground do you see

392
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:39,800
through ground ground ground do you see
 

393
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,350
through ground ground ground do you see
it

394
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
it
 

395
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,069
it
can appear to be

396
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
can appear to be
 

397
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,389
can appear to be
functioning okay and now we'll put more

398
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:47,399
functioning okay and now we'll put more
 

399
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,110
functioning okay and now we'll put more
pressure and we'll have a increased

400
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,120
pressure and we'll have a increased
 

401
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,509
pressure and we'll have a increased
pressure which you can do by somebody

402
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:52,519
pressure which you can do by somebody
 

403
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,110
pressure which you can do by somebody
that is stronger and you're going to see

404
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
that is stronger and you're going to see
 

405
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,550
that is stronger and you're going to see
that it it was not functioning at all or

406
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
that it it was not functioning at all or
 

407
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,870
that it it was not functioning at all or
if we do do the other drill right and

408
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
if we do do the other drill right and
 

409
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,350
if we do do the other drill right and
you're going to do tyo henko slowly so

410
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:04,360
you're going to do tyo henko slowly so
 

411
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,030
you're going to do tyo henko slowly so
let you're going to come to this angle

412
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
let you're going to come to this angle
 

413
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,509
let you're going to come to this angle
and she's going to

414
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
and she's going to
 

415
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,389
and she's going to
get this clearly not skeletal alignment

416
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
get this clearly not skeletal alignment
 

417
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,310
get this clearly not skeletal alignment
more over here right you see he's

418
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:17,320
more over here right you see he's
 

419
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,670
more over here right you see he's
passing through her you see that and so

420
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:20,680
passing through her you see that and so
 

421
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,910
passing through her you see that and so
it'll expose how much of the previous

422
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
it'll expose how much of the previous
 

423
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,590
it'll expose how much of the previous
angle was skeletal alignment was

424
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:26,600
angle was skeletal alignment was
 

425
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,670
angle was skeletal alignment was
material was external how much was

426
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
material was external how much was
 

427
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,990
material was external how much was
internal so go like this and just

428
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,000
internal so go like this and just
 

429
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,350
internal so go like this and just
push youing

430
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:38,360
push youing
 

431
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,550
push youing
or we do the other one get to there

432
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
or we do the other one get to there
 

433
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,110
or we do the other one get to there
stop right give me your other hand and

434
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,120
stop right give me your other hand and
 

435
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,590
stop right give me your other hand and
I'll take this angle and will you can

436
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:48,600
I'll take this angle and will you can
 

437
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,910
I'll take this angle and will you can
see that she's not grounded at all she's

438
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
see that she's not grounded at all she's
 

439
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,790
see that she's not grounded at all she's
not rooted at all do you understand okay

440
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
not rooted at all do you understand okay
 

441
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,949
not rooted at all do you understand okay
so as you increase the pressure it is

442
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
so as you increase the pressure it is
 

443
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,509
so as you increase the pressure it is
more telling of how permanent

444
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
more telling of how permanent
 

445
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,590
more telling of how permanent
you are okay and that's what a heavier

446
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:02,600
you are okay and that's what a heavier
 

447
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,590
you are okay and that's what a heavier
subb toe

448
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:04,600
subb toe
 

449
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,350
subb toe
does it's more like a a truth stick okay

450
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:10,360
does it's more like a a truth stick okay
 

451
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,910
does it's more like a a truth stick okay
but you don't want to get a heavier uh

452
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:12,920
but you don't want to get a heavier uh
 

453
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,310
but you don't want to get a heavier uh
spab toe to uh condition yourself that's

454
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:17,320
spab toe to uh condition yourself that's
 

455
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,590
spab toe to uh condition yourself that's
not the point and likewise you don't

456
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:20,600
not the point and likewise you don't
 

457
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,110
not the point and likewise you don't
need this to go there you can of course

458
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
need this to go there you can of course
 

459
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,310
need this to go there you can of course
you can ground Vector here as

460
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:25,320
you can ground Vector here as
 

461
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,389
you can ground Vector here as
well but the

462
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:27,399
well but the
 

463
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:37,389
well but the
drill is the

464
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:37,399

 

465
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:43,069

okay so let's try it with suby toe

466
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:43,079

 

467
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,629

now okay so as the beginner Gateway all

468
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
now okay so as the beginner Gateway all
 

469
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,509
now okay so as the beginner Gateway all
that energy is I'm going to focus it uh

470
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:50,519
that energy is I'm going to focus it uh
 

471
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,069
that energy is I'm going to focus it uh
or at least observe that it is at the

472
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:53,079
or at least observe that it is at the
 

473
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:56,590
or at least observe that it is at the
midfoot vector okay and again in more

474
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:56,600
midfoot vector okay and again in more
 

475
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,829
midfoot vector okay and again in more
accurate Poetics that me micro adjust

476
00:12:58,829 --> 00:12:58,839
accurate Poetics that me micro adjust
 

477
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:00,990
accurate Poetics that me micro adjust
tting my balance so that energy is going

478
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,000
tting my balance so that energy is going
 

479
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,189
tting my balance so that energy is going
down there is more that I become

480
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:04,199
down there is more that I become
 

481
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:07,629
down there is more that I become
permeable and then energy does its thing

482
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:07,639
permeable and then energy does its thing
 

483
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,829
permeable and then energy does its thing
what's its thing it fills vacuums and it

484
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
what's its thing it fills vacuums and it
 

485
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,590
what's its thing it fills vacuums and it
drops it will drop it's heavy it goes

486
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:14,600
drops it will drop it's heavy it goes
 

487
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,269
drops it will drop it's heavy it goes
down okay and then I am intellectually

488
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:18,279
down okay and then I am intellectually
 

489
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:22,590
down okay and then I am intellectually
confirming that it's going down by using

490
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:22,600
confirming that it's going down by using
 

491
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,829
confirming that it's going down by using
my mind uh to register midfoot okay so

492
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
my mind uh to register midfoot okay so
 

493
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,269
my mind uh to register midfoot okay so

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,029
feel the other CQ location you're will
be in the right hand and you're going to

664
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
be in the right hand and you're going to
 

665
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,590
be in the right hand and you're going to
see you're going to experience another

666
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
see you're going to experience another
 

667
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,270
see you're going to experience another
one of those profession bounces or

668
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:54,280
one of those profession bounces or
 

669
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,710
one of those profession bounces or
rebounding So you you're going to see

670
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:56,720
rebounding So you you're going to see
 

671
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,630
rebounding So you you're going to see
like a double I'll exag you're going to

672
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640
like a double I'll exag you're going to
 

673
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,149
like a double I'll exag you're going to
see like a double bounce not just the

674
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:01,159
see like a double bounce not just the
 

675
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:03,110
see like a double bounce not just the
one where I come down you see this I

676
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
one where I come down you see this I
 

677
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,909
one where I come down you see this I
just come down this is leg

inhalation uh with Yin and exhalation

700
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:48,640
inhalation uh with Yin and exhalation
 

701
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,549
inhalation uh with Yin and exhalation
with Y and so

702
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:53,559

 

703
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,630

um and then the colonist understanding

704
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
um and then the colonist understanding
 

705
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,549
um and then the colonist understanding
is that uh movement M up all the way to

706
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
is that uh movement M up all the way to
 

707
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,190
is that uh movement M up all the way to
up is going to

708
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,200
up is going to
 

709
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,950
up is going to
begin and then movement down all the way

710
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:06,960
begin and then movement down all the way
 

711
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,070
begin and then movement down all the way
down is y so you

712
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,080
down is y so you
 

713
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,870
down is y so you
inhale on the way up and then exhale no

714
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:13,880
inhale on the way up and then exhale no
 

715
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,230
inhale on the way up and then exhale no
the the CQ requires in the beginner the

716
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240
the the CQ requires in the beginner the
 

717
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,029
the the CQ requires in the beginner the
C is the exhalation so you have up at

718
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:22,039
C is the exhalation so you have up at
 

719
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:22,870
C is the exhalation so you have up at
the

720
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
the
 

721
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,149
the
top you have another one in the

722
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:27,159
top you have another one in the
 

723
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:35,190
top you have another one in the
hand

724
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200

 

725
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,510

and then one at the bottom

726
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,520

 

727
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,630

so not like

728
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:43,640

 

729
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,149

that

730
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:45,159
that
 

731
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:48,909
that
okay now

732
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:48,919

 

733
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:52,190

beate you are counter

734
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,200
beate you are counter
 

735
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,990
beate you are counter
rotating the hands against each other so

736
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
rotating the hands against each other so
 

737
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,350
rotating the hands against each other so
usually you'll do that in the beginning

738
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,360

 

739
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,830

to get a mechanical advantage

740
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
to get a mechanical advantage
 

741
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,029
to get a mechanical advantage
here you stack the bul

742
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:07,039
here you stack the bul
 

743
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,070
here you stack the bul
in but here you see it too you pull the

744
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
in but here you see it too you pull the
 

745
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,470
in but here you see it too you pull the
hand you pull the left

746
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
hand you pull the left
 

747
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,870
hand you pull the left
hand well I'm not pulling the left hand

748
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:14,880
hand well I'm not pulling the left hand
 

749
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,630
hand well I'm not pulling the left hand
because the left hand is in an nely

750
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,640
because the left hand is in an nely
 

751
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,070
because the left hand is in an nely
state so it doesn't generate more

752
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080
state so it doesn't generate more
 

753
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,909
state so it doesn't generate more
energy it stays neutral at zero the left

754
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919
energy it stays neutral at zero the left
 

755
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,269
energy it stays neutral at zero the left
hand is what sends I'm sorry the right

756
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:26,279
hand is what sends I'm sorry the right
 

757
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:38,830
hand is what sends I'm sorry the right
hand is what sends the book

758
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:38,840

 

759
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,909

not the left hand pulling against the

760
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:40,919
not the left hand pulling against the
 

761
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,510
not the left hand pulling against the
right hand

762
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:43,520
right hand
 

763
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,549
right hand
okay

764
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:49,559

 

765
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,830

um let's define terms a little

766
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:52,840
um let's define terms a little
 

767
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,149
um let's define terms a little
bit so the

768
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
bit so the
 

769
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,909
bit so the
CQ is the pressurized vacuum resulting

770
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
CQ is the pressurized vacuum resulting
 

771
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,510
CQ is the pressurized vacuum resulting
of you becoming

772
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
of you becoming
 

773
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,430
of you becoming
permeable so as I become

774
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:06,440
permeable so as I become
 

775
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,190
permeable so as I become

permeability so I'm not trying to
 

835
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,470
permeability so I'm not trying to
twist that's generating pressure or

836
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:47,480
twist that's generating pressure or
 

837
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,230

Co body is relaxed projected to two

850
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,120

 

851
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,029

points two points there's the top

852
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039
points two points there's the top
 

853
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:24,630
points two points there's the top
one boom boom and the bottom

854
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,640

 

855
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,070

one okay got it all right try

856
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,080

 

857
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:46,269

see you're just working

858
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:46,279

 

859
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:49,310

it okay let's pick it up you'll find it

860
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,320
it okay let's pick it up you'll find it
 

861
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,190
it okay let's pick it up you'll find it
more challenging why cuz more energy

862
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,200
more challenging why cuz more energy
 

863
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,480
more challenging why cuz more energy
okay try it again
