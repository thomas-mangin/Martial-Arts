1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,860

but I come on I don't want to just

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:09,870
but I come on I don't want to just
 

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,089
but I come on I don't want to just
deviate off the line like there's that

4
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:14,099
deviate off the line like there's that
 

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:24,560
deviate off the line like there's that
turn it has to be again yielding in the

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:24,570
turn it has to be again yielding in the
 

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,470
turn it has to be again yielding in the
target hit you just move across like

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:27,480
target hit you just move across like
 

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,380
target hit you just move across like
this it's not there's no yield and you

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:30,390
this it's not there's no yield and you
 

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,619
this it's not there's no yield and you
won't pull the person in so there's a

12
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:33,629
won't pull the person in so there's a
 

13
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:37,280
won't pull the person in so there's a
torque for me here and then this is what

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,290
torque for me here and then this is what
 

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,119
torque for me here and then this is what
goes straight it's the first year I did

16
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:44,129
goes straight it's the first year I did
 

17
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:48,340
goes straight it's the first year I did
try to twist but I just twisted my foot

18
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:48,350
try to twist but I just twisted my foot
 

19
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,080
try to twist but I just twisted my foot
and now you're gonna have to come

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,090
and now you're gonna have to come
 

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,520
and now you're gonna have to come
forward and then that crazy turn which

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:55,530
forward and then that crazy turn which
 

23
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,220
forward and then that crazy turn which
is speed no one does everyone goes like

24
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:58,230
is speed no one does everyone goes like
 

25
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:05,150
is speed no one does everyone goes like
this so the yield is boom here then this

26
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:05,160
this so the yield is boom here then this
 

27
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,249
this so the yield is boom here then this
foot just threads the needle and your

28
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:07,259
foot just threads the needle and your
 

29
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:17,600
foot just threads the needle and your
inner knee

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:17,610

 

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,270

so again the geometry twist 45 to go on

32
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,280
so again the geometry twist 45 to go on
 

33
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,380
so again the geometry twist 45 to go on
to attack straight in boom and you have

34
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,390
to attack straight in boom and you have
 

35
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,260
to attack straight in boom and you have
that inch to inch off the line of attack

36
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:31,270
that inch to inch off the line of attack
 

37
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:39,930
that inch to inch off the line of attack
and your DD and we'll put it as this is

38
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:39,940
and your DD and we'll put it as this is
 

39
00:01:39,940 --> 00:02:04,500
and your DD and we'll put it as this is
an abstract like this a lot of your

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:04,510
an abstract like this a lot of your
 

41
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,980
an abstract like this a lot of your
first initially in absorptions have to

42
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:07,990
first initially in absorptions have to
 

43
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,640
first initially in absorptions have to
have a deception out of it so if you

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:11,650
have a deception out of it so if you
 

45
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,800
have a deception out of it so if you
make your roof traverse the map it's too

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:16,810
make your roof traverse the map it's too
 

47
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,949
make your roof traverse the map it's too
easy to tell because is he's a predator

48
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:19,959
easy to tell because is he's a predator
 

49
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,290
easy to tell because is he's a predator
with his eyes in front of his head and

50
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:22,300
with his eyes in front of his head and
 

51
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,310
with his eyes in front of his head and
he can read death very easily okay so

52
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,320
he can read death very easily okay so
 

53
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,590
he can read death very easily okay so
you're doing your your hidden move and

54
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:28,600
you're doing your your hidden move and
 

55
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,770
you're doing your your hidden move and
you're over here she's gonna really

56
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:31,780
you're over here she's gonna really
 

57
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,260
you're over here she's gonna really
sense that even though I got off the

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,270
sense that even though I got off the
 

59
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,320

joke I didn't pull him in which is what

60
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,330
joke I didn't pull him in which is what
 

61
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,280
joke I didn't pull him in which is what
I want okay and as you try to do that

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,290
I want okay and as you try to do that
 

63
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,440
I want okay and as you try to do that
error what ends up happening is you

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:43,450
error what ends up happening is you
 

65
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,170
error what ends up happening is you
really overshot here you're really off

66
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:46,180
really overshot here you're really off
 

67
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,260
really overshot here you're really off
balance this is not a good thing so just

68
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,270
balance this is not a good thing so just
 

69
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:55,170

himself you see
 

87
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,370
himself you see
and then the this leg comes shot well

88
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:17,380
and then the this leg comes shot well
 

89
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,339
and then the this leg comes shot well
same thing here during in move should

90
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:20,349
same thing here during in move should
 

91
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:24,360
same thing here during in move should
happen more in place Warren place more

forward turn your hips in place then you

96
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
forward turn your hips in place then you
 

97
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,710
forward turn your hips in place then you
okay try to get okay so just

105
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,090

just like in the other move as my hips

106
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:00,100
just like in the other move as my hips
 

107
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,810
just like in the other move as my hips
rotate they can't rotate in place so and

108
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:03,820
rotate they can't rotate in place so and
 

109
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,870
rotate they can't rotate in place so and
Sheila Ted common a rotate him in place

110
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:05,880
Sheila Ted common a rotate him in place
 

111
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,520
Sheila Ted common a rotate him in place
and watch no violence there was a weight

112
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,530
and watch no violence there was a weight
 

113
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,820

shift and had to happen right so I had

114
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:14,830
shift and had to happen right so I had
 

115
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,180
shift and had to happen right so I had
to go to a single pivot home when I'm

116
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,190
to go to a single pivot home when I'm
 

117
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,060
to go to a single pivot home when I'm
here like that so my ex rotated and I am

118
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,070
here like that so my ex rotated and I am
 

119
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,250
here like that so my ex rotated and I am
pivoting and weighted over this way I

120
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:23,260
pivoting and weighted over this way I
 

121
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,620
pivoting and weighted over this way I
can hang out there all day same kind of

can hang out there all day same kind of
 

123
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,820
can hang out there all day same kind of
thing so to do that is my hips rotate

124
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:28,830
thing so to do that is my hips rotate
 

125
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,600
