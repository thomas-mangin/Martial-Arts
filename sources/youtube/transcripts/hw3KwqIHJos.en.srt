171
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,430
heard him say that so many times I
didn't realize the essence of

172
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440

 

173
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,710

it all right control come up

180
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:40,280

 

181
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,230

tired all right you don't know what's

182
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:43,240
tired all right you don't know what's
 

183
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,150
tired all right you don't know what's
going on in my head and I'm like I'm

184
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
going on in my head and I'm like I'm
 

185
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,070
going on in my head and I'm like I'm
like Fork lightning I'm down there I'm

186
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,080
like Fork lightning I'm down there I'm
 

187
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,029
like Fork lightning I'm down there I'm
going I'm working out every twitch he's

188
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:54,039
going I'm working out every twitch he's
 

189
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,469
going I'm working out every twitch he's
doing I'm working our electrical

190
00:04:57,469 --> 00:04:57,479
doing I'm working our electrical
 

191
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,790
doing I'm working our electrical
angle all right so a bit too heavy for

192
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
angle all right so a bit too heavy for
 

193
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,390
angle all right so a bit too heavy for
today isn't it

194
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400

 

195
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,110

but so if you think you're turning over

196
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
but so if you think you're turning over
 

197
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,150
but so if you think you're turning over
but then it goes over that way a little

198
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,160
but then it goes over that way a little
 

199
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,670
but then it goes over that way a little
bit you're not actually getting out the

200
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
bit you're not actually getting out the
 

201
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,550
bit you're not actually getting out the
way cuz then you bring it back here and

202
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
way cuz then you bring it back here and
 

203
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,390
way cuz then you bring it back here and
it might be subtle but that's what as a

204
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
it might be subtle but that's what as a
 

205
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,629
it might be subtle but that's what as a
teacher I'm trying to give

206
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:23,639
teacher I'm trying to give
 

207
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,390
teacher I'm trying to give
you

208
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:27,400

 

209
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,830

subtlety okay so we'll try again

210
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:30,840
subtlety okay so we'll try again
 

211
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,550
subtlety okay so we'll try again
uh you don't have to think exactly what

212
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
uh you don't have to think exactly what
 

213
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,830
uh you don't have to think exactly what
I think but you know make sure you're

214
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:34,840
I think but you know make sure you're
 

215
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,950
I think but you know make sure you're
not in their way they should they should

216
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
not in their way they should they should
 

217
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,070
not in their way they should they should
be able to keep going and you should be

218
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
be able to keep going and you should be
 

219
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,150
be able to keep going and you should be
able to uh do the

220
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
able to uh do the
 

221
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,189
able to uh do the
technique there's this

222
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:44,199
technique there's this
 

223
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,390
technique there's this
one there's this one where I'm still

224
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
one there's this one where I'm still
 

225
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,469
one there's this one where I'm still
getting out the way but the right timing

226
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:49,479
getting out the way but the right timing
 

227
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:50,909
getting out the way but the right timing
that one comes

228
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:50,919
that one comes
 

229
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,550
that one comes
in so you can play around I don't care

230
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:53,560
in so you can play around I don't care
 

231
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,430
in so you can play around I don't care
how many variations I see I normally see

232
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
how many variations I see I normally see
 

233
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,110
how many variations I see I normally see
a lot of variations when you're trying

234
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
a lot of variations when you're trying
 

235
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,319
a lot of variations when you're trying
to do it my way anyhow don't
