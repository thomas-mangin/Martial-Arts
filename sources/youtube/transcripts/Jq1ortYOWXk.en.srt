00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:01,240
have a counter enery energy uh in the
 

167
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,950
have a counter enery energy uh in the
sense that he he pushes out and then I'm

168
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:03,960
sense that he he pushes out and then I'm
 

169
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,950
sense that he he pushes out and then I'm
pushing in that's not what's happening

170
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:05,960
pushing in that's not what's happening
 

171
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,870
pushing in that's not what's happening
okay so uh it's just I'm here if he

172
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:09,880
okay so uh it's just I'm here if he
 

173

00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:12,039
brought his hands in I would of course
 

175
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,350
brought his hands in I would of course
bring my hands in more to to keep that

176
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,360
bring my hands in more to to keep that
 

177
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,270
bring my hands in more to to keep that
friction there

178
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,280
friction there
 

179
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,710
friction there
okay but he's still trying to do de do

180
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
okay but he's still trying to do de do
 

181
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,270
okay but he's still trying to do de do
push okay it's just

00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:32,759

 

185
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,390

counter and you can't I'm using the

186
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,400
counter and you can't I'm using the
 

187
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,150
counter and you can't I'm using the
adhesion now to do the same positional

188
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,160
adhesion now to do the same positional
 

189
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,309
adhesion now to do the same positional
Integrity

190
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:42,319

 

191
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,510

okay all right all right I come around

195
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,430

push switch these

196
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440

 

197
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:24,270

sides you're pushing

199
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,589

okay we'll switch

200
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:25,599
okay we'll switch
 

201
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,670
okay we'll switch
sides do the

202
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
sides do the
 

203
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,430
sides do the
counter B

204
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:30,440
counter B
 

205
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,309
counter B
and then try to get rid of those hooks

206
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:33,319
and then try to get rid of those hooks
 

207
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,629
and then try to get rid of those hooks
there you

208
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639

just get stuck on the contact
Point okay seven we do uh fi

246
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:29,960
Point okay seven we do uh fi
 

247
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,029
Point okay seven we do uh fi
Uno but from the adhesion so I go Y Line

248
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
Uno but from the adhesion so I go Y Line
 

249
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:49,629
Uno but from the adhesion so I go Y Line
to Y line through his Center okay say

250
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:49,639

 

251
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:58,309

again okay let's

252
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319

 

253
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:25,790

try

254
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:25,800

 

255
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,550

so in the C

256
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:27,560
so in the C
 

257
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,270
so in the C
drills it's there's a built-in Center

258
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:30,280
drills it's there's a built-in Center
 

259
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,589
drills it's there's a built-in Center
catching you got to catch the center

260
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:32,599
catching you got to catch the center
 

261
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,829
catching you got to catch the center
okay so uh he Co drills it starts out

262
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:36,839
okay so uh he Co drills it starts out
 

263
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,790
okay so uh he Co drills it starts out
you don't even know you're doing it okay

264
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:39,800
you don't even know you're doing it okay
 

265
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,829
you don't even know you're doing it okay
you so you most people just move back

266
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
you so you most people just move back
 

267
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,509
you so you most people just move back
here and then move back forward like on

268
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:44,519
here and then move back forward like on
 

269
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,910
here and then move back forward like on
Dr uh number two D number three okay so

270
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
Dr uh number two D number three okay so
 

271
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,829
Dr uh number two D number three okay so
they're doing fi Uno but right here

272
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
they're doing fi Uno but right here
 

273
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,190
they're doing fi Uno but right here
there's a

274
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
there's a
 

275
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,430
there's a
catch right where you catch it boom and

276
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
catch right where you catch it boom and
 

277
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,550
catch right where you catch it boom and
then back but most people wait

278
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:01,560

 

279
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,470

and it's caught but only butter

280
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
and it's caught but only butter
 

281
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,069
and it's caught but only butter
prescription okay as we move into the

282
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:08,079
prescription okay as we move into the
 

283
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,590
prescription okay as we move into the
next drill where you don't come back to

284
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:10,600
next drill where you don't come back to
 

285
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,190
next drill where you don't come back to
Y phase but only the Y phase here that

286
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,200
Y phase but only the Y phase here that
 

287
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,670
Y phase but only the Y phase here that
catch is very

288
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
catch is very
 

289
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,550
catch is very
important so he catch

290
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
important so he catch
 

291
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,910
important so he catch
boom you then you get the balce more so

292
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
boom you then you get the balce more so
 

293
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,310
boom you then you get the balce more so
catch boom oh then as you go on the

294
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:25,320
catch boom oh then as you go on the
 

295
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,550
catch boom oh then as you go on the
catching becomes way more important um

296
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
catching becomes way more important um
 

297
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,389
catching becomes way more important um
so as we going forward there's a catch

298
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
so as we going forward there's a catch
 

299
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,110
so as we going forward there's a catch
that I'm doing internally that's what is

300
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,120
that I'm doing internally that's what is
 

301
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,430
that I'm doing internally that's what is
allowing that to happen and then we go

302
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:36,440
allowing that to happen and then we go
 

303
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,190
allowing that to happen and then we go
to drill 7 there's a catch when I come

304
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
to drill 7 there's a catch when I come
 

305
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,670
to drill 7 there's a catch when I come
in there's a catch what's the catch the

306
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
in there's a catch what's the catch the
 

307
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,710
in there's a catch what's the catch the
catch is that his tanden and my tanden

308
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
catch is that his tanden and my tanden
 

309
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,630
catch is that his tanden and my tanden
are in that iy state there's a kind of a

310
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:47,640
are in that iy state there's a kind of a
 

311
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,630
are in that iy state there's a kind of a
sense here like if he was throwing uh go

312
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:51,640
sense here like if he was throwing uh go
 

313
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,870
sense here like if he was throwing uh go
grab us one of the heavy balls as he

314
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
grab us one of the heavy balls as he
 

315
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,990
grab us one of the heavy balls as he
catches as he throws it I don't go

316
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
catches as he throws it I don't go
 

317
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,750
catches as he throws it I don't go
that's not what I do okay as as he

318
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:00,760
that's not what I do okay as as he
 

319
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,269
that's not what I do okay as as he
throws itom I catch it I go with it

320
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
throws itom I catch it I go with it
 

321
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,590
throws itom I catch it I go with it
catch it okay catch it this is the same

322
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
catch it okay catch it this is the same
 

323
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,430
catch it okay catch it this is the same
thing I'm doing the center catch it boom

324
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:12,440
thing I'm doing the center catch it boom
 

325
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,630
thing I'm doing the center catch it boom
okay and that becomes even more

326
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
okay and that becomes even more
 

327
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,590
okay and that becomes even more
important as you're doing the uh iy ver

328
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
important as you're doing the uh iy ver
 

329
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,670
important as you're doing the uh iy ver
variance because you don't have the

330
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
variance because you don't have the
 

331
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,509
variance because you don't have the
ledges or the of the grip nor the

332
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:22,519
ledges or the of the grip nor the
 

333
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,910
ledges or the of the grip nor the
mechanics of the grip so you have to

334
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:24,920
mechanics of the grip so you have to
 

335
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,790
mechanics of the grip so you have to
catch it

336
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:27,800
catch it
 

337
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,870
catch it
catch catch

338
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
catch catch
 

339
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,710
catch catch
okay boom catch boom all right pay

340
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
okay boom catch boom all right pay
 

341
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,509
okay boom catch boom all right pay
attention Okay drill eight to the Y Line

342
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
attention Okay drill eight to the Y Line
 

343
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,990
attention Okay drill eight to the Y Line
so this one I do catch it on the back

344
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
so this one I do catch it on the back
 

345
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,670
so this one I do catch it on the back
foot but then I don't go past the yin

346
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:42,680
foot but then I don't go past the yin
 

347
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,750
foot but then I don't go past the yin
then Yin is ankle straight okay uh so

348
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:46,760
then Yin is ankle straight okay uh so
 

349
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,790
then Yin is ankle straight okay uh so
catch ankle straight catch ankle

350
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:51,800
catch ankle straight catch ankle
 

351
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,230
catch ankle straight catch ankle
straight catch ankle

352
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:55,240
straight catch ankle
 

353
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,350
straight catch ankle
straight attach ankle straight it's very

00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
straight attach ankle straight it's very
 

355
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,269
straight attach ankle straight it's very
important uh what why I like these iy

356
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
important uh what why I like these iy
 

357
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,110
important uh what why I like these iy
drills is there's the desire to throw

358
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
drills is there's the desire to throw
 

359
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,069
drills is there's the desire to throw
and as you desire to throw you're going

360
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
and as you desire to throw you're going
 

361
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,870
and as you desire to throw you're going
to start to slip because you're going to

362
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:11,880
to start to slip because you're going to
 

363
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,030
to start to slip because you're going to
out Yong the Y aspect of him and you'll

364
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
out Yong the Y aspect of him and you'll
 

365
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,590
out Yong the Y aspect of him and you'll
slip

366
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:16,600
slip
 

367
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,310

okay um or you start to grab or you look

368
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
okay um or you start to grab or you look
 

369
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,990
okay um or you start to grab or you look
for Ledges of some kind okay so you have

370
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,000
for Ledges of some kind okay so you have
 

371
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,590
for Ledges of some kind okay so you have
to your hands basically boom just kind

372
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
to your hands basically boom just kind
 

373
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,590
to your hands basically boom just kind
of fly out exactly like Pom My Hands

374
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:28,600
of fly out exactly like Pom My Hands
 

375
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,310
of fly out exactly like Pom My Hands
just fly out there so I come out keep

376
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,320
just fly out there so I come out keep
 

377
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,790
just fly out there so I come out keep
the feeling boom feeling catch boom okay

378
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
the feeling boom feeling catch boom okay
 

379
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,310
the feeling boom feeling catch boom okay
let's try through mind is going forward

380
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
let's try through mind is going forward
 

381
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,710
let's try through mind is going forward
uh and again a lot of the skills in

382
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
uh and again a lot of the skills in
 

383
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,470
uh and again a lot of the skills in
order to climb the sequence I I'm not

384
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:45,480
order to climb the sequence I I'm not
 

385
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,110

telling you what you're doing again that

386
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,120
telling you what you're doing again that
 

387
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,310
telling you what you're doing again that
gets in the way for most people the ego

388
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
gets in the way for most people the ego
 

389
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,590
gets in the way for most people the ego
tripartite mind will aim for that

390
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:52,600
tripartite mind will aim for that
 

391
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,509
tripartite mind will aim for that
instead of the feeling okay um so I kind

392
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
instead of the feeling okay um so I kind
 

393
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,190
instead of the feeling okay um so I kind
of leave it leave the drills to work

394
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
of leave it leave the drills to work
 

395
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,310
of leave it leave the drills to work
their magic on their own and when the

396
00:11:59,310 --> 00:11:59,320
their magic on their own and when the
 

397
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,470
their magic on their own and when the
student feels something I and and I can

398
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
student feels something I and and I can
 

399
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,430
student feels something I and and I can
sense that they feel it then I just keep

400
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:04,440
sense that they feel it then I just keep
 

401
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,030
sense that they feel it then I just keep
doing that keep feeling that keep

402
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,040
doing that keep feeling that keep
 

403
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,110
doing that keep feeling that keep
feeling that okay that's the best way of

404
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,120
feeling that okay that's the best way of
 

405
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,629
feeling that okay that's the best way of
learning this all right so uh when we

406
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:11,639
learning this all right so uh when we
 

407
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,310
learning this all right so uh when we
have the cut drils it looks like he has

408
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
have the cut drils it looks like he has
 

409
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,230
have the cut drils it looks like he has
his

410
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:15,240
his
 

411
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,990
his
grip and some people will be using the

412
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
grip and some people will be using the
 

413
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,910
grip and some people will be using the
grip so you use their

414
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
grip so you use their
 

415
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,750
grip so you use their
friction and the fact that your arm gets

416
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:22,760
friction and the fact that your arm gets
 

417
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,110
friction and the fact that your arm gets
wider here so you use that anatomical

418
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
wider here so you use that anatomical
 

419
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,710
wider here so you use that anatomical
ledge of the widening forearm to

420
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:27,720
ledge of the widening forearm to
 

421
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,470
ledge of the widening forearm to
generate that

422
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:29,480
generate that
 

423
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,629
generate that
projection point but if you were doing

424
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:31,639
projection point but if you were doing
 

425
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,990
projection point but if you were doing
it right you're inside you're inside the

426
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
it right you're inside you're inside the
 

427
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,430
it right you're inside you're inside the
grip and you have that same adhesion you

428
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:36,440
grip and you have that same adhesion you
 

429
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,269
grip and you have that same adhesion you
were you you were doing it right uh if

430
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
were you you were doing it right uh if
 

431
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,269
were you you were doing it right uh if
you're doing it right you were doing it

432
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
you're doing it right you were doing it
 

433
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,069
you're doing it right you were doing it
without Reliance on that physicality and

434
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
without Reliance on that physicality and
 

435
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,629
without Reliance on that physicality and
then pushing through you would feel his

436
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
then pushing through you would feel his
 

437
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,350
then pushing through you would feel his
grip and your inside his grip okay so

438
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:50,360
grip and your inside his grip okay so
 

439
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,629
grip and your inside his grip okay so
we're not really doing anything

440
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:51,639
we're not really doing anything
 

441
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,629
we're not really doing anything
different we're just taking away the

442
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:53,639
different we're just taking away the
 

443
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,310
different we're just taking away the
anatomical possibility of the grip of

444
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
anatomical possibility of the grip of
 

445
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,670
anatomical possibility of the grip of
using the grip okay as as we go on in

446
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
using the grip okay as as we go on in
 

447
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,150
using the grip okay as as we go on in
this drill it's a little bit more

448
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
this drill it's a little bit more
 

449
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,790
this drill it's a little bit more
complicated because we have to walk

450
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:03,800
complicated because we have to walk
 

451
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,829
complicated because we have to walk
towards each other and somewhere in

452
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
towards each other and somewhere in
 

453
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,790
towards each other and somewhere in
there I got a counter uh I like what the

454
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
there I got a counter uh I like what the
 

455
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,189
there I got a counter uh I like what the
complexity does because sometimes I

456
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:11,199
complexity does because sometimes I
 

457
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:15,590
complexity does because sometimes I
don't get the perfect uh point I might

458
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
don't get the perfect uh point I might
 

459
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,750
don't get the perfect uh point I might
get one hand half in grip one hand not

460
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:18,760
get one hand half in grip one hand not
 

461
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,750
get one hand half in grip one hand not
in grip you can still do the projection

462
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
in grip you can still do the projection
 

463
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,550
in grip you can still do the projection
okay so just let the magic happens but

464
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
okay so just let the magic happens but
 

465
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,550
okay so just let the magic happens but
as far as everything else it's exactly

475
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,430
okay let's try and uh Dr 10 is the
same so from out of the horse stance
