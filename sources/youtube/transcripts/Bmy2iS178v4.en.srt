okay so the first part of the practice
 

13
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:26,830
okay so the first part of the practice
we do we we cut a to the rest

14
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:26,840

 

15
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,790

or we come to the Head

16
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:31,800

 

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,310

to the side of the head

18
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
to the side of the head
 

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,950
to the side of the head
then you'll come in this cat is still

20
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
then you'll come in this cat is still
 

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,910
then you'll come in this cat is still
the same I don't I don't handle it I

22
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:40,920
the same I don't I don't handle it I
 

23
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,630
the same I don't I don't handle it I
just

24
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:41,640
just
 

25
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,350
just
move my body to a different angle so my

26
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
move my body to a different angle so my
 

27
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,810
move my body to a different angle so my
cuts are straight

28
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:47,820
cuts are straight
 

29
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,490
cuts are straight
but if I move to the side

30
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:52,500

 

31
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,970

some teachers they they bring off the

32
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:55,980
some teachers they they bring off the
 

33
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,709
some teachers they they bring off the
side of the head and they cut like this

34
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:57,719
side of the head and they cut like this
 

35
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,930
side of the head and they cut like this
to me this is the incorrect

36
00:00:59,930 --> 00:00:59,940
to me this is the incorrect
 

37
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,889
to me this is the incorrect
of noticing my sensitive teachers so

38
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:03,899
of noticing my sensitive teachers so
 

39
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,450
of noticing my sensitive teachers so
here

40
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:05,460
here
 

41
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,289
here
is straight part of the practice capture

42
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:09,299
is straight part of the practice capture
 

43
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,070
is straight part of the practice capture
the wrist

44
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,080

 

45
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,370

so

46
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:15,380
so
 

47
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,350
so
they come to the West

48
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:18,360
they come to the West
 

49
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,350
they come to the West
or

50
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:20,360
or
 

51
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,429
or
he cut to the Head the temple

52

he cut to the Head the temple
 

53
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,929
he cut to the Head the temple
so this is the observation part now

54
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:32,939
