1
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,950

so I

2
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
so I
 

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,830
so I
know I'm oriented this way towards

4
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:32,840
know I'm oriented this way towards
 

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,350
know I'm oriented this way towards
her and I know on the first move I'm

6
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
her and I know on the first move I'm
 

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,110
her and I know on the first move I'm
going to bring her over

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
going to bring her over
 

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,069
going to bring her over
here I know I should face her

10
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
here I know I should face her
 

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,950
here I know I should face her
then so at some point there's a degree

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
then so at some point there's a degree
 

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,830
then so at some point there's a degree
of

14
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
of
 

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,189
of
rotation I know

16
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:50,199
rotation I know
 

17
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:55,270
rotation I know
that I know that there's certain joint

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
that I know that there's certain joint
 

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,150
that I know that there's certain joint
alignments or joint relationships I have

20
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
alignments or joint relationships I have
 

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,750
alignments or joint relationships I have
to keep intact

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:00,760
to keep intact
 

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,910
to keep intact
so the foot

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:02,920
so the foot
 

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,149
so the foot
knee hip shoulder elbow

26
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:07,159
knee hip shoulder elbow
 

27
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,950
knee hip shoulder elbow
wrist I don't I'm not going to do this

28
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:09,960
wrist I don't I'm not going to do this
 

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,350
wrist I don't I'm not going to do this
change the relationship

30
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360

 

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,550

here I'm not going to do this change the

32
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
here I'm not going to do this change the
 

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,230
here I'm not going to do this change the
KNE to foot

34
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,469
relationship
okay I also know that she has y aspect

38
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
okay I also know that she has y aspect
 

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,190
okay I also know that she has y aspect
to her

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,510
to her
movement so let's start there young

42
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
movement so let's start there young
 

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,830

you see that so right here it's that X

58
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
you see that so right here it's that X
 

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,789
you see that so right here it's that X
and here's x + y you see that and then x

00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
and here's x + y you see that and then x
 

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,749
and here's x + y you see that and then x
- y That's she falls in so that that

would not be a harmonization then

64
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:04,439
would not be a harmonization then
 

65
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,870
would not be a harmonization then
there's a clash right in right there

66
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
there's a clash right in right there
 

67
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,430
there's a clash right in right there
okay so you push harder and you'll see

everything go
 

73
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,949
everything go
back but this is also

see okay so what you do

80
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
see okay so what you do
 

81
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,750
see okay so what you do
instead is you shift onto the back foot

82
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:30,760
instead is you shift onto the back foot
 

83
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,830
instead is you shift onto the back foot
so as you come

84
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:32,840
so as you come
 

85

87
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,830

back and I start to work off of this

88
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:40,840
back and I start to work off of this
 

89
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,309

it to not work

94
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:53,640
it to not work
 

95
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,830
it to not work
against the rotation I leave my foot

96
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:56,840
against the rotation I leave my foot
 

97
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,830
against the rotation I leave my foot
there and I turn that's me working again

98
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
there and I turn that's me working again
 

99
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,750
there and I turn that's me working again
against the foot but when I take weight

against the foot but when I take weight
 

101
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,949
against the foot but when I take weight
off of it it's very light to

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:12,590

what

154
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:12,600

 

155
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:22,110

I'm on the

156
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,120

 

157
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,990

ground okay all you're in that ballp

158
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
ground okay all you're in that ballp
 

159
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,749
ground okay all you're in that ballp
part the elbow

160
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
part the elbow
 

161
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,909
part the elbow
is going to guide when that foot turns

162
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:32,919
is going to guide when that foot turns
 

163
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,189
is going to guide when that foot turns
it turns with the

164
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:36,199

 

165
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,670

elbow and hence you'll never end up like

166
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
elbow and hence you'll never end up like
 

167
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,749

this
 

169
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,550
this
see like that here you got

170
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:45,560
see like that here you got
 

171
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,830
see like that here you got
crunched

172
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:48,840

 

173
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,150

okay so

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,160
okay so
 

175
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,350
okay so

00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,870
slightly that way close the
quaw the foot moves with the elbow and

180
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
quaw the foot moves with the elbow and
 

181
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,270
quaw the foot moves with the elbow and
you maintain that Harmony shoulder elbow

182
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,280
you maintain that Harmony shoulder elbow
 

183
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,790
you maintain that Harmony shoulder elbow

someone that's
 

203
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,550
someone that's
pushing okay the same thing if she was

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:05,560
pushing okay the same thing if she was
 

205
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,909
pushing okay the same thing if she was
pulling right she's pulling I ground on

pulling right she's pulling I ground on
 

207
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,309
pulling right she's pulling I ground on
the back foot and close the

208
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:13,319
the back foot and close the
 

209
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,909
the back foot and close the
core

210
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:15,919
core
 

211
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:22,469

okay the technique though she's

212
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479

 

213
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,309

attention to the foot elbow relationship

216
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:34,199

 

217
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:46,070

my weight on this

foot
 

221
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,029
foot
okay now we can do the next thing

222
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:52,039
okay now we can do the next thing
 

223
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,510
okay now we can do the next thing
one and you can see that when I shift

224
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:56,520
one and you can see that when I shift
 

225
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,670
one and you can see that when I shift
here that this quaw this foot

226
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:00,680
here that this quaw this foot
 

227
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,950
here that this quaw this foot
this knee this shoulder they have

228
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
this knee this shoulder they have
 

229
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,350
this knee this shoulder they have
the organization that I

230
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:08,360
the organization that I
 

231
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,029
the organization that I
want now I reorganize the other side

232
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
want now I reorganize the other side
 

233
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,390
want now I reorganize the other side
okay you can see that as I do

234
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
okay you can see that as I do
 

235
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,990
okay you can see that as I do
this I come back and now I'm on the

277
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,310
now I can pass you the rest of the way
that works okay and that's what we're

278
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
that works okay and that's what we're
 

279
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,790
that works okay and that's what we're
doing here one and I go to the other

280
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:33,800

 

281
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,350

side one and I'm on the other side I'm

on the other foot

284
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320

 

285
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,509

now this fall this

286
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:44,519

 

287
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,310

fall this

288
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
fall this
 

289
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,509
fall this
this that allows me to close so if I

290
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
this that allows me to close so if I
 

291
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,509
this that allows me to close so if I
stay here on this claw or's I'd have to

292
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:54,519
stay here on this claw or's I'd have to
 

293
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,230
stay here on this claw or's I'd have to
violate the harmonies but when I go to

294
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:57,240
violate the harmonies but when I go to
 

295
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,430
violate the harmonies but when I go to
the other quaw it closes

296
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:00,440
the other quaw it closes
 

297
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,750
the other quaw it closes
and I can keep it again foot knee elbow

298
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
and I can keep it again foot knee elbow
 

299
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,430
and I can keep it again foot knee elbow
shoulder so just like I'm on this claw

00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:22,519
here just want you to understand that
 

307
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:25,949
here just want you to understand that
you've pass her she's past you in the

311
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,949

okay well now that happens before we

312
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:35,959
okay well now that happens before we
 

313
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:39,710
okay well now that happens before we
adem okay try another pointer to help

314
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:39,720

out so unweighted

316
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:44,360

rotation is done on the
 

319
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,069
rotation is done on the

00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:51,079
heel this is weighted this is unweighted
 

321
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:55,710
heel this is weighted this is unweighted
see you pivot you rotated on the

322
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:55,720
see you pivot you rotated on the
 

323
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,230
see you pivot you rotated on the
heel weighted

324
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
heel weighted
 

325
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,670

rotation that's where I'm going to shift

326
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:00,680
rotation that's where I'm going to shift
 

327
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,230
rotation that's where I'm going to shift
here is done on the ball of the foot on

328
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:05,240
here is done on the ball of the foot on
 

329
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,470
here is done on the ball of the foot on
the ball of the

330
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
the ball of the
 

331
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,430
the ball of the
foot do you guys see that don't don't go

332
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:10,440
foot do you guys see that don't don't go
 

333
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,949
foot do you guys see that don't don't go
ball the foot here because you're

334
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:11,959
ball the foot here because you're
 

335
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:13,430
ball the foot here because you're
waiting and it's supposed to be

336
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
waiting and it's supposed to be
 

337
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,750
waiting and it's supposed to be
unweighted so it's on the heel and then

338
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:16,760
unweighted so it's on the heel and then
 

339
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,069
unweighted so it's on the heel and then
likewise you're going to reweight

340
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
likewise you're going to reweight
 

341
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,829
likewise you're going to reweight
it and rotate on it it goes on the ball

342
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:24,839
it and rotate on it it goes on the ball
 

343
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:25,750
it and rotate on it it goes on the ball
of the

344
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
of the
 

345
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,030
of the

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
that means I'm entering into y space so
 

391
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:54,470
that means I'm entering into y space so
I take you away and I enter into that

little turn that we did here right when

396
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
little turn that we did here right when
 

397
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,350
little turn that we did here right when
I go under this

398
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:04,360
I go under this
 

399
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,310
I go under this
foot I use it to turn now into the EDI

400
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:09,320
foot I use it to turn now into the EDI
 

401
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,269
foot I use it to turn now into the EDI
so you don't stay in place okay I had

402
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:12,279
so you don't stay in place okay I had
 

403
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,990
so you don't stay in place okay I had
you stay in place so you have the

404
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
you stay in place so you have the
 

405
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,509
you stay in place so you have the
mechanics but when you come around to

406
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:16,519
mechanics but when you come around to
 

407
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,069
mechanics but when you come around to
this side you enter into that

408
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:20,079
this side you enter into that
 

409
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,710
this side you enter into that
turn so you have to stay weighted a

410
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
turn so you have to stay weighted a
 

411
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,949
turn so you have to stay weighted a
little longer

412
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
little longer
 

413
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,910
little longer
here and you turn on the ball the foot

414
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
here and you turn on the ball the foot
 

415
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,550
here and you turn on the ball the foot
there

416
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560

 

417
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,150

right right here is three that's what

418
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,160
right right here is three that's what
 

419
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,910
right right here is three that's what
you need okay that's where you enter you

420
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
you need okay that's where you enter you
 

421
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,189
you need okay that's where you enter you
don't enter

422
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
don't enter
 

423
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,389
don't enter
into pushing

424
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:45,399

 

425
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:55,710

on there's nothing here you got light

426
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:55,720

 

427
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,670

okay the bigger mistake is that when you

428
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:58,680
okay the bigger mistake is that when you
 

429
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,870
okay the bigger mistake is that when you
get here you iner you violate everything

430
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:01,880
get here you iner you violate everything
 

431
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,590
get here you iner you violate everything
we just did this side

432
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:06,600

 

433
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,230

Mar and you did this again and you're

434
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
Mar and you did this again and you're
 

435
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,230
Mar and you did this again and you're
trying to turn so when you

436
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:13,240
trying to turn so when you
 

437
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,949
trying to turn so when you
incher you

438
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
incher you
 

439
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,910
incher you
incher

440
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:18,920

 

441
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,910

turning you can step just like when I'm

442
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
turning you can step just like when I'm
 

443
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,430
turning you can step just like when I'm
here and I

444
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:24,440
here and I
 

445
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,710
here and I
reposition my

and
 

521
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:09,870
and
okay TR so your degree of

522
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:09,880

 

523
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,110

rotation can't

524
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,120
rotation can't
 

525
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,189
rotation can't
violate

526
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:14,199
violate
 

527
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,309
violate
those organization between those joints

528
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:19,319
those organization between those joints
 

529
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,909
those organization between those joints
okay and you're that means you have a

530
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:21,919
okay and you're that means you have a
 

531
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,870
okay and you're that means you have a
ceiling to what you can do because if

532
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:23,880
ceiling to what you can do because if
 

533
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,470
ceiling to what you can do because if
you over rotate one joint or two joints

534
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
you over rotate one joint or two joints
 

535
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,270
you over rotate one joint or two joints
they'll fall out of a harmonious align

536
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
they'll fall out of a harmonious align
 

537
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,909
they'll fall out of a harmonious align
with the other

538
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:30,919
with the other
 

539
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,590
with the other
joints what we do instead is this claw

540
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:36,600
joints what we do instead is this claw
 

541
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,510
joints what we do instead is this claw
gives me we we didn't measure it Andrew

542
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:40,520
gives me we we didn't measure it Andrew
 

543
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,470

rotational um movement okay so you're

550
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:53,720
rotational um movement okay so you're
 

551
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,430
rotational um movement okay so you're
doing your Technique uh in Su waza
