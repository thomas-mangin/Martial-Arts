1
00:00:28,840 --> 00:01:05,350

um

2
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360

 

3
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,670

this time the guy is going to come in

4
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
this time the guy is going to come in
 

5
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,070
this time the guy is going to come in
right the guy comes in like this right

6
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
right the guy comes in like this right
 

7
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,350
right the guy comes in like this right
okay this time he's going to come in

8
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
okay this time he's going to come in
 

9
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,789
okay this time he's going to come in
and push the car shoulder okay

10
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
and push the car shoulder okay
 

11
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,710
and push the car shoulder okay
so you were here this time you step

12
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
so you were here this time you step
 

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,469
so you were here this time you step
in you push the car

14
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
in you push the car
 

15
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,230
in you push the car
the other side

16
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240

 

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,030

so it could be like boom

18
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040

 

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,950

okay we're just doing the push part

20
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
okay we're just doing the push part
 

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,270
okay we're just doing the push part
but you have to keep in mind it could

22
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
but you have to keep in mind it could
 

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,270
but you have to keep in mind it could
easily go

24
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
easily go
 

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,950
easily go
okay you guys understand

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960

 

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,670

so the guy is going to push right

28
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
so the guy is going to push right
 

29
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,950
so the guy is going to push right
and they're going to do the same foot

30
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
and they're going to do the same foot
 

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,910
and they're going to do the same foot
maneuver

32
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920

 

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,709

not well ahead of him because he's not

34
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
not well ahead of him because he's not
 

35
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,910
not well ahead of him because he's not
going to do that

36
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
going to do that
 

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:11,670
going to do that
i have to ride in him

38
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680

 

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:35,430

too early

40
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440

 

41
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,509

all right if i am late then my base

42
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
all right if i am late then my base
 

43
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,030
all right if i am late then my base
is affected

44
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040

 

45
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,309

if i'm early his base is not okay

46
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
if i'm early his base is not okay
 

47
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,350
if i'm early his base is not okay
but if i do it right time

48
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
but if i do it right time
 

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,430
but if i do it right time
my base is not affected you see that

50
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
my base is not affected you see that
 

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,270
my base is not affected you see that
little

52
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
little
 

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,790
little
residual intention okay that's what you

54
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
residual intention okay that's what you
 

55
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,149
residual intention okay that's what you
want

56
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
want
 

57
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,670
want
today i'm i'm manipulating

58
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
today i'm i'm manipulating
 

59
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,790
today i'm i'm manipulating
too early he's not

60
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
too early he's not
 

61
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,830
too early he's not
right where he's gonna push you

62
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
right where he's gonna push you
 

63
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,149
right where he's gonna push you
so you have your angle of deviation

64
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
so you have your angle of deviation
 

65
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,630
so you have your angle of deviation
and you want it redundant with the angle

66
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
and you want it redundant with the angle
 

67
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,030
and you want it redundant with the angle
of deflection

68
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
of deflection
 

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,350
of deflection
but you can't deflect so that you don't

70
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
but you can't deflect so that you don't
 

71
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,430
but you can't deflect so that you don't
have that residual intention on this

72
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
have that residual intention on this
 

73
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,710
have that residual intention on this
part

74
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
part
 

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,630
part
let it come to your body you see

76
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
let it come to your body you see
 

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:44,830
let it come to your body you see
see how he is coming in

78
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840

 

79
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,390

in

80
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400

 

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:04:26,830

okay try it

82
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840

 

83
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,469

um

84
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
um
 

85
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,310
um
yeah you don't want either or okay

86
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
yeah you don't want either or okay
 

87
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,950
yeah you don't want either or okay
you don't want residual intention

88
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
you don't want residual intention
 

89
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,350
you don't want residual intention
you don't want or

90
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360

 

91
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,350

arm control okay you use one to give you

92
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
arm control okay you use one to give you
 

93
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,030
arm control okay you use one to give you
the other

94
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040

 

95
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,790

see the difference okay

96
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
see the difference okay
 

97
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,950
see the difference okay
see that little extra hop he's taking

98
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
see that little extra hop he's taking
 

99
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:30,469
see that little extra hop he's taking
i want that

100
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479

 

101
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,790

so you see what's happening is you're

102
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
so you see what's happening is you're
 

103
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,590
so you see what's happening is you're
all fine

104
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
all fine
 

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,430
all fine
pushing when you like he's not here okay

106
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
pushing when you like he's not here okay
 

107
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,469
pushing when you like he's not here okay
and you're all fine pushing

108
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
and you're all fine pushing
 

109
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,230
and you're all fine pushing
but the second you start aiming down

110
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
but the second you start aiming down
 

111
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,830
but the second you start aiming down
then you stop pushing

112
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840

 

113
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,870

okay you can't be a coward you cannot be

114
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
okay you can't be a coward you cannot be
 

115
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,110
okay you can't be a coward you cannot be
a coward to train aikido

116
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
a coward to train aikido
 

117
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,510
a coward to train aikido
all right you cannot worry about your

118
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
all right you cannot worry about your
 

119
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,510
all right you cannot worry about your
face so much

120
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
face so much
 

121
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,270
face so much
you know how many times my nose has been

122
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
you know how many times my nose has been
 

123
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,550
you know how many times my nose has been
broken so

124
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
broken so
 

125
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,510
broken so
you can't come in here do that

126
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
you can't come in here do that
 

127
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,670
you can't come in here do that
what was your attack right

128
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
what was your attack right
 

129
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,550
what was your attack right
right let's do that one with this other

130
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
right let's do that one with this other
 

131
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,710
right let's do that one with this other
cowardice one

132
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720

 

133
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,870

not the same thing he's gonna punch me

134
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
not the same thing he's gonna punch me
 

135
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,830
not the same thing he's gonna punch me
when i come back

136
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
when i come back
 

137
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,469
when i come back
oh right because i went again

138
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
oh right because i went again
 

139
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,510
oh right because i went again
so make sure you you come in you can go

140
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
so make sure you you come in you can go
 

141
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,550
so make sure you you come in you can go
slow but you have to keep coming in

142
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
slow but you have to keep coming in
 

143
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:38,550
slow but you have to keep coming in
when he does the technique boom

144
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560

 

145
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,029

you keep coming in you can't control the

146
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
you keep coming in you can't control the
 

147
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,790
you keep coming in you can't control the
speed if you want

148
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
speed if you want
 

149
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,749
speed if you want
but you cannot change the physics do not

150
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
but you cannot change the physics do not
 

151
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:56,070
but you cannot change the physics do not
change the attack

152
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080

 

153
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:11,350

can you push your shoulder in his head

154
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360

 

155
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,150

all right let's work on this

156
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
all right let's work on this
 

157
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,510
all right let's work on this
the guy's coming in and i have

158
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
the guy's coming in and i have
 

159
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:34,309
the guy's coming in and i have
this right watch what his body does

160
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319

 

161
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,790

all i'm going to do is keep his arm

162
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800

 

163
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,870

going on that circle you guys can

164
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
going on that circle you guys can
 

165
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,670
going on that circle you guys can
visualize

166
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680

 

167
00:07:49,680 --> 00:08:10,830

that's all i'm doing but i just had my

168
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840

 

169
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:24,830

face

170
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840

 

171
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:35,589

one

172
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599

 

173
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,469

okay so i get the residuals

174
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
okay so i get the residuals
 

175
00:08:40,479 --> 00:09:06,829
okay so i get the residuals
it's kind of like poke hole isn't it

176
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839

 

177
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:23,269

hey

178
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279

 

179
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,360

you
