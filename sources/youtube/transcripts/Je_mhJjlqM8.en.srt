1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,030

so and

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,040
so and
 

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:14,070
so and
then on the other side CH he go

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080

 

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:42,650

[Music]

6
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:42,660

 

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:53,950

[Music]

8
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:53,960

 

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,510

so in this technique you're going to

10
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:56,520
so in this technique you're going to
 

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,110
so in this technique you're going to
tilt see he's tilting I'm going to keep

12
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
tilt see he's tilting I'm going to keep
 

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,709
tilt see he's tilting I'm going to keep
this tilt going going keep this tilt

14
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:01,719
this tilt going going keep this tilt
 

15
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:04,670
this tilt going going keep this tilt
going

16
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:04,680
going
 

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,109
going
this so his head is uh going to go on

18
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
this so his head is uh going to go on
 

19
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,510
this so his head is uh going to go on
the tilt on the Tilt and on the

20
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:14,520

 

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,109

Tilt

22
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:16,119
Tilt
 

23
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:23,310
Tilt
boom this way boom

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:23,320

 

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,109

H you're not going here it goes like

26
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:26,119
H you're not going here it goes like
 

27
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,670
H you're not going here it goes like
this I have a collapse here and then my

28
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:28,680
this I have a collapse here and then my
 

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,149
this I have a collapse here and then my
nice choreograph bends over for I don't

30
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
nice choreograph bends over for I don't
 

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:41,789
nice choreograph bends over for I don't
bend over the I tilt the boom tilt tilt

32
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:41,799

 

33
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,429

tilt tilt

34
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:44,439
tilt tilt
 

35
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,109
tilt tilt
tilt on the last tilt I step into the in

36
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:48,119
tilt on the last tilt I step into the in
 

37
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,990
tilt on the last tilt I step into the in
space boom right in

38
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,000
space boom right in
 

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:08,910
space boom right in
here so I don't feel his weight

40
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:08,920

 

41
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,520

hey
