00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:35,879
the 45 turn it to the
 

253
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,510

line he keeps the hip distance for his
 

261
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,749
line he keeps the hip distance for his
body because that keeps him neutral in

262
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:52,759
body because that keeps him neutral in
 

263
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,790
body because that keeps him neutral in
terms of which directions he can go

264
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:55,800
terms of which directions he can go
 

265
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,270
terms of which directions he can go
which of the eight eight here in air

266
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:58,280
which of the eight eight here in air
 

267
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,270
which of the eight eight here in air
quot because eight repr represents all

268
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,280
quot because eight repr represents all
 

269
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,990
quot because eight repr represents all
directions okay he's more neutral he can

270
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,000
directions okay he's more neutral he can
 

271
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,790
directions okay he's more neutral he can
go in more many more directions than if

272
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:05,800
go in more many more directions than if
 

273
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,350
go in more many more directions than if
you start sticking him on a tight rope

274
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:08,360
you start sticking him on a tight rope
 

275
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,909
you start sticking him on a tight rope
certain directions become a little more

276
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:10,919
certain directions become a little more
 

277
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,670
certain directions become a little more
difficult so if I'm on that tight rope

278
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
difficult so if I'm on that tight rope
 

279
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,110
difficult so if I'm on that tight rope
the 4:00 angle becomes much harder for

280
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,120
the 4:00 angle becomes much harder for
 

281
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,230
the 4:00 angle becomes much harder for
me to fall onto okay or to move onto so

282
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
me to fall onto okay or to move onto so
 

283
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:37,630
me to fall onto okay or to move onto so
we don't get on that tight rope okay

284
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:37,640

 

285
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,990

so this this foot takes that 45 this one

286
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:41,000
so this this foot takes that 45 this one
 

287
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,269
so this this foot takes that 45 this one
takes the 90 so it's pointed at the

288
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
takes the 90 so it's pointed at the
 

289
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,070
takes the 90 so it's pointed at the
person all right and because he has the

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
person all right and because he has the
 

291
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,710
person all right and because he has the
midfoot vector you're going to see he

292
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
midfoot vector you're going to see he
 

293
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,910
midfoot vector you're going to see he
has to bend his knees he has to bend his

294
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:50,920
has to bend his knees he has to bend his
 

295

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,120
pelvis a little bit and he has to C that
 

297
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,350
pelvis a little bit and he has to C that
torso a little forward a beginner

298
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
torso a little forward a beginner
 

299
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,790
torso a little forward a beginner

rolling it in so the arch is
 

329
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,829
rolling it in so the arch is
caving and that the knife edge here gets

330
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
caving and that the knife edge here gets
 

331
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,310
caving and that the knife edge here gets
light or even comes up but even on some

00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,030
okay so don't do that don't go I can
stay in place more if I bring the hand

506
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
stay in place more if I bring the hand
 

507
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,350
stay in place more if I bring the hand
here and then go no here

508
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,360
here and then go no here
 

509
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,790
here and then go no here
qu here

510
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800

 

511
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,629

qu okay try it go so as I go here which

512
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:41,639
qu okay try it go so as I go here which
 

513
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,710
qu okay try it go so as I go here which
foot is

514
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
foot is
 

515
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,949
foot is
grounding so there's nothing on this

516
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:45,959
grounding so there's nothing on this
 

517
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,509
grounding so there's nothing on this
foot okay so I don't want to turn and

518
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
foot okay so I don't want to turn and
 

519
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,710
foot okay so I don't want to turn and
shift my weight onto

520
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:52,720

 

521
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,910

it I'm on the back foot there's nothing

522
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
it I'm on the back foot there's nothing
 

523
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,309
it I'm on the back foot there's nothing
on the on the front foot he's pushing as

524
00:15:58,309 --> 00:15:58,319
on the on the front foot he's pushing as
 

525
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:59,550
on the on the front foot he's pushing as
hard as he can

526
00:15:59,550 --> 00:15:59,560
hard as he can
 

527
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,870
hard as he can
nothing's on the front foot and so

528
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:01,880
nothing's on the front foot and so
 

529
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,350
nothing's on the front foot and so
that's why the front CL can

530
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360

 

531
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,670

turn they ground on the back foot stay

532
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:10,680
turn they ground on the back foot stay
 

533
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,230
turn they ground on the back foot stay
grounded qu

534
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:13,240

turns don't go here do you see you're

536
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:15,880
turns don't go here do you see you're
 

537
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,350
turns don't go here do you see you're
clashing now as you try to go back

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:18,360
clashing now as you try to go back
 

539
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,309

forward and that foot is being pinned
 

541
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:23,749
forward and that foot is being pinned
because you brought your weight to it

542
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
because you brought your weight to it
 

543
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,710
because you brought your weight to it
and you're trying to turn it and try to

and you're trying to turn it and try to
 

545
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,550
and you're trying to turn it and try to
step on it and then you try to turn it

546
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:29,560
step on it and then you try to turn it
 

547
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,710
step on it and then you try to turn it
the friction on the foot is going to

548
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:31,720
the friction on the foot is going to
 

549
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,790
the friction on the foot is going to
hurt your

here it's the same I'm in that same
 

563
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:02,189
here it's the same I'm in that same
position he's pushing and he's not going

564
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:02,199
position he's pushing and he's not going
 

565
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:11,110
position he's pushing and he's not going
to push me

566
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120

 

567
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,710

over I'm not over here and it gets

00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:13,720
over I'm not over here and it gets
 

569
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,150
over I'm not over here and it gets
pushed and I knock me

570
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
pushed and I knock me
 

571
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,710
pushed and I knock me
over even though the energy is going

572
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:19,720
over even though the energy is going
 

573
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,390
over even though the energy is going
around me the

574
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400
around me the
 

575
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,429
around me the
radius has C he can't he can't come into

576
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:26,439
radius has C he can't he can't come into
 

577
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:29,950
radius has C he can't he can't come into
me yes he's going around me but he can't

578
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:29,960
me yes he's going around me but he can't
 

579
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,070
me yes he's going around me but he can't
come in he's going to feel that base the

580
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,080
come in he's going to feel that base the
 

581
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,350
come in he's going to feel that base the
same

582
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:34,360
same
 

583
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,870
same
grounding so make sure you're not just

584
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
grounding so make sure you're not just
 

585
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,750
grounding so make sure you're not just
here which you will always be off here

586
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
here which you will always be off here
 

587
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,150
here which you will always be off here
when you go like

588
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:41,160
when you go like
 

589
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,430
when you go like
that and he pushes me you're going to

590
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:44,440
that and he pushes me you're going to
 

591
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,630
that and he pushes me you're going to
see he'll push on that weaken double

592
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
see he'll push on that weaken double
 

593
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,470
see he'll push on that weaken double
pivot so

594
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
pivot so
 

595
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,590
pivot so
don't double

596
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:52,600
don't double
 

597
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,870

to the outside back onto the midfoot

602
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520
to the outside back onto the midfoot
 

603
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,270
to the outside back onto the midfoot
okay try it

604
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
okay try it
 

605
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,950
okay try it
again okay so usually why people do this

606
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
again okay so usually why people do this
 

607
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,430
again okay so usually why people do this
stuff or even this stuff is because

608
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:11,440
stuff or even this stuff is because
 

609
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,470
stuff or even this stuff is because
they're using the

610
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:13,480
they're using the
 

611
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,470
they're using the
external and the same thing goes with

612
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
external and the same thing goes with
 

613
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,630
external and the same thing goes with
the reason you're double pivoting on the

614
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:18,640
the reason you're double pivoting on the
 

615
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,549
the reason you're double pivoting on the
two feet like this and this weighted

616
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:21,559
two feet like this and this weighted
 

617
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,750
two feet like this and this weighted
foot is because you can't do it one you

618
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
foot is because you can't do it one you
 

619
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,909
foot is because you can't do it one you
can't do it on one foot cuz you're not

620
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:26,919
can't do it on one foot cuz you're not
 

621
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:29,669
can't do it on one foot cuz you're not
doing the internals okay but in order to

622
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
doing the internals okay but in order to
 

623
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,310
doing the internals okay but in order to
turn you got to let go of one foot you

624
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
turn you got to let go of one foot you
 

625
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,590
turn you got to let go of one foot you
can't double pivot

626
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600
can't double pivot
 

627
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,470
can't double pivot
okay so I I am on that foot and then

628
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,480
okay so I I am on that foot and then
 

629
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,390
okay so I I am on that foot and then
it's easy I just turn

630
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
it's easy I just turn
 

631
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,029
it's easy I just turn
okay so we go on now I'm here okay and

632
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:48,039
okay so we go on now I'm here okay and
 

633
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:52,750
okay so we go on now I'm here okay and
then I enter on the turn so my foot

634
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:52,760
then I enter on the turn so my foot
 

635
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,669
then I enter on the turn so my foot
isn't going to be

636
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679

 

637
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,909

straight my foot's not going to be

638
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:57,919
straight my foot's not going to be
 

639
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,669
straight my foot's not going to be
straight

640
00:18:59,669 --> 00:18:59,679
straight
 

641
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:06,470
straight
the qua keeps turning the qua keeps

642
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:06,480

 

643
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,070

turning on the back foot qua enter on

644
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,080
turning on the back foot qua enter on
 

645
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,830
turning on the back foot qua enter on
the

646
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:12,840
the
 

647
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,350
the
turn cu the qua turns it doesn't go

648
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,360
turn cu the qua turns it doesn't go
 

649
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:25,230
turn cu the qua turns it doesn't go
here the B turns he keeps going around

650
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:25,240

 

651
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:37,630

me one two

652

653
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,029

so just like as I'm here eventually I'm

654
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
so just like as I'm here eventually I'm
 

655

two okay
try three I have

674
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:21,480
try three I have
 

675
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,990
try three I have
one and

676
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,000

 

677
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,310

two how much Circle you do here is how

678
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:31,320
two how much Circle you do here is how
 

679
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,950
two how much Circle you do here is how
much structural Integrity you have to

680
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:33,960
much structural Integrity you have to
 

681
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,350
much structural Integrity you have to
you feel you're going to lose okay so if

682
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:38,360
you feel you're going to lose okay so if
 

683
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,669
you feel you're going to lose okay so if
uh like he he's not going to push me

uh like he he's not going to push me
 

685
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,310
uh like he he's not going to push me
over this arm is not going to be struct

686
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:45,320
over this arm is not going to be struct
 

687
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,350
over this arm is not going to be struct
compromised even though he's pushing

688
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
compromised even though he's pushing
 

689
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,070
compromised even though he's pushing
there it's not he's not going to do it

690
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,080
there it's not he's not going to do it
 

691
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,950
there it's not he's not going to do it
do you get it but let's say if I did it

692
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
do you get it but let's say if I did it
 

693
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,710
do you get it but let's say if I did it
would start to look like that you

694
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:53,720
would start to look like that you
 

695
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,190
would start to look like that you
see so before it goes here before I lose

696
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:58,200
see so before it goes here before I lose
 

697
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,350
see so before it goes here before I lose
the qua elbow line that's where I would

698
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360
the qua elbow line that's where I would
 

699
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,270
the qua elbow line that's where I would
enter and I would enter so that I could

700
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,280
enter and I would enter so that I could
 

701
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:10,630
enter and I would enter so that I could
keep it

702
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640

 

703
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,950

okay so in other words like I don't need

anything here right I don't really have
 

707
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,710
anything here right I don't really have
to turn I don't have to turn I'm right

708
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
to turn I don't have to turn I'm right
 

709
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,990
to turn I don't have to turn I'm right
there inside

710
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
there inside
 

711
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,630
there inside
hand I felt like I was going to lose

712
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
hand I felt like I was going to lose
 

713
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,669
hand I felt like I was going to lose
that a lot I'd add more external I'm

714
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:26,679
that a lot I'd add more external I'm
 

715
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:29,029
that a lot I'd add more external I'm
going to lose it a lot I have to go way

716
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
going to lose it a lot I have to go way
 

717
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,710
going to lose it a lot I have to go way
over here got

718
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,720

 

719
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,710

okay if you do you have to

720
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:38,720
okay if you do you have to
 

721
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,510
okay if you do you have to
obey the single point pivot Rule and the

722
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:42,520
obey the single point pivot Rule and the
 

723
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,070
obey the single point pivot Rule and the
foot knee hip rule on this line so we'll

724
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,080
foot knee hip rule on this line so we'll
 

725
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,870
foot knee hip rule on this line so we'll
go a little slower light and the load

726
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:47,880
go a little slower light and the load
 

727
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,549
go a little slower light and the load
okay so as I feel like this is going to

728
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:50,559
okay so as I feel like this is going to
 

729
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,149
okay so as I feel like this is going to
get compromised this is going to get

730
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:53,159
get compromised this is going to get
 

731
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,549
get compromised this is going to get
compromised here this foot is going to

732
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:57,559
compromised here this foot is going to
 

733
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,029
compromised here this foot is going to
turn

734
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
turn
 

735
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,310
turn
and then I can step back

736
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,320

 

737
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,909

straight

738
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:08,919

 

739
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:13,029

okay don't go like

740
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
okay don't go like
 

741
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,470
okay don't go like
this don't go like

742
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480

 

743
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,430

this this foot turns so that means

744
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
this this foot turns so that means
 

745
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,110
this this foot turns so that means
weight's going to go onto the right foot

746
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,120
weight's going to go onto the right foot
 

747
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,310
weight's going to go onto the right foot
that foot will turn and then I can go

748
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,320
that foot will turn and then I can go
 

749
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,190
that foot will turn and then I can go
back over

750
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,200

 

751
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,350

on the left foot and the right foot can

752
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,360
on the left foot and the right foot can
 

753
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,190
on the left foot and the right foot can
turn I need to turn the right foot more

754
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:38,200
turn I need to turn the right foot more
 

755
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,750
turn I need to turn the right foot more
so my weight goes to the left foot turns

756
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:41,760
so my weight goes to the left foot turns
 

757
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,230
so my weight goes to the left foot turns
and then I can step in okay let's try

758
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,240
and then I can step in okay let's try
 

759
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,110
and then I can step in okay let's try
that so as we

760
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,120
that so as we
 

761
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,750
that so as we
go if you pay

762
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:50,760
go if you pay
 

763
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,149
go if you pay
attention if I need a great rotation

764
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:54,159
attention if I need a great rotation
 

765
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,990
attention if I need a great rotation
here I had to shift my weight onto the

766
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,000
here I had to shift my weight onto the
 

767
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,909
here I had to shift my weight onto the
right foot so that the left foot would

768
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:00,919
right foot so that the left foot would
 

769
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:02,230
right foot so that the left foot would
be free to

770
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
be free to
 

771
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,190
be free to
rotate only then can I enter and Obey

772
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:06,200
rotate only then can I enter and Obey
 

773
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,830
rotate only then can I enter and Obey
all the rules of the foot knee F

774
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:10,840
all the rules of the foot knee F
 

775
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,470
all the rules of the foot knee F
line and if you pay

776

line and if you pay
 

777
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,149
line and if you pay
attention when I shift my weight to the

778
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159
attention when I shift my weight to the
 

779
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,310
attention when I shift my weight to the
front foot the right foot I am going

780
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:19,320
front foot the right foot I am going
 

781
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,510
front foot the right foot I am going
behind him

782
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:24,520

 

783
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,830

okay when I'm here like this and I

784
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
okay when I'm here like this and I
 

785
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,350
okay when I'm here like this and I
double pck it I'm not yet behind him if

786
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:32,360
double pck it I'm not yet behind him if
 

787
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,029
double pck it I'm not yet behind him if
this even worked and it

788
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:36,039

 

789
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,470

doesn't so you're actually going to do

790
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:39,480
doesn't so you're actually going to do
 

791
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,870
doesn't so you're actually going to do
that one more

792
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:41,880
that one more
 

793
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,750
that one more
time here you're going to shift your

794
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:46,760
time here you're going to shift your
 

795
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,590
time here you're going to shift your
weight onto this foot and

796
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:50,600
weight onto this foot and
 

797
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,830
weight onto this foot and
rotate this

798
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:52,840
rotate this
 

799
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,070
rotate this
foot is ready is weighted and so this

800
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,080
foot is ready is weighted and so this
 

801
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,070
foot is ready is weighted and so this
foot can now move

802
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,080
foot can now move
 

803
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,669
foot can now move
and you're in no

804
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:00,679
and you're in no
 

805
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:04,630
and you're in no
h do it

806
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640

hand
here we're going to do it slow like this

824
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:17,799

 

825
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,029

okay let's

826
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:19,039
okay let's
 

827
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:25,549
okay let's
try

828
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:25,559

 

829
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,870

one and you're going to shift your

830
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
one and you're going to shift your
 

831
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,789
one and you're going to shift your
weight onto this

832
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
weight onto this
 

833
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,470
weight onto this
foot okay and the hip is going to turn

834
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
foot okay and the hip is going to turn
 

835
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,510
foot okay and the hip is going to turn
that

836
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:36,520
that
 

837
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:45,269
that
foot then this leg just comes straight

838
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:45,279

 

839
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,310

back turns

840
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,320
back turns
 

841
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,230
back turns
turns this s irrelevant now

842
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,240
turns this s irrelevant now
 

843
