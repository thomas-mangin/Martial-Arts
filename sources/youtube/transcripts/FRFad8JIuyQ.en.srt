that and I gave some possible causes for
 

85
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,030
that and I gave some possible causes for
that to most likely Virginia what's one

Joe yeah so if you if you hit the hands

168
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
Joe yeah so if you if you hit the hands
 

169
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,990
Joe yeah so if you if you hit the hands
and you bring the hands into the center

170
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
and you bring the hands into the center
 

171
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,550
and you bring the hands into the center
the the ve Vector that Oshi on the hands

172
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:55,560
the the ve Vector that Oshi on the hands
 

173
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,909
the the ve Vector that Oshi on the hands
so that it vectors through the center

174
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
so that it vectors through the center
 

175
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,710
so that it vectors through the center
and not just straight down on the hand

176
00:05:59,710 --> 00:05:59,720
and not just straight down on the hand
 

177
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,510
and not just straight down on the hand
hands you're going to be close enough

178
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,520
hands you're going to be close enough
 

179
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,950
hands you're going to be close enough
it's going to be the same distance and

180
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
it's going to be the same distance and
 

181
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,870
it's going to be the same distance and
then the atoshi Zuki Works do you get

182
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:07,880
then the atoshi Zuki Works do you get
 

183
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,870
then the atoshi Zuki Works do you get
that so they messed up they changed your

184
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
that so they messed up they changed your
 

185
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,550
that so they messed up they changed your
mind you should adapt to their

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:13,560
mind you should adapt to their
 

187
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,710
mind you should adapt to their
mind okay you don't take the E don't

188
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
mind okay you don't take the E don't
 

189
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,309

just do the form here in air quotes and

190
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:19,319
just do the form here in air quotes and
 

191
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,990
just do the form here in air quotes and
that's prioritized over what's the

192
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
that's prioritized over what's the
 

193
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,670
that's prioritized over what's the
relationship they change the form you

194
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:24,680
relationship they change the form you
 

195
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,909
relationship they change the form you
change the form okay so you still have

196
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
change the form okay so you still have
 

197
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,830
change the form okay so you still have
to meet the requirements of the form the

198
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:30,840
to meet the requirements of the form the
 

199
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,589
to meet the requirements of the form the
concept so when I hit the hands I have

200
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:33,599
concept so when I hit the hands I have
 

201
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:34,629
concept so when I hit the hands I have
to hit the

202
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
to hit the
 

203
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,950
to hit the
center I can't be so far away

204
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
center I can't be so far away
 

205
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,749
center I can't be so far away
from how I hit their hands that the

206
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
from how I hit their hands that the
 

207
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,510
from how I hit their hands that the
vector I have is nowhere near their

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,070
obvious reason why someone's Kessa might
be out of range it's so don't over

226
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,080
be out of range it's so don't over
 

227
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,309
be out of range it's so don't over
complicate

here this is not the intro day yesterday
was intro day let's [\h__\h] train

268
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:30,680

 

269
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,469

you got to pin that Center he you

270
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:37,479

 

271
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,110

Virginia you're hooking

272
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,120
Virginia you're hooking
 

273
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,509
Virginia you're hooking
it so the more if you go if you over

274
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
it so the more if you go if you over
 

275
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,750
it so the more if you go if you over
rotate the cross there's less vertical

276
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:46,760
rotate the cross there's less vertical
 

277
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,509
rotate the cross there's less vertical
pressure do you see um and so now the

278
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:50,519
pressure do you see um and so now the
 

279
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,910
pressure do you see um and so now the
center is not down now they don't remain

280
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:52,920
center is not down now they don't remain
 

281
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,829
center is not down now they don't remain
as close now they're able to move okay

282
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
as close now they're able to move okay
 

283
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,069
as close now they're able to move okay
so careful that you're not hooking that

284
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:58,079
so careful that you're not hooking that
 

285
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,870
so careful that you're not hooking that
thing go

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,120
tension in your lower leg so it didn't
 

295
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:30,230

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:46,870
your knee more by walking bent backwards
just walk

332
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880

 

333
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,550

out don't be there waiting for the Joe

334
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:49,560
out don't be there waiting for the Joe
 

335
00:10:49,560 --> 00:11:00,230
out don't be there waiting for the Joe
fill the face with the Joe end

336
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240

 

337
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:48,470

same thing

338
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480

 

339
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,030

um continuous motion the symbol for

340
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,040
um continuous motion the symbol for
 

341
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,790
um continuous motion the symbol for
continuous motion is is figure

342
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:55,800
continuous motion is is figure
 

343
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,350
continuous motion is is figure
okay uh it's also your Al and your immer

344
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:00,360
okay uh it's also your Al and your immer
 

345
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,949
okay uh it's also your Al and your immer
spirals put you put them together and

346
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
spirals put you put them together and
 

347
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,750
spirals put you put them together and
it's that movement that we always do in

348
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:04,760
it's that movement that we always do in
 

349
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,470
it's that movement that we always do in
ik you see it all the time and it is in

350
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:07,480
ik you see it all the time and it is in
 

351
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,030
ik you see it all the time and it is in
the middle of your dojo Crest you have

352
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,040
the middle of your dojo Crest you have
 

353
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,350
the middle of your dojo Crest you have
the heart this way but this way you have

354
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,360
the heart this way but this way you have
 

355
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,629
the heart this way but this way you have
the figure

356
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:13,639
the figure
 

357
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,230
the figure
a I'm trying to tell you it's

358
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240

 

359
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,470

Central um the say is where linear end

360
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,480
Central um the say is where linear end
 

361
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,590
Central um the say is where linear end
circular BS and where circular ends

362
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:24,600
circular BS and where circular ends
 

363
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,790
circular BS and where circular ends
linear begins so linear and circular

364
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
linear begins so linear and circular
 

365
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,230
linear begins so linear and circular
begin

366
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
begin
 

367
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,629
begin
circular ends linear begins do you see

368
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
circular ends linear begins do you see
 

369
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,790
circular ends linear begins do you see
that okay what it is is it's not reverse

370
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:35,800
that okay what it is is it's not reverse
 

371
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,389
that okay what it is is it's not reverse
motion it's not right angle

372
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
motion it's not right angle
 

373
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,269
motion it's not right angle
motion

374
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:40,279
motion
 

375
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,030
motion
okay um it allows you to get a lot of

376
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,040
okay um it allows you to get a lot of
 

377
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,829
okay um it allows you to get a lot of
power because you're transferring

378
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:46,839
power because you're transferring
 

379
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:49,870
power because you're transferring
momentum from one angle into the other

380
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:49,880
momentum from one angle into the other
 

381
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,990
momentum from one angle into the other
angle okay so for example the guys

382
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,000
angle okay so for example the guys
 

383
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,389
angle okay so for example the guys
up and hold the sword in the other hand

384
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
up and hold the sword in the other hand
 

385
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,750
up and hold the sword in the other hand
and say he has a a punch okay and I want

386
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:02,760
and say he has a a punch okay and I want
 

387
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,629
and say he has a a punch okay and I want
to hit this back knuckle well that's

388
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:05,639
to hit this back knuckle well that's
 

389
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,550
to hit this back knuckle well that's
really short it's really short but if I

390
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:09,560
really short it's really short but if I
 

391
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,230
really short it's really short but if I
start from the Parry it's one big wind

392
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
start from the Parry it's one big wind
 

393
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,670
start from the Parry it's one big wind
up this way it's it would be like I do

394
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:16,680
up this way it's it would be like I do
 

395
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,310
up this way it's it would be like I do
this you see so and I come in this way

396
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
this you see so and I come in this way
 

397
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,949
this you see so and I come in this way
and I start lengthening the path of

398
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
and I start lengthening the path of
 

399
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,389
and I start lengthening the path of
action you see and I can build up more

400
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:25,399
action you see and I can build up more
 

401
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,189
action you see and I can build up more
speed transfer momentum Etc if you your

402
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:30,199
speed transfer momentum Etc if you your
 

403
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:33,310
speed transfer momentum Etc if you your
sort out it would be the same thing if

404
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:33,320
sort out it would be the same thing if
 

405
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,590
sort out it would be the same thing if
I'm here like

406
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:36,600

 

407
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,750

this I've lengthened the path of action

408
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
this I've lengthened the path of action
 

409
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,269
this I've lengthened the path of action
and I can start building up more

410
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:42,279
and I can start building up more
 

411
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,030
and I can start building up more
energy so on this

412
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,040
energy so on this
 

413
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,829
energy so on this
technique when he goes around and that's

414
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
technique when he goes around and that's
 

415
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,069
technique when he goes around and that's
reverse motion you see and now there's

416
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:53,079
reverse motion you see and now there's
 

417
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,310
reverse motion you see and now there's
only so much I get there okay there only

418
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
only so much I get there okay there only
 

419
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,470
only so much I get there okay there only
so much because it's a very short path

420
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
so much because it's a very short path
 

421
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,829
so much because it's a very short path
of action it's very powerful because of

422
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839
of action it's very powerful because of
 

423
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,710
of action it's very powerful because of
how much mass is in there right but it

424
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:03,720
how much mass is in there right but it
 

425
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,030
how much mass is in there right but it
doesn't have that lengthen passive

426
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
doesn't have that lengthen passive
 

427
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,550
doesn't have that lengthen passive
action so uh you're just going to be a a

428
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:11,560
action so uh you're just going to be a a
 

429
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,710
action so uh you're just going to be a a
Target okay instead of uh going like

430
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:17,720
Target okay instead of uh going like
 

431
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,910
Target okay instead of uh going like
this you're winding up you see

432
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:24,920

 

433
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,949

that coming in okay not here like that

434
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:29,959
that coming in okay not here like that
 

435
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:34,269
that coming in okay not here like that
you see that difference okay so that's

436
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:34,279
you see that difference okay so that's
 

437
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,590
you see that difference okay so that's
what's in

438
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:36,600
what's in
 

439
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,430
what's in
here it's one big wind up

440
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:40,440
here it's one big wind up
 

441
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,430
here it's one big wind up
so when you come here that's a zigzag

442
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:44,440
so when you come here that's a zigzag
 

443
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,350
so when you come here that's a zigzag
that's one short wind

444
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:48,360

 

445
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,069

up is where that comes you guys see that

446
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
up is where that comes you guys see that
 

447
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,590
up is where that comes you guys see that
okay so I if I trace the parts that's

448
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:56,600
okay so I if I trace the parts that's
 

449
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,230
okay so I if I trace the parts that's
where that is going to be which gives me

450
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,240
where that is going to be which gives me
 

451
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,710
where that is going to be which gives me
other tactical priorities being met and

452
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
other tactical priorities being met and
 

453
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,990
other tactical priorities being met and
I come

454
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,000
I come
 

455
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,829
I come
around is my wind up you see that so we

456
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:08,839
around is my wind up you see that so we
 

457
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,790
around is my wind up you see that so we
should see

458
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:12,800

 

459
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,069

that that Joe in his face on the center

460
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
that that Joe in his face on the center
 

461
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,590
that that Joe in his face on the center
line occupying it we should not see here

462
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:20,600
line occupying it we should not see here
 

463
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,790
line occupying it we should not see here
you see that that's going be very weak I

464
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:22,800
you see that that's going be very weak I
 

465
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,430
you see that that's going be very weak I
know it feels strong but it's nowhere

466
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:24,440
know it feels strong but it's nowhere
 

467
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,829
know it feels strong but it's nowhere
near somebody who wound up and did the

468
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
near somebody who wound up and did the
 

469
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,990
near somebody who wound up and did the
same uh Mass equation or mass value in

470
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
same uh Mass equation or mass value in
 

471
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,030
same uh Mass equation or mass value in
that they're they're adding way more

472
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,040
that they're they're adding way more
 

473
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,189
that they're they're adding way more
speed into that uh Force equation okay

474
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:38,199
speed into that uh Force equation okay
 

475
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:52,790
speed into that uh Force equation okay
so let's try

476
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800

 

477
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,710

different there's no my turn your

478
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:55,720
different there's no my turn your
 

479
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:06,590
different there's no my turn your
turn you're on the whole time

480
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:06,600

 

481
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,030

[Applause]

482
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,040
[Applause]
 

483
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,670
[Applause]
yes and now you still do Theos you

484
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:10,680
yes and now you still do Theos you
 

485
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:22,590
yes and now you still do Theos you
didn't pin

486
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:22,600

 

487
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,710

him again at a certain point we you just

488
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:25,720
him again at a certain point we you just
 

489
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,069
him again at a certain point we you just
got to have you just thrust on him okay

490
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
got to have you just thrust on him okay
 

491
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,389
got to have you just thrust on him okay
he'll learn he knows how to [\h__\h] fall

492
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
he'll learn he knows how to [\h__\h] fall
 

493
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,350
he'll learn he knows how to [\h__\h] fall
are you are do you have red tape on your

494
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:34,360

508
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:35,799
SK you you have to hit the linear
 

509
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:43,010
SK you you have to hit the linear
line well before you make

519
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:15,990

same thing you're turning it in

520
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000

 

521
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,870

range you did the push okay and then

522
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
range you did the push okay and then
 

523
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,029
range you did the push okay and then
you're going to hit the target right and

524
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
you're going to hit the target right and
 

525
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,190
you're going to hit the target right and
the target's going to offer some

526
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
the target's going to offer some
 

527
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,789
the target's going to offer some
resistance okay got it so as you're

528
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
resistance okay got it so as you're
 

529
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,430
resistance okay got it so as you're
you're trying to bring it up to your

530
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
you're trying to bring it up to your
 

531
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,390
you're trying to bring it up to your
head and you're going to have that curve

532
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:33,400
head and you're going to have that curve
 

533
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,110
head and you're going to have that curve
there you see that and you hit that

534
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,120
there you see that and you hit that
 

535
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,350
there you see that and you hit that
Target on the curve part it's going to

536
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:40,360
Target on the curve part it's going to
 

537
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,310
Target on the curve part it's going to
have leverage over you so as you is

538
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
have leverage over you so as you is
 

539
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,230
have leverage over you so as you is
pressing and as you keep going it's

pressing and as you keep going it's
 

541
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,669
pressing and as you keep going it's
taking your tip offline you see that so

542
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:50,679
taking your tip offline you see that so
 

543
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,470
taking your tip offline you see that so
you will go all the way up

544
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
you will go all the way up
 

545
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,270
you will go all the way up

okay so you can't you can't go here and
 

559
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,830
okay so you can't you can't go here and
be turning it on them you see it kept it

560
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
be turning it on them you see it kept it
 

561
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,630
be turning it on them you see it kept it
out I have to be get

562
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:25,640
out I have to be get
 

563
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,029
out I have to be get
position and then Jou boom there's no

564
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:30,039
position and then Jou boom there's no
 

565
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,510
position and then Jou boom there's no
rotational

566
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:31,520
rotational
 

567
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,230
rotational
torque after I touch their person that

568
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,240
torque after I touch their person that
 

569
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,230
torque after I touch their person that
means all rotational torque has to end

570
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:37,240
means all rotational torque has to end
 

571
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,669
means all rotational torque has to end
before I start to in okay don't get lazy

572
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:40,679
before I start to in okay don't get lazy
 

573
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,669
before I start to in okay don't get lazy
try it

574
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
try it
 

575
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,430
try it
again if you Spar them like I'm asking

576
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
again if you Spar them like I'm asking
 

577
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,669
again if you Spar them like I'm asking
you you would learn these

578
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
you you would learn these
 

579
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:55,950
you you would learn these
things

above because your knee is not going to

594
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:21,320
above because your knee is not going to
 

595
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,110
above because your knee is not going to
take it you get it I probably work your

00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,950

you got to get that

600
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:41,960
you got to get that
 

601
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:53,149
you got to get that
dropped it's barely any

602
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:53,159

 

603
00:20:53,159 --> 00:21:02,990

pen don't bring the hand up

604
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:03,000

 

605
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,710

the hand up that's why the tips is

606
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
the hand up that's why the tips is
 

607
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,149
the hand up that's why the tips is
dropping that's why it's actually

608
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:07,159
dropping that's why it's actually
 

609
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:14,909
dropping that's why it's actually
lighter finish the

610
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:14,919

 

611
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:17,190

push your tips

612
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
push your tips
 

613
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,110
push your tips
down the only way the tip is down is if

614
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,120
down the only way the tip is down is if
 

615
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,029
down the only way the tip is down is if
your hand is up do you understand that

616
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,039
your hand is up do you understand that
 

617
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,269
your hand is up do you understand that
and if my right hand is up the Joe's not

618
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:26,279
and if my right hand is up the Joe's not
 

619
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,230
and if my right hand is up the Joe's not
heavy yes and I'm over rotate the cross

620
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,240
heavy yes and I'm over rotate the cross
 

621
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:48,350
heavy yes and I'm over rotate the cross
which we already noted

622
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:48,360

 

623
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,110

before okay so there's there's mechanics

624
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,120
before okay so there's there's mechanics
 

625
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,750
before okay so there's there's mechanics
here that you have to follow okay so you

626
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760
here that you have to follow okay so you
 

627
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,310
here that you have to follow okay so you
can't go like that all right do you see

628
00:21:59,310 --> 00:21:59,320
can't go like that all right do you see
 

629
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,510
can't go like that all right do you see
that so I dropped a tip when my hand is

630
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
that so I dropped a tip when my hand is
 

631
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,390
that so I dropped a tip when my hand is
higher you see so that was supposed to

632
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:07,400
higher you see so that was supposed to
 

633
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,909
higher you see so that was supposed to
go here okay so here I am like that and

634
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:11,919
go here okay so here I am like that and
 

635
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:18,149
go here okay so here I am like that and
I want to go like this

636
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159

 

637
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,070

okay I'm also not going to do something

638
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,080
okay I'm also not going to do something
 

639
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,070
okay I'm also not going to do something
weird the the energy drops with the

640
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080
weird the the energy drops with the
 

641
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,990
weird the the energy drops with the
intern internal dropping so I can't have

642
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,000
intern internal dropping so I can't have
 

643
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,029
intern internal dropping so I can't have
tension in my body I can't be parallel

644
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,039
tension in my body I can't be parallel
 

645
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,590
tension in my body I can't be parallel
that the energy

646
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:36,600
that the energy
 

647
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,669
that the energy
drops okay and you can see and you can

648
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:40,679
drops okay and you can see and you can
 

649
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,350
drops okay and you can see and you can
feel how his feet got [\h__\h] up okay got

650
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:44,360
feel how his feet got [\h__\h] up okay got
 

651
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,750
feel how his feet got [\h__\h] up okay got
it and that's not with

652
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
it and that's not with
 

653
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,230
it and that's not with
the extended path of action okay so it's

654
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
the extended path of action okay so it's
 

655
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,549
the extended path of action okay so it's
no different than we're we're here right

656
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:55,559
no different than we're we're here right
 

657
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,789
no different than we're we're here right

and I'm
 

659
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,549
and I'm
like I'm just doing that same thing

660
00:22:59,549 --> 00:22:59,559
like I'm just doing that same thing
 

661
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:02,390
like I'm just doing that same thing
whatever that is

662
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:02,400
whatever that is
 

663
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,390
whatever that is
or this

664
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:05,400
or this
 

665
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,390
or this
here that power do you see is in this

666
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
here that power do you see is in this
 

667
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,029
here that power do you see is in this
same

668
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:12,039
same
 

669
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:14,310
same
thing what you're doing is you're going

670
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
thing what you're doing is you're going
 

671
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,750
thing what you're doing is you're going
to your external power sources is that's

672
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:16,760
to your external power sources is that's
 

673
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,909
to your external power sources is that's
not as powerful

674
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:18,919
not as powerful
 

675
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:23,110
not as powerful
okay again back to my other comment Bo

how I
 

687
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,230
how I
said once I feel your pressure on your

688
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,240
said once I feel your pressure on your
 

689
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,669
said once I feel your pressure on your
hand and I feel the RoR to my foot the

690
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:01,679
hand and I feel the RoR to my foot the
 

691
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,630
hand and I feel the RoR to my foot the
drill is done for me same thing here

692
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640
drill is done for me same thing here
 

693
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,070
drill is done for me same thing here
once I feel your feet I push through put

694
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:09,080
once I feel your feet I push through put
 

695
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,390
once I feel your feet I push through put
the weight on there I don't have

696
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
the weight on there I don't have
 

697
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,390
the weight on there I don't have
to totally do it you see that's that's

698
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
to totally do it you see that's that's
 

699
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,789
to totally do it you see that's that's
the difference I

700
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:18,799
the difference I
 

701
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,990
the difference I
think um I'm working at the energetic

702
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
think um I'm working at the energetic
 

703
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,029
think um I'm working at the energetic

okay so don't confuse what I'm saying

710
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
okay so don't confuse what I'm saying

with going crazy now you're doing weird

712
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,320

some of you won't get your being into it
 

717
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,590
some of you won't get your being into it
unless you're going full speed but now

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:44,600
unless you're going full speed but now
 

719
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,669
unless you're going full speed but now
we have the other problem it's the wrong

720
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
we have the other problem it's the wrong
 

721
00:24:47,679 --> 00:25:01,630
we have the other problem it's the wrong
okay right switchs

722
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:01,640

 

723
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:26,510

you to feel his feet

724
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:26,520

 

725
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,230

sh you feel your your young aspect on

726
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
sh you feel your your young aspect on
 

727
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:44,310
sh you feel your your young aspect on
your

728
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320

 

729
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,149

midfoot if you feel her feet you

730
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:47,159
midfoot if you feel her feet you
 

731
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,230
midfoot if you feel her feet you
wouldn't Point your tip down you're

732
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:49,240
wouldn't Point your tip down you're
 

733
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,310
wouldn't Point your tip down you're
going too early into the the aosi Zuki

734
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:53,320
going too early into the the aosi Zuki
 

735
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,350
going too early into the the aosi Zuki
so you're lifting the back hand way too

736
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:56,360
so you're lifting the back hand way too
 

737
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,990
so you're lifting the back hand way too
early you want to feel her feet you want

738
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,000
early you want to feel her feet you want
 

739
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:20,860
early you want to feel her feet you want
to push her feet

740
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:20,870

 

741
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,430

down so the say is where linear and

744
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,080
down so the say is where linear and
 

745
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,830
down so the say is where linear and
circular begins I got that

746
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:28,840
circular begins I got that
 

747
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,870
circular begins I got that
okay so in that in that pattern you're

748
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:31,880
okay so in that in that pattern you're
 

749
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,789
okay so in that in that pattern you're
going to see straight lines that's a

750
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:33,799
going to see straight lines that's a
 

751
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,870
going to see straight lines that's a
straight line you see that and then you

752
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:36,880
straight line you see that and then you
 

753
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,549
straight line you see that and then you
come around that's a curve there's

754
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
come around that's a curve there's
 

755
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,430
come around that's a curve there's
nothing straight about it and then

756
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:40,440
nothing straight about it and then
 

757
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,990
nothing straight about it and then
that's a straight line there's nothing

758
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,000
that's a straight line there's nothing
 

759
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,830
that's a straight line there's nothing
curved about it okay so when when you

760
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
curved about it okay so when when you
 

761
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,470
curved about it okay so when when you
when you make like two circles do you

762
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:49,480
when you make like two circles do you
 

763
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,389
when you make like two circles do you
see that that's not it okay so here I

764
00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:55,399
see that that's not it okay so here I
 

765
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:58,510
see that that's not it okay so here I
have curves

766
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:58,520
have curves
 

767
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,110
have curves
then it

768
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,120
then it
 

769
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,990
then it
ends straight down there's nothing

770
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,000
ends straight down there's nothing
 

771
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,510
ends straight down there's nothing
curved about it

772
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:05,520
curved about it
 

773
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,470
curved about it
don't curve it it's not a curve okay so

774
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
don't curve it it's not a curve okay so
 

775
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,750
don't curve it it's not a curve okay so
you have to

776
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:11,760
you have to
 

777
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,950
you have to
complete the

778
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:13,960
complete the
 

779
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,669
complete the
linearity boom and then it's a new move

780
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
linearity boom and then it's a new move
 

781
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,830
linearity boom and then it's a new move
here it's not this move coming like that

782
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:21,840
here it's not this move coming like that
 

783
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,909
here it's not this move coming like that
do you guys get that um Mr Pig you say

784
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
do you guys get that um Mr Pig you say
 

785
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,830
do you guys get that um Mr Pig you say
you have to complete the cycle of action

786
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:28,840
you have to complete the cycle of action
 

787
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,190
you have to complete the cycle of action
it was a pistol reference you [\h__\h] up

788
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:31,200
it was a pistol reference you [\h__\h] up
 

789
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,110
it was a pistol reference you [\h__\h] up
the cycle of action the Gun starts to

790
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,120
the cycle of action the Gun starts to
 

791
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,750
the cycle of action the Gun starts to
malfunction so something similar to this

792
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:36,760
malfunction so something similar to this
 

793
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,510
malfunction so something similar to this
is like you have to wait for the click

794
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:39,520
is like you have to wait for the click
 

795
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,110
is like you have to wait for the click
if I'm loading the magazine I got to go

796
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,120
if I'm loading the magazine I got to go
 

797
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,990
if I'm loading the magazine I got to go
click right I don't and then start

798
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,000
click right I don't and then start
 

799
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,950
click right I don't and then start
getting my grip the magazine falls out

800
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:47,960
getting my grip the magazine falls out
 

801
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,070
getting my grip the magazine falls out
or didn't see properly so it has to go

802
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,080
or didn't see properly so it has to go
 

803
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,230
or didn't see properly so it has to go
linear to the clip then you can start

804
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,240
linear to the clip then you can start
 

805
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,990
linear to the clip then you can start
getting your grip you see so same thing

806
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,000
getting your grip you see so same thing
 

807
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,789
getting your grip you see so same thing
it has to go linear

808
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
it has to go linear
 

809
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,470
it has to go linear
till the feet they're there boom there's

810
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:01,480
till the feet they're there boom there's
 

811
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,630
till the feet they're there boom there's
the pin then it comes up it doesn't go

812
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:05,640
the pin then it comes up it doesn't go
 

813
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:40,389
the pin then it comes up it doesn't go
into this move okay try again
