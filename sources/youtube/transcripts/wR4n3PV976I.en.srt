00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,670
patch and as you know is the receiver
you're the receiver so swap over in this

10
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:15,680
you're the receiver so swap over in this
 

11
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,189
you're the receiver so swap over in this
case but but if you're the

12
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
case but but if you're the
 

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,310
case but but if you're the
receiver you shouldn't be even

14
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
receiver you shouldn't be even
 

15
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,830
receiver you shouldn't be even
thinking you're waiting for the LIF or

16
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:24,840
thinking you're waiting for the LIF or
 

17
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,750
thinking you're waiting for the LIF or
not so so by so so we like we I'm not

18
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:28,760
not so so by so so we like we I'm not
 

19
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,509
not so so by so so we like we I'm not
making the film yet so just go through

20
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:30,519
making the film yet so just go through
 

21
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,069
making the film yet so just go through
so here if we go if we go here um and

22
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:35,079
so here if we go if we go here um and
 

23
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,670
so here if we go if we go here um and
I'm thinking when's he going to

24
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
I'm thinking when's he going to
 

25
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,350
I'm thinking when's he going to
lift that sensory perception of

26
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:40,360
lift that sensory perception of
 

27
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,430
lift that sensory perception of
connecting never was never there in the

28
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:42,440
connecting never was never there in the
 

29
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,190
connecting never was never there in the
first place I don't need it if i s you

30
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
first place I don't need it if i s you
 

31
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,590
first place I don't need it if i s you
know B and that bow should have been

32
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
know B and that bow should have been
 

33
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,389

00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:53,359
see what I mean so so when we do when we
 

37
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,830
see what I mean so so when we do when we
sort of do that even though it's for the

00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
sort of do that even though it's for the
 

39
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,229
sort of do that even though it's for the
camer we shouldn't need it you it should

40
00:00:59,229 --> 00:00:59,239
camer we shouldn't need it you it should
 

41
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,910
camer we shouldn't need it you it should
it should be

42
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:00,920
it should be
 

43
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,829
it should be
you I'm searching for it

44
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:03,839
you I'm searching for it
 

45
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:07,510
you I'm searching for it
now I'm searching for this okay is a bit

46
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
now I'm searching for this okay is a bit
 

47
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,149
now I'm searching for this okay is a bit
weak but I've got his

48
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:09,159
weak but I've got his
 

49
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,350
weak but I've got his
connection so when I do this this is

50
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
connection so when I do this this is
 

51
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,469
connection so when I do this this is
actually for the

52
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479

 

53
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,749

camera so so we're going to go through

54
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
camera so so we're going to go through
 

55
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,710
camera so so we're going to go through
all this really fine

56
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:19,720
all this really fine
 

57
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,870
all this really fine
detail but what I want to do is I want

58
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:21,880
detail but what I want to do is I want
 

59
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,550
detail but what I want to do is I want
to film you first so that we and say

60
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:25,560
to film you first so that we and say
 

61
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,149
to film you first so that we and say
this is what we started with this is

62
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
this is what we started with this is
 

63
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,510
this is what we started with this is
what we ended

64
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:30,520
what we ended
 

65
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:38,109
what we ended
so we all see of a massive change

66
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:38,119

 

67
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,870

the longterm

68
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880

 

69
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:54,109

memory I think you

70
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:54,119

 

71
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:06,469

said but because he's connected

72
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479

 

73
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,790

this is here it matter about being over

74
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
this is here it matter about being over
 

75
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,270
this is here it matter about being over
his wrist in the

76
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,280
his wrist in the
 

77
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,509
his wrist in the
connection in the Practical mode I I

78
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:16,519
connection in the Practical mode I I
 

79
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:17,949
connection in the Practical mode I I
need to be

80
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:17,959
need to be
 

81
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,319
need to be
there so that's why I want
