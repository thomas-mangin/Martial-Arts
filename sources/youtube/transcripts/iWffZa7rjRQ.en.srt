pulls that's going to be energy okay um

36
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
pulls that's going to be energy okay um
 

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,910
pulls that's going to be energy okay um
so he pulls and you have uh cou hole

38
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:26,920
so he pulls and you have uh cou hole
 

39
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,109
so he pulls and you have uh cou hole
see but we're going to do it from the

141
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,870

143
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,390

technique all right let's try

144
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:33,400

 

145
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,670

okay another obvious one for the push he

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
okay another obvious one for the push he
 

147
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,870
okay another obvious one for the push he
goes to push is just your 10

goes to push is just your 10
 

149
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,070
goes to push is just your 10
P you give me 10 P okay and so here you

150
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
P you give me 10 P okay and so here you
 

151
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,110
P you give me 10 P okay and so here you
can you can he he goes to push you can

can you can he he goes to push you can
see you have ju nothing but we're going

154
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:48,759
see you have ju nothing but we're going
 

155
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,029
see you have ju nothing but we're going
to do it from the two on

156
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:53,039

 

157
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:56,550

one again as he pushes don't

158
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
one again as he pushes don't

brace you should feel it he goes to push

160
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
brace you should feel it he goes to push
 

161
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:10,029
brace you should feel it he goes to push
and that's your

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,150
get he comes around his circles going
that way you see so let's put it on the

that way you see so let's put it on the
 

169
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,150
that way you see so let's put it on the
clock so you can

170
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,160
clock so you can
 

171
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,309
clock so you can
see so he's going

172
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:24,319
see so he's going
 

173
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,029
see so he's going
clockwise and we usually go inside this

174
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:28,039
clockwise and we usually go inside this
 

175
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:30,270
clockwise and we usually go inside this
circle going the other way

176
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,280
circle going the other way
 

177
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,950
circle going the other way
okay so all all of your

178
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
okay so all all of your
 

179
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,909
okay so all all of your
ratio techniques are are like that the

180
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:36,919
ratio techniques are are like that the
 

181
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,230
ratio techniques are are like that the
ones that coming in okay so we're going

182
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:39,240
ones that coming in okay so we're going
 

183
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,110
ones that coming in okay so we're going
to use that technique

184
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,120
to use that technique
 

185
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,150
to use that technique
so I go to the two onone look how I

186
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,160
so I go to the two onone look how I
 

187
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,870
so I go to the two onone look how I
drive that gets most people to push

188
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:47,880
drive that gets most people to push
 

189
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,710
drive that gets most people to push
that's when I yield he gets his balance

190
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
that's when I yield he gets his balance
 

191
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,990
that's when I yield he gets his balance
he's going to come in you see well

192
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,000
he's going to come in you see well
 

193
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,629
he's going to come in you see well
that's that same Circle he's going

194
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
that's that same Circle he's going
 

195
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,469
that's that same Circle he's going
around me I'm going to come inside his

196
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
around me I'm going to come inside his
 

197
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:06,350
around me I'm going to come inside his
Circle

198
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:06,360

 

199
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,830

balance inside his

200
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840

 

201
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,510

Circle I don't care if you hold the arm

202
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:12,520
Circle I don't care if you hold the arm
 

203
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,510
Circle I don't care if you hold the arm
right now just work the

204
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520

 

205
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,950

pattern right

206
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960

 

207
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,029

there there's obviously the same timing

208
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:26,039
there there's obviously the same timing
 

209
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,029
there there's obviously the same timing
so if he pushes and I go like that this

210
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
so if he pushes and I go like that this
 

211
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,070
so if he pushes and I go like that this
technique doesn't work it's when he

212
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,080
technique doesn't work it's when he
 

213
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,990
technique doesn't work it's when he
pushes that's when this works same way

214
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
pushes that's when this works same way
 

215
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,189
pushes that's when this works same way
as when he pulls that's when all those

216
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:36,199
as when he pulls that's when all those
 

217
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,110
as when he pulls that's when all those
work it's not he pulls resist and then

218
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
work it's not he pulls resist and then
 

219
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,189
work it's not he pulls resist and then
go so the same thing here he pushes a

220
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:44,199
go so the same thing here he pushes a
 

221
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,909
go so the same thing here he pushes a
yield when he goes to stand up that's

222
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:46,919
yield when he goes to stand up that's
 

223
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,230
yield when he goes to stand up that's
when I go can't be standing then I go we

224
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,240
when I go can't be standing then I go we
 

225
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,150
when I go can't be standing then I go we
we're

226
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
we're
 

227
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,390
we're
changing

228
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400

 

229
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,629

places

230
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:01,639

 

231
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,790

okay let's

232
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:07,800

 

233
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,510

go here's the elbow arm that's the one I

234
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
go here's the elbow arm that's the one I
 

235
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,070
go here's the elbow arm that's the one I
don't want go up okay so I'll hold the

236
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,080
don't want go up okay so I'll hold the
 

237
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,350
don't want go up okay so I'll hold the
wrist arm as long as I need to to get

238
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,360
wrist arm as long as I need to to get
 

239
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,390
wrist arm as long as I need to to get
over here you can still hold it if you

240
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:21,400
over here you can still hold it if you
 

241
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,589
over here you can still hold it if you
want you can still hold it but you don't

242
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
want you can still hold it but you don't
 

243
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,390
want you can still hold it but you don't
need it you can also come to the legs

244
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:25,400
need it you can also come to the legs
 

245
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,309
need it you can also come to the legs
here on the on the

246
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
here on the on the
 

247
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,830
here on the on the
front right you do want to go around

248
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:30,840
front right you do want to go around
 

249
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,629
front right you do want to go around
that Noble arm and the way you get

250
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:33,639
that Noble arm and the way you get
 

251
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,990
that Noble arm and the way you get
around it is with that same

252
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,000
around it is with that same
 

253
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:47,830
around it is with that same
softness this

254
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840

 

255
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,230

way okay let's go so uh let's

256
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
way okay let's go so uh let's
 

257
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,110
way okay let's go so uh let's
say uh I got a key or he's like trying

00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
to rip my badge off of
 

261
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,469
to rip my badge off of
me you get get it so same same thing so

262
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
me you get get it so same same thing so
 

263
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,909
me you get get it so same same thing so
he he goes to grab look you're in the

264
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:04,919
he he goes to grab look you're in the
 

265
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,950
he he goes to grab look you're in the
same thing goes to grab boom you're in

266
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
same thing goes to grab boom you're in
 

267
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,469
same thing goes to grab boom you're in
the same he goes he does get a grip

268
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
the same he goes he does get a grip
 

269
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,270
the same he goes he does get a grip
doing the same thing he's got a clinch

270
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:14,280
doing the same thing he's got a clinch
 

271
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,990
doing the same thing he's got a clinch
you see starting to clinch and and

272
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,000
you see starting to clinch and and
 

273
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,309
you see starting to clinch and and
you're in the same exact thing you guys

274
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:19,319
you're in the same exact thing you guys
 

275
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,550
you're in the same exact thing you guys
see that you go right to the two on one

276
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:21,560
see that you go right to the two on one
 

277
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:28,230
see that you go right to the two on one
okay so uh you can do it on a grab

278
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
okay so uh you can do it on a grab
 

279
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,350
okay so uh you can do it on a grab
attemp you could do it on the ground

280
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
attemp you could do it on the ground
 

281
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,269
attemp you could do it on the ground
just

282
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
just
 

283
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,589
just
push you could do it on the clinch

284
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
push you could do it on the clinch
 

285
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,589
push you could do it on the clinch
attemp boom and then start any of those

286
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
attemp boom and then start any of those
 

287
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,750
attemp boom and then start any of those
techniques that we went over okay all

288
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
techniques that we went over okay all
 

289
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,350
techniques that we went over okay all
right let's

290
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360

 

291
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:58,190

[Music]

292
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,200

 

293
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:20,240

go

294
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,250

 

295
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:28,630

[Music]

296
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640

 

297
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,230

I so you have to go you do have to go

298
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,240
I so you have to go you do have to go
 

299
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,430
I so you have to go you do have to go
through a phase where you got to learn

300
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:32,440
through a phase where you got to learn
 

301
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,630
through a phase where you got to learn
the moves you got to learn the move and

302
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
the moves you got to learn the move and
 

303
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,190
the moves you got to learn the move and
then I I think it's okay to go through a

304
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
then I I think it's okay to go through a
 

305
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,269
then I I think it's okay to go through a
phase where you kind of slowing the

306
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:40,279
phase where you kind of slowing the
 

307
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,230
phase where you kind of slowing the
technique down through

308
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
technique down through
 

309
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,710
technique down through
contestation you know just a little bit

310
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
contestation you know just a little bit
 

311
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,110
contestation you know just a little bit
and then you do some

312
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
and then you do some
 

313
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,949
and then you do some
yield that's okay that's like a growing

314
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:49,959
yield that's okay that's like a growing
 

315
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:52,710
yield that's okay that's like a growing
phase as long as you keep training and

316
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
phase as long as you keep training and
 

317
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,110
phase as long as you keep training and
again we all know what that means right

318
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
again we all know what that means right
 

319
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,350
again we all know what that means right
four to 6 hours a day listen to your

320
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
four to 6 hours a day listen to your
 

321
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,350
four to 6 hours a day listen to your
teacher do all the other mental

322
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
teacher do all the other mental
 

323
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,470
teacher do all the other mental
trainings you'll get through that phase

324
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
trainings you'll get through that phase
 

325
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,590
trainings you'll get through that phase
but if you're pushing pushing pushing

326
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:04,600
but if you're pushing pushing pushing
 

327
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,670
but if you're pushing pushing pushing
forcing forcing forc that's a different

328
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:06,680
forcing forcing forc that's a different
 

329
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,509
forcing forcing forc that's a different
phase do do you understand so I I'll

330
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
phase do do you understand so I I'll
 

331
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,990
phase do do you understand so I I'll
describe it you guys are some of you are

332
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,000
describe it you guys are some of you are
 

333
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,389
describe it you guys are some of you are
looking at me right here okay so maybe I
