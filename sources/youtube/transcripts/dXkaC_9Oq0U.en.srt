connection he rotates the
 

241
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,269
connection he rotates the
cross and he goes

242
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:48,279
cross and he goes
 

243
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:55,110
cross and he goes
underneath

244
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120

 

245
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,310

boom one boom boom here
