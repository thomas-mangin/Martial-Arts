1
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,349

all right so oftentimes when I talk

2
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:06,359
all right so oftentimes when I talk
 

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,690
all right so oftentimes when I talk
about an adhesion

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:08,700
about an adhesion
 

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,770
about an adhesion
and you notice

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:12,780

 

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,870

there's like some look like the person

8
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:14,880
there's like some look like the person
 

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,630
there's like some look like the person
does look kind of stuck to you okay but

10
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:17,640
does look kind of stuck to you okay but
 

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,029
does look kind of stuck to you okay but
then your ego tripartite mind your

12
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:20,039
then your ego tripartite mind your
 

13
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,029
then your ego tripartite mind your
material mind right your worldly mind it

14
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
material mind right your worldly mind it
 

15
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,609
material mind right your worldly mind it
now tries to find a solution that it

16
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:25,619
now tries to find a solution that it
 

17
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,170
now tries to find a solution that it
understands and it can only understand

18
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:27,180
understands and it can only understand
 

19
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,109
understands and it can only understand
things dichotomously well that's a

20
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:30,119
things dichotomously well that's a
 

21
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,089
things dichotomously well that's a
problem because Ike is the

22
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:32,099
problem because Ike is the
 

23
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,090
problem because Ike is the
reconciliation of dichotomy so there's

24
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:35,100
reconciliation of dichotomy so there's
 

25
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,650
reconciliation of dichotomy so there's
no way you can understand it so it's

26
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:36,660
no way you can understand it so it's
 

27
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,530
no way you can understand it so it's
very common

28
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:38,540
very common
 

29
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,310
very common
that uh you imagine that I'm using his

30
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,320
that uh you imagine that I'm using his
 

31
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,490
that uh you imagine that I'm using his
fingertips you see and I me and that's

32
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:46,500
fingertips you see and I me and that's
 

33
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,510
fingertips you see and I me and that's
what's kind of pulling him that way

34
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:50,520

 

35
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,569

but you're not

36
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:53,579

 

37
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,869

so he opens his hand I I have to find

38
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
so he opens his hand I I have to find
 

39
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,689
so he opens his hand I I have to find
that adhesion in the hand so I can't go

40
00:00:59,689 --> 00:00:59,699
that adhesion in the hand so I can't go
 

41
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,450
that adhesion in the hand so I can't go
extra young and I definitely can't go

42
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:02,460
extra young and I definitely can't go
 

43
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,109
extra young and I definitely can't go
extra in I have to match that match it

44
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:06,119
extra in I have to match that match it
 

45
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,210
extra in I have to match that match it
match it match it match it match it

46
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,220
match it match it match it match it
 

47
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,149
match it match it match it match it
match what he's doing

48
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:11,159
match what he's doing
 

49
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,170
match what he's doing
if you pay attention this hand is going

50
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:15,180
if you pay attention this hand is going
 

51
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,609
if you pay attention this hand is going
to pick up

52
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:16,619
to pick up
 

53
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,929
to pick up
where this hand is

54
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:19,939
where this hand is
 

55
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:24,230
where this hand is
migrating from its young face to its Yin

56
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
migrating from its young face to its Yin
 

57
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,310
migrating from its young face to its Yin
face

58
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:25,320
face
 

59
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,130
face
so if you pay attention that starts to

60
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:28,140
so if you pay attention that starts to
 

61
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,490
so if you pay attention that starts to
happen here at the center line and now

62
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:31,500
happen here at the center line and now
 

63
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,410
happen here at the center line and now
the other hand which wasn't being

64
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:33,420
the other hand which wasn't being
 

65
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,109
the other hand which wasn't being
grabbed by anything is what does the

66
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:36,119
grabbed by anything is what does the
 

67
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,350
grabbed by anything is what does the
magnesium

68
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360

 

69
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,069

so it's not much to ask of an adhesion

70
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:43,079
so it's not much to ask of an adhesion
 

71
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,130
so it's not much to ask of an adhesion
to go from this shoulder line to this

72
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,140
to go from this shoulder line to this
 

73
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,069
to go from this shoulder line to this
Center Line it's not much at all okay so

74
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:49,079
Center Line it's not much at all okay so
 

75
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,770
Center Line it's not much at all okay so
we won't have you pushed this time go

76
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:51,780
we won't have you pushed this time go
 

77
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,289
we won't have you pushed this time go
ahead and ground yourself okay so he's

78
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:54,299
ahead and ground yourself okay so he's
 

79
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,630
ahead and ground yourself okay so he's
not pushing all I need to do is get that

80
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
not pushing all I need to do is get that
 

81
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,969
not pushing all I need to do is get that
adhesion for this time to not pick up

82
00:01:58,969 --> 00:01:58,979
adhesion for this time to not pick up
 

83
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,870
adhesion for this time to not pick up
and it will continue the techniques

84
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
and it will continue the techniques
 

85
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,270
and it will continue the techniques
which has no grout the second hand

86
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
which has no grout the second hand
 

87
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,069
which has no grout the second hand
wasn't relying on a grab do you guys

88
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:07,079
wasn't relying on a grab do you guys
 

89
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,469
wasn't relying on a grab do you guys
understand that okay so the first hand

90
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:09,479
understand that okay so the first hand
 

91
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,630
understand that okay so the first hand
is just an adhesion it moves him

92
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640

 

93
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,750

so the person who let's go doesn't

94
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
so the person who let's go doesn't
 

95
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,010
so the person who let's go doesn't
matter

96
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,020
matter
 

97
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,589
matter
it's gonna adhere on the outside yes

98
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
it's gonna adhere on the outside yes
 

99
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,530
it's gonna adhere on the outside yes
what are you doing okay let's go I was

100
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:24,540
what are you doing okay let's go I was
 

101
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,150
what are you doing okay let's go I was
never dependent on their fingers in the

102
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
never dependent on their fingers in the
 

103
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,330
never dependent on their fingers in the
grab anyways so it's irrelevant I'm here

104
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:29,340
grab anyways so it's irrelevant I'm here
 

105
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,729
grab anyways so it's irrelevant I'm here
I will my brush there it is right there

106
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:34,739

 

107
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,089

same thing goes uh what so let's say

108
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:38,099
same thing goes uh what so let's say
 

109
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,910
same thing goes uh what so let's say
he's pulling without his grip he's

110
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:40,920
he's pulling without his grip he's
 

111
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,949
he's pulling without his grip he's
trying to go back it increases the

112
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
trying to go back it increases the
 

113
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,930
trying to go back it increases the
friction do you feel it okay because

114
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:44,940
friction do you feel it okay because
 

115
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,170
friction do you feel it okay because
he's increasing the young value so that

116
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,180
he's increasing the young value so that
 

117
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,509
he's increasing the young value so that
it's easier for me to stick everything

118
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:50,519
it's easier for me to stick everything
 

119
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,750
it's easier for me to stick everything
gets stickier because the young the

120
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
gets stickier because the young the
 

121
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,350
gets stickier because the young the
reconciled young value is higher so here

122
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
reconciled young value is higher so here
 

123
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,430
reconciled young value is higher so here
with no grab and he's just holding there

124
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
with no grab and he's just holding there
 

125
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,190
with no grab and he's just holding there
it let's say it's 10 but when he tries

126
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,200
it let's say it's 10 but when he tries
 

127
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,890
it let's say it's 10 but when he tries
to pull backwards it gets it's at a

128
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:06,900
to pull backwards it gets it's at a
 

129
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,009
to pull backwards it gets it's at a
hundred now do you guys there's more

130
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:10,019
hundred now do you guys there's more
 

131
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,710
hundred now do you guys there's more
as more of a sense of friction at that

132
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
as more of a sense of friction at that
 

133
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,890
as more of a sense of friction at that
part okay so it's as I said in the

134
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:15,900
part okay so it's as I said in the
 

135
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,690
part okay so it's as I said in the
previous videos the person that's just

136
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:17,700
previous videos the person that's just
 

137
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,229
previous videos the person that's just
limp okay do you get it well they're not

138
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:21,239
limp okay do you get it well they're not
 

139
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,350
limp okay do you get it well they're not
asking for much so even that little tilt

140
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:24,360
asking for much so even that little tilt
 

141
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,809
asking for much so even that little tilt
that I get there in that head that's

142
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:26,819
that I get there in that head that's
 

143
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,690
that I get there in that head that's
enough to keep it going

144
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:29,700
enough to keep it going
 

145
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,809
enough to keep it going
once you start him moving so you start

146
00:03:32,809 --> 00:03:32,819
once you start him moving so you start
 

147
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,149
once you start him moving so you start
him moving and he moves around all right

148
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:35,159
him moving and he moves around all right
 

149
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,790
him moving and he moves around all right
now let's say for example

150
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:37,800
now let's say for example
 

151
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,670
now let's say for example
on this side

152
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:40,680
on this side
 

153
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,830
on this side
you don't have the forward progress

154
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
you don't have the forward progress
 

155
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,789
you don't have the forward progress
to go ahead and generate the adhesion as

156
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:49,799
to go ahead and generate the adhesion as
 

157
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,369
to go ahead and generate the adhesion as
you're working with centrifugal and

158
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:52,379
you're working with centrifugal and
 

159
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,530
you're working with centrifugal and
centripetal energy so like I've noticed

160
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:54,540
centripetal energy so like I've noticed
 

161
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,869
centripetal energy so like I've noticed
Tristan that you're beginning to sense

162
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
Tristan that you're beginning to sense
 

163
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,589
Tristan that you're beginning to sense
oh yeah that's a higher Yong value and I

164
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:00,599
oh yeah that's a higher Yong value and I
 

165
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,350
oh yeah that's a higher Yong value and I
can actually move people more do you get

166
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
can actually move people more do you get
 

167
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,190
can actually move people more do you get
it okay but it's not necessary so for

168
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
it okay but it's not necessary so for
 

169
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,170
it okay but it's not necessary so for
example

170
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:09,180
example
 

171
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,869
example
you understand centrifugal energy of him

172
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:11,879
you understand centrifugal energy of him
 

173
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,670
you understand centrifugal energy of him
going forward is Young I match it here

174
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
going forward is Young I match it here
 

175
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,050
going forward is Young I match it here
centripetally you're going to have like

176
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,060
centripetally you're going to have like
 

177
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,370
centripetally you're going to have like
a yawn value of 100. a young reconciled

178
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:22,380
a yawn value of 100. a young reconciled
 

179
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,530
a yawn value of 100. a young reconciled
value of a hundred you got it but this

180
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:24,540
value of a hundred you got it but this
 

181
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,909
value of a hundred you got it but this
is still young

182
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
is still young
 

183
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,650
is still young
his body sitting here is still young so

184
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:30,660
his body sitting here is still young so
 

185
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,230
his body sitting here is still young so
this thing still sticks

186
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:33,240
this thing still sticks
 

187
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,530
this thing still sticks
I just have to match it it still sticks

188
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:36,540
I just have to match it it still sticks
 

189
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,870
I just have to match it it still sticks
do you understand and now when it starts

190
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
do you understand and now when it starts
 

191
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,469
do you understand and now when it starts
to fall that too is Young descending

192
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
to fall that too is Young descending
 

193
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,749
to fall that too is Young descending
into Yin and you match that too

194
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759

 

195
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,749

same thing here he doesn't want to come

196
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:50,759
same thing here he doesn't want to come
 

197
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,870
same thing here he doesn't want to come
well if he wants to get up and go the

198
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:53,880
well if he wants to get up and go the
 

199
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,010
well if he wants to get up and go the
other way

200
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:55,020
other way
 

201
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,350
other way
it's gonna do what

202
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
it's gonna do what
 

203
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,270
it's gonna do what
more it's going to stick more because

204
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
more it's going to stick more because
 

205
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,030
more it's going to stick more because
the yarn values more okay so he doesn't

206
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,040
the yarn values more okay so he doesn't
 

207
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,310
the yarn values more okay so he doesn't
want to come it doesn't matter the

208
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
want to come it doesn't matter the
 

209
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,890
want to come it doesn't matter the
gravity working on him is enough young

210
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:06,900
gravity working on him is enough young
 

211
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,930
gravity working on him is enough young
value for me to match to move

212
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:11,940

 

213
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,629

it's just I always say it's harder

214
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
it's just I always say it's harder
 

215
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,090
it's just I always say it's harder
that's how I describe this harder why is

216
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,100
that's how I describe this harder why is
 

217
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,610
that's how I describe this harder why is
it harder

218
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:19,620

 

219
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,610

it's harder because your self gets

220
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:22,620
it's harder because your self gets
 

221
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,790
it's harder because your self gets
triggered more when they're not moving

222
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
triggered more when they're not moving
 

223
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,610
triggered more when they're not moving
and you can't do I key from a state of

224
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:28,620
and you can't do I key from a state of
 

225
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,590
and you can't do I key from a state of
self you can only do I keep from a state

226
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:30,600
self you can only do I keep from a state
 

227
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,050
self you can only do I keep from a state
of no cell that's why it's harder so

228
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,060
of no cell that's why it's harder so
 

229
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,110
of no cell that's why it's harder so
what makes it harder it requires higher

230
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,120
what makes it harder it requires higher
 

231
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,629
what makes it harder it requires higher
degrees of no self that's why higher

232
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
degrees of no self that's why higher
 

233
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,909
degrees of no self that's why higher
degrees of skill at reconciling self

234
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:40,919
degrees of skill at reconciling self
 

235
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,870
degrees of skill at reconciling self
that's why it's harder okay if we

236
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
that's why it's harder okay if we
 

237
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,249
that's why it's harder okay if we
have a ski for example and he's not over

238
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:49,259
have a ski for example and he's not over
 

239
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,129
have a ski for example and he's not over
penetrating go ahead there's no grab

240
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:52,139
penetrating go ahead there's no grab
 

241
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,050
penetrating go ahead there's no grab
there does that mean there's no Aikido

242
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,060
there does that mean there's no Aikido
 

243
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,450
there does that mean there's no Aikido
there now it doesn't mean that right so

244
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:56,460
there now it doesn't mean that right so
 

245
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,210
there now it doesn't mean that right so
he goes and I hear and I adhere that's

246
00:05:59,210 --> 00:05:59,220
he goes and I hear and I adhere that's
 

247
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,670
he goes and I hear and I adhere that's
all I get that's fine here is where I

248
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
all I get that's fine here is where I
 

249
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,450
all I get that's fine here is where I
use the other stuff you know boom

250
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:05,460
use the other stuff you know boom
 

251
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,050
use the other stuff you know boom
boom

252
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,060

 

253
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,890

so let's do an open grab no movement in

254
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:12,900
so let's do an open grab no movement in
 

255
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,370
so let's do an open grab no movement in
all you need is this little tilt that

256
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:16,380
all you need is this little tilt that
 

257
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,230
all you need is this little tilt that
was it that's all I need I'm in the

258
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
was it that's all I need I'm in the
 

259
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,330
was it that's all I need I'm in the
center line the other hand starts to

260
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:20,340
center line the other hand starts to
 

261
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,550
center line the other hand starts to
moving you have your forward progress

262
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
moving you have your forward progress
 

263
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,730
moving you have your forward progress
there you have your adhesion here energy

264
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:28,740

 

265
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:35,870

cool

266
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:35,880

 

267
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,909

all right let's see what happens right

268
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:40,919

 

269
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,309

okay so his grip is open

270
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:43,319
okay so his grip is open
 

271
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,909
okay so his grip is open
right and we know if you if he pulls

272
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:46,919
right and we know if you if he pulls
 

273
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,850
right and we know if you if he pulls
back on it then it increases that

274
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:49,860
back on it then it increases that
 

275
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,370
back on it then it increases that
adhesion value we know that right okay

276
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:52,380
adhesion value we know that right okay
 

277
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,490
adhesion value we know that right okay
so when I go like this

278
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:55,500
so when I go like this
 

279
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,370
so when I go like this
is he tries to drop his hand like he

280
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:58,380
is he tries to drop his hand like he
 

281
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,070
is he tries to drop his hand like he
lets it drop just let it dry do you get

282
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,080
lets it drop just let it dry do you get
 

283
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,129
lets it drop just let it dry do you get
it he lets it die do you see that all I

284
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:04,139
it he lets it die do you see that all I
 

285
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,309
it he lets it die do you see that all I
need is this I'll now do get on

286
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:07,319
need is this I'll now do get on
 

287
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,809
need is this I'll now do get on
do you understand

288
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:11,819

 

289
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,050

if he tries to pull it back what will

290
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:15,060
if he tries to pull it back what will
 

291
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,170
if he tries to pull it back what will
happen the young value will go up right

292
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:18,180
happen the young value will go up right
 

293
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,469
happen the young value will go up right
and same thing if he tries to go in now

294
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:21,479
and same thing if he tries to go in now
 

295
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,089
and same thing if he tries to go in now
he tries to go in towards he's trying to

296
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:23,099
he tries to go in towards he's trying to
 

297
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,370
he tries to go in towards he's trying to
go in towards him it's going away from

298
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:25,380
go in towards him it's going away from
 

299
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,469
go in towards him it's going away from
me the young value goes up you feel it

300
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:27,479
me the young value goes up you feel it
 

301
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,249
me the young value goes up you feel it
okay but when we're here and he dies and

302
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:31,259
okay but when we're here and he dies and
 

303
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,290
okay but when we're here and he dies and
goes Yin well that's where you'll get on

304
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:33,300
goes Yin well that's where you'll get on
 

305
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,629
goes Yin well that's where you'll get on
this so I go here he dies while I'm

306
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:35,639
this so I go here he dies while I'm
 

307
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,430
this so I go here he dies while I'm
picking up over here

308
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
picking up over here
 

309
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,689
picking up over here
you got it you understand okay so I I go

310
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:41,699
you got it you understand okay so I I go
 

311
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,730
you got it you understand okay so I I go
he dies I picked this up over here and

312
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:43,740
he dies I picked this up over here and
 

313
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:50,570
he dies I picked this up over here and
I'm in the same technique

314
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:50,580

 

315
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,350

okay so UK is just gonna sit there once

316
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:54,360
okay so UK is just gonna sit there once
 

317
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,170
okay so UK is just gonna sit there once
you feel whoa let's try to just let the

318
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,180
you feel whoa let's try to just let the
 

319
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,270
you feel whoa let's try to just let the
arm die and then you'll pick up the arm

320
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
arm die and then you'll pick up the arm
 

321
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,730
arm die and then you'll pick up the arm
with uh going over the top okay all

322
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:01,740
with uh going over the top okay all
 

323
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,409
with uh going over the top okay all
right

324
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:06,419

 

325
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,870

okay so on the first on the first star

326
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:08,880
okay so on the first on the first star
 

327
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,029
okay so on the first on the first star
we can't go up you're confused there so

328
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
we can't go up you're confused there so
 

329
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,390
we can't go up you're confused there so
you can't go up go up can't go up

330
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
you can't go up go up can't go up
 

331
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,830
you can't go up go up can't go up
lift it up can't go up okay

332
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:18,840
lift it up can't go up okay
 

333
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,050
lift it up can't go up okay
and you can't go back because he'll

334
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,060
and you can't go back because he'll
 

335
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,790
and you can't go back because he'll
increase the friction and he can't go

336
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
increase the friction and he can't go
 

337
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,409
increase the friction and he can't go
out he'll increase the friction but he

338
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:24,419
out he'll increase the friction but he
 

339
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,749
out he'll increase the friction but he
can go down do you understand and that

340
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:26,759
can go down do you understand and that
 

341
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,089
can go down do you understand and that
opens up the two Dawn here you work the

342
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:29,099
opens up the two Dawn here you work the
 

343
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:30,950
opens up the two Dawn here you work the
lower level okay

344
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
lower level okay
 

345
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,290
lower level okay
so once you get

346
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:33,300
so once you get
 

347
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,130
so once you get
to the outside right and you go here he

348
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:37,140
to the outside right and you go here he
 

349
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,430
to the outside right and you go here he
goes dies and you're here on the outside

350
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
goes dies and you're here on the outside
 

351
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,529
goes dies and you're here on the outside
again the same thing he can't come into

352
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:42,539
again the same thing he can't come into
 

353
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,710
again the same thing he can't come into
me because of the coke you you see do

354
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:45,720
me because of the coke you you see do
 

355
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,410
me because of the coke you you see do
you understand push in can't push it

356
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:48,420
you understand push in can't push it
 

357
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,410
you understand push in can't push it
he's going to lose his balance okay

358
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:50,420
he's going to lose his balance okay
 

359
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,230
he's going to lose his balance okay
uh he can he go back what do you think

360
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
uh he can he go back what do you think
 

361
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,509
uh he can he go back what do you think
he'll increase the friction do you see

362
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:56,519
he'll increase the friction do you see
 

363
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,670
he'll increase the friction do you see
that if he goes forward he'll increase

364
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:58,680
that if he goes forward he'll increase
 

365
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,790
that if he goes forward he'll increase
the friction he can only go that way do

366
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:01,800
the friction he can only go that way do
 

367
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,670
the friction he can only go that way do
you say because he can only go in the

368
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:04,680
you say because he can only go in the
 

369
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,550
you say because he can only go in the
cross to the young contact

370
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:07,560
cross to the young contact
 

371
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,310
cross to the young contact
got it so he can he can only go that way

372
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
got it so he can he can only go that way
 

373
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,530
got it so he can he can only go that way
so he goes that way and then he just

374
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:12,540
so he goes that way and then he just
 

375
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,550
so he goes that way and then he just
gave you his back

376
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:24,120
hair he counters I pick it up over here
 

381
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,150
hair he counters I pick it up over here
he counters again and then thank you

382
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
he counters again and then thank you
 

383
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,230
he counters again and then thank you
very much

384
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240

 

385
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,610

okay

386
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:31,620
okay
 

387
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,530
okay
let's try that so you guys got to do

388
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:33,540
let's try that so you guys got to do
 

389
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,030
let's try that so you guys got to do
this too dead counters okay try

390
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,040
this too dead counters okay try
 

391
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,829
this too dead counters okay try
okay there's something to note it's not

392
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:39,839
okay there's something to note it's not
 

393
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,570
okay there's something to note it's not
visible on camera and really only the

394
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:41,580
visible on camera and really only the
 

395
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,730
visible on camera and really only the
okay can feel it

396
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:43,740
okay can feel it
 

397
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,389
okay can feel it
so even when he's just here and he's uh

398
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:47,399
so even when he's just here and he's uh
 

399
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,910
so even when he's just here and he's uh
not giving any energy and his hand is

400
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
not giving any energy and his hand is
 

401
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,009
not giving any energy and his hand is
just uh I already matched the young

402
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:52,019
just uh I already matched the young
 

403
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,190
just uh I already matched the young
value right and that's our young value

404
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
value right and that's our young value
 

405
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,670
value right and that's our young value
here and so the tonden fields are going

406
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:58,680
here and so the tonden fields are going
 

407
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,970
here and so the tonden fields are going
to be connected so I move I can move him

408
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:01,980
to be connected so I move I can move him
 

409
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,850
to be connected so I move I can move him
at his Center I'm not in his arm not

410
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:04,860
at his Center I'm not in his arm not
 

411
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,250
at his Center I'm not in his arm not
trying to move his arm not slapping his

412
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:07,260
trying to move his arm not slapping his
 

413
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,070
trying to move his arm not slapping his
arm at hyper young okay so whatever he

414
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,080
arm at hyper young okay so whatever he
 

415
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,410
arm at hyper young okay so whatever he
grabs with I match it and now now I have

416
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:12,420
grabs with I match it and now now I have
 

417
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,110
grabs with I match it and now now I have
the center okay so what I mean by that

418
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
the center okay so what I mean by that
 

419
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,210
the center okay so what I mean by that
take away your hands

420
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:17,220
take away your hands
 

421
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,150
take away your hands
if he pushes on me what's gonna happen

422
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
if he pushes on me what's gonna happen
 

423
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,970
if he pushes on me what's gonna happen
to the overall reconciled young value

424
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:22,980
to the overall reconciled young value
 

425
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,250
to the overall reconciled young value
it's gonna go up do you see that so he

426
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:25,260
it's gonna go up do you see that so he
 

427
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,990
it's gonna go up do you see that so he
can't he can't go forward because the

428
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,000
can't he can't go forward because the
 

429
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,310
can't he can't go forward because the
Coq is there okay uh but it all stays

430
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:31,320
Coq is there okay uh but it all stays
 

431
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,470
Coq is there okay uh but it all stays
the same it's just at a lower value well

432
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:33,480
the same it's just at a lower value well
 

433
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,410
the same it's just at a lower value well
I touch here I'm in his Center and that

434
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:36,420
I touch here I'm in his Center and that
 

435
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,009
I touch here I'm in his Center and that
is why when I come here like that I

436
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:40,019
is why when I come here like that I
 

437
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,769
is why when I come here like that I
don't just move his arm or move his arm

438
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:42,779
don't just move his arm or move his arm
 

439
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,290
don't just move his arm or move his arm
that I'm moving that bot that center

440
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:45,300
that I'm moving that bot that center
 

441
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,050
that I'm moving that bot that center
part and so he feels that and he tries

442
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:48,060
part and so he feels that and he tries
 

443
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,329
part and so he feels that and he tries
to get off of it and same thing here I'm

444
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:50,339
to get off of it and same thing here I'm
 

445
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,030
to get off of it and same thing here I'm
not just moving his arm I'm gonna touch

446
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
not just moving his arm I'm gonna touch
 

447
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,970
not just moving his arm I'm gonna touch
that Center that's why he's stepping

448
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:55,980
that Center that's why he's stepping
 

449
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,090
that Center that's why he's stepping
so uh put your leg back down and we'll

450
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,100
so uh put your leg back down and we'll
 

451
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,050
so uh put your leg back down and we'll
get here okay don't step Don't Step

452
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,060
get here okay don't step Don't Step
 

453

don't step
 

455
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,350
don't step
he falls so he steps okay so here he

456
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
he falls so he steps okay so here he
 

457
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,449
he falls so he steps okay so here he
counter I picked up the new counter

458
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:11,459
counter I picked up the new counter
 

459
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:14,990
counter I picked up the new counter
encounters again and now we're here okay

460
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,000
encounters again and now we're here okay
 

461
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,110
encounters again and now we're here okay
so look at it this way your your hard

462
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,120
so look at it this way your your hard
 

463
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,630
so look at it this way your your hard
work is as you're moving through your

464
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
work is as you're moving through your
 

465
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,030
work is as you're moving through your
phases everything's going to be at your

466
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,040
phases everything's going to be at your
 

467
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,370
phases everything's going to be at your
Center Line so when I go and he counts

468
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:25,380
Center Line so when I go and he counts
 

469
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,410
Center Line so when I go and he counts
it that hand is right there already you

470
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:27,420
it that hand is right there already you
 

471
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,410
it that hand is right there already you
see and he's losing his balance so he

472
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:30,420
see and he's losing his balance so he
 

473
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,329
see and he's losing his balance so he
steps he pulls off the counter the

474
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:32,339
steps he pulls off the counter the
 

475
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,670
steps he pulls off the counter the
Honda's there right when he does it so

476
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:34,680
Honda's there right when he does it so
 

477
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,590
Honda's there right when he does it so
you I'll make sound effects so you

478
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:36,600
you I'll make sound effects so you
 

479
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,930
you I'll make sound effects so you
understand

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,310
he counted
right he counters

486
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
right he counters
 

487
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,650
right he counters
get stuck there you get it it's not like

488
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:48,660
get stuck there you get it it's not like
 

489
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,829
get stuck there you get it it's not like
this he goes well he counters oh

490
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
this he goes well he counters oh
 

491
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,509
this he goes well he counters oh
and I try to go like that and he puts

492
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
and I try to go like that and he puts
 

493
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,610
and I try to go like that and he puts
his arm inside and then I go like that

494
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:55,620
his arm inside and then I go like that
 

495
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,410
his arm inside and then I go like that
it all happens seamlessly

496
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:00,420

 

497
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,569

so no one would even noticed that he

498
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:02,579
so no one would even noticed that he
 

499
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,329
so no one would even noticed that he
tried to counter the technique you just

500
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:05,339
tried to counter the technique you just
 

501
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,630
tried to counter the technique you just
move to the next adhesion Point okay

502
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:08,640
move to the next adhesion Point okay
 

503
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,230
move to the next adhesion Point okay
your techniques are

504
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,240
your techniques are
 

505
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,569
your techniques are
organized in a way for that

506
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:14,579
organized in a way for that
 

507
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:17,030
organized in a way for that
okay it does that

508
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
okay it does that
 

509
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,550
okay it does that
it has to do with the consensual the

510
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:19,560
it has to do with the consensual the
 

511
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,490
it has to do with the consensual the
piss to me I always talk about

512
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:22,500
piss to me I always talk about
 

513
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,269
piss to me I always talk about
um

514
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
um
 

515
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,750
um
so get on chewed on Joe Don is part of

516
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:26,760
so get on chewed on Joe Don is part of
 

517
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,210
so get on chewed on Joe Don is part of
that Triune cosmology there's not really

518
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:29,220
that Triune cosmology there's not really
 

519
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,910
that Triune cosmology there's not really
three levels there's only one level at

520
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
three levels there's only one level at
 

521
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,530
three levels there's only one level at
the internal level there's only one

522
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:33,540
the internal level there's only one
 

523
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,810
the internal level there's only one
thing it's just that adhesion part okay

524
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:35,820
thing it's just that adhesion part okay
 

525
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,410
thing it's just that adhesion part okay
so you go one two three you're still

526
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:39,420
so you go one two three you're still
 

527
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,690
so you go one two three you're still
operating at the three things that are

528
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:41,700
operating at the three things that are
 

529
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,310
operating at the three things that are
not three things they're supposed to be

530
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:43,320
not three things they're supposed to be
 

531
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,290
not three things they're supposed to be
one thing okay so also another important

532
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:48,300
one thing okay so also another important
 

533
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,569
one thing okay so also another important
part to note even though there's an I

534
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:50,579
part to note even though there's an I
 

535
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:55,069
part to note even though there's an I
key at this angle Coq will be present at

536
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:55,079
key at this angle Coq will be present at
 

537
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,470
key at this angle Coq will be present at
the other angle of the Cross you are

538
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:57,480
the other angle of the Cross you are
 

539
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,790
the other angle of the Cross you are
rotating

540
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
rotating
 

541
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,269
rotating
okay and that's why uh as I'm trying to

542
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:02,279
okay and that's why uh as I'm trying to
 

543
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,210
okay and that's why uh as I'm trying to
go even though I'm going in on the other

544
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:05,220
go even though I'm going in on the other
 

545
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,329
go even though I'm going in on the other
side of the Cross you can't push in you

546
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:08,339
side of the Cross you can't push in you
 

547
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,850
side of the Cross you can't push in you
can't push in you can project when you

548
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:10,860
can't push in you can project when you
 

549
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,590
can't push in you can project when you
feel that okay

550
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:12,600
feel that okay
 

551
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,790
feel that okay
so same thing if I'm operating at the

552
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
so same thing if I'm operating at the
 

553
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,090
so same thing if I'm operating at the
level of conden here

554
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,100
level of conden here
 

555
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,150
level of conden here
same thing my UK is just kind of being a

556
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,160
same thing my UK is just kind of being a
 

557
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,290
same thing my UK is just kind of being a
lump I'm not gonna tilt him

558
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:27,300
lump I'm not gonna tilt him
 

559
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,790
lump I'm not gonna tilt him
I'm touching and I'll move his Center

560
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:31,800
I'm touching and I'll move his Center
 

561
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,150
I'm touching and I'll move his Center
do you think

562
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,160

 

563
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,810

same thing here a lot of UK want to just

564
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:38,820
same thing here a lot of UK want to just
 

565
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,150
same thing here a lot of UK want to just
fall for years so they want to Pivot on

566
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,160
fall for years so they want to Pivot on
 

567
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,490
fall for years so they want to Pivot on
that inner knee they go there and they

568
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:43,500
that inner knee they go there and they
 

569
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,490
that inner knee they go there and they
pivot you see that no no no no practice

570
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:46,500
pivot you see that no no no no practice
 

571
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,650
pivot you see that no no no no practice
make your UK have to move that center

572
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:48,660
make your UK have to move that center
 

573
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,170
make your UK have to move that center
around

574
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,180

 

575
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,410

same thing goes on the throw

576
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:54,420
same thing goes on the throw
 

577
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,230
same thing goes on the throw
so I'm gonna I'm pulling on the center

578
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:57,240
so I'm gonna I'm pulling on the center
 

579
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,569
so I'm gonna I'm pulling on the center
because I have a center same thing goes

580
00:13:59,569 --> 00:13:59,579
because I have a center same thing goes
 

581
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,850
because I have a center same thing goes
on the throat most you can't want to

582
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:01,860
on the throat most you can't want to
 

583
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:13,329
on the throat most you can't want to
fall right here on that back break fall

584
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:13,339

 

585
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,069

doesn't just fall over in all the other

586
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
doesn't just fall over in all the other
 

587
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,129
doesn't just fall over in all the other
videos we've been posting okay so you're

588
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:19,139
videos we've been posting okay so you're
 

589
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,850
videos we've been posting okay so you're
in the center in his Center whoa I want

590
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:22,860
in the center in his Center whoa I want
 

591
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,069
in the center in his Center whoa I want
to move him again oh where we have him

592
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:25,079
to move him again oh where we have him
 

593
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,509
to move him again oh where we have him
again

594
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:26,519
again
 

595
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,629
again
is that it you're always in the center

596
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:29,639
is that it you're always in the center
 

597
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,000
is that it you're always in the center
right
