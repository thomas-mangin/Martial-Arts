to disarm him injured him but more

162
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:27,630
to disarm him injured him but more
 

163
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,060
to disarm him injured him but more
importantly to check his mobility you

164
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,070
importantly to check his mobility you
 

165
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,620
importantly to check his mobility you
see that so the strike has to to push

166
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:36,630
see that so the strike has to to push
 

167
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,320
see that so the strike has to to push
into a center it's when I push into a

168
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,330
into a center it's when I push into a
 

169
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:47,730
into a center it's when I push into a
center oh I can do this key so I'm here

170
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:47,740

the opening I need for this ski it's not
 

175
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,269

quick little moves okay

176
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:00,279
quick little moves okay
 

177
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,319
quick little moves okay
so I need all my mouse move on that

178
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:04,329
so I need all my mouse move on that
 

179
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:08,339
so I need all my mouse move on that
Center so that he gets delayed for me to

180
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:08,349
Center so that he gets delayed for me to
 

181
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:09,709
Center so that he gets delayed for me to
close together

182
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:09,719
close together
 

183
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:21,970
close together
okay let's go okay next common mistake

184
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:21,980

 

185
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,230

your hands go down together

186
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
your hands go down together
 

187
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,650
your hands go down together
see this you don't want that the Joe has

188
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:30,660
see this you don't want that the Joe has
 

189
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,100
see this you don't want that the Joe has
a whipping just like all of you all of

190
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,110
a whipping just like all of you all of
 

191
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,790
a whipping just like all of you all of
your art has this you don't you don't go

192
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:37,800
your art has this you don't you don't go
 

193
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,820
your art has this you don't you don't go
like that there's always a a softening

194
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:40,830
like that there's always a a softening
 

195
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,830
like that there's always a a softening
and they're releasing in a wave-like

196
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:42,840
and they're releasing in a wave-like
 

197
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,830
and they're releasing in a wave-like
fashion and the same goes with the Joe

198
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
fashion and the same goes with the Joe
 

199
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,290
fashion and the same goes with the Joe
say you're not going here here here here

200
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,300
say you're not going here here here here
 

201
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,560
say you're not going here here here here
here here look if I leave my hands here

202
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:54,570
here here look if I leave my hands here
 

203
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,990
here here look if I leave my hands here
you know that the Joe is supposed to be

204
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,000
you know that the Joe is supposed to be
 

205
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,870
you know that the Joe is supposed to be
at a 45 degree angle in the block but if

206
00:06:59,870 --> 00:06:59,880
at a 45 degree angle in the block but if
 

207
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,180
at a 45 degree angle in the block but if
I bring them up together how will that

208
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,190
I bring them up together how will that
 

209
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,110
I bring them up together how will that
ever happen you see that so clearly when

210
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,120
ever happen you see that so clearly when
 

211
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,420
ever happen you see that so clearly when
you brought it up the right hand is

212
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,430
you brought it up the right hand is
 

213
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,700
you brought it up the right hand is
doing something slightly different and

214
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:10,710
doing something slightly different and
 

215
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,880
doing something slightly different and
in a different timing than the left hand

216
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:13,890
in a different timing than the left hand
 

217
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,310
in a different timing than the left hand
then the same thing goes when I go down

218
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:16,320
then the same thing goes when I go down
 

219
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,130
then the same thing goes when I go down
don't go from here and move them down

220
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:19,140
don't go from here and move them down
 

221
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,659
don't go from here and move them down
now you won't have the movement whoa the

222
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:23,669
now you won't have the movement whoa the
 

223
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:26,150
now you won't have the movement whoa the
right hand is moving do you see the left

224
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
right hand is moving do you see the left
 

225
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,510
right hand is moving do you see the left
hand starts afterwards so they move

226
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
hand starts afterwards so they move
 

227
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,490
hand starts afterwards so they move
differently and they move at a different

228
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:31,500
differently and they move at a different
 

229
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,010
differently and they move at a different
rate so we're going to go back to the

230
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,020
rate so we're going to go back to the
 

231
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,440
rate so we're going to go back to the
drill embryonic whoa don't move these

232
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:42,450
drill embryonic whoa don't move these
 

233
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:48,380
drill embryonic whoa don't move these
the same find this straight angle then

234
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:48,390
the same find this straight angle then
 

235
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,110
the same find this straight angle then
put that weight now into that give me

236
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
put that weight now into that give me
 

237
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,890
put that weight now into that give me
some lightness so I had to make up the

238
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:57,900
some lightness so I had to make up the
 

239
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,580
some lightness so I had to make up the

right if I move you it's gonna hurt you

242
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:04,740
right if I move you it's gonna hurt you
 

243
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,750
right if I move you it's gonna hurt you
move you

244
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:07,760

 

245
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,430

we're going slow so there's no inertia

246
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:10,440
we're going slow so there's no inertia
 

247

everyone starts making contact there and
 

269
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,519
everyone starts making contact there and
the other violation is you may contact

270
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:35,529
the other violation is you may contact
 

271
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,289
the other violation is you may contact
there you didn't really penetrate the

00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:37,299
there you didn't really penetrate the
 

273
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:47,129
there you didn't really penetrate the
target so as we go to the ski now the

274
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:47,139
target so as we go to the ski now the
 

275
00:09:47,139 --> 00:10:00,449

277
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:02,379

okay let's go

278
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:02,389
okay let's go
 

279
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:08,470
okay let's go
so the human body due to its material a

280
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
so the human body due to its material a
 

281
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,780
so the human body due to its material a
cup skin muscle balm right fluid and

282
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:15,790
cup skin muscle balm right fluid and
 

283
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:23,139
cup skin muscle balm right fluid and
also the gravity force that's pulling on

284
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:23,149
also the gravity force that's pulling on
 

285
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:25,870
also the gravity force that's pulling on
him down and trying to keep him in place

286
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:25,880
him down and trying to keep him in place
 

287
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,850
him down and trying to keep him in place
as an object that will remain in that

288
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:27,860
as an object that will remain in that
 

289
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,110
as an object that will remain in that
state until a greater object displaces

290
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
state until a greater object displaces
 

291
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,250
state until a greater object displaces
those two things create resistance to my

292
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:36,260
those two things create resistance to my
 

293
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:43,750
those two things create resistance to my
weapon but when I hit it that resistance

294
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
weapon but when I hit it that resistance
 

295
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,319
weapon but when I hit it that resistance
can overcome what I'm trying to do so if

296
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:47,329
can overcome what I'm trying to do so if
 

297
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:50,340
can overcome what I'm trying to do so if
I'm over here and I hit it here

298
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,350
I'm over here and I hit it here
 

299
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:56,139
I'm over here and I hit it here
maybe my grip slips you see maybe it

300
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:56,149
maybe my grip slips you see maybe it
 

301
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:01,160
maybe my grip slips you see maybe it
knocks it out of my hands

302
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,170

 

303
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,530

so we're gonna just offer resistance

304
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:03,540
so we're gonna just offer resistance
 

305
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,470
so we're gonna just offer resistance
hold the end do you understand these

306
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:09,480
hold the end do you understand these
 

307
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,609
hold the end do you understand these
representing that resistance okay so

308
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:13,619
representing that resistance okay so
 

309
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:16,780
representing that resistance okay so
we're going to do a couple of things I

310
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:16,790
we're going to do a couple of things I
 

311
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,229
we're going to do a couple of things I
want you to slide your hands back like

312
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:21,239
want you to slide your hands back like
 

313
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:26,019
want you to slide your hands back like
that so you sliding it through this here

314
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:26,029
that so you sliding it through this here
 

315
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:30,409
that so you sliding it through this here
resistance okay and I'm gonna let him go

316
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:30,419
resistance okay and I'm gonna let him go
 

317
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:33,650
resistance okay and I'm gonna let him go
with me knees up I wanted you to slide

318
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:33,660
with me knees up I wanted you to slide
 

319
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,269
with me knees up I wanted you to slide
one hand like that you see how I did

320
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
one hand like that you see how I did
 

321
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,359
one hand like that you see how I did
that it's like cool you see that

322
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:38,369

put my front surface with this line okay
and he goes to displace it go so even if

352
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,370
and he goes to displace it go so even if

resistance passed the line you see so he

360
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:05,949
resistance passed the line you see so he
 

361
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:12,030
resistance passed the line you see so he
goes you see not not not fast because

362
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,040
goes you see not not not fast because
 

363
