thought you would benefit as somebody

10
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:14,599
thought you would benefit as somebody
 

11
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,510
thought you would benefit as somebody
that maybe doesn't know the form or is

12
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
that maybe doesn't know the form or is
 

13
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,710
that maybe doesn't know the form or is
relearning

14
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720
relearning
 

15
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,029
relearning
it based on how I teach it I thought

16
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:22,039
it based on how I teach it I thought
 

17
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,310
it based on how I teach it I thought
you'd benefit from watching how I teach

18
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320

my son
okay so we're not just going to do the

22
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:28,920
okay so we're not just going to do the
 

23
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,870
okay so we're not just going to do the
form like you see on all those other

24
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
form like you see on all those other
 

25
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,749
form like you see on all those other
videos I shared and you just learn it

26
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:32,759
videos I shared and you just learn it
 

27
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,709
videos I shared and you just learn it
cuz you're never going to get it get it

28
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
cuz you're never going to get it get it
 

29
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,430
cuz you're never going to get it get it
that way okay um we have to go deeper I

30
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
that way okay um we have to go deeper I
 

31
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,790
that way okay um we have to go deeper I
would never just show the form to people

32
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:39,800
would never just show the form to people
 

33
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,110
would never just show the form to people

00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:01,239
this tactic which Cally
 

43
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:03,670
this tactic which Cally
in in my knif fighting

torso here is my adversary's
 

73
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,190
torso here is my adversary's
torso it is much riskier here for me to

torso it is much riskier here for me to
 

75
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,990

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
us too okay so for
 

85
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,390
us too okay so for
example uh in this

86
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:23,400
example uh in this
 

87
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,110
example uh in this
case the

88
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,120
case the
 

89
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,470
case the
adversary has the

90
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
adversary has the
 

91
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,430
adversary has the
Joe and when they put that weapon as in

92
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:32,440
Joe and when they put that weapon as in
 

93
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,509
Joe and when they put that weapon as in
uh the previous move this arm is closer

94
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:36,519
uh the previous move this arm is closer
 

95
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:39,309
uh the previous move this arm is closer
to me as the bulken

96
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:39,319
to me as the bulken
 

97
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:42,710
to me as the bulken
person and it is much easier for me to

98
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
person and it is much easier for me to
 

99
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,910
person and it is much easier for me to
try to cut that arm that is sticking

100
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:44,920
try to cut that arm that is sticking
 

101
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,630
try to cut that arm that is sticking
somewhere out here in the middle of the

102
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
somewhere out here in the middle of the
 

103
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,309
somewhere out here in the middle of the
fight then to come back and try to cut

104
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:49,319
fight then to come back and try to cut

their head or their neck or something
 

107
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,190
their head or their neck or something
like that because the closer I get to

108
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,200
like that because the closer I get to
 

109
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,750
like that because the closer I get to
here more Arsenal is available to my

110
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:58,760
here more Arsenal is available to my
 

111
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,509
here more Arsenal is available to my
opponent such as the rear end of the Joe

112
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
opponent such as the rear end of the Joe
 

113
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,149
opponent such as the rear end of the Joe
can turn it on

114
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:05,159
can turn it on
 

115
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,910
can turn it on
me but also personal weapons kicks hands

116
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:10,920
me but also personal weapons kicks hands
 

117
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,710
me but also personal weapons kicks hands
so they can grapple they can grab my

118
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:13,720
so they can grapple they can grab my
 

119
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,270
so they can grapple they can grab my
weapon they can punch and kick me it is

120
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
weapon they can punch and kick me it is
 

121
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,630
weapon they can punch and kick me it is
just much safer to not deal with the

122
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:19,640
just much safer to not deal with the
 

123
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,869
just much safer to not deal with the
additional Arsenal and just t attack the

124

okay so in that
 

215
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,629
okay so in that
portion of this move I would like to

216
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:39,639
portion of this move I would like to
 

217
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,990
portion of this move I would like to
focus in on this

218
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,000
focus in on this
 

219
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,950
focus in on this
part what brings the X close to me okay

220
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
part what brings the X close to me okay
 

221
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,909
part what brings the X close to me okay
that is an iy

222
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
that is an iy
 

223
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,469
that is an iy
adhesion

224
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:53,479
adhesion
 

225
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,990
adhesion
okay and we know from I that it is a

226
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,000
okay and we know from I that it is a
 

227
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,430
okay and we know from I that it is a
communion of two forces

228
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:04,440

 

229
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,550

there's two forces minimum that have to

230
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:07,560
there's two forces minimum that have to
 

231
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,070
there's two forces minimum that have to
become one the one force is created by

232
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,080
become one the one force is created by
 

233
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,990

ukas Joe going up towards the face it

234
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,000
ukas Joe going up towards the face it
 

235
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,430

has an upward
 

237
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,430
has an upward
energy the other force is created by the

238
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
energy the other force is created by the
 

239
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,510
energy the other force is created by the
sword person doing the otos it has a

240
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
sword person doing the otos it has a
 

241
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,350
sword person doing the otos it has a
downward energy okay

242
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:30,360
downward energy okay
 

243
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,909
downward energy okay
and here those downward energy and

244
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:32,919
and here those downward energy and
 

245
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,629
and here those downward energy and
upward energy are neutralized those two

246
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:35,639
upward energy are neutralized those two
 

247
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,029
upward energy are neutralized those two
y energies are neutralize and they and

248
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
y energies are neutralize and they and
 

249
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,230
y energies are neutralize and they and
the sword person moves the ax closer to

250
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:43,240
the sword person moves the ax closer to
 

251
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,990
the sword person moves the ax closer to
them so that they don't have to over

252
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
them so that they don't have to over
 

253
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,029
them so that they don't have to over
penetrate so they don't near the Torso

254
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
penetrate so they don't near the Torso
 

255

penetrate so they don't near the Torso
area of the adversary

256

I mentioned many times before one of the
 

273
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,350
I mentioned many times before one of the
things that they do is they just try to

274
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
things that they do is they just try to
 

275
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,189
things that they do is they just try to
free their center from the

adhesion in Gaza I say just go to the

278
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:28,280
adhesion in Gaza I say just go to the
 

279
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,749
adhesion in Gaza I say just go to the
next adhesion point in Kaza I say no

00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
next adhesion point in Kaza I say no
 

281
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,350
next adhesion point in Kaza I say no
that's bad in ki because UK is supposed

282
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
that's bad in ki because UK is supposed
 

283
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,990

Naga cha Sensei sets are forms but they
 

289
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,430
Naga cha Sensei sets are forms but they
are not Kona that is very important

290
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:50,440
are not Kona that is very important
 

291
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,589
are not Kona that is very important
there is built in a counter so there's

292
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:54,599
there is built in a counter so there's
 

293
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,950
there is built in a counter so there's
an attack and a counter and it is uh not

294
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
an attack and a counter and it is uh not
 

295
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,749
an attack and a counter and it is uh not
like at all like uh Kon waza because

296
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
like at all like uh Kon waza because
 

297
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,710
like at all like uh Kon waza because
there's no counter in kihon waza okay so

298
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:05,720
there's no counter in kihon waza okay so
 

299
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,629
there's no counter in kihon waza okay so
you have to be able you're going to be

300
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
you have to be able you're going to be
 

301
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,430
you have to be able you're going to be
attacked and then the UK has to counter

302
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:12,440
attacked and then the UK has to counter
 

303
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,430
attacked and then the UK has to counter
and here's the thing that counter

304
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:14,440
and here's the thing that counter
 

305
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,430
and here's the thing that counter
actually happens through the I adhesion

306
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:18,440
actually happens through the I adhesion
 

307
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,230
actually happens through the I adhesion
that part is very difficult for the

308
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,240
that part is very difficult for the
 

309
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,950
that part is very difficult for the
scaredy cat UK who's going to be more

315
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,230
hurt as we already demonstrated they
hurt more than the hands hurt especially

316
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:31,240
hurt more than the hands hurt especially
 

317
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,829
hurt more than the hands hurt especially

like hits the stick and then he can pull

434
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,240
like hits the stick and then he can pull
 

435
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,069
like hits the stick and then he can pull
out and do something else meaning I'm

436
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:27,079
out and do something else meaning I'm
 

437
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:29,670
out and do something else meaning I'm
never really doing the move and so he

438
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
never really doing the move and so he
 

439
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,110
never really doing the move and so he
never really has to counter it okay and

440
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
never really has to counter it okay and
 

441
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,030
never really has to counter it okay and
that's totally different and when we get

442
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
that's totally different and when we get
 

443
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,750
that's totally different and when we get
to move five you're going to see how

444
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
to move five you're going to see how
 

445
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,389
to move five you're going to see how
radically different my form is and why

446
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:41,399
radically different my form is and why
 

447
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,230
radically different my form is and why
and the and why I do it that way is

448
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
and the and why I do it that way is
 

449
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,310
and the and why I do it that way is
because I have problems with I'm

450
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:47,320
because I have problems with I'm
 

451
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,629
because I have problems with I'm
supposed to do an attack and they're

to just take turns all right so let's
 

457
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,389
to just take turns all right so let's
get to that point and we're going to

458
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
get to that point and we're going to
 

459
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,150
get to that point and we're going to
stay slow so we can make this point all

460
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,160
stay slow so we can make this point all
 

461
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,550

see here
 

503
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,829
see here
all right let's look at how would that

504
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:02,839
all right let's look at how would that
 

505
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,430
all right let's look at how would that
work I have problems with this because

506
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:06,440
work I have problems with this because
 

507
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,590
work I have problems with this because
his weapon is in the way of my ski if

do Makia Tosh you see that I moved the
weapon out of the way and there's the C

518
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
weapon out of the way and there's the C
 

519
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,230
weapon out of the way and there's the C
cha Sensei forms do that all the time

520
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,240
cha Sensei forms do that all the time
 

521
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,189
cha Sensei forms do that all the time
dis place the weapon from the center

522
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:35,199
dis place the weapon from the center
 

523
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,870
dis place the weapon from the center
line then attack on the center line but

524
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:37,880
line then attack on the center line but
 

525
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,310
line then attack on the center line but
here on this movement the way most

526
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
here on this movement the way most
 

527
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,790
here on this movement the way most
people do it is they come over here the

528
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
people do it is they come over here the
 

529
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,829
people do it is they come over here the
sword is on the center line why would I

530
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
sword is on the center line why would I
 

531
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,509

enter here makes no sense

532
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
enter here makes no sense
 

533
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,829

okay but if you pay

534
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
okay but if you pay

attention he did a move he doesn't

536
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
attention he did a move he doesn't
 

537

penetrates and he doesn't doesn't really
 

541
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,310
penetrates and he doesn't doesn't really
capture my center and hence I can pull

542
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
capture my center and hence I can pull
 

543
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,310
capture my center and hence I can pull
out so we'll do it again I go he goes

544
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:05,320
out so we'll do it again I go he goes
 

545
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,430
out so we'll do it again I go he goes
one 2 3 and I can just pull out this way

546
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:09,440
one 2 3 and I can just pull out this way
 

547
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,269
one 2 3 and I can just pull out this way
but if he had the adhesion go a little

548
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:12,279
but if he had the adhesion go a little
 

549
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,430
but if he had the adhesion go a little
slow go a little slower one two boom he

550
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
slow go a little slower one two boom he
 

551
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,910
slow go a little slower one two boom he
pulls me in I wouldn't even be able to

552
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
pulls me in I wouldn't even be able to
 

553
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,230
pulls me in I wouldn't even be able to
do that movement you can see on video

554
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:21,240
do that movement you can see on video
 

555
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,629
do that movement you can see on video
move number four how fast that little

556
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:23,639
move number four how fast that little
 

557
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,150
move number four how fast that little
flick is okay you're not going to be

558
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
flick is okay you're not going to be
 

559
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,670
flick is okay you're not going to be
able to go in and out and even if you

560

could the sword is waiting for you there
on the ski okay so we have to counter

564
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
on the ski okay so we have to counter
 

565
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,829
on the ski okay so we have to counter
his weapon and the way we counter it is

his weapon and the way we counter it is
 

567
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,509
his weapon and the way we counter it is
not by disengaging from the ike adhesion

568
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:42,519
not by disengaging from the ike adhesion
 

569
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,710
not by disengaging from the ike adhesion
but using the IE adhesion okay so we

570
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:45,720
but using the IE adhesion okay so we
 

571
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,509
but using the IE adhesion okay so we
can't be a little scared to who is cuz

572
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
can't be a little scared to who is cuz
 

573
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,350
can't be a little scared to who is cuz
you're going to want to disengage and it

574
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
you're going to want to disengage and it
 

575
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,509
you're going to want to disengage and it
may look like it works at slow speed but

576
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
may look like it works at slow speed but
 

577
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,030
may look like it works at slow speed but
it will not work at fast speed okay all

578
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,040
it will not work at fast speed okay all
 

579
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,509
it will not work at fast speed okay all
right so here we go he goes one two

it out
 

643
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,350
it out
nope there you go we draw the J there we

644
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:22,360
nope there you go we draw the J there we
 

645
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,390
nope there you go we draw the J there we
