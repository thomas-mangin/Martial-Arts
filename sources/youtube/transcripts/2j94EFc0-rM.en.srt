balance then you're just attacking the
 

179
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,110
balance then you're just attacking the
arm versus the disarm

180
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
arm versus the disarm
 

181
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,589
arm versus the disarm
boom there he got a grip and i'll cut

182
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
boom there he got a grip and i'll cut
 

183
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:16,790
boom there he got a grip and i'll cut
the grip

184
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800

188
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
inside there you go
 

189
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,150
inside there you go
just do the same adhesion

190
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
just do the same adhesion
 

191
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,070
just do the same adhesion
attack the arm

192
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080

 

193
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,230

boom you're back where we started with

194
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
boom you're back where we started with
 

195
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,550
boom you're back where we started with
the disarm

196
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560

 

197
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,480

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,830

[Music]

200
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:42,840

 

201
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:56,830

grabs

202
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840

 

203
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,230

his uh cover bomb this one okay

204
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
his uh cover bomb this one okay
 

205
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,430
his uh cover bomb this one okay
so i'm going to save the skies roll

206
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
so i'm going to save the skies roll
 

207
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,550
so i'm going to save the skies roll
hop and it's here like this so here i do

208
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
hop and it's here like this so here i do
 

209
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,830
hop and it's here like this so here i do
the same

210
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840

213
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:24,830
kazushi
so again the sky is home into the same

214
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840

 

215
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:39,269

00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279

 

217
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,310

pull back turn it

218
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
pull back turn it
 

219
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,470
pull back turn it
here

220
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480

 

221
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,710

but now he's not driving you saw how

222
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
but now he's not driving you saw how
 

223
00:08:48,720 --> 00:09:07,269
but now he's not driving you saw how
difficult it is

224
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279

 

225
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,990

and then don't ask so much of your

226
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
and then don't ask so much of your
 

227
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,350
and then don't ask so much of your
kazushi

228
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
kazushi
 

229
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,389
kazushi
so oh that's it then you can use your

230
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
so oh that's it then you can use your
 

231
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,430
so oh that's it then you can use your
strips

232
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440

 

233
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:44,949

so we went over the strip

234
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959

 

235
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,910

generate that angle cancellation from

236
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
generate that angle cancellation from
 

237
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,829
generate that angle cancellation from
here

238
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839
here
 

239
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,230
here
get the homologous shoulder

240
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
get the homologous shoulder
 

241
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:02,829
get the homologous shoulder
in the way of the cross lateral

242
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:02,839

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,110
this is different this is me just
stripping without his balance

248
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
stripping without his balance
 

249
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,829
stripping without his balance
attack is balanced boom balance send the

you don't really look for those things

284
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
you don't really look for those things
 

285
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,310
you don't really look for those things

286
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
in applications
 

287
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,670
in applications
so the kazushi in terms of an

288
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
so the kazushi in terms of an
 

289
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,350
so the kazushi in terms of an
application

290
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
application
 

291
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,550

is really about tilting his spine

292
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
is really about tilting his spine
 

293
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,389
is really about tilting his spine
and moving it into that spiral

294
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
and moving it into that spiral
 

295
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,870
and moving it into that spiral
it's not really about this whole thing

296
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
it's not really about this whole thing
 

297
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,550
it's not really about this whole thing
like this

298
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
like this
 

299
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,710
like this
that's more my study guide

300
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
that's more my study guide
 

301
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,150
that's more my study guide
so as i as i come in and i go

302
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
so as i as i come in and i go
 

303
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,430
so as i as i come in and i go
here you can see he's he's hitting he's

304
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
here you can see he's he's hitting he's
 

305
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,310
here you can see he's he's hitting he's
hitting so

306
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
hitting so
 

307
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,509
hitting so
he has a yog and i use the yawn to an

308
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
he has a yog and i use the yawn to an
 

309
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,550
he has a yog and i use the yawn to an
accident

310
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
accident
 

311
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,509
accident
adhesion to start that motion i i'm not

312
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
adhesion to start that motion i i'm not
 

313
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,150
adhesion to start that motion i i'm not
going to go

314
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
going to go
 

315
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,110
going to go
here and pull in my clasp with him and

316
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
here and pull in my clasp with him and
 

317
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,630
here and pull in my clasp with him and
the second i hit

318
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
the second i hit
 

319
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,470
the second i hit
he touches me i'm going into that

320
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
he touches me i'm going into that
 

321
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,550
he touches me i'm going into that
and then i'm only looking for the tilt

322
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
and then i'm only looking for the tilt
 

323
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,870
and then i'm only looking for the tilt
of that spine i'm only looking for the

324
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
of that spine i'm only looking for the
 

325
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,069
of that spine i'm only looking for the
energy to go into the kazushi pattern

326
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
energy to go into the kazushi pattern
 

327
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:19,590
energy to go into the kazushi pattern
so boom boom that's it

328
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600

 

329
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,710

so let's take the 9000 sometimes it

330
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
so let's take the 9000 sometimes it
 

331
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,389
so let's take the 9000 sometimes it
jacks you up

332
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
jacks you up
 

333
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,509
jacks you up
so boom boom here clear

334
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519

 

335
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,350

and what you're looking for is not to do

336
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
and what you're looking for is not to do
 

337
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,870
and what you're looking for is not to do
this

338
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
this
 

339
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,910
this
you don't have this balance

340
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
you don't have this balance
 

341
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,460
you don't have this balance
so boom

342
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:38,470
so boom
 

343
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:50,829
so boom
[Music]

344

345
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,310

so he's doing the maneuver

346
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
so he's doing the maneuver
 

347
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,110
so he's doing the maneuver
boom up he if he doesn't take me off

348
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
boom up he if he doesn't take me off
 

349
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,990
boom up he if he doesn't take me off
balance i can

350
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000
balance i can
 

351
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,949
balance i can
i can do the same thing to him do it

352
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
i can do the same thing to him do it
