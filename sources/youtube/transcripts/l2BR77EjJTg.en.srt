00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:54,350

don't

180
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:54,360

 

181
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,870

it's very it's everything is exaggerated

182
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
it's very it's everything is exaggerated
 

183
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,829
it's very it's everything is exaggerated
for training purposes so

184
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:02,839
for training purposes so
 

185
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,290
for training purposes so
understanding it conceptually means not

186
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:06,300
understanding it conceptually means not
 

187
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,790
understanding it conceptually means not
exactly

188
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:07,800
exactly
 

189
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,389
exactly
like he who

190
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:11,399

 

191
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,650

let's go

192
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:12,660
let's go
 

193
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,530
let's go
so since you're training obviously

194
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:15,540
so since you're training obviously
 

195
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,509
so since you're training obviously
you're not fighting because you don't

196
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
you're not fighting because you don't
 

197
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,670
you're not fighting because you don't
have your weapons right

198
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
have your weapons right
 

199
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,590
have your weapons right
so you're training and so you make this

200
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
so you're training and so you make this
 

201
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,930
so you're training and so you make this
kind of specialized environment

202
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:23,940
kind of specialized environment
 

203
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,750
kind of specialized environment
where you could observe

204
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:26,760
where you could observe
 

205
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,449
where you could observe
these skill sets okay you have to first

206
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:29,459
these skill sets okay you have to first
 

207
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,970
these skill sets okay you have to first
know what are these skill sets and never

208
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:31,980
know what are these skill sets and never
 

209
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,970
know what are these skill sets and never
confuse these skill sets with

210
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:34,980
confuse these skill sets with
 

211
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,030
confuse these skill sets with
the totality okay

212
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,040
the totality okay
 

213
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,410
the totality okay
so

214
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:39,420
so
 

215
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,230
so
um when you do your idea

216
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
um when you do your idea
 

217
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,050
um when you do your idea
I talked about how there's points

218
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,060
I talked about how there's points
 

219
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,790
I talked about how there's points
in the form

220
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
in the form
 

221
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,250
in the form
where you're going to basically do a

222
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:49,260
where you're going to basically do a
 

223
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,129
where you're going to basically do a
standing meditation right

224
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:52,139
standing meditation right
 

225
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,350
standing meditation right
um all you should look for those points

226
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:54,360
um all you should look for those points
 

227
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,490
um all you should look for those points
here too

228
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:55,500
here too
 

229
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,870
here too
okay

230
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
okay
 

231
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,170
okay
so a few pages it's deceiving because

232
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:00,180
so a few pages it's deceiving because
 

233
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,329
so a few pages it's deceiving because
you can't feel it they only you can feel

234
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:02,339
you can't feel it they only you can feel
 

235
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,009
you can't feel it they only you can feel
it you see

236
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,019
it you see
 

237
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,310
it you see
um so I'm trying to talk my way so this

238
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:07,320
um so I'm trying to talk my way so this
 

239
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,110
um so I'm trying to talk my way so this
this situation here is already some

240
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
this situation here is already some
 

241
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,670
this situation here is already some
specialized skill set because if I had

242
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
specialized skill set because if I had
 

243
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,550
specialized skill set because if I had
weapons I wouldn't be here see that I

244
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
weapons I wouldn't be here see that I
 

245
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,930
weapons I wouldn't be here see that I
think the only way to be here with

246
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:17,940
think the only way to be here with
 

247
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,490
think the only way to be here with
weapons

248
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:19,500
weapons
 

249
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:25,490
weapons
is

250
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:25,500

 

251
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,370

he he got me in the corner of these

252
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:28,380
he he got me in the corner of these
 

253
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,269
he he got me in the corner of these
things

254
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
things
 

255
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,250
things
you get he's closer than that you'd have

256
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:31,260
you get he's closer than that you'd have
 

257
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,110
you get he's closer than that you'd have
to be close we're here like that and now

258
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
to be close we're here like that and now
 

259
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,610
to be close we're here like that and now
now we're into

260
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:34,620
now we're into
 

261
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,949
now we're into
that rank so we don't need the corner to

262
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:36,959
that rank so we don't need the corner to
 

263
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,870
that rank so we don't need the corner to
practice that range

264
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880
practice that range
 

265
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,310
practice that range
got it okay and so since I hear I want

266
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:43,320
got it okay and so since I hear I want
 

267
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,470
got it okay and so since I hear I want
to practice that range

268
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:45,480
to practice that range
 

269
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,230
to practice that range
not practice fighting

270
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
not practice fighting
 

271
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,750
not practice fighting

285
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,930
he's what what he thinks he's gonna do
because I'm moving past it into here

286
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:11,940
because I'm moving past it into here
 

287
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,050
because I'm moving past it into here
do you think but look at the Tilt that I

288
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,060
do you think but look at the Tilt that I
 

289
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,009
do you think but look at the Tilt that I
got

290
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:16,019
got
 

291
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,629
got
you see

292
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:17,639
you see
 

293
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,470
you see
so you can hit me harder with that boom

294
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:21,480
so you can hit me harder with that boom
 

295
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,389
so you can hit me harder with that boom
it's not going to do what he thinks it's

296
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:23,399
it's not going to do what he thinks it's
 

297
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,870
it's not going to do what he thinks it's
going to do okay but I got the tilt okay

298
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
going to do okay but I got the tilt okay
 

299
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,350
going to do okay but I got the tilt okay
and now it looks

300
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,360
and now it looks
 

301
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,710
and now it looks
uh let's push into each other it looks

302
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:33,720
uh let's push into each other it looks
 

303
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,810
uh let's push into each other it looks
no don't let me push you hold your base

it looks like we're doing that
 

307
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,910
it looks like we're doing that
but

308
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:40,920
but
 

309
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,069
but
I'm just here right

00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:43,079
I'm just here right
 

311
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,230
I'm just here right
you feel push into me do you feel that

312
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:45,240
you feel push into me do you feel that
 

313
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,550
you feel push into me do you feel that
difference now I'm here push

314

difference now I'm here push
 

315
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,790
difference now I'm here push
this is different so it's not so in

316
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
this is different so it's not so in
 

317
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,069
this is different so it's not so in
other words push into each other and

318
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:55,079
other words push into each other and
 

319
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,650
other words push into each other and
quickly get out of the way then you'll

320
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:57,660
quickly get out of the way then you'll
 

321
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,509
quickly get out of the way then you'll
see me falling

322
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
see me falling
 

323
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,189
see me falling
I am pressing or I am touching him but

324
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:04,199
I am pressing or I am touching him but
 

325
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,250
I am pressing or I am touching him but
as he's pushed into me I'm just grounded

326
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:07,260
as he's pushed into me I'm just grounded
 

327
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,050
as he's pushed into me I'm just grounded
if he quickly moves out of the way

328
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,060
if he quickly moves out of the way
 

329
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,090
if he quickly moves out of the way
it's like he was never on me you see

330

it's like he was never on me you see
 

331
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,550
it's like he was never on me you see
that but I get I want to practice that

332
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:13,560
that but I get I want to practice that
 

333
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,569
that but I get I want to practice that
range

334
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:14,579
range
 

335
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:18,050
range
but when I practice when I get here you

336
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,060
but when I practice when I get here you
 

337
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,990
but when I practice when I get here you
have to not want the question to him

you okay

516
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:41,700

 

517
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,130

um

518
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:43,140
um
 

519
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,390
um
it's it's the it's shuhadi is what that

520
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:47,400
it's it's the it's shuhadi is what that
 

521
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,970
it's it's the it's shuhadi is what that
little pyramid makes but it's the it's

522
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:49,980
little pyramid makes but it's the it's
 

523
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,450
little pyramid makes but it's the it's
the tripartite or the Triune cosmology

524
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:53,460
the tripartite or the Triune cosmology
 

525
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,250
the tripartite or the Triune cosmology
and you're saying you have two things

526
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:55,260
and you're saying you have two things
 

527
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,590
and you're saying you have two things
but really there's just one where you

528
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600
but really there's just one where you
 

529
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,590
but really there's just one where you
work in these Trias I think

530
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:00,600
work in these Trias I think
 

531
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,169
work in these Trias I think
but shuhadi you have form and non-form

532
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:03,179
but shuhadi you have form and non-form
 

533
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,990
but shuhadi you have form and non-form
or form and the deconstruction form

534
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,000
or form and the deconstruction form
 

535
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,669
or form and the deconstruction form
and then you have this other state

536
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
and then you have this other state
 

537
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,409
and then you have this other state
that's somewhere

538
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:09,419
that's somewhere
 

539
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:13,850
that's somewhere
perfectly balanced in the middle

540
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:13,860

 

541
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,830

which would be the reconciliation of

542
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
which would be the reconciliation of
 

543
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,690
which would be the reconciliation of
form and non-formal

544
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:17,700
form and non-formal
 

545
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,190
form and non-formal
that's the crest in the turkey

00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,610
what they could do about it maybe that's
a plausible answer as well not according

684
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:22,620
a plausible answer as well not according
 

685
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,890
a plausible answer as well not according
to our theory of evolution yeah

686
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:24,900
to our theory of evolution yeah
 

687
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,110
to our theory of evolution yeah
that okay so

688
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
that okay so
 

689
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,990
that okay so
it's not that I stopped him from doing

690
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
it's not that I stopped him from doing
 

691
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,230
it's not that I stopped him from doing
it I would want him to do it you see

692
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,240
it I would want him to do it you see
 

693
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,149
it I would want him to do it you see
so see if you could put it together with

694
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:35,159
so see if you could put it together with
 

695
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,490
so see if you could put it together with
that clue why did he not why was there

696
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:37,500
that clue why did he not why was there
 

697
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,910
that clue why did he not why was there
no spinal displacement why

698
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:39,920
no spinal displacement why
 

699
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,010
no spinal displacement why

00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:45,059
what did what was he allowed to do in
 

703
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,669
what did what was he allowed to do in
the drill

704
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:46,679
the drill
 

705
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,049
the drill
anything

706
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:48,059
anything
 

707
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,470
anything
do you see so any counter any kind of

708
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:51,480
do you see so any counter any kind of
 

709
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,990
do you see so any counter any kind of
attack do you see that oh he feels

710
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,000
attack do you see that oh he feels
 

711
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,850

himself going off balance what do you

712
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:55,860
himself going off balance what do you
 

713
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,169
himself going off balance what do you
think he did

714
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:57,179
think he did
 

715
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:59,450
think he did
regained his balance either he regained

716
00:28:59,450 --> 00:28:59,460
regained his balance either he regained
 

717
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,029
regained his balance either he regained
it going forward no because he would go

718
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:02,039
it going forward no because he would go
 

719
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,130
it going forward no because he would go
into this you see that so he's making

720
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:04,140
into this you see that so he's making
 

721
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,890
into this you see that so he's making
these little micro adjustments to try to

722
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:06,900
these little micro adjustments to try to
 

723
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,149
these little micro adjustments to try to
stop any kind of that young energy that

724
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:11,159
stop any kind of that young energy that
 

725
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,610
stop any kind of that young energy that
would lead to a spinal displacement lead

726
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:13,620
would lead to a spinal displacement lead
 

727
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,010
would lead to a spinal displacement lead
to becoming a spinal displacement tactic

728
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:16,020
to becoming a spinal displacement tactic
 

729
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,190
to becoming a spinal displacement tactic
he may have done it like once two two

730
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,200
he may have done it like once two two
 

731
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,470
he may have done it like once two two
three times I think in there but even in

00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:21,480
three times I think in there but even in

00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,930
three times I think in there but even in
the midst of the throw he was reducing

734
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:23,940
the midst of the throw he was reducing
 

735
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,210
the midst of the throw he was reducing
how much spinal displacement he did and

736
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:26,220
how much spinal displacement he did and
 

737
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,210
how much spinal displacement he did and
so you don't see the big kihon do you

738
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:29,220
so you don't see the big kihon do you
 

739
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,830
so you don't see the big kihon do you
see that

740
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:30,840
see that
 

741
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,710
see that

now don't look for the big no you wasn't

762
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,640
now don't look for the big no you wasn't
 

763
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,570
now don't look for the big no you wasn't
especially in a drill where

00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:02,580
especially in a drill where
 

765
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,870
especially in a drill where
as a trained aikidoka is gonna go I'm

do you see that like you
know he's constantly countered he was

772
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:11,640
know he's constantly countered he was
 

773
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,909
know he's constantly countered he was
constantly countered it might look to

774
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:13,919
constantly countered it might look to
 

775
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,149
constantly countered it might look to
you like it's one two but no it's like

776
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:17,159
you like it's one two but no it's like

100 plus 79 10 11 12 got it do you
 

779
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,850
100 plus 79 10 11 12 got it do you
understand there's constant little micro

780
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:22,860
understand there's constant little micro
 

781
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,310
understand there's constant little micro
countering going on

782
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:25,320
countering going on
 

783
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,649
countering going on
and that's the funness of the drill it's

784
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:27,659
and that's the funness of the drill it's
 

785
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,330
and that's the funness of the drill it's
like can you adopt with this

786
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:29,340
like can you adopt with this
 

787
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,669
like can you adopt with this
ever-changing situation

788
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:31,679
ever-changing situation
 

789
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,930
ever-changing situation
so

790
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:32,940
so
 

791
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,310
so
you would need to have form or waza that

792
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,320
you would need to have form or waza that
 

793
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,070
you would need to have form or waza that
would be able to address all of these

794
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,080
would be able to address all of these
 

795
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,310
would be able to address all of these
things see if all you're doing is q1 was

796
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:43,320
things see if all you're doing is q1 was
 

797
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,330
things see if all you're doing is q1 was
that

798
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:44,340

and this is where most Aikido people go

806
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:54,419
and this is where most Aikido people go
 

807
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,210

I would jcd me

808
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:56,220
I would jcd me
 

809
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,889
I would jcd me
you say well now you're doing spinal

810
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:57,899
you say well now you're doing spinal
 

811
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,169
you say well now you're doing spinal
displacement on another trade aikidoka

so see where that lands you

814
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:02,520
so see where that lands you
 

815
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,250
so see where that lands you
get it

816
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:04,260
get it
 

817

819
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,210

so may you look at you okay

820
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:10,220
so may you look at you okay
 

821
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,529
so may you look at you okay

was coming in
 

959
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,930
was coming in
but you were like I would say a second

960
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:17,940
but you were like I would say a second
 

961
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,730

and a half after
 

963
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,849
and a half after
you see that so you're it you stayed

964
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:22,859
you see that so you're it you stayed
 

965
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:26,089
you see that so you're it you stayed

not in the here and now and so that and
 

969
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,970
not in the here and now and so that and
that's what the ego tripartite does that

970
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:31,980
that's what the ego tripartite does that
 

971
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,770
that's what the ego tripartite does that
it's either you're either early or late

972
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:33,780
it's either you're either early or late
 

973

it's either you're either early or late
you can't be in the present

you can't be in the present
 

975
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,050
you can't be in the present
that's what the god mind can be in the

976
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:39,060
that's what the god mind can be in the
 

977
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,750
that's what the god mind can be in the
present okay and so you're chasing

978
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:41,760
present okay and so you're chasing
 

979
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,629
present okay and so you're chasing
things right that they're already gone

980
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:44,639
things right that they're already gone
 

981
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,510
things right that they're already gone
or you're falling for fakes because you

982
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520
or you're falling for fakes because you
 

983
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,149
or you're falling for fakes because you
were predicting them you see now it's

984
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
were predicting them you see now it's
 

985
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,790
were predicting them you see now it's
like man I can't get anything going and

986
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:52,800
like man I can't get anything going and
 

987
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,070
like man I can't get anything going and
that's that sense of that okay so when

988
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:55,080
that's that sense of that okay so when
 

989
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,950
that's that sense of that okay so when
it comes to access it this comes to the

990
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:57,960
it comes to access it this comes to the
 

991
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,430
it comes to access it this comes to the
skill uh can I release from the ego

992

again and as a skill then is it to not
 

1009
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,150
again and as a skill then is it to not
related to the training equations

1010
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,160
related to the training equations
 

1011
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,069
related to the training equations
you see so again it's not that

1012
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:37,079
you see so again it's not that
 

1013
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:40,910
you see so again it's not that
we just saw in the three senpai

1014
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:40,920
we just saw in the three senpai
 

1015
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,450
we just saw in the three senpai
a bunch of forms but we saw the fluidity

1016
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:44,460
a bunch of forms but we saw the fluidity
 

1017
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,569
a bunch of forms but we saw the fluidity
and the adaptability you see that's that

1018
00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:47,579
and the adaptability you see that's that
 

1019
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:51,170
and the adaptability you see that's that
other part and again if you go and you

1020
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:51,180
other part and again if you go and you
 

1021
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,329
other part and again if you go and you
you calculate that like you you want to

1022
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:53,339
you calculate that like you you want to
 

1023
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:54,829
you calculate that like you you want to
be a coach do you see you let's say you

1024
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:54,839
be a coach do you see you let's say you
 

1025
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:56,690
be a coach do you see you let's say you
want to be a coach you know I see okay

1026
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:56,700
want to be a coach you know I see okay
 

1027
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,849
want to be a coach you know I see okay
that athlete is getting this to work

1028
00:35:58,849 --> 00:35:58,859
that athlete is getting this to work
 

1029
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:01,069
that athlete is getting this to work
right not that we're athletes but

1030
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:01,079
right not that we're athletes but
 

1031
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,870
right not that we're athletes but
they're getting after work what do they

1032
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
they're getting after work what do they
 

1033
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,750
they're getting after work what do they
do you see and you would plot for it you

1034
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:05,760
do you see and you would plot for it you
 

1035
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,109
do you see and you would plot for it you
got a plot for the hours you see and I

1036
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:09,119
got a plot for the hours you see and I
 

1037
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,210
got a plot for the hours you see and I
would say as I've always said man get to

1038
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:11,220
would say as I've always said man get to
 

1039

the do the hours first and then start

1040
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,040
the do the hours first and then start
 

1041
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,130
the do the hours first and then start
plotting for uh you know lesson plans

1042
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:18,140
plotting for uh you know lesson plans
 

1043
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,990
plotting for uh you know lesson plans
and training environments and all that

1044
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:21,000
and training environments and all that
 

1045
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,089
and training environments and all that
kind of stuff because people with hours

1046
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:23,099
kind of stuff because people with hours
 

1047
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:27,490
kind of stuff because people with hours
can overcome bad Futures bad schedules

1048
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:27,500
can overcome bad Futures bad schedules
 

1049
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,790
can overcome bad Futures bad schedules
uh bad information

1050
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:30,800
uh bad information
 

1051
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,589
uh bad information
people don't realize that

1052
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:33,599
people don't realize that
 

1053
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,450
people don't realize that
because they're they're sold on this

1054

because they're they're sold on this
academic intellect kind of thing but

1056
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,040
academic intellect kind of thing but
 

1057
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,970

you know what I mean but he just worked

1068
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:54,839
you know what I mean but he just worked
 

1069
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:55,910
you know what I mean but he just worked
harder

1070

harder
 

1071
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,130
harder
he worked harder

1072
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:58,140
he worked harder
 

1073
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,030
he worked harder
or he worked hard enough to overcome his

1074
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,040
or he worked hard enough to overcome his
 

1075
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,730
or he worked hard enough to overcome his
poor environment his poor training

1076
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:04,740
poor environment his poor training
 

1077
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,490
poor environment his poor training
environment you see I was trained as a

1078
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:07,500
environment you see I was trained as a
 

1079
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,890
environment you see I was trained as a
as a teenager with world champions

1080
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:09,900
as a teenager with world champions
 

1081
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,050
as a teenager with world champions
you're going to get fast you see that

1082
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,060
you're going to get fast you see that
 

1083
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,970
you're going to get fast you see that
but you don't need the world champions

1084

to get past you just gotta work harder
 

1087
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,230
to get past you just gotta work harder
because you don't have World

1088
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:18,240
because you don't have World
 

1089
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,370
because you don't have World
Championships

1090

and that kid was every bit as
 

1093
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,630
and that kid was every bit as
competitive as everyone you and he was

1094
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:23,640
competitive as everyone you and he was
 

1095
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,130
competitive as everyone you and he was
tougher because it's going to make you

1096
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:25,140
tougher because it's going to make you
 

1097
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,230
tougher because it's going to make you
tougher see you do all that kind of work

1098
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,240
tougher see you do all that kind of work
 

1099
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,550
tougher see you do all that kind of work
and stuff

1100
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:28,560
and stuff
 

1101
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,250
and stuff
so and that's just been my experience if

1102
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:31,260
so and that's just been my experience if
 

1103
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,290
so and that's just been my experience if
you wait for the ideal teacher and the

1104
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:33,300
you wait for the ideal teacher and the

00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,160
middle diamond
 

1117
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,490
middle diamond
do you understand not you know I don't

1118
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:49,500
do you understand not you know I don't
 

1119
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,050
do you understand not you know I don't
want all the forms that's not enough

1120
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,060
want all the forms that's not enough
 

1121
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,870
want all the forms that's not enough
right and they want to be able to do

1122
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:53,880
right and they want to be able to do
 

1123
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,089
right and they want to be able to do
something okay

1124
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:56,099
something okay
 

1125
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,010
something okay
but I'm after the middle one and I will

1126
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:58,020
but I'm after the middle one and I will
 

1127
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,510
but I'm after the middle one and I will
do whatever it takes and what I'm

1128
00:37:59,510 --> 00:37:59,520
do whatever it takes and what I'm
 

1129
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,849
do whatever it takes and what I'm
telling you to start is you have to

1130
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:01,859
telling you to start is you have to
 

1131
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:03,890
telling you to start is you have to
start with the training equations

1132
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:03,900
start with the training equations
 

1133
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,069
start with the training equations
okay I'm not saying it's the end-all but

1134
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:07,079
okay I'm not saying it's the end-all but
 

1135
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,930
okay I'm not saying it's the end-all but
it is the place to start and there's no

1136
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:08,940
it is the place to start and there's no
 

1137
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,510
it is the place to start and there's no
point going Beyond it

1138
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:11,520
point going Beyond it
 

1139
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,349
point going Beyond it
if you haven't yet achieved it

1140
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:14,359
if you haven't yet achieved it
 

1141
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,690
if you haven't yet achieved it
if you have achieved it then we can

1142
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:17,700
if you have achieved it then we can
 

1143
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,450
if you have achieved it then we can
start looking at other things okay and

1144
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:20,460
start looking at other things okay and
 

1145
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,030
start looking at other things okay and
so that your question was how do I stop

1146
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
so that your question was how do I stop
 

1147
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,710
so that your question was how do I stop
being lost and I would say get the

1148
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
being lost and I would say get the
 

1149
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,510
being lost and I would say get the
training equation first

1150
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:26,520
training equation first
 

1151
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,550
training equation first
and then we'll go from there

1152
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:28,560
and then we'll go from there
 

1153
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,670
and then we'll go from there
okay that's that's how I answer that

1154
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:31,680
okay that's that's how I answer that
 

1155
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,800
okay that's that's how I answer that
question okay

1156
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:32,810
question okay
 

1157
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:37,730

you are supposed to reconcile form and

00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:57,480
you are supposed to reconcile form and
 

1173
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,290
you are supposed to reconcile form and
non-form which means that dichotomy is

1174
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:00,300
non-form which means that dichotomy is
 

1175
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,430
non-form which means that dichotomy is

it's no matter what he does
 

1201

it's no matter what he does
I have to make sure he ends up in the

I have to make sure he ends up in the
 

1203

00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,329
same place
by the same Concepts in geoaza I get to

1206
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:44,339
by the same Concepts in geoaza I get to
 

1207
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,370
by the same Concepts in geoaza I get to
pick what how he wants to end you see

1208
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:46,380
pick what how he wants to end you see
 

1209
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,770
pick what how he wants to end you see
that's G was of me is actually way

1210
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:48,780
that's G was of me is actually way
 

1211
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,690
that's G was of me is actually way
easier than Keyhole lessons

1212
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:50,700
easier than Keyhole lessons
 

1213
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,410
easier than Keyhole lessons
but most people do kiwan Maza and the

1214
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:54,420
but most people do kiwan Maza and the
 

1215
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,109
but most people do kiwan Maza and the
way they might do G was that where

1216
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:57,119
way they might do G was that where
 

1217
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,150

they're younging everything and forcing

1218
00:39:59,150 --> 00:39:59,160
they're younging everything and forcing
 

1219
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,250
they're younging everything and forcing
everything you see

1220
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:01,260
everything you see
 

1221
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,010
everything you see
so well I don't know let's say let's say

1222
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:04,020
so well I don't know let's say let's say
 

1223
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,349
so well I don't know let's say let's say
we'll we'll just we're doing see what he

1224
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:06,359
we'll we'll just we're doing see what he
 

1225
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:08,150
we'll we'll just we're doing see what he
wasn't here we go that has nothing to do

1226
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,160
wasn't here we go that has nothing to do
 

1227
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,910
wasn't here we go that has nothing to do
with what I just saw okay but it's a

1228
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:10,920
with what I just saw okay but it's a
 

1229
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,010
with what I just saw okay but it's a
level of mind and it's exactly the same

1230
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:13,020
level of mind and it's exactly the same
 

1231
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:17,450
level of mind and it's exactly the same
so uh as as he goes right

1232
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:17,460
so uh as as he goes right
 

1233
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,210
so uh as as he goes right
I can tell you he's pushing down

1234
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:20,220
I can tell you he's pushing down
 

1235
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,849
I can tell you he's pushing down
did you feel it okay

1236
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:22,859
did you feel it okay
 

1237
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:25,670
did you feel it okay
so we'll try to duplicate it again but

1238
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:25,680
so we'll try to duplicate it again but
 

1239
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,250
so we'll try to duplicate it again but
normally what's he supposed to do he's

1240
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:28,260
normally what's he supposed to do he's
 

1241
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,069
normally what's he supposed to do he's
supposed to push in but he decides he's

1242
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:31,079
supposed to push in but he decides he's
 

1243
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:32,870
supposed to push in but he decides he's
changing and he started to push down you

1244
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
changing and he started to push down you
 

1245
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,349
changing and he started to push down you
see that so when he pushes down if I now

1246
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:36,359
see that so when he pushes down if I now
 

1247
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:40,010
see that so when he pushes down if I now
try to go up like the normal form then

1248
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:40,020
try to go up like the normal form then
 

1249
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,569
try to go up like the normal form then
I'm young

1250
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:41,579
I'm young
 

1251
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:45,050
I'm young
do you understand so you push down and

1252
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:45,060
do you understand so you push down and
 

1253
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,030
do you understand so you push down and
I'll go here

1254
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,040
I'll go here
 

1255
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,609
I'll go here
and so I'll do it again for the camera

1256
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:49,619
and so I'll do it again for the camera
 

1257
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:51,770
and so I'll do it again for the camera
see so normal form don't push down

1258
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:51,780
see so normal form don't push down
 

1259
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,530
see so normal form don't push down
normal form is here there was no

1260
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:54,540
normal form is here there was no
 

1261
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,569
normal form is here there was no
downward pressure on it so he supposed

1262
00:40:56,569 --> 00:40:56,579
downward pressure on it so he supposed
 

1263
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,329
downward pressure on it so he supposed
to push down for me to push up now that

1264
00:40:59,329 --> 00:40:59,339
to push down for me to push up now that
 

1265
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:01,370
to push down for me to push up now that
would be yum yum that's no different

1266
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:01,380
would be yum yum that's no different
 

1267
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,250
would be yum yum that's no different
than uh he's coming in on me and me

1268
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:04,260
than uh he's coming in on me and me
 

1269
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,450
than uh he's coming in on me and me
doing that

1270
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:05,460
doing that
 

1271
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,210
doing that
you see me pushing on him externally

1272
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:08,220
you see me pushing on him externally
 

1273
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,790
you see me pushing on him externally
mechanic

1274
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:10,800
mechanic
 

1275
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,370
mechanic
so instead we'll go here I don't know if

1276
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:13,380
so instead we'll go here I don't know if
 

1277
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,810
so instead we'll go here I don't know if
you can see it Taylor you probably have

1278
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:14,820
you can see it Taylor you probably have
 

1279
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,849
you can see it Taylor you probably have
some problems

1280
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:16,859
some problems
 

1281
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:19,430
some problems
okay so he had that power pressure so

1282
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:19,440
okay so he had that power pressure so
 

1283
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,430
okay so he had that power pressure so
I'm gonna go down and go behind him

1284
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:22,440
I'm gonna go down and go behind him
 

1285
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,210
I'm gonna go down and go behind him
you see that so all uh you can push

1286
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:26,220
you see that so all uh you can push
 

1287
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,270
you see that so all uh you can push
straight or you can push down okay you

1288
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,280
straight or you can push down okay you
 

1289
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,430
straight or you can push down okay you
got it and we'll just we'll do the

1290
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:31,440
got it and we'll just we'll do the
 

1291
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,109
got it and we'll just we'll do the
position we'll start over and you'll go

1292
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:33,119
position we'll start over and you'll go
 

1293
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,010
position we'll start over and you'll go
again

1294
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,020
again
 

1295
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:40,790
again
no he's gonna go

1296
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:40,800

 

1297
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,790

so it looked like you do not pay

1298
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:43,800
so it looked like you do not pay
 

1299
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,430
so it looked like you do not pay
attention it looks like the same

1300
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:46,440
attention it looks like the same
 

1301
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,250
attention it looks like the same
technique but you're supposed to go uh

1302
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:49,260
technique but you're supposed to go uh
 

1303
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,130
technique but you're supposed to go uh
Dave went down on one and it went up on

1304
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:52,140
Dave went down on one and it went up on
 

1305
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,349
Dave went down on one and it went up on
the other and now you gotta reverse

1306
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:54,359
the other and now you gotta reverse
 

1307
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:57,890
the other and now you gotta reverse
engineer oh he's not just doing Style

1308
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:57,900
engineer oh he's not just doing Style
 

1309
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,770
engineer oh he's not just doing Style
he blessed to push down but usually you

1310
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:00,780
he blessed to push down but usually you
 

1311
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,050
he blessed to push down but usually you
can't you don't make that conclusion do

1312
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:03,060
can't you don't make that conclusion do
 

1313
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,870
can't you don't make that conclusion do
you think you got it so as as we're

1314
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:05,880
you think you got it so as as we're
 

1315
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,030
you think you got it so as as we're
moving on with the form

1316
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,040
moving on with the form
 

1317
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,089
moving on with the form
okay and look you you can see because he

1318
00:42:11,089 --> 00:42:11,099
okay and look you you can see because he
 

1319
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,470
okay and look you you can see because he
came back

1320
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:12,480
came back
 

1321
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,390
came back
if you paid attention

1322
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,400
if you paid attention
 

1323
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,510
if you paid attention
so he went back and then he came back

1324
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
so he went back and then he came back
 

1325
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,670
so he went back and then he came back
