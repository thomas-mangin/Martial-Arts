00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:58,070
thinking about keeping that thing moving
okay keeping it moving

118
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080

 

119
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,470

so i have to have some spontaneity in it

120
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480

okay i'm trying to fake him but
if if now he's gonna try to tag me as

124
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
if if now he's gonna try to tag me as
 

125
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,070
if if now he's gonna try to tag me as
i'm coming in

126
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
i'm coming in
 

127
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,190
i'm coming in
okay so maybe i'll try and fake him and

128
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
okay so maybe i'll try and fake him and
 

129
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,910
okay so maybe i'll try and fake him and
work

130
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
work
 

131
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,990
work
but maybe i'm thinking i could tell he

132
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
but maybe i'm thinking i could tell he
 

133
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,750
but maybe i'm thinking i could tell he
falls like you're gonna nail me

134
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
falls like you're gonna nail me
 

135
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,110
falls like you're gonna nail me
okay then maybe i have to do a conscious

136
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
okay then maybe i have to do a conscious
 

137
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,910
okay then maybe i have to do a conscious
angle of deviation okay so that's the

138
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
angle of deviation okay so that's the
 

139
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,030
angle of deviation okay so that's the
drill

140
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
drill
 

141
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,630
drill
