1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,470

so kho is a drilling a training exercise

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:11,480
so kho is a drilling a training exercise
 

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,589
so kho is a drilling a training exercise
it's for that c moment that I

4
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:14,599
it's for that c moment that I
 

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,429
it's for that c moment that I
demonstrated yesterday yesterday's video

6
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:17,439
demonstrated yesterday yesterday's video
 

7
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:19,630
demonstrated yesterday yesterday's video
okay you you have

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:19,640
okay you you have
 

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,509
okay you you have
to uh be able to project their line of

10
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
to uh be able to project their line of
 

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,950
to uh be able to project their line of
gravity way outside of an athlete's

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
gravity way outside of an athlete's
 

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,389
gravity way outside of an athlete's
ability to reposition their basis

14
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
ability to reposition their basis
 

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,630
ability to reposition their basis
support back under it okay so when you

16
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:35,640
support back under it okay so when you
 

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,190
support back under it okay so when you
do a momentum

18
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200

 

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,150

throw the athlete is always going to be

20
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
throw the athlete is always going to be
 

21
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,110
throw the athlete is always going to be
able to get their Bas of support back

22
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
able to get their Bas of support back
 

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,709
able to get their Bas of support back
underneath that line of gravity okay so

24
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:47,719
underneath that line of gravity okay so
 

25
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:53,630
underneath that line of gravity okay so
the art is based upon in part that CQ

26
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:53,640
the art is based upon in part that CQ
 

27
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,389
the art is based upon in part that CQ
projection okay and so here you're doing

28
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
projection okay and so here you're doing
 

29
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,950
projection okay and so here you're doing
a drill where you repeat over and over

30
00:00:59,950 --> 00:00:59,960
a drill where you repeat over and over
 

31
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,110
a drill where you repeat over and over
over and over that moment that's what

32
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,120
over and over that moment that's what
 

33
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,630
over and over that moment that's what
drills do just work on that one moment

34
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
drills do just work on that one moment
 

35
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,149
drills do just work on that one moment
okay and so for the sake of repeating

36
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:07,159
okay and so for the sake of repeating
 

37
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,390
okay and so for the sake of repeating
that moment the projection moment uh

38
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:10,400
that moment the projection moment uh
 

39
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,710
that moment the projection moment uh
everything else is kind of idealized and

40
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
everything else is kind of idealized and
 

41
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,830
everything else is kind of idealized and
control it's irrelevant

42
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840
control it's irrelevant
 

43
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,230
control it's irrelevant
okay so um I don't want to do any kind

44
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:21,240
okay so um I don't want to do any kind
 

45
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,350
okay so um I don't want to do any kind
of tilting of this

46
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
of tilting of this
 

47
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,550
of tilting of this
body I'm not doing this kind of

48
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:27,560
body I'm not doing this kind of
 

49
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,749
body I'm not doing this kind of
stuff so what is this kind of stuff well

50
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:30,759
stuff so what is this kind of stuff well
 

51
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:33,190
stuff so what is this kind of stuff well
in Ence you're taking his line of

52
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
in Ence you're taking his line of
 

53
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,749
in Ence you're taking his line of
gravity and moving it outside his b of

54
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
gravity and moving it outside his b of
 

55
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,389
gravity and moving it outside his b of
support you see that but as I turn him

56
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:39,399
support you see that but as I turn him
 

57
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,030
support you see that but as I turn him
here and he can she go underneath this

58
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
here and he can she go underneath this
 

59
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,069
here and he can she go underneath this
you see and then it's not going to work

60
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
you see and then it's not going to work
 

61
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,550
you see and then it's not going to work
so why did it work before because he

62
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
so why did it work before because he
 

63
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,510
so why did it work before because he
left his base of support there and then

64
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:52,520
left his base of support there and then
 

65
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,389
left his base of support there and then
he eventually will fall do you

66
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
he eventually will fall do you
 

67
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,149
he eventually will fall do you
understand that okay so that is to me

68
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
understand that okay so that is to me
 

69
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,630
understand that okay so that is to me
that is not called this is not

70
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:01,640
that is not called this is not
 

71
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,870
that is not called this is not
C this is just I don't know low level

72
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:05,880
C this is just I don't know low level
 

73
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,229
C this is just I don't know low level
momentum throwing got it okay so

74
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
momentum throwing got it okay so
 

75
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,830
momentum throwing got it okay so
um what we're doing is taking his uh

76
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
um what we're doing is taking his uh
 

77
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,309
um what we're doing is taking his uh
energy letting it pass through me come

78
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
energy letting it pass through me come
 

79
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,390
energy letting it pass through me come
down to the ground let it pass back out

80
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
down to the ground let it pass back out
 

81
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,589
down to the ground let it pass back out
through me rebound and that displaces

82
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
through me rebound and that displaces
 

83
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,390
through me rebound and that displaces
him like he gets like a jolt of like a

84
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:29,400
him like he gets like a jolt of like a
 

85
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,030
him like he gets like a jolt of like a
something pushed him okay but it's

86
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,040
something pushed him okay but it's
 

87
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,229
something pushed him okay but it's
energetic it's not with my actual hands

88
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
energetic it's not with my actual hands
 

89
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,430
energetic it's not with my actual hands
okay so we're going to uh take

90
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
okay so we're going to uh take
 

91
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,630
okay so we're going to uh take
out the final part even this part

92
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:45,640
out the final part even this part
 

93
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,430
out the final part even this part
because that's working on another aspect

94
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:48,440
because that's working on another aspect
 

95
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,710
because that's working on another aspect
of and we're just going to focus on

96
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:51,720
of and we're just going to focus on
 

97
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,550
of and we're just going to focus on
the projection part okay um so I am

98
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:57,560
the projection part okay um so I am
 

99
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,470
the projection part okay um so I am
going to he's going to by drill design

100
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:01,480
going to he's going to by drill design
 

101
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,070
going to he's going to by drill design
uh connect to my Center so he's not just

102
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,080
uh connect to my Center so he's not just
 

103
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,910
uh connect to my Center so he's not just
holding my wrist here okay what do I

104
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
holding my wrist here okay what do I
 

105
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,509
holding my wrist here okay what do I
mean by connect to my Center is he comes

106
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:10,519
mean by connect to my Center is he comes
 

107
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:13,149
mean by connect to my Center is he comes
in establishes the center relationship

108
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:13,159
in establishes the center relationship
 

109
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,190
in establishes the center relationship
to where a little extra and I can

110
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
to where a little extra and I can
 

111
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,910
to where a little extra and I can
project him out do you got it so I'm not

112
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
project him out do you got it so I'm not
 

113
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,350
project him out do you got it so I'm not
sitting here this

114
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:22,360
sitting here this
 

115
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,630
sitting here this
a and you could do that if that was your

116
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:25,640
a and you could do that if that was your
 

117
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,670
a and you could do that if that was your
role but that is not your role Your Role

118
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:28,680
role but that is not your role Your Role
 

119
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,910
role but that is not your role Your Role
is to get to Center here okay just prior

120
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:32,920
is to get to Center here okay just prior
 

121
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,589
is to get to Center here okay just prior
of projection so he's doing that okay

122
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:36,599
of projection so he's doing that okay
 

123
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,710
of projection so he's doing that okay
and I send that energy down it's not in

124
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:39,720
and I send that energy down it's not in
 

125
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,990
and I send that energy down it's not in
my shoulders send it down and now I am

126
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
my shoulders send it down and now I am
 

127
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,470
my shoulders send it down and now I am
going to increase his y value in this

128
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
going to increase his y value in this
 

129
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,309
going to increase his y value in this
drill so his pushing that's y I'm going

130
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
drill so his pushing that's y I'm going
 

131
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,350
drill so his pushing that's y I'm going
to increase it with a slight yield

132
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
to increase it with a slight yield
 

133
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,630
to increase it with a slight yield
boom and that is what I use to project

134
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
boom and that is what I use to project
 

135
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:06,910
boom and that is what I use to project
back out

136
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:06,920

 

137
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,110

I can increases y value with the my

138
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
I can increases y value with the my
 

139
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,990
I can increases y value with the my
exercise so you going to get the first

140
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
exercise so you going to get the first
 

141
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,189
exercise so you going to get the first
one you're going to come in and I'm

142
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:16,199
one you're going to come in and I'm
 

143
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,150
one you're going to come in and I'm
going to take that you see his intention

144
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:19,160
going to take that you see his intention
 

145
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,870
going to take that you see his intention
to come in his intention to grab and

146
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:21,880
to come in his intention to grab and
 

147
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,230
to come in his intention to grab and
feel my Center here I'm going to make

148
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
feel my Center here I'm going to make
 

149
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,830
feel my Center here I'm going to make
him continue that intention here but not

150
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
him continue that intention here but not
 

151
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,150
him continue that intention here but not
with this bent elbow okay so you'll get

152
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
with this bent elbow okay so you'll get
 

153
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,350
with this bent elbow okay so you'll get
one oh you'll come

possible is to have his young energy

168
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
possible is to have his young energy
 

169
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,870
possible is to have his young energy
bounce off of me okay so that means my

170
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:07,880
bounce off of me okay so that means my
 

171
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,390
bounce off of me okay so that means my
arms don't have to go in and they don't

172
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
arms don't have to go in and they don't
 

173
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:22,590
arms don't have to go in and they don't
have to go out so pop I'm going to load

174
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:22,600

 

175
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,230

176
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,240
for this shape is
 

177
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,790
for this shape is
irrelevant where my arms

178
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:27,800
irrelevant where my arms
 

179
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:40,029
irrelevant where my arms
are doesn't matter

180
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:40,039

doesn't matter if it's two or one the
 

183
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,390
doesn't matter if it's two or one the
energy is coming in cuz I take advantage

184
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:45,400
energy is coming in cuz I take advantage
 

185
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,749

order to have his energy go through me I
 

249
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,510
order to have his energy go through me I
can't be tense it doesn't go through me

if I see how lo hands are stuff okay you
 

263
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,790
if I see how lo hands are stuff okay you
will block the energy if you tense up

264
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:07,800
will block the energy if you tense up
 

265
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,469
will block the energy if you tense up
here and it'll go superficial it won't

266
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
here and it'll go superficial it won't

up if you're doing this right your butt
 

283
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,709
up if you're doing this right your butt
goes down butt goes down energy goes

284
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
goes down butt goes down energy goes
 

285
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,750
goes down butt goes down energy goes
down not

286
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:38,760
down not
 

287
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,790
down not
not that the energy is

288
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:41,800
not that the energy is
 

289
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,430

uh if he increases the pressure it's

292
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,080
uh if he increases the pressure it's
 

293
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,190
uh if he increases the pressure it's
easier to project it's harder to project

294
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,200
easier to project it's harder to project
 

295
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,230
easier to project it's harder to project
on people that do disengage the pressure

296
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
on people that do disengage the pressure
 

297
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,430
on people that do disengage the pressure
okay but if you're doing it

298
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
okay but if you're doing it
 

299
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,430
okay but if you're doing it
superficially

300
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
superficially
 

301
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,670

externally when they increase the
 

303
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,389
externally when they increase the
pressure that will get harder for you

304
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
pressure that will get harder for you
 

305
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,670
pressure that will get harder for you
okay so he's he's going to try to really

331
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,150
Ito kazushi is about reducing energy and
mass so the most efficient way of

332
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
mass so the most efficient way of
 

333
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,790
mass so the most efficient way of
creating a top Turvy effect is on this

334
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:01,800
creating a top Turvy effect is on this
 

335
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,870
creating a top Turvy effect is on this
diagonal here this diagonal here this

336
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
diagonal here this diagonal here this
 

337
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,110
diagonal here this diagonal here this
diagonal here okay do you got it uh but

338
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,120
diagonal here okay do you got it uh but
 

339
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,670
diagonal here okay do you got it uh but
that means if I'm trying to train that

340
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
that means if I'm trying to train that
 

341
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,910
that means if I'm trying to train that
is going to

342
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:12,920
is going to
 

343
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,550
is going to
be um a less efficient way of drilling

344
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
be um a less efficient way of drilling
 

345
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,550
be um a less efficient way of drilling
basically you're using less weight on

346
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
basically you're using less weight on
 

347
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,949
basically you're using less weight on
the bar if you're trying to do a bench

348
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
the bar if you're trying to do a bench
 

349
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,350
the bar if you're trying to do a bench
press and you're taking weight off

350
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
press and you're taking weight off
 

351
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,710
press and you're taking weight off
that's what you do in kazushi okay but

352
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:25,720
that's what you do in kazushi okay but
 

353
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,829
that's what you do in kazushi okay but
in drilling in kokuo you don't take the

354
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:28,839
in drilling in kokuo you don't take the
 

355
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,870
in drilling in kokuo you don't take the
weight off you try to keep the weight on

356
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:31,880
weight off you try to keep the weight on
 

357
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,870
weight off you try to keep the weight on
so to speak it's not really weight but

358
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:33,880
so to speak it's not really weight but
 

359
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,470
so to speak it's not really weight but
you're trying to keep as much energy in

360
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:35,480
you're trying to keep as much energy in
 

361
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,670
you're trying to keep as much energy in
the technique as possible okay so uh you

362
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
the technique as possible okay so uh you
 

363
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,629
the technique as possible okay so uh you
don't I don't want to tilt him and then

364
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:44,639

 

365
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,910

project tilt him and then project

366
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:48,920
project tilt him and then project
 

367
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,910
project tilt him and then project
s so if you pay attention uh especially

368
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:52,920

427
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,350
here down to the ground just because I'm
moving my hand forward that energy is

428
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:36,360
moving my hand forward that energy is
 

429
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,949
moving my hand forward that energy is
still passing through me to the

00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
still passing through me to the
 

431
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,790
still passing through me to the
