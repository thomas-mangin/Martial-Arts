00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,550

again try try to understand like you

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:03,560
again try try to understand like you

00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,070
again try try to understand like you
can't just repeat a thrill and then

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,080
can't just repeat a thrill and then
 

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,430
can't just repeat a thrill and then
magically it's going to make you more

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
magically it's going to make you more
 

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,549
magically it's going to make you more
skilled at the technical aspects like I

8
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
skilled at the technical aspects like I
 

9
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,709
skilled at the technical aspects like I
guess you could lift that way right so

10
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
guess you could lift that way right so
 

11
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,790
guess you could lift that way right so
you you lift and then you get stronger

12
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:17,800
you you lift and then you get stronger
 

13
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,230
you you lift and then you get stronger
you just repeat the lift over and over

14
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
you just repeat the lift over and over
 

15
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,109
you just repeat the lift over and over
okay or you maintain strength but

16
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:22,119
okay or you maintain strength but
 

17
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:24,550
okay or you maintain strength but
technical skills not like that so you

18
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560
technical skills not like that so you
 

19
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,230
technical skills not like that so you
have a drill and the purpose of the

20
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
have a drill and the purpose of the
 

21
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,710
have a drill and the purpose of the
drill is that you can you you understand

22
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:29,720
drill is that you can you you understand
 

23
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,310
drill is that you can you you understand
that

24
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:31,320
that
 

25
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,229
that
I'm only as good as much as I'm doing

26
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:33,239
I'm only as good as much as I'm doing
 

27
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,229
I'm only as good as much as I'm doing
the drill like that's the bare minimum

28
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:35,239
the drill like that's the bare minimum
 

29
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:38,229
the drill like that's the bare minimum
okay so instead of doing this technique

30
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
okay so instead of doing this technique
 

31
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,069
okay so instead of doing this technique
and I go here and then he's there and

32
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:41,079
and I go here and then he's there and
 

33
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,790
and I go here and then he's there and
then I go WR and you start timing uh how

34
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
then I go WR and you start timing uh how
 

35
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,430
then I go WR and you start timing uh how
much I'm doing so we do one rep okay do

36
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
much I'm doing so we do one rep okay do
 

37
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,150
much I'm doing so we do one rep okay do
one rep boom boom boom okay that's the

38
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
one rep boom boom boom okay that's the
 

39
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,349
one rep boom boom boom okay that's the
one rep and now I set up again well all

40
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:55,359
one rep and now I set up again well all
 

41
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,910
one rep and now I set up again well all
this set up time is taken away from my

42
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
this set up time is taken away from my
 

43
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,630
this set up time is taken away from my
rep time got so we combine the the stuff

44
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:01,640
rep time got so we combine the the stuff
 

45
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,349
rep time got so we combine the the stuff
all right but it doesn't make it any

46
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
all right but it doesn't make it any
 

47
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,390
all right but it doesn't make it any
less a technical drill so as we get rid

48
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
less a technical drill so as we get rid
 

49
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,350
less a technical drill so as we get rid
of the setup time to increase the rep

50
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
of the setup time to increase the rep
 

51
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,109
of the setup time to increase the rep
count over time I still want to be as

52
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
count over time I still want to be as
 

53
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,590
count over time I still want to be as
technical as

54
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:14,600
technical as
 

55
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,910
technical as
possible just because I got rid of the

56
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:16,920
possible just because I got rid of the
 

57
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,250
possible just because I got rid of the
setup time I'm I don't start working

58
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:20,260
setup time I'm I don't start working
 

59
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,429
setup time I'm I don't start working
[Applause]

60
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:22,439
[Applause]
 

61
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,910
[Applause]
crap you get it all right so what am I

62
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
crap you get it all right so what am I
 

63
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,710
crap you get it all right so what am I
working on the same stuff I'm I'm always

64
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
working on the same stuff I'm I'm always
 

65
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,630
working on the same stuff I'm I'm always
working on so we want these weapons to

66
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:31,640
working on so we want these weapons to
 

67
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,870
working on so we want these weapons to
stick that's what makes them I weapons

68
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:33,880
stick that's what makes them I weapons
 

69
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,910
stick that's what makes them I weapons
so they have to stick how do they stick

70
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:36,920
so they have to stick how do they stick
 

71
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,670
so they have to stick how do they stick
they're going to rotate crosses that's

72
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:38,680
they're going to rotate crosses that's
 

73
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,670
they're going to rotate crosses that's
how they stick the yin and yang AIS are

74
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
how they stick the yin and yang AIS are
 

75
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,630
how they stick the yin and yang AIS are
are going to rotate around to prevent

76
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:43,640
are going to rotate around to prevent
 

77
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:58,590
are going to rotate around to prevent
the The Clash from happening

78
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:58,600

 

79
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,990

okay so so right here I rotate

80
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,000

 

81
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,149

around I

82
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:05,159
around I
 

83
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,630
around I
don't I don't come this way I don't go

84
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
don't I don't come this way I don't go
 

85
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,229
don't I don't come this way I don't go
that way the pressure that he has there

86
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
that way the pressure that he has there
 

87
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,710
that way the pressure that he has there
I yield to it and go around it boom

88
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
I yield to it and go around it boom
 

89
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,750
I yield to it and go around it boom
pressure there's no pressure here this

90
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:18,760
pressure there's no pressure here this
 

91
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,509
pressure there's no pressure here this
is where I draw back on

92
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:21,519
is where I draw back on
 

93
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,589
is where I draw back on
ATT

94
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
ATT
 

95
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,750
ATT
boom

96
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:28,760

 

97
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:47,830

around

98
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840

 

99
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:58,750

and it doesn't change on the

100
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:58,760

 

101
00:02:58,760 --> 00:04:12,630

sword

102
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640

 

103
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,150

so because I don't let him hit

104
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
so because I don't let him hit
 

105
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:28,590
so because I don't let him hit
me I see connection and

106
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600

 

107
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,629

around

108
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:33,639

 

109
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,590

same thing here he goes around I go

110
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:38,600
same thing here he goes around I go
 

111
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:58,550
same thing here he goes around I go
around come

112
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560

 

113
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,550

on

114
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560

 

115
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,310

not like this

116
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:11,320

 

117
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:21,550

go I'm

118
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:21,560

 

119
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:28,469

stu okay let's

120
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479

 

121
00:05:28,479 --> 00:06:03,309

go

122
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:03,319

 

123
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,110

so remember we're trying to make our way

124
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
so remember we're trying to make our way
 

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,510
so remember we're trying to make our way
we're trying to bridge our way to

126
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:06,520
we're trying to bridge our way to
 

127
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,830
we're trying to bridge our way to
application timing moving away from the

128
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:08,840
application timing moving away from the
 

129
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,749
application timing moving away from the
embryonic timing okay so I'm here I

130
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
embryonic timing okay so I'm here I
 

131
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,430
embryonic timing okay so I'm here I
don't want I don't have to do this

132
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
don't want I don't have to do this
 

133
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,870
don't want I don't have to do this
anymore in the drill okay I I what I

134
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:17,880
anymore in the drill okay I I what I
 

135
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,390
anymore in the drill okay I I what I
want to do instead is take the body

136
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
want to do instead is take the body
 

137
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,749
want to do instead is take the body
relationship of application

138
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
relationship of application
 

139
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,510
relationship of application
timing so as I go and he moves you see

140
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
timing so as I go and he moves you see
 

141
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,790
timing so as I go and he moves you see
how I move with him he moved I move with

142
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
how I move with him he moved I move with
 

143
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,710
how I move with him he moved I move with
him I'm not over here he goes and then I

144
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:33,720
him I'm not over here he goes and then I
 

145
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,469
him I'm not over here he goes and then I
move on the weapon the guy's flanking

146
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
move on the weapon the guy's flanking
 

147
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,150
move on the weapon the guy's flanking
you you need to keep the center line so

148
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
you you need to keep the center line so
 

149
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,309
you you need to keep the center line so
as I he goes I move you see that I do

150
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:43,319
as I he goes I move you see that I do
 

151
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,749
as I he goes I move you see that I do
that every time you see every time he

152
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
that every time you see every time he
 

153
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,629
that every time you see every time he
mov I've already started

154
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
mov I've already started
 

155
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,749
mov I've already started
moving so now look at my Center Line to

156
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
moving so now look at my Center Line to
 

157
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,830
moving so now look at my Center Line to
his Center Line and it stays the same

158
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
his Center Line and it stays the same
 

159
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,589
his Center Line and it stays the same
every

160
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:56,599

 

161
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:01,189

time but it so that you're not here

162
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
time but it so that you're not here
 

163
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,869
time but it so that you're not here
he goes and then he has to wait and then

164
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:03,879
he goes and then he has to wait and then
 

165
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,909
he goes and then he has to wait and then
I go that's just we're keeping that huge

166
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:06,919
I go that's just we're keeping that huge
 

167
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:09,790
I go that's just we're keeping that huge
stepping stone to the application time

168
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:09,800

okay um but because of the reset it's

186
