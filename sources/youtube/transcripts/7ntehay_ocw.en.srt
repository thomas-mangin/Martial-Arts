1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,270

so uh

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
so uh
 

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,710
so uh
there's no single aikido

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:08,720

 

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,509

regardless of

6
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519

 

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:21,510

herd mentalities and modern illusions

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520

 

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,269

where you have group over individuals

10
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
where you have group over individuals
 

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,509
where you have group over individuals
there's no single idea

12
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:29,519

 

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,750

regardless of that discourse we are

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:33,760
regardless of that discourse we are
 

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,830
regardless of that discourse we are
like the days of old where you didn't

16
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:35,840
like the days of old where you didn't
 

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,310
like the days of old where you didn't
study john

18
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
study john
 

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,030
study john
you went and studied with that master

20
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
you went and studied with that master
 

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,990
you went and studied with that master
you studied at

22
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
you studied at
 

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,270
you studied at
that mountain in that

24
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
that mountain in that
 

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,510
that mountain in that
temple with that master

26
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520

 

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,830

john is something for

28
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:56,840

 

29
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,790

academics

30
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
academics
 

31
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,830
academics
so there's no single aikido then there's

32
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
so there's no single aikido then there's
 

33
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,630
so there's no single aikido then there's
no single

34
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
no single
 

35
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,710
no single
ukemi and you can reverse

36
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
ukemi and you can reverse
 

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,429
ukemi and you can reverse
engineer by how uke

38
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439

 

39
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,550

what the moves are for naga

40
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
what the moves are for naga
 

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,510
what the moves are for naga
okay um

42
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520

 

43
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,190

we have a few people come out so

44
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200

 

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,990

and you're going to do a back break ball

46
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
and you're going to do a back break ball
 

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,950
and you're going to do a back break ball
looking this way

48
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
looking this way
 

49
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,870
looking this way
going back

50
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880

 

51
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:49,590

please look that way there you go

52
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600

 

53
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,630

there is a point where it goes forward

54
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
there is a point where it goes forward
 

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,469
there is a point where it goes forward
but then there's a point where it goes

56
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
but then there's a point where it goes
 

57
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,230
but then there's a point where it goes
backwards

58
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
backwards
 

59
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,980
backwards
forward

60
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:58,990

 

61
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:06,830

[Music]

62
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840

 

63
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,190

okay

64
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
okay
 

65
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,790
okay
same thing

66
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800

 

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,390

less do you think stay this way

68
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
less do you think stay this way
 

69
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,110
less do you think stay this way
and go back now i want you to make it go

70
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
and go back now i want you to make it go
 

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,990
and go back now i want you to make it go
back

72
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000

 

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,949

this is closer to the last example now i

74
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
this is closer to the last example now i
 

75
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,430
this is closer to the last example now i
want you to watch what happens

76
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
want you to watch what happens
 

77
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,270
want you to watch what happens
when she brings her center back

78
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
when she brings her center back
 

79
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,470
when she brings her center back
to her head what happens to her head

80
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
to her head what happens to her head
 

81
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,309
to her head what happens to her head
go the head comes forward

82
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
go the head comes forward
 

83
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,430
go the head comes forward
uh let's look at some extreme examples

84
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
uh let's look at some extreme examples
 

85
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,470
uh let's look at some extreme examples
so

86
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480

 

87
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,710

this is where i go here

88
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
this is where i go here
 

89
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,070
this is where i go here
sit down the head comes

90
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
sit down the head comes
 

91
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,910
sit down the head comes
way full every time the center goes back

92
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920
way full every time the center goes back
 

93
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,390
way full every time the center goes back
the head comes forward to lower myself

94
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
the head comes forward to lower myself
 

95
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:17,509
the head comes forward to lower myself
so i go

96
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519

 

97
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,190

by that design

98
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200

 

99
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,949

you would be able to tell that the nage

100
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
you would be able to tell that the nage
 

101
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,470
you would be able to tell that the nage
the nagiwaza does not expect the person

102
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480
the nagiwaza does not expect the person
 

103
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,030
the nagiwaza does not expect the person
to come forward

104
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
to come forward
 

105
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,190
to come forward
they expect the person to go backwards

106
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200

 

107
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,830

so can you do that last version

108
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840

 

109
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:58,309

yes

110
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319

 

111
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:06,229

you got to do the other

112
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239

 

113
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,429

if he tries to do that and i expecting

114
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
if he tries to do that and i expecting
 

115
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,309
if he tries to do that and i expecting
him to go

116
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
him to go
 

117
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,390
him to go
forward he comes forward

118
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
forward he comes forward
 

119
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,749
forward he comes forward
it's impossible you can't you can't do

120
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
it's impossible you can't you can't do
 

121
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,310
it's impossible you can't you can't do
it

122
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
it
 

123
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,390
it
so you know by default by how the uket

124
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
so you know by default by how the uket
 

125
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,909
so you know by default by how the uket
looks in their chemi what the assumption

126
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
looks in their chemi what the assumption
 

127
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,430
looks in their chemi what the assumption
is for naginwasa

128
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
is for naginwasa
 

129
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,870
is for naginwasa
okay there's another assumption

130
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
okay there's another assumption
 

131
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,990
okay there's another assumption
in that last version so

132
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
in that last version so
 

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,749
in that last version so
as he goes down

134
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759

 

135
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,830

he's going straight back his

136
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
he's going straight back his
 

137
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,390
he's going straight back his
head go is

138
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
head go is
 

139
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,590
head go is
on the line of attack the entire time

140
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
on the line of attack the entire time
 

141
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,430
on the line of attack the entire time
okay and the resolution is by him

142
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
okay and the resolution is by him
 

143
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,230
okay and the resolution is by him
staying ahead of the line of attack

144
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
staying ahead of the line of attack
 

145
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,870
staying ahead of the line of attack
that's

146
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
that's
 

147
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,710
that's
problematic if he was supposed to be

148
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
problematic if he was supposed to be
 

149
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,030
problematic if he was supposed to be
going forward he can't stay ahead of it

150
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
going forward he can't stay ahead of it
 

151
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,990
going forward he can't stay ahead of it
you see well if my assumption is that

152
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
you see well if my assumption is that
 

153
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,990
you see well if my assumption is that
i'm pushing him backwards then he'll he

154
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
i'm pushing him backwards then he'll he
 

155
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,749
i'm pushing him backwards then he'll he
can sort of stay ahead of it

156
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
can sort of stay ahead of it
 

157
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,909
can sort of stay ahead of it
it's kind of risky because if i

158
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
it's kind of risky because if i
 

159
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,510
it's kind of risky because if i
overpower him or over

160
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
overpower him or over
 

161
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,390
overpower him or over
accelerate him he's going to hit his

162
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
accelerate him he's going to hit his
 

163
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,029
accelerate him he's going to hit his
head

164
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
head
 

165
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,070
head
because it's on the line of attack okay

166
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
because it's on the line of attack okay
 

167
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,430
because it's on the line of attack okay
um but the assumption here from the

168
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
um but the assumption here from the
 

169
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,629
um but the assumption here from the
noggin was uh

170
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
noggin was uh
 

171
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,469
noggin was uh
let's do coquiho and you have to do that

172
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
let's do coquiho and you have to do that
 

173
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,990
let's do coquiho and you have to do that
other version okay

174
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
other version okay
 

175
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,670
other version okay
is that the throw is backwards

176
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
is that the throw is backwards
 

177
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,710
is that the throw is backwards
straight that the line is this way

178
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720

 

179
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,950

if the technique rotates

180
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
if the technique rotates
 

181
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,070
if the technique rotates
it's going to go this way and he trying

182
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
it's going to go this way and he trying
 

183
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,029
it's going to go this way and he trying
to do

184
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
to do
 

185
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,310
to do
that other one can't do the other one

186
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320

 

187
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,110

so there is this interdependency between

188
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
so there is this interdependency between
 

189
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,950
so there is this interdependency between
ukis architecture

190
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
ukis architecture
 

191
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,029
ukis architecture
and nagin's architecture and you can

192
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
and nagin's architecture and you can
 

193
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,710
and nagin's architecture and you can
reverse engineer the two

194
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
reverse engineer the two
 

195
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,390
reverse engineer the two
okay um

196
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
okay um
 

197
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,390
okay um
what we do is we have

198
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
what we do is we have
 

199
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,150
what we do is we have
when a person is going to take a new

200
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
when a person is going to take a new
 

201
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,469
when a person is going to take a new
kemi towards the rear

202
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
kemi towards the rear
 

203
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,309
kemi towards the rear
towards her back in a supine

204
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
towards her back in a supine
 

205
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,550
towards her back in a supine
position

206
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560

 

207
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,990

we expect them to be going forward

208
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
we expect them to be going forward
 

209
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,469
we expect them to be going forward
not backwards person that can go

210
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
not backwards person that can go
 

211
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,909
not backwards person that can go
backwards

212
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
backwards
 

213
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,510
backwards
is the person that can run out of the

214
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
is the person that can run out of the
 

215
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,950
is the person that can run out of the
technique so he's coming in

216
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
technique so he's coming in
 

217
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,350
technique so he's coming in
and i'm gonna make him go straight

218
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
and i'm gonna make him go straight
 

219
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,110
and i'm gonna make him go straight
backwards and instead of lowering

220
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
backwards and instead of lowering
 

221
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,790
backwards and instead of lowering
yourself

222
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
yourself
 

223
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,950
yourself
use my acceleration to just take it out

224
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
use my acceleration to just take it out
 

225
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,390
use my acceleration to just take it out
of the technique

226
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400

 

227
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,749

okay so and the reason that he's

228
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
okay so and the reason that he's
 

229
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,110
okay so and the reason that he's
able to do that is because his base of

230
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
able to do that is because his base of
 

231
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,870
able to do that is because his base of
support

232
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
support
 

233
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,469
support
is never itself being deconstructed

234
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
is never itself being deconstructed
 

235
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,230
is never itself being deconstructed
or addressed only his line of gravity

236
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
or addressed only his line of gravity
 

237
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,950
or addressed only his line of gravity
is being addressed okay so in other

238
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
is being addressed okay so in other
 

239
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,510
is being addressed okay so in other
words

240
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
words
 

241
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,029
words
if he leaves if he leaves his feet still

242
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
if he leaves if he leaves his feet still
 

243
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,350
if he leaves if he leaves his feet still
then i can accelerate his line of

244
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
then i can accelerate his line of
 

245
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,029
then i can accelerate his line of
gravity out

246
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
gravity out
 

247
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,350
gravity out
and get something like that going but

248
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
and get something like that going but
 

249
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,629
and get something like that going but
there was nothing

250
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
there was nothing
 

251
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,390
there was nothing
addressing his base of support

252
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
addressing his base of support
 

253
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,510
addressing his base of support
secondly we want to address the base of

254
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
secondly we want to address the base of
 

255
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,390
secondly we want to address the base of
support

256
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
support
 

257
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,629
support
not just the line of gravity so line of

258
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
not just the line of gravity so line of
 

259
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,309
not just the line of gravity so line of
gravity is going to go one way

260
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
gravity is going to go one way
 

261
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,230
gravity is going to go one way
and basal support is going to go the

262
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
and basal support is going to go the
 

263
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,350
and basal support is going to go the
other way

264
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
other way
 

265
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,150
other way
then you can't do that as we can

266
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
then you can't do that as we can
 

267
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,830
then you can't do that as we can
additionally

268
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
additionally
 

269
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,510
additionally
um when we come in

270
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520

 

271
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,990

i am uh not so much

272
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
i am uh not so much
 

273
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,990
i am uh not so much
at all interested in acceleration

274
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
at all interested in acceleration
 

275
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,430
at all interested in acceleration
okay if to accelerate something

276
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
okay if to accelerate something
 

277
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,350
okay if to accelerate something
i have to admit i have to be able to

278
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
i have to admit i have to be able to
 

279
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,430
i have to admit i have to be able to
press on it

280
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
press on it
 

281
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,950
press on it
we don't want to press on something like

282
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960
we don't want to press on something like
 

283
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,430
we don't want to press on something like
to press on something

284
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
to press on something
 

285
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,230
to press on something
and to have it function in my favor i

286
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
and to have it function in my favor i
 

287
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,749
and to have it function in my favor i
have to be stronger than it

288
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
have to be stronger than it
 

289
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,749
have to be stronger than it
and we don't want to do that okay so

290
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
and we don't want to do that okay so
 

291
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,430
and we don't want to do that okay so
we're not going to be acceleration

292
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
we're not going to be acceleration
 

293
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,629
we're not going to be acceleration
dependent

294
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
dependent
 

295
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,469
dependent
because i have to be stronger and

296
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
because i have to be stronger and
 

297
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,390
because i have to be stronger and
because he can out accelerate whatever

298
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
because he can out accelerate whatever
 

299
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,589
because he can out accelerate whatever
i'm accelerating

300
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
i'm accelerating
 

301
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,189
i'm accelerating
okay so we are uh going to

302
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
okay so we are uh going to
 

303
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,629
okay so we are uh going to
look at a more sound way

304
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
look at a more sound way
 

305
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,830
look at a more sound way
of creating a topsy-turvy effect which

306
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
of creating a topsy-turvy effect which
 

307
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,790
of creating a topsy-turvy effect which
we will define

308
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
we will define
 

309
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,550
we will define
by his head training

310
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
by his head training
 

311
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,150
by his head training
orientation with his feet right now

312
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
orientation with his feet right now
 

313
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,629
orientation with his feet right now
head is towards the ceiling and feet are

314
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
head is towards the ceiling and feet are
 

315
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,670
head is towards the ceiling and feet are
towards the floor

316
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680
towards the floor
 

317
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,510
towards the floor
and we're going to reverse that where

318
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
and we're going to reverse that where
 

319
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,670
and we're going to reverse that where
head is going towards the floor and feet

320
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
head is going towards the floor and feet
 

321
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,509
head is going towards the floor and feet
are just going towards the ceiling

322
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
are just going towards the ceiling
 

323
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,029
are just going towards the ceiling
topsy-turvy effect okay and the best way

324
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
topsy-turvy effect okay and the best way
 

325
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,389
topsy-turvy effect okay and the best way
to do that

326
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
to do that
 

327
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,990
to do that
is not to turn it straight over itself

328
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
is not to turn it straight over itself
 

329
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,110
is not to turn it straight over itself
because each side is offering resistance

330
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
because each side is offering resistance
 

331
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,470
because each side is offering resistance
to the other side making it very heavy

332
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
to the other side making it very heavy
 

333
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,509
to the other side making it very heavy
what we're going to do is tilt it we're

334
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
what we're going to do is tilt it we're
 

335
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,550
what we're going to do is tilt it we're
going to tilt it

336
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
going to tilt it
 

337
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,910
going to tilt it
you see and then each side starts to

338
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
you see and then each side starts to
 

339
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,230
you see and then each side starts to
assist the other side as it goes into

340
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
assist the other side as it goes into
 

341
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,269
assist the other side as it goes into
the topsy-turvy

342
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
the topsy-turvy
 

343
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,430
the topsy-turvy
bag so his body

344
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
bag so his body
 

345
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,350
bag so his body
can't come forward his head because

346
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
can't come forward his head because
 

347
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,509
can't come forward his head because
he's going to be going forward his

348
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
he's going to be going forward his
 

349
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,110
he's going to be going forward his
center can't go backwards

350
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
center can't go backwards
 

351
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,430
center can't go backwards
center's going to keep going forward and

352
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
center's going to keep going forward and
 

353
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,350
center's going to keep going forward and
he can't go straight back

354
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
he can't go straight back
 

355
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,790
he can't go straight back
because we're going to rotate him okay

356
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
because we're going to rotate him okay
 

357
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,470
because we're going to rotate him okay
so the ukemi we're going to see

358
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
so the ukemi we're going to see
 

359
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,710
so the ukemi we're going to see
is his head is going to come off the

360
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
is his head is going to come off the
 

361
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,670
is his head is going to come off the
line

362
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
line
 

363
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,990
line
okay so go ahead and do army kimmy his

364
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
okay so go ahead and do army kimmy his
 

365
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,110
okay so go ahead and do army kimmy his
center is going to stay

366
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
center is going to stay
 

367
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,829
center is going to stay
up and you're going to see his body

368
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:34,839
up and you're going to see his body
 

369
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,350
up and you're going to see his body
rotate

370
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
rotate
 

371
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,870
rotate
center boom stays there

372
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
center boom stays there
 

373
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,030
center boom stays there
and his body rotates okay and that way

374
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
and his body rotates okay and that way
 

375
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,750
and his body rotates okay and that way
uh you can see oh that's the shape of

376
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
uh you can see oh that's the shape of
 

377
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,470
uh you can see oh that's the shape of
the arc

378
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
the arc
 

379
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,750
the arc
of the nagawaza so coming in

380
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:51,760
of the nagawaza so coming in
 

381
00:09:51,760 --> 00:10:00,630
of the nagawaza so coming in
and

382
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640

 

383
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,110

okay so let's learn how we do this

384
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
okay so let's learn how we do this
 

385
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,550
okay so let's learn how we do this
i'll start at phase one it's down

386
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
i'll start at phase one it's down
 

387
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,230
i'll start at phase one it's down
and we're first going to learn the

388
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
and we're first going to learn the
 

389
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,670
and we're first going to learn the
pattern okay

390
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
pattern okay
 

391
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,910
pattern okay
so he'll have his left knee facing this

392
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
so he'll have his left knee facing this
 

393
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,949
so he'll have his left knee facing this
way

394
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
way
 

395
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,230
way
and his right knee is a right angle

396
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
and his right knee is a right angle
 

397
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,030
and his right knee is a right angle
the back leg is going to mark the

398
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
the back leg is going to mark the
 

399
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,670
the back leg is going to mark the
rolling

400
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
rolling
 

401
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,870
rolling
or the the chemi arm so

402
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
or the the chemi arm so
 

403
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,949
or the the chemi arm so
his head wants to go in this case

404
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
his head wants to go in this case
 

405
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,230
his head wants to go in this case
in the direction of the back leg so he

406
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
in the direction of the back leg so he
 

407
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,069
in the direction of the back leg so he
goes backwards and he sees this right

408
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
goes backwards and he sees this right
 

409
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,069
goes backwards and he sees this right
angle to the line of attack

410
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
angle to the line of attack
 

411
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:44,630
angle to the line of attack
okay i'll do it again

412
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640

 

413
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,550

then the next phase for beginners he

414
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
then the next phase for beginners he
 

415
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,389
then the next phase for beginners he
stands up

416
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
stands up
 

417
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,509
stands up
and he's going to drop to kiza so knees

418
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
and he's going to drop to kiza so knees
 

419
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,949
and he's going to drop to kiza so knees
aren't on the ground

420
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
aren't on the ground
 

421
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,509
aren't on the ground
and now he does the same angle again

422
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519

 

423
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,550

same thing feet are in position kiza

424
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
same thing feet are in position kiza
 

425
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,590
same thing feet are in position kiza
goes back and that angle gets his head

426
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
goes back and that angle gets his head
 

427
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,030
goes back and that angle gets his head
off the line okay but at this point

428
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
off the line okay but at this point
 

429
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,350
off the line okay but at this point
we're not working with the center

430
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
we're not working with the center
 

431
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,509
we're not working with the center
staying forward you see we're allowing

432
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
staying forward you see we're allowing
 

433
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,550
staying forward you see we're allowing
his center

434
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
his center
 

435
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,829
his center
go to stay there it didn't come forward

436
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
go to stay there it didn't come forward
 

437
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,590
go to stay there it didn't come forward
but it's not going back either

438
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
but it's not going back either
 

439
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,990
but it's not going back either
okay so that his head never comes

440
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
okay so that his head never comes
 

441
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,190
okay so that his head never comes
forward during the whole move

442
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
forward during the whole move
 

443
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,269
forward during the whole move
okay because the center never goes back

444
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
okay because the center never goes back
 

445
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,389
okay because the center never goes back
in the move

446
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
in the move
 

447
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,310
in the move
all right now we gotta work on getting

448
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320
all right now we gotta work on getting
 

449
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,829
all right now we gotta work on getting
the center

450
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
the center
 

451
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,269
the center
um to come up so we're gonna come out of

452
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
um to come up so we're gonna come out of
 

453
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,710
um to come up so we're gonna come out of
the stance

454
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
the stance
 

455
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,069
the stance
and he's in this kind of neutral stance

456
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
and he's in this kind of neutral stance
 

457
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,470
and he's in this kind of neutral stance
and he's going the first phase for this

458
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
and he's going the first phase for this
 

459
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,550
and he's going the first phase for this
one for standing is the center comes

460
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
one for standing is the center comes
 

461
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,670
one for standing is the center comes
forward and then this foot is going to

462
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
forward and then this foot is going to
 

463
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,150
forward and then this foot is going to
step

464
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
step
 

465
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,550
step
back into that right angle and he goes

466
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
back into that right angle and he goes
 

467
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,910
back into that right angle and he goes
that way you go

468
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
that way you go
 

469
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,670
that way you go
yep

470
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680

 

471
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,230

so center is coming forward because the

472
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
so center is coming forward because the
 

473
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,990
so center is coming forward because the
energy of the throw is going to require

474
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
energy of the throw is going to require
 

475
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,750
energy of the throw is going to require
coming forward

476
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
coming forward
 

477
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,829
coming forward
but we let a kind of little tuck at the

478
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839
but we let a kind of little tuck at the
 

479
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,670
but we let a kind of little tuck at the
end

480
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
end
 

481
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,350
end
okay but you want to keep it to a

482
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
okay but you want to keep it to a
 

483
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,350
okay but you want to keep it to a
minimum all right you don't want to

484
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,360
minimum all right you don't want to
 

485
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,509
minimum all right you don't want to
start sitting your butt down

486
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:09,519
start sitting your butt down
 

487
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,350
start sitting your butt down
so he steps back

488
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360

 

489
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,110

okay and then we have uh

490
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
okay and then we have uh
 

491
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,030
okay and then we have uh
the next phase where if you notice

492
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
the next phase where if you notice
 

493
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,829
the next phase where if you notice
we go down on the ball of the foot not

494
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:23,839
we go down on the ball of the foot not
 

495
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,750
we go down on the ball of the foot not
the instep of the foot

496
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
the instep of the foot
 

497
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,670
the instep of the foot
and that's because that's your bracing

498
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:28,680
and that's because that's your bracing
 

499
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,910
and that's because that's your bracing

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,990
engine for lowering yourself we don't
lower ourselves like this

504
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
lower ourselves like this
 

505
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,030
lower ourselves like this
which is why there's no sports like that

506
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
which is why there's no sports like that
 

507
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,030
which is why there's no sports like that
nobody plays like that there's no

508
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
nobody plays like that there's no
 

509
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,710
nobody plays like that there's no
fighting like that there's no

510
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
fighting like that there's no
 

511
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,150
fighting like that there's no
that is the route to a foot injury

512
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
that is the route to a foot injury
 

513
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,829
that is the route to a foot injury
okay why does no one get injured

514
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
okay why does no one get injured
 

515
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,230
okay why does no one get injured
they uh generally because no one's

516
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
they uh generally because no one's
 

517
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,670
they uh generally because no one's
actually throwing them

518
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:51,680
actually throwing them
 

519
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,710
actually throwing them
they get to lower themselves okay but he

520
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
they get to lower themselves okay but he
 

521
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,670
they get to lower themselves okay but he
needs to have

522
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
needs to have
 

523
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,550
needs to have
the way his foot works to lower and

524
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
the way his foot works to lower and
 

525
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,710
the way his foot works to lower and
reconcile the energy

526
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
reconcile the energy
 

527
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,230
reconcile the energy
so in this contracting center drill

528
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
so in this contracting center drill
 

529
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,949
so in this contracting center drill
he's going to go up and he's not going

530
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
he's going to go up and he's not going
 

531
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,430
he's going to go up and he's not going
to

532
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
to
 

533
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,230
to
uh bring this back at all and he's going

534
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
uh bring this back at all and he's going
 

535
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,509
uh bring this back at all and he's going
to land

536
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
to land
 

537
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,590
to land
on him the ball of his foot of his

538
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
on him the ball of his foot of his
 

539
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,829
on him the ball of his foot of his
choosing

540
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839

 

541
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,660

again

542
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:21,670

okay got that drill um that gets you

546
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
okay got that drill um that gets you
 

547
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,670
okay got that drill um that gets you
pretty close

548
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
pretty close
 

549
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,470
pretty close
to our architectures before you can do

00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480
to our architectures before you can do

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,670
to our architectures before you can do
that

that
 

553
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,350
that
we are not really throwing you we're

554
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
we are not really throwing you we're
 

555
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,680
we are not really throwing you we're
letting you practice the back breakfall

556
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:39,690
letting you practice the back breakfall

he goes

560
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320

 

561
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,990

there and then there's more advanced
 

565
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,509
there and then there's more advanced
versions of this because

566
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
versions of this because
 

567
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,590
versions of this because
we're not going to give him his foot

568
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
we're not going to give him his foot
 

569
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,750
we're not going to give him his foot
when we when we do the throw

570
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
when we when we do the throw
 

571
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,069
when we when we do the throw
you're going to see that he won't get

572
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
you're going to see that he won't get
 

573
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,030
you're going to see that he won't get
his foot

00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040
his foot
 

575
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,110
his foot
but his center contraction is what he

576
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
but his center contraction is what he
 

577
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,230
but his center contraction is what he
uses so

578
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
uses so
 

579
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,030
uses so
i'm going to take his foot away he

580
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
i'm going to take his foot away he
 

581
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,189
i'm going to take his foot away he
doesn't get his foot but the center part

582
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
doesn't get his foot but the center part
 

583
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,189
doesn't get his foot but the center part
and the upper body part is the same

and the upper body part is the same
 

585
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,870

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,069
contracting center drill
back find your back foot

590
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
back find your back foot
 

591
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,150
back find your back foot
okay gotta get there don't let it come

592
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
okay gotta get there don't let it come
 

593
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,910
okay gotta get there don't let it come
back don't let your head come forward

594
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
back don't let your head come forward
 

595
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,110
back don't let your head come forward
that's the problem

596
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
that's the problem
 

597
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,069
that's the problem
okay uh how to get up i'll do it

598
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
okay uh how to get up i'll do it
 

599
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,910
okay uh how to get up i'll do it
i'll do it okay so uh when we get up

600
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
i'll do it okay so uh when we get up
 

601
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,710
i'll do it okay so uh when we get up
let's

602
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
let's
 

603
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,750
let's
say we're doing the the first standing

604
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
say we're doing the the first standing
 

605
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,110
say we're doing the the first standing
one so i go down

606
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
one so i go down
 

607
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,590
one so i go down
and i come up i don't want to give my

608
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
and i come up i don't want to give my
 

609
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,189
and i come up i don't want to give my
back to the

610
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
back to the
 

611
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,949
back to the
knock i don't want to ever get in that

612
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
knock i don't want to ever get in that
 

613
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,710
knock i don't want to ever get in that
habit okay

614
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
habit okay
 

615
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,750
habit okay
so that's why we also don't do backwards

616
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
so that's why we also don't do backwards
 

617
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,269
so that's why we also don't do backwards
rolls you're going to give your back to

618
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
rolls you're going to give your back to
 

619
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,310
rolls you're going to give your back to
the noggin

620
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
the noggin
 

621
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,389
the noggin
but you can't do a backwards roll

622
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399
but you can't do a backwards roll
 

623
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,949
but you can't do a backwards roll
because anything to the supine

624
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
because anything to the supine
 

625
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,949
because anything to the supine
had you coming forward you can only do

626
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
had you coming forward you can only do
 

627
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,790
had you coming forward you can only do
the backwards roll if you're going that

628
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
the backwards roll if you're going that
 

629
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,189
the backwards roll if you're going that
way

630
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
way
 

631
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,670
way
okay so we don't do the backwards roll

632
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
okay so we don't do the backwards roll
 

633
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,269
okay so we don't do the backwards roll
um

634
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
um
 

635
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,910
um
if he's my person my noggin

636
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
if he's my person my noggin
 

637
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,710
if he's my person my noggin
i'm going to keep my eyes on him as i go

638
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
i'm going to keep my eyes on him as i go
 

639
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,590
i'm going to keep my eyes on him as i go
to do

640
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
to do
 

641
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,629
to do
the lowering one my eyes stay

642
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:14,639
the lowering one my eyes stay
 

643
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,030
the lowering one my eyes stay
on him and i'm out

644
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
on him and i'm out
 

645
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,350
on him and i'm out
so another drill you could do is add

646
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
so another drill you could do is add
 

647
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,590
so another drill you could do is add
some walking

648
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
some walking
 

649
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,350
some walking
step into the foot position go down into

650
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
step into the foot position go down into
 

651
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,990
step into the foot position go down into
keys though

652
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
keys though
 

653
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,910
keys though
eyes are on him

654
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920

 

655
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,430

on your eye okay um

656
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
on your eye okay um
 

657
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,949
on your eye okay um
let's all do those two so let's work

658
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
let's all do those two so let's work
 

659
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,430
let's all do those two so let's work
on the contracting center a drill for

660
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
on the contracting center a drill for
 

661
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,470
on the contracting center a drill for
the contracting

662
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
the contracting
 

663
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,310
the contracting
center so the last phase we did

664
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
center so the last phase we did
 

665
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,150
center so the last phase we did
is he is out and then he finds his back

666
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
is he is out and then he finds his back
 

667
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,590
is he is out and then he finds his back
but all that is up to him it's one thing

668
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
but all that is up to him it's one thing
 

669
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,590
but all that is up to him it's one thing
to have a contracting center and a

670
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:55,600
to have a contracting center and a
 

671
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,350
to have a contracting center and a
center that is alive

672
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
center that is alive
 

673
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,069
center that is alive
when you're in control what happens when

674
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:00,079
when you're in control what happens when
 

675
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:00,550
when you're in control what happens when
you're not

676
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
you're not
 

677
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,829
you're not
in control is you lose consciousness

678
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:03,839
in control is you lose consciousness
 

679
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,030
in control is you lose consciousness
the center goes weak soft dead

680
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
the center goes weak soft dead
 

681
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,749
the center goes weak soft dead
and it's no longer a contracting center

682
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
and it's no longer a contracting center
 

683
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,150
and it's no longer a contracting center
so

684
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
so
 

685
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,829
so
this drill is uh one we're

686
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
this drill is uh one we're
 

687
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,069

same drill there's going to be a bounce

768
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160
same drill there's going to be a bounce
 

769
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,630
same drill there's going to be a bounce
boom

770
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:22,640
boom
 

771
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:35,110
boom
out gets up locks his body

772
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120

 

773
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,150

so when he's getting up uh disconnect

774
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
so when he's getting up uh disconnect
 

775
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,190
so when he's getting up uh disconnect
your center together

776
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
your center together
 

777
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,470
your center together
like that you see his head

778
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
like that you see his head
 

779
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,310
like that you see his head
the engaged center creates a

780
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,320
the engaged center creates a
 

781
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,470
the engaged center creates a
relationship between his head and his

782
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
relationship between his head and his
 

783
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,029
relationship between his head and his
feet

784
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
feet
 

785
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,270
feet
so when his head lock your center when

786
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
so when his head lock your center when
 

787
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,710
so when his head lock your center when
his head goes back

788
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
his head goes back
 

789
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,590
his head goes back
no more than that as soon as your head

790
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,600
no more than that as soon as your head
 

791
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,470
no more than that as soon as your head
moves your feet should move

792
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,480
moves your feet should move
 

793
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,590
moves your feet should move
and the same thing vice versa should be

794
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
and the same thing vice versa should be
 

795
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,870
and the same thing vice versa should be
like that

796
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:04,880
like that
 

797
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,150
like that
become a small gap

798
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160

 

799
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,950

so that's what he's working on boom he

800
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
so that's what he's working on boom he
 

801
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,029
so that's what he's working on boom he
keeps that engagement

802
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
keeps that engagement
 

803
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,310
keeps that engagement
feet bring the head up up he comes

804
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
feet bring the head up up he comes
 

805
