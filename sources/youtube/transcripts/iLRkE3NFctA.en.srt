1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,390

all right so we're time couple or few

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,400
all right so we're time couple or few
 

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,990
all right so we're time couple or few
lessons together so I'm doing that same

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,000
lessons together so I'm doing that same
 

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,230
lessons together so I'm doing that same
thing okay when I move into him you'll

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:17,240
thing okay when I move into him you'll
 

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,189
thing okay when I move into him you'll
feel uh an increase in the

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:20,199
feel uh an increase in the
 

9
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,589
feel uh an increase in the
Y that might cause a flexion but as I

10
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
Y that might cause a flexion but as I
 

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,630
Y that might cause a flexion but as I
move into him I release that tension so

12
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640
move into him I release that tension so
 

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,830
move into him I release that tension so
there's no flection okay so keep that in

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
there's no flection okay so keep that in
 

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,510
there's no flection okay so keep that in
mind the same if you push this harder

16
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:34,520
mind the same if you push this harder
 

17
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,790
mind the same if you push this harder
there's an increase in the

18
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
there's an increase in the
 

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,190
there's an increase in the
Y and I maintain positional integrity

20
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
Y and I maintain positional integrity
 

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,630
Y and I maintain positional integrity
and I let go of any added tension that

22
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:43,640
and I let go of any added tension that
 

23
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,830
and I let go of any added tension that
that arose from that if I go towards him

24
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:46,840
that arose from that if I go towards him
 

25
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,709
that arose from that if I go towards him
there's an increase in the yangong and I

26
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
there's an increase in the yangong and I
 

27
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,910
there's an increase in the yangong and I
have to again practice the releasing to

28
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
have to again practice the releasing to
 

29
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,630
have to again practice the releasing to
move there so you might feel a tension

30
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
move there so you might feel a tension
 

31
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,389
move there so you might feel a tension
just let it go till it goes away

32
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
just let it go till it goes away
 

33
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,710
just let it go till it goes away
here do the first

34
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:03,720
here do the first
 

35
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,350
here do the first
drill go tension then move to hand and

36
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:08,360
drill go tension then move to hand and
 

37
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,510
drill go tension then move to hand and
let go of

38
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
let go of
 

39
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,749
let go of
tension I only move like an inch or two

40
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:12,759
tension I only move like an inch or two
 

41
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:14,590
tension I only move like an inch or two
and I let go of

42
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:14,600
and I let go of
 

43
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,390
and I let go of
tension but I still keep the elbow

44
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400
tension but I still keep the elbow
 

45
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,789
tension but I still keep the elbow
shoulder claw wi so I do the first Dr

46
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:21,799
shoulder claw wi so I do the first Dr
 

47
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,469
shoulder claw wi so I do the first Dr
Let It

48
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:23,479
Let It
 

49
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:26,749
Let It
Go move towards

50
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:26,759
Go move towards
 

51
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,710
Go move towards
him let go of any tension thats

52
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:31,720
him let go of any tension thats
 

53
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,149
him let go of any tension thats
okay

54
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159

 

55
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,710

that's so my my drill is that you're

56
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:39,720
that's so my my drill is that you're
 

57
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,630
that's so my my drill is that you're
going to create an environment where the

58
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:43,640
going to create an environment where the
 

59
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,469
going to create an environment where the
likelihood is that you're going to

60
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479
likelihood is that you're going to
 

61
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,510
likelihood is that you're going to
flex that is generated by tasking myself

62
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:50,520
flex that is generated by tasking myself
 

63
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,030
flex that is generated by tasking myself
with he's going to push and I'm going to

64
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
with he's going to push and I'm going to
 

65
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,789
with he's going to push and I'm going to
keep my hands Stu to get it and so it

66
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
keep my hands Stu to get it and so it
 

67
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,709
keep my hands Stu to get it and so it
when I feel that flexion I let go of it

68
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:01,719
when I feel that flexion I let go of it
 

69
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,310
when I feel that flexion I let go of it
always let go that's my only task let go

70
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:05,320
always let go that's my only task let go
 

71
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,029
always let go that's my only task let go
the flexion any flexion that

72
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:08,039
the flexion any flexion that
 

73
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,869
the flexion any flexion that
generates then I I'm going to increase

74
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:11,879
generates then I I'm going to increase
 

75
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,390
generates then I I'm going to increase
and as I increase I let go of the

76
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
and as I increase I let go of the
 

77
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,390
and as I increase I let go of the
tension any tension that

78
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,400
tension any tension that
 

79
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,509
tension any tension that
arises I

80
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:19,519
arises I
 

81
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:28,350
arises I
just then pic

82
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:28,360

 

83
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,430

tension any that

84
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440

 

85
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,830

arises in in truth that that's the drill

86
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:38,840
arises in in truth that that's the drill
 

87
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,869
arises in in truth that that's the drill
tension arises like all this would be

88
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
tension arises like all this would be
 

89
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,110
tension arises like all this would be
the only training I would do

90
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120

 

91
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,070

who

92
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,080
who
 

93
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,309
who
cool maybe hard to tell what the hell

94
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
cool maybe hard to tell what the hell
 

95
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,190
cool maybe hard to tell what the hell
that was so I here I will release I'll

96
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,200
that was so I here I will release I'll
 

97
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,309
that was so I here I will release I'll
amplify the problem release as I'm going

98
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
amplify the problem release as I'm going
 

99
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:28,509
amplify the problem release as I'm going
forward release release and I

100
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:28,519

 

101
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:39,309

just that's all our Dr okay let's try it

102
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:39,319

 

103
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,149

again I'm combine

104
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
again I'm combine
 

105
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,070
again I'm combine
the other drill so I'm

106
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,080
the other drill so I'm
 

107
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,470
the other drill so I'm
working on the tesak the inward spiral

108
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:51,480
working on the tesak the inward spiral
 

109
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,990
working on the tesak the inward spiral
and the outward

110
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,000
and the outward
 

111
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,990
and the outward
spiral inward

112
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,000
spiral inward
 

113
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,750

00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:01,879
spiral makes the heart two of
 

117
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,350
spiral makes the heart two of
them

118
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360

 

119
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,630

okay I still have my elbow shoulder

120
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
okay I still have my elbow shoulder
 

121
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,710
okay I still have my elbow shoulder
fall I'm going to

122
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720

 

123
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,110

increase the likelihood that you're

124
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
increase the likelihood that you're
 

125
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,749
increase the likelihood that you're
going to tend so the first one you're

126
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
going to tend so the first one you're
 

127
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:26,150
going to tend so the first one you're
going to do is disengage one

128
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160

 

129
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,590

do the inward spiral with the same
 

143
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,550
do the inward spiral with the same
releasing no tension in my body okay I

144

come back qu comes back shoulder elbow
 

147
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,749
come back qu comes back shoulder elbow
stays with it I start the other spiral

148
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:00,759
stays with it I start the other spiral
