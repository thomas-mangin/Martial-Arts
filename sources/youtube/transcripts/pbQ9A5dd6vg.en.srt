1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,390

okay so what what we're doing is uh

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400
okay so what what we're doing is uh
 

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,230
okay so what what we're doing is uh
we're tempting the mind

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
we're tempting the mind
 

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,509
we're tempting the mind
to stay in that first mind aspect in the

6
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
to stay in that first mind aspect in the
 

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,910
to stay in that first mind aspect in the
functioning of the ego tripartite

8
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
functioning of the ego tripartite
 

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,830
functioning of the ego tripartite
by generating uh the fear and triggering

10
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:17,840
by generating uh the fear and triggering
 

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,750
by generating uh the fear and triggering
the fear response and the world's power

12
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,760
the fear response and the world's power
 

13
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,790
the fear response and the world's power
reactivity

14
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
reactivity
 

15
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,029
reactivity
okay um and it doesn't take much to do

16
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:25,039
okay um and it doesn't take much to do
 

17
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,150
okay um and it doesn't take much to do
that to people

18
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
that to people
 

19
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,669
that to people
okay so you can keep this

20
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
okay so you can keep this
 

21
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,229
okay so you can keep this
in a normal let's say one person so a

22
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
in a normal let's say one person so a
 

23
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:32,950
in a normal let's say one person so a
normal g

24
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
normal g
 

25
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,470
normal g
was uh and uh we're just going

26
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480

 

27
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,950

in i'm not over here predicting ahead of

28
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
in i'm not over here predicting ahead of
 

29
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,590
in i'm not over here predicting ahead of
time

30
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
time
 

31
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,150
time
that's not what i'm doing as as he

32
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
that's not what i'm doing as as he
 

33
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,910
that's not what i'm doing as as he
triggers my mind

34
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:45,920
triggers my mind
 

35
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,910
triggers my mind
right here he triggered he triggered me

36
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
right here he triggered he triggered me
 

37
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,950
right here he triggered he triggered me
and got the will to power

38
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
and got the will to power
 

39
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,910
and got the will to power
and so in in that is where i do my

40
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:53,920
and so in in that is where i do my
 

41
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,830
and so in in that is where i do my
release

42
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
release
 

43
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,229
release
and find the technique

44
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239

 

45
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,710

okay something different would be

46
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
okay something different would be
 

47
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,870
okay something different would be
me predicting ahead of time and you're

48
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
me predicting ahead of time and you're
 

49
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,630
me predicting ahead of time and you're
just taking advantage of knowing what's

50
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
just taking advantage of knowing what's
 

51
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,510
just taking advantage of knowing what's
coming in

52
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
coming in
 

53
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,670
coming in
if this technique is so simple that this

54
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680
if this technique is so simple that this
 

55
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,630
if this technique is so simple that this
g was this

56
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,640
g was this
 

57
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,190
g was this
environment is so simple that you have

58
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
environment is so simple that you have
 

59
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,230
environment is so simple that you have
to

60
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
to
 

61
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,270
to
not predict you have to release

62
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
not predict you have to release
 

63
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,830
not predict you have to release
and then secondly um you're never

64
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
and then secondly um you're never
 

65
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,830
and then secondly um you're never
muscling you're never muscling

66
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
muscling you're never muscling
 

67
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,070
muscling you're never muscling
okay but some don't realize that they

68
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
okay but some don't realize that they
 

69
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,469
okay but some don't realize that they
don't

70
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
don't
 

71
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,910
don't
they don't see that so we add a second

72
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
they don't see that so we add a second
 

73
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,270
they don't see that so we add a second
guy

74
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
guy
 

75
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,390
guy
and that would be enough to amplify and

76
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
and that would be enough to amplify and
 

77
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,590
and that would be enough to amplify and
make visible

78
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
make visible
 

79
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,910
make visible
so i'm going and you see i'm stuck on

80
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:39,920
so i'm going and you see i'm stuck on
 

81
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,950
so i'm going and you see i'm stuck on
him

82
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
him
 

83
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,069
him
you see as i pick my technique

84
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
you see as i pick my technique
 

85
00:01:44,079 --> 00:02:06,830
you see as i pick my technique
the mind has to find the uh

86
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840

 

87
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:20,830

so

88
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840

 

89
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,990

so

90
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000

 

91
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,350

so you see i never lose the other guy

92
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
so you see i never lose the other guy
 

93
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,270
so you see i never lose the other guy
my mind is constantly releasing

94
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
my mind is constantly releasing
 

95
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,710
my mind is constantly releasing
okay let's try it the mine's on andrew

96
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
okay let's try it the mine's on andrew
 

97
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,750
okay let's try it the mine's on andrew
and you lost strength

98
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760

 

99
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:59,030

so don't wait you need to wait

100
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040

 

101
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,110

okay so uh

102
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120

 

103
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,390

[Music]

104
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
[Music]
 

105
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,830
[Music]
so she goes and she's counting

106
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
so she goes and she's counting
 

107
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:26,470
so she goes and she's counting
come on

108
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480

 

109
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,990

this is that practice where um

110
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
this is that practice where um
 

111
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,229
this is that practice where um
they don't get to decide you get it

112
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
they don't get to decide you get it
 

113
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,390
they don't get to decide you get it
um so you're

114
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
um so you're
 

115
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,149
um so you're
you were tasked with getting him

116
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
you were tasked with getting him
 

117
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,149
you were tasked with getting him
so we see his triggerability

118
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
so we see his triggerability
 

119
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,869
so we see his triggerability
but you tasked yourself with defending

120
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
but you tasked yourself with defending
 

121
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,229
but you tasked yourself with defending
yourself

122
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
yourself
 

123
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,070
yourself
okay so

124
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
okay so
 

125
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,630
okay so
but you can make that part of your

126
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
but you can make that part of your
 

127
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,750
but you can make that part of your
training

128
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
training
 

129
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,429
training
because you make everything work

130
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
because you make everything work
 

131
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,470
because you make everything work
okay without it getting

132
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
okay without it getting
 

133
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,309
okay without it getting
it okay got it but

134
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
it okay got it but
 

135
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,509
it okay got it but
he will get better and you will not

136
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
he will get better and you will not
 

137
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,789
he will get better and you will not
okay all right try it again

138
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
okay all right try it again
 

139
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,830
okay all right try it again
so in the gu you're you're coming and

140
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
so in the gu you're you're coming and
 

141
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,030
so in the gu you're you're coming and
you're trying to do

142
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
you're trying to do
 

143
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,390
you're trying to do
the uh nugget but when the person is

144
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
the uh nugget but when the person is
 

145
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,670
the uh nugget but when the person is
countering you

146
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
countering you
 

147
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,189
countering you
and you you lose you fail okay or

148
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
and you you lose you fail okay or
 

149
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,990
and you you lose you fail okay or
when we have the two attackers and

150
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
when we have the two attackers and
 

151
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,950
when we have the two attackers and
you're over here

152
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
you're over here
 

153
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,390
you're over here
and you're trying to muscle them you get

154
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
and you're trying to muscle them you get
 

155
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,629
and you're trying to muscle them you get
pinned and when you get pinned you get

156
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
pinned and when you get pinned you get
 

157
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,629
pinned and when you get pinned you get
delayed and the second attacker catches

158
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
delayed and the second attacker catches
 

159
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,469
delayed and the second attacker catches
captaincy

160
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
captaincy
 

161
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,790
captaincy
okay so we're going to go into that

162
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
okay so we're going to go into that
 

163
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,070
okay so we're going to go into that
technique a little bit

164
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
technique a little bit
 

165
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,990
technique a little bit
and so let's just look at poke hole

166
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000

 

167
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,110

and uh what's actually happening okay

168
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
and uh what's actually happening okay
 

169
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,830
and uh what's actually happening okay
so if he if i'm here

170
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
so if he if i'm here
 

171
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,270
so if he if i'm here
and i leverage him up

172
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
and i leverage him up
 

173
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,430
and i leverage him up
and then try to throw him

174
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440

 

175
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,469

we do that technique like this this

176
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
we do that technique like this this

we do that technique like this this
is now i have been pinned

178
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
is now i have been pinned
 

179
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,990
is now i have been pinned
second guy is going to catch me

180
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000

 

181
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,390

what we want to do instead is not have

182
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
what we want to do instead is not have
 

183
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,909
what we want to do instead is not have
two young arms

184
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919

 

185
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,710

but one yin arm okay

186
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720

 

187
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,909

so i keep his energy going on one side

188
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
so i keep his energy going on one side
 

189
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,150
so i keep his energy going on one side
that's what starts to tilt

190
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
that's what starts to tilt
 

191
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,270
that's what starts to tilt
if you look here he's just square and

so a lot of times when they're allowed

194
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
so a lot of times when they're allowed
 

195
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,310
so a lot of times when they're allowed
to counter

196
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
to counter
 

197
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,710
to counter
because his posture is not compromised

198
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
because his posture is not compromised
 

199
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,070
because his posture is not compromised
and he counters he can

200
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
and he counters he can
 

201
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,870
and he counters he can
he can do it especially when he lets go

202
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
he can do it especially when he lets go
 

203
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,230
he can do it especially when he lets go
double leg

204

double leg
 

205
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,909

oh then i'm in trouble

206
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919

 

207
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,430

so i'll show you what i mean okay uh
 

227
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,670

you can let go and he's not

00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
you can let go and he's not
 

229
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,350

he i have the adhesion okay
 

233
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,909
he i have the adhesion okay
so it's not a passive i'm here and i get

234
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
so it's not a passive i'm here and i get
 

235
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,870

but if i don't have his body he can do

246
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
but if i don't have his body he can do
 

247
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,830

move on the way he does whatever he
 

251
00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:00,150

479
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,870
okay so right away and now all i got to
do with that hand

480
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
do with that hand
 

481
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,750
do with that hand
is continue to take him into the shape

482
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
is continue to take him into the shape
 

483
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,710
is continue to take him into the shape
of the front

484
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
of the front
 

485
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,150
of the front
inward kazushi so don't

486
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
inward kazushi so don't
 

487
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,310
inward kazushi so don't
do don't leave it up here because i did

488
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
do don't leave it up here because i did
 

489
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,230
do don't leave it up here because i did
have the adhesion but i didn't keep the

490
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
have the adhesion but i didn't keep the
 

491
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,590
have the adhesion but i didn't keep the
tilt going

492
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
tilt going
 

493
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,949
tilt going
so tilt tilt tilt tilt tilt down

494
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
so tilt tilt tilt tilt tilt down
 

495
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,310
so tilt tilt tilt tilt tilt down

fully aware that the lower his head
 

497
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,790
fully aware that the lower his head
gets the easier it is for the hip to

498
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
gets the easier it is for the hip to
 

499
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,069
gets the easier it is for the hip to

make that
 

513
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,710
make that
uh left hip take that geometry from

514
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
uh left hip take that geometry from
 

515
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,509
uh left hip take that geometry from
falling

516
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
falling
 

517
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,750
falling
so i'm going i'm going to lower it

518
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
so i'm going i'm going to lower it
 

519
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,870
so i'm going i'm going to lower it
to get his head low

520
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
to get his head low
 

521
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,110
to get his head low
lower it to get his head up

522
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120

 

523
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,790

boom lower it to get his head down

524
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
boom lower it to get his head down
 

525
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,629
boom lower it to get his head down
and low

526
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639

 

527
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,350

okay now this is where you'll return to

528
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,360
okay now this is where you'll return to
 

529
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,590
okay now this is where you'll return to
your external stuff all right and again

530
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
your external stuff all right and again
 

531
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,430
your external stuff all right and again
the guy's going to counter you or slow

532
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
the guy's going to counter you or slow
 

533
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,990
the guy's going to counter you or slow
you down enough to the second uk gets

534
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
you down enough to the second uk gets
 

535
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,310
you down enough to the second uk gets
you

536
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
you
 

537
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,389
you
right um or you just won't have the

538
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
right um or you just won't have the
 

539
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,430
right um or you just won't have the
mechanics for for doing the technique so

540
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,440
mechanics for for doing the technique so
 

541
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,150
mechanics for for doing the technique so
when you're over here and you're going

542
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
when you're over here and you're going
 

543
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,110
when you're over here and you're going
like this

544
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
like this
 

545
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,710
like this
this is all just leverage

546
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
this is all just leverage
 

547
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,230
this is all just leverage
right and so you could he could change

548
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
right and so you could he could change
 

549
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,509
right and so you could he could change
let's say i'm in the position right if i

550
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
let's say i'm in the position right if i
 

551
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,110
let's say i'm in the position right if i
go over here like this there's no

552
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,120
go over here like this there's no
 

553
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,710
go over here like this there's no
controlling him so this is where the

554
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
controlling him so this is where the
 

555
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,990
controlling him so this is where the
counter you can get

556
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
counter you can get
 

557
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,550
counter you can get
something else okay so here i already

558
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
something else okay so here i already
 

559
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,910
something else okay so here i already
have control so

560
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
have control so
 

561
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,509
have control so
we're going to show that i have control

562
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:23,519
we're going to show that i have control
 

563
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,110
we're going to show that i have control
that he will

564
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
that he will
 

565
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,590
that he will
give him different angles so uh let's

566
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
give him different angles so uh let's
 

567
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,110
give him different angles so uh let's
say he wants to come forward

568
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120
say he wants to come forward
 

569
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,990
say he wants to come forward
before i want to you can and what you're

570
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
before i want to you can and what you're
 

571
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,910
before i want to you can and what you're
going to see when i say he can't

572
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:33,920
going to see when i say he can't
 

573
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,150
going to see when i say he can't
is it shifts his line of gravity and he

574
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
is it shifts his line of gravity and he
 

575
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,910
is it shifts his line of gravity and he
has to move his base of support

576
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
has to move his base of support
 

577
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,629
has to move his base of support
okay so uh in other words if he uh

578
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
okay so uh in other words if he uh
 

579
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,790
okay so uh in other words if he uh
tries to pull back it's not that i'm

580
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
tries to pull back it's not that i'm
 

581
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,750
tries to pull back it's not that i'm
over here

582
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:45,760
over here
 

583
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,670
over here
it's that when i have the adhesion it

584
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:47,680
it's that when i have the adhesion it
 

585
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,949
it's that when i have the adhesion it
tries to pull back it

586
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
tries to pull back it
 

587
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,150
tries to pull back it
affects his line of gravity okay so as

588
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
affects his line of gravity okay so as
 

589
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,150
affects his line of gravity okay so as
i'm going you're gonna see that i don't

590
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,160
i'm going you're gonna see that i don't
 

591
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,430
i'm going you're gonna see that i don't
ever get

592
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
ever get
 

593
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,550
ever get
on to the other side and now make this a

594
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
on to the other side and now make this a
 

595
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:58,949
on to the other side and now make this a
push

596
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
push
 

597
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,389
push
move it's it's all an adhesion

598
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
move it's it's all an adhesion
 

599
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,150
move it's it's all an adhesion
okay so let's let's have him uh

600
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
okay so let's let's have him uh
 

601
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,350
okay so let's let's have him uh
lift up against the adhesion

602
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,360

 

603
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,870

uh and we're going let's let's have him

604
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
uh and we're going let's let's have him
 

605
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,509
uh and we're going let's let's have him
uh

606
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
uh
 

607
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,470
uh
try to bring his foot this foot forward

608
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
try to bring his foot this foot forward
 

609
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:18,790
try to bring his foot this foot forward
yeah

610
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
yeah
 

611
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,389
yeah
to get your face back under you do it

612
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
to get your face back under you do it
 

613
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,069
to get your face back under you do it
again there you go okay i'll do the

614
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
again there you go okay i'll do the
 

615
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:22,949
again there you go okay i'll do the
adhesion

616
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959
adhesion
 

617
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,150
adhesion
just take some more into it

618
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
just take some more into it
 

619
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,750
just take some more into it
so you have to watch the difference that

620
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:27,760
so you have to watch the difference that
 

621
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,030
so you have to watch the difference that
you're not over here and you're going

622
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
you're not over here and you're going
 

623
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,629
you're not over here and you're going
like that

624
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:30,639
like that
 

625
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,389
like that
that will just go and it looks like it

626
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
that will just go and it looks like it
 

627
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,910
that will just go and it looks like it
looks like it's going to work but it

628
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
looks like it's going to work but it
 

629
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,110
looks like it's going to work but it
doesn't

630
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
doesn't
 

631
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,310
doesn't
as you as you've noticed okay so instead

632
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
as you as you've noticed okay so instead
 

633
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,790
as you as you've noticed okay so instead
it's here you have the adhesion

634
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
it's here you have the adhesion
 

635
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,629
it's here you have the adhesion
and you're just using that adhesion on

636
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
and you're just using that adhesion on
 

637
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:52,829
and you're just using that adhesion on
that hat wall

638
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:52,839

 

639
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,829

adhesion

640
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:57,839

 

641
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:05,910

okay let's go okay

642
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920

 

643
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,430

so as i as i do this technique

644
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
so as i as i do this technique
 

645
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,430
so as i as i do this technique
i i don't want to get on this side and

646
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
i i don't want to get on this side and
 

647
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,829
i i don't want to get on this side and
then push this down

648
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
then push this down
 

649
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,870
then push this down
it's going to be a leverage move

650
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
it's going to be a leverage move
 

651
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,269
it's going to be a leverage move
so this this hand's got the connection

652
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
so this this hand's got the connection
 

653
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,230
so this this hand's got the connection
let's show it by you resisting this

654
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
let's show it by you resisting this
 

655
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,990
let's show it by you resisting this
hand's got the connection

656
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
hand's got the connection
 

657
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,829
hand's got the connection
and what i'm going to do is you can see

658
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
and what i'm going to do is you can see
 

659
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,509
and what i'm going to do is you can see
that i'm making his mask move towards me

660
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
that i'm making his mask move towards me
 

661
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,790
that i'm making his mask move towards me
and it's going to hit the cue so

662
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
and it's going to hit the cue so
 

663
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,829
and it's going to hit the cue so
he's going to come in again and i have

664
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
he's going to come in again and i have
 

665
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,829
he's going to come in again and i have
the adhesion on this hand

666
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
the adhesion on this hand
 

667
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,189
the adhesion on this hand
and i'm going to manipulate him so

668
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
and i'm going to manipulate him so
 

669
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,269
and i'm going to manipulate him so
boom he hits this hand

670
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279

 

671
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,790

so again the eye adhesion

672
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
so again the eye adhesion
 

673
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,949
so again the eye adhesion
we'll do the one below will you get on

674
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
we'll do the one below will you get on
 

675
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,310
we'll do the one below will you get on
okay so

676
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
okay so
 

677
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,389
okay so
uh i have the adhesion go a little
