then I was taking his balance like that

166
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:49,830
then I was taking his balance like that
 

167
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,100
then I was taking his balance like that
same way that I thought I wasn't going

168

projection you understand okay you have
 

177
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:17,100
projection you understand okay you have
to find the center rule so let's look at

178
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,110
to find the center rule so let's look at
 

179
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,380
to find the center rule so let's look at
this a little bit you you're tending to

180
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:19,390
this a little bit you you're tending to
 

181
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,410
this a little bit you you're tending to
be here if that all lines for the target
