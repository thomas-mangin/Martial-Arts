so first learn form

164
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:13,620

 

165
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,050

non-form okay

168
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:17,220
non-form okay
 

169
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,890
non-form okay
but usually they'll say break the form

170
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:20,900
but usually they'll say break the form
 

171
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,270
but usually they'll say break the form
it's because the literal translation

172
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
it's because the literal translation
 

173
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,249
it's because the literal translation
would be break the form hold the form

174
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:25,259
would be break the form hold the form
 

175
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,950
would be break the form hold the form
break the form okay but if you're

176
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:27,960
break the form okay but if you're
 

177
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,689
break the form okay but if you're
intentionally breaking the form you're

178

operating at the spiritual component
 

385
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,610
operating at the spiritual component
this is the energetic component

386
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:37,620
this is the energetic component
 

387
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,710
this is the energetic component
but you know

it's also your physical component okay
so these things are happening

so these things are happening
 

407
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,670
so these things are happening

420
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:25,800

 

421
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,490

not it's not it's not also aikido's
 

431
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,889
not it's not it's not also aikido's
version of sparring you see

432
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:42,899
version of sparring you see
 

433
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:48,769
version of sparring you see
it's a technology of self of this nature

434
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:48,779

 

435
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,250

likewise it's not trying to do Aikido

436

likewise it's not trying to do Aikido
nagewaza because that's this stuck on

438
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
nagewaza because that's this stuck on
 

439
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,610
nagewaza because that's this stuck on
this do you see it's in a way is trying

440
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:58,620
this do you see it's in a way is trying
 

441
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,590
this do you see it's in a way is trying
to transcend form

442
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:00,600
to transcend form
 

443
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,630
to transcend form
is trying to transcend the opposition

444
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:02,640

between form and non-form okay

446
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
between form and non-form okay
 

447
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,269
between form and non-form okay
so hence it would be a problem

448
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:08,279
so hence it would be a problem
 

449
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,449
so hence it would be a problem

did we see a technique that's never done
 

463

just because of the mathematical

466
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:35,820
just because of the mathematical

doing it long enough we should see a
 

473
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,150
doing it long enough we should see a
