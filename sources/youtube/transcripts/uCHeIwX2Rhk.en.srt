00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,590
this way do it this way
but in aikido i'm gonna say the reason

34
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
but in aikido i'm gonna say the reason
 

35
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,790
but in aikido i'm gonna say the reason
why

36
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
why
 

37
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,910
why
i was told about it and it it made sense

38
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
i was told about it and it it made sense
 

39
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,990
i was told about it and it it made sense
to me when i was

40
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
to me when i was
 

41
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,470
to me when i was
reasonably young so i changed it i've

42
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
reasonably young so i changed it i've
 

43
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,270
reasonably young so i changed it i've
never gone back so

44
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
never gone back so
 

45
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,189
never gone back so
they put it on the front they they have

46
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
they put it on the front they they have
 

47
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:01,990
they put it on the front they they have
it

48
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
it
 

49
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,830
it
equal

50
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
equal
 

51
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,310
equal
equal distance

52
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
equal distance
 

53
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,310
equal distance
put it on the

54
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
put it on the
 

55
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:19,670
put it on the
front of the body

56
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680

 

57
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,950

would cross it over and do a normal

58
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960

 

59
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,870

a normal

60
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
a normal
 

61
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,749
a normal
notch

62
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
notch
 

63
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,910
notch
and

64
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920

 

65
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,590

the idea is for the

66
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
the idea is for the
 

67
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,270
the idea is for the
the tabs to

68
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
the tabs to
 

69
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,109
the tabs to
point down

70
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
point down
 

71
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,670
point down
it's not very good example is it there

72
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
it's not very good example is it there
 

73
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,830
it's not very good example is it there
we go

74
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
we go
 

75
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,069
we go
but for the tabs to

76
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079

 

77
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,429

went down

78
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
went down
 

79
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,749
went down
okay

80
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759

 

81
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,990

so that's uh that's the normal way that

82
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
so that's uh that's the normal way that
 

83
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,030
so that's uh that's the normal way that
you'll find 99 of the people what i want

84
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
you'll find 99 of the people what i want
 

85
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,190
you'll find 99 of the people what i want
to do is i want to show you at the back

86
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
to do is i want to show you at the back
 

87
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,389
to do is i want to show you at the back

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,230
now i'm not
done this purposely

90
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240
done this purposely
 

91
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,429
done this purposely
can you see where it crosses over here

92
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
can you see where it crosses over here
 

93
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,830
can you see where it crosses over here
okay where it crosses over

94
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840
okay where it crosses over
 

95
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,990
okay where it crosses over
well what happens

96
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
well what happens
 

97
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,710
well what happens
is in aikido

98
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720

most people will study backward ukemi

102
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
most people will study backward ukemi
 

103
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,190

unless you study back with your kemi you
 

105

belt may get a little bit ruffled like

108
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
belt may get a little bit ruffled like
 

109
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,550
belt may get a little bit ruffled like
this

110
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
this
 

111
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,110
this
and you may be able to see that it's now

112
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
and you may be able to see that it's now
 

113
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,509
and you may be able to see that it's now
starting to deform a little bit

114
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:31,519

 

115
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,390

okay

116
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
okay
 

117
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,830
okay
and of course i'm doing it with my hands

118
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
and of course i'm doing it with my hands
 

119
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,270
and of course i'm doing it with my hands
but i'm

120
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
but i'm
 

121
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,830

00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
by rolling backwards and forwards the
 

123
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,470
by rolling backwards and forwards the
belt can do this automatically

124
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
belt can do this automatically
 

125
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,869
belt can do this automatically
on your back

126
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
on your back
 

127
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,229

00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
so
 

129
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,790
so
i had my belt this way

130
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
i had my belt this way
 

131
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,350
i had my belt this way
and

132
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360

 

133
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,509

i went on a seminar and the teacher said

134
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
i went on a seminar and the teacher said
 

135
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,430
i went on a seminar and the teacher said
to me

136
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
to me
 

137
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,550
to me
would you keep rolling on a stone year

138
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
would you keep rolling on a stone year
 

139
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,149
would you keep rolling on a stone year
after year

140
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
after year
 

141
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,390
after year
and i looked a little bit strange and

142
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
and i looked a little bit strange and
 

143
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,149
and i looked a little bit strange and
thought what do you mean he said well if

144
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
thought what do you mean he said well if
 

145
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,229
thought what do you mean he said well if
you keep your belt like that as the two

146
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
you keep your belt like that as the two
 

147
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,190
you keep your belt like that as the two
cross over each other

148
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
cross over each other
 

149
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,229
cross over each other
in the end it forms a hard piece

150
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
in the end it forms a hard piece
 

151
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,229
in the end it forms a hard piece
and you perhaps won't know but in years

152
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
and you perhaps won't know but in years
 

153
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,350
and you perhaps won't know but in years
to come if you suffer from

154
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
to come if you suffer from
 

155
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,869
to come if you suffer from
back pain

156
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
back pain
 

157
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,790
back pain
you might not know you'll just think

158
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
you might not know you'll just think
 

159
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,630
you might not know you'll just think
perhaps it's a something because you're

160
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
perhaps it's a something because you're
 

161
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,869
perhaps it's a something because you're
getting older but it may be because

162
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
getting older but it may be because
 

163
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,110
getting older but it may be because
you're about you've been rolling on this

164
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
you're about you've been rolling on this
 

165
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,550
you're about you've been rolling on this
it's not

166
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
it's not
 

167
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,110
it's not
that's become harder and harder

168
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
that's become harder and harder
 

169
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,350
that's become harder and harder
and when you take the belt off of course

170
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
and when you take the belt off of course
 

171
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,949
and when you take the belt off of course
it's always

172
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
it's always
 

173
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,949
it's always
it's always flat

174
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
it's always flat
 

175
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,229
it's always flat
and um so you wouldn't know that it's
