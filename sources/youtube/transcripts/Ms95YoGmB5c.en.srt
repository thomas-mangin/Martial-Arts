00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,910
pretty cool pulling that arm okay
the reason why that's happening is

22
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
the reason why that's happening is
 

23
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,370
the reason why that's happening is
you're throwing him under you

24
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:34,380
you're throwing him under you
 

25
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,889
you're throwing him under you
you do not throw the person under you

26
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:36,899
you do not throw the person under you
 

27
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,470
you do not throw the person under you
you never throw them under you okay

28
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:39,480
you never throw them under you okay
 

29
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,110
you never throw them under you okay
unless you want to but then you should

30
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,120
unless you want to but then you should
 

31
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,709
unless you want to but then you should
follow up with a Stomp or something like

32
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:45,719
follow up with a Stomp or something like
 

33
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,490
follow up with a Stomp or something like
that okay but nagit was that always

34
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:49,500
that okay but nagit was that always
 

35
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,229
that okay but nagit was that always
projects now you waza projects okay and

36
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
projects now you waza projects okay and
 

37
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,049
projects now you waza projects okay and
so what's happening is is you are

38
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:57,059
so what's happening is is you are
 

39
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,410
so what's happening is is you are
generating the kazushi part

40
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:00,420
generating the kazushi part
 

41
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,570
generating the kazushi part
and then doing this throw

42
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:04,580
and then doing this throw
 

43
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,289
and then doing this throw
you must project so when you project

44
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:08,299
you must project so when you project
 

45
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:11,990
you must project so when you project
boom you must project okay it doesn't

46
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
boom you must project okay it doesn't
 

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,450

107
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:16,210

okay let's try it

108
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:16,220

 

109
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,830

remember
and if you're doing this thing

112
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:21,620
and if you're doing this thing
 

113
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,869
and if you're doing this thing
is going that way

114
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,879
is going that way
 

115
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,830
is going that way
I didn't get project him okay when when

116
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
I didn't get project him okay when when
 

117
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,580
I didn't get project him okay when when
I go here

118
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:28,590
I go here
 

119
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,830
I go here
[Music]

120
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
[Music]
 

121
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,210
[Music]
he's walking that way

122
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:32,220
he's walking that way
 

123
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,030
he's walking that way
got it so you don't go here he has

124
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
got it so you don't go here he has
 

125
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,850
got it so you don't go here he has
balance and then you're doing what you

126
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:37,860
balance and then you're doing what you
 

127
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,229
balance and then you're doing what you
think is projection

128
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:39,239
think is projection
 

129
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,930
think is projection
he has to fall that way okay

130
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:41,940
he has to fall that way okay
 

131
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,410
he has to fall that way okay
then maybe from this angle

132
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:45,420
then maybe from this angle
 

133
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,509
then maybe from this angle
this arm

134
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
this arm
 

135
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,729
this arm
is going to do kotagash with his head

136
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:52,739
is going to do kotagash with his head
 

137
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,990
is going to do kotagash with his head
so if I have put the gas here

138
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
so if I have put the gas here
 

139
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,630
so if I have put the gas here
this arm is going to go that way

140
00:03:59,630 --> 00:03:59,640
this arm is going to go that way
 

141
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,789
this arm is going to go that way
that way back around this way

142
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799

 

143
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,550

you can do it with someone's head this

144
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:07,560
you can do it with someone's head this
 

145
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,890
you can do it with someone's head this
way this way

146
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:09,900
way this way
 

147
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,710
way this way
now you do it with one arm

148
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
now you do it with one arm
 

149
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,050
now you do it with one arm
so you can sphere

150
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,060
so you can sphere
 

151
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,090
so you can sphere
this is gonna go this way this way

152
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,100

 

153
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,550

it's just very very tiny

154
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
it's just very very tiny
 

155
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,290
it's just very very tiny
but it's not

156
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:24,300
but it's not
 

157
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,570
but it's not
is this

158
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:26,580
is this
 

159
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,110
is this
that's not it you're going to on this

160
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,120
that's not it you're going to on this
 

161
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,010
that's not it you're going to on this
end

162
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,020
end
 

163
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,469
end
you're going to adhere

164
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:33,479
you're going to adhere
 

165
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:39,950
you're going to adhere
and here to here and a little circle in

166
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:39,960

 

167
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,469

but he's already following that way that

168
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
but he's already following that way that
 

169
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,030
but he's already following that way that
just helps

170
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,040
just helps
 

171
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:52,189
just helps
so whoo wow

172
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:52,199
