1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,982
Sensei, thank you for your time today.

2
00:00:01,982 --> 00:00:03,982
Thank you for having me.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,438
Sensei, how did you first learn about Daito-ryu?

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:18,338
When I was a high school student, I studied Chinese martial arts and Yagyu Shingan-ryu.

5
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:27,230
That master had also studied Daito-ryu under Yamamoto Kakuyoshi Sensei.

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,840
So, I learned a little bit of Daito-ryu as well from him.

7
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:43,684
At that time, one of my acquaintances told me about an interesting form of jujutsu and he introduced me.

8
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:48,191
So I went to see a class and this is how it began.

9
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:57,461
The place we visited was a dojo of Horikawa sensei’s Daito-ryu Aiki Jujutsu. 

10
00:00:57,461 --> 00:01:04,131
It was a student of Horikawa sensei who was teaching.

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:17,435
Since I was already doing Daito-ryu Jujutsu I wanted to try the class and the teacher let me grab his wrist.

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:27,424
And then, when I grabbed his hands, I got thrown.

13
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:34,097
The way how he threw me was very different compared to the Jujutsu I had trained. 

14
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:52,689
The difference was that Jujutsu is mainly to lock the joints and throw, however, as I grabbed him I was thrown suddenly.

15
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:55,760
It was a very unusual feeling, 

16
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,500
nothing like any technique I have experienced since then. 

17
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,841
I was very surprised.

18
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:11,391
At that moment, I realized for the first time that such techniques exist in the world.

19
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:24,874
I wanted to become able to these techniques and enrolled in the dojo in July 1988. 

20
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:31,834
That's how I joined Horikawa sensei’s Daito-ryu line.

21
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:37,528
Have you encountered any particular difficulty during your study of Daito-ryu?

22
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,520
It would be too much to say struggle, 

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,720
but at the point when I had been training in Daito-ryu for 21 years,

24
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,930
in 2004

25
00:02:51,930 --> 00:03:00,206
My sempai, who was teaching in Tokyo decided to become independent. 

26
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:06,700
So it happened that the Tokyo dojo was left to me.

27
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:17,316
I found myself in a position where I had to teach others. 

28
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,840
I felt the necessity to relearn the basics one more time.

29
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:35,990
I visited the home of Shimbo Tasuo Shihan in Sapporo, who is a Menkyo Kaiden Shihan of the Horikawa line.

30
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,670
I asked him if he would teach me.

31
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:50,473
In the beginning, he trained me together with three of his student from Sapporo.

32
00:03:50,680 --> 00:04:04,720
I insisted to learn one-to-one and eventually he started to teach me privately.

33
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:14,936
He is a Menkyo Kaiden Shihan of Horikawa sensei and he started to give me private lessons.

34
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:27,114
On the first day, when I tried to apply a technique to Shimbo sensei, it didn’t work at all.
 

35
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,186
"Who did you learn from?" he asked. 
 

36
00:04:32,186 --> 00:04:34,186
"It’s totally wrong." he scolded me. 

37
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:40,252
I still remember the shock.

38
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:48,180
I remember being shocked by the sound,

39
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:56,360
At the same time, receiving his techniques I did not doubt that his skill is real.

40
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:08,620
That was the moment I decided to throw away everything I had learned and restart from the basics.

41
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,169
And since that time, I was receiving his private lessons.

42
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:18,568
Receiving private teaching must have been a valuable experience.

43
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,450
Yes it has.

44
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:26,919
Could you tell us more about what and how you learned from Shimbo sensei?

45
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:34,234
The training with Shimbo Shihan is one to one.

46
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:46,563
First, I learned Shimbo Shihan’s technique. For example, I grab both of his wrists and he applies a technique to me.

47
00:05:46,786 --> 00:05:57,475
Then, I apply the same technique to Shimbo Shihan.

48
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:00,825
However, it was very difficult, right?

49
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:17,101
We would practice the same technique over and over until Shimbo Shihan said "fine" as signal that my technique was good enough.

50
00:06:17,198 --> 00:06:28,307
When I was learning Aiki techniques from Shimbo Shihan the techniques looked very simple.

51
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:36,169
However the simpler it looks the more difficult it is.

52
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:46,843
I was challenged to figure out the fundamental mechanism of Aiki.

53
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:55,370
Shimbo sensei would throw me and then I would throw him. 

54
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,338
When I could do the techniques it felt like being in Heaven. 

55
00:06:58,338 --> 00:07:00,338
When I couldn't do it it was like Hell.

56
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:12,250
While going back and forth from Hell to Heaven, I learned the techniques little by little.

57
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:23,180
In our training, I received teaching from the basic to the secret techniques, as well as weapon techniques.

58
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,540
Shimbo Shihan taught me all the techniques.

59
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:47,071
His private lessons lasted from 2005 to 2018. Approximately 12 years.

60
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:54,574
We stopped the training due to Shimbo Shihan’s illness.

61
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:03,322
In June of 2018, I was invited to Shimbo Shihan’s home. 

62
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:15,081
As proof that he taught me all his knowledge he awarded me Menkyo Kaiden and pointed me as his successor.

63
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:27,513
From ancient times, Menkyo Kaiden is something that is given from master to student.

64
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:38,183
It is different from the dan system of recent years, that is given by an organization.

65
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:29,908
I heard you got independent and created a new association last year. Could you tell us more about your new association?

66
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:39,490
It’s called Daito-ryu Aikijujutsu Koshinkai. 

67
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:52,371
Referring to that we transmit Horikawa Kodo sensei’s techniques and spirit sincerely, I choose the name Koshinkai.

68
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:58,918
About Aiki, it takes a lot of time to require this skill.

69
00:10:58,918 --> 00:11:02,717
My teaching style is to teach thoroughly so the Aiki techniques can be learned quickly.

70
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:15,472
Along the training process, together with the dan certificates, we give copies of scrolls transmitted from Takeda Sokaku sensei to Horikawa Kodo sensei.

71
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:20,780
Please tell us about the technical system.

72
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,728
Yes

73
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:27,764
Aiki is a way of using the body and it takes time to learn.

74
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,306
First, we teach the basic training method of how to develop Aiki.

75
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:36,555
Next, we train how to remove the grasp of the partner. It’s called ”Hazushite”.

76
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:39,359
Then come to the Jujutsu techniques. 

77
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:45,030
The Jujutsu techniques are structured to serve as a base for the Aiki techniques.

78
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:50,365
After that, we focus on the Aiki techniques.

79
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:56,134
First the jujutsu techniques change into Aiki techniques.

80
00:11:56,134 --> 00:12:03,194
Then, at a higher level, practitioners learn how to apply Aiki through weapons.

81
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:05,662
This is very difficult.

82
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:18,233
In general, Aiki-age is famous. However, in the Horikawa line, we learn many types of Aiki.

83
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:28,460
Then, at a higher level, practitioners learn how to apply Aiki through weapons.

84
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:41,294
I would like the next generation to take over these techniques taught by Horikawa sensei to Shimbo sensei.

85
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:47,601
I’m very afraid that these techniques would get lost.

86
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:54,076
Next time, please tell us about the history and techniques of Horikawa sensei.

87
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:56,048
Thank you very much for today.

88
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:58,050
Thank you.
