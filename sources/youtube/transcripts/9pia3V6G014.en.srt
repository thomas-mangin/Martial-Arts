00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:23,799
she did do that and at the end she
 

163
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:26,270
she did do that and at the end she
touted all her expertise in firearm

164
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,280
touted all her expertise in firearm
 

165
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,390
touted all her expertise in firearm
training to that one moment okay uh so

166
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:29,400
training to that one moment okay uh so
 

167
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,229
training to that one moment okay uh so
there's no not any way there's a way

168
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
there's no not any way there's a way
 

169
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,710
there's no not any way there's a way
that's the way you do it so when we look

170
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
that's the way you do it so when we look
 

171
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,910
that's the way you do it so when we look
at your

172
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
at your
 

173
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,190
at your
EO it violates a lot of the rules of

174
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
EO it violates a lot of the rules of
 

175
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,869
EO it violates a lot of the rules of
anatomical positioning so anatomical

176
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:41,879
anatomical positioning so anatomical
 

177
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,070
anatomical positioning so anatomical
positioning is a pre-application a

you and then you're coming around this
 

197
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,670
you and then you're coming around this

they
 

203
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,310
they
want your feet stay in

204
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:23,320
want your feet stay in
 

205
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,749
want your feet stay in
place you move

206
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
place you move
 

207
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,950
place you move
him around you

208
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:29,960
him around you
 

209
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,150
him around you
you move him back towards

210
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
you move him back towards
 

211
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,710
you move him back towards
you then into the

212
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:35,720
you then into the
 

213
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,029
you then into the
technique

214
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:38,039
technique
 

215
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,830
technique
okay it doesn't change if we go a little

216
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
okay it doesn't change if we go a little
 

217
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,270
okay it doesn't change if we go a little
quicker nothing

218
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280

 

219
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,110

changes

220
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
changes
 

221
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,150
changes
okay um I just want to look at that one

222
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
okay um I just want to look at that one
 

223
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,629
okay um I just want to look at that one
part so let's look at the anatomical

224
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:55,639
part so let's look at the anatomical
 

225
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,909
part so let's look at the anatomical
positioning that we want to achieve with

226
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:58,919
positioning that we want to achieve with
 

227
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,070
positioning that we want to achieve with
the initial test ofak okay what we want

228
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,080
the initial test ofak okay what we want
 

229
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,469
the initial test ofak okay what we want
is him to enter into the front inward

230
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
is him to enter into the front inward
 

231
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,670
is him to enter into the front inward

kazushi
 

233
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,870
kazushi
pattern here that's what we want to

234
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
pattern here that's what we want to
 

235
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,230
pattern here that's what we want to
generate and eventually we want to be

236
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
generate and eventually we want to be
 

237
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,629
generate and eventually we want to be
able to stand in here for the EO

238
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
able to stand in here for the EO
 

239
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,590
able to stand in here for the EO
technique for the

240
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:20,600
technique for the
 

241
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,270
technique for the
adashi okay so I have to move in a way

242
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
adashi okay so I have to move in a way
 

243
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,150
adashi okay so I have to move in a way
that gets him if he's in katate stay

244
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,160
that gets him if he's in katate stay
 

245
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,830
that gets him if he's in katate stay
there please

246
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840

 

247
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,350

to have his other foot come

248
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:34,360
to have his other foot come
 

249
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,029
to have his other foot come
forward and to have his body Teeter into

250
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:38,039
forward and to have his body Teeter into
 

251
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,029
forward and to have his body Teeter into
this

252
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
this
 

253
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,830
this
shape

254
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:40,840
shape
 

255
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,990
shape
okay so my anatomical positioning should

256
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
okay so my anatomical positioning should
 

257
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,070
okay so my anatomical positioning should
not do anything that is not conducive

258
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
not do anything that is not conducive
 

259
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,590
not do anything that is not conducive
towards that end

260
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:48,600
towards that end
 

261
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,430
towards that end
okay

262
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:50,440
okay
 

263
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:57,350
okay
so when I make him go around like

264
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360

 

265
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,430

this the other foot

266
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:00,440
this the other foot
 

267
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,990
this the other foot
foot

268
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
foot
 

269
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,589
foot
is not ever going to become so

270
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:05,599
is not ever going to become so
 

271
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:09,870
is not ever going to become so
heavy that this foot becomes light you

272
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:09,880
heavy that this foot becomes light you
 

273
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,430
heavy that this foot becomes light you
just you would just make him walk

274
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
just you would just make him walk
 

275
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,909
just you would just make him walk
exactly like he is do you see then we're

276
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
exactly like he is do you see then we're
 

277
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,350
exactly like he is do you see then we're
here so we're

278
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
here so we're
 

279
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,309
here so we're
here now if

280
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
here now if
 

281
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,230
here now if
I take whatever tension is here and I

282
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,240
I take whatever tension is here and I
 

283
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,430
I take whatever tension is here and I
move it back this way eventually the

284
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:26,440
move it back this way eventually the
 

285
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,029
move it back this way eventually the
shoulder turns back towards me when I

286
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
shoulder turns back towards me when I
 

287
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,670
shoulder turns back towards me when I
needed this shoulder to be over here and

288
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:32,680
needed this shoulder to be over here and
 

289
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,430
needed this shoulder to be over here and
I needed him to be like this so if you

290
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
I needed him to be like this so if you
 

291
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,830
I needed him to be like this so if you
watch your video slowly on slow motion

292
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:38,840
watch your video slowly on slow motion
 

293
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,270
watch your video slowly on slow motion
you'll see that your UK always turn back

294
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
you'll see that your UK always turn back
 

295
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,390
you'll see that your UK always turn back
towards you and then go like

296
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
towards you and then go like
 

297
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,230
towards you and then go like
that

298
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
that
 

299
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,150
that
okay so let's look

300
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:51,160
okay so let's look
 

301
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,150
okay so let's look
at how we don't have him turn back

302
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
at how we don't have him turn back
 

303
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,589
at how we don't have him turn back
towards me and how we get him in that

304
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
towards me and how we get him in that
 

305
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,670
towards me and how we get him in that
your to position okay so first let's

306
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:02,680
your to position okay so first let's
 

307
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,589
your to position okay so first let's
deal with the second one cuz it's the

308
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:04,599
deal with the second one cuz it's the
 

309
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:07,270
deal with the second one cuz it's the
easiest he comes

310
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
easiest he comes
 

311
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,189
easiest he comes
around all

312
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
around all
 

313
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,070
around all
right if

314
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,080
right if
 

315
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,350
right if
you in any

316
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
you in any
 

317
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,110
you in any
way pull on this

318
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,120
way pull on this
 

319
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,749
way pull on this
shoulder then he's going to turn toward

320
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
shoulder then he's going to turn toward
 

321
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,629
shoulder then he's going to turn toward
you so if you pull on this arm in any

322
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:25,639
you so if you pull on this arm in any
 

323
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,189
you so if you pull on this arm in any
way eventually he turns towards you

324
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199

 

325
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,790

so we don't the the the arm is going to

326
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
so we don't the the the arm is going to
 

327
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,309
so we don't the the the arm is going to
tell you how much you can manipulated at

328
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
tell you how much you can manipulated at
 

329
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,390
tell you how much you can manipulated at
the

330
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:39,400
the
 

331
