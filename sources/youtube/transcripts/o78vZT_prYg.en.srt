00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
and we're going to go for more of a high
 

363
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,350
and we're going to go for more of a high
a high mount on this

364
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
a high mount on this
 

365
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,949
a high mount on this
okay so my arms are up here his arms are

up here
 

369
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,550
up here
so strategy again and the residual

370
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
so strategy again and the residual
 

371
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,589
so strategy again and the residual
inertia

372
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
inertia
 

373
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,509
inertia
his hands stay back there he didn't push

374
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519

gonna be better up coming up on the

384
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
gonna be better up coming up on the
 

385
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,870
gonna be better up coming up on the
up on this high mount here okay and get

386
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
up on this high mount here okay and get
 

387
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,230
up on this high mount here okay and get
his arms

388
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
his arms
 

389
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,710
his arms
in this position if you can't get all

390
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
in this position if you can't get all
 

391
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,269
in this position if you can't get all
the way

392
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
the way
 

393
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,070
the way
just scoop his arms up and then you'll

394
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
just scoop his arms up and then you'll
 

395
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,750
just scoop his arms up and then you'll
be in this high mount here

396
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
be in this high mount here
 

397
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:11,670
be in this high mount here
okay all right let's try it

398
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680

 

399
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,110

okay when i go to punch

400
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
okay when i go to punch
 

401
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,990
okay when i go to punch
i don't punch like this i want to leave

402
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
i don't punch like this i want to leave
 

403
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,509
i don't punch like this i want to leave
with the knuckles

404
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
with the knuckles
 

405
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,870
with the knuckles
so this one boom

406
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
so this one boom
 

407
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,590
so this one boom
and my weight stays down so there's

408
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
and my weight stays down so there's
 

409
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,110
and my weight stays down so there's
still weight on your face right

410
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
still weight on your face right
 

411
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,590
still weight on your face right
okay this is where i'm punching now now

412
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
okay this is where i'm punching now now
 

413
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,630
okay this is where i'm punching now now
the arm came up

414
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
the arm came up
 

415
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,910
the arm came up
so i worry about the other arm

416
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
so i worry about the other arm
 

417
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,310
so i worry about the other arm
in here

418
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320

 

419
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,430

so we land boom he didn't do the

420
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
so we land boom he didn't do the
 

421
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,350
so we land boom he didn't do the
instinctual thing of getting weight

422
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
instinctual thing of getting weight
 

423
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,150
instinctual thing of getting weight
so i'm concerned bob get his hand up and

424
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
so i'm concerned bob get his hand up and
 

425
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,630
so i'm concerned bob get his hand up and
i seek to get the other hand up high

426
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
i seek to get the other hand up high
 

427
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,470
i seek to get the other hand up high
and then i'm in this position okay

428
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
and then i'm in this position okay
 

429
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,630
and then i'm in this position okay
try it again punch the right way and

430
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
try it again punch the right way and
 

431
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,389
try it again punch the right way and
leave weight on the head when you punch

432
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
leave weight on the head when you punch
 

433
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,710
leave weight on the head when you punch
go and it's there you have to you have

434
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720
go and it's there you have to you have
 

435
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,829
go and it's there you have to you have
to learn uh

436
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
to learn uh
 

437
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,870
to learn uh
strategy and tactics okay

438
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
strategy and tactics okay
 

439
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,509
strategy and tactics okay
so you can't just have an obscure move

440
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
so you can't just have an obscure move
 

441
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,230
so you can't just have an obscure move
so that's

442
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
so that's
 

443
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,710
so that's
we're giving you some context here of

444
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
we're giving you some context here of
 

445
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,470
we're giving you some context here of
course drill the tactic

446
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
course drill the tactic
 

447
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,190
course drill the tactic
but try to understand the context so

448
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
but try to understand the context so
 

449
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,990
but try to understand the context so
that's why

450
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
that's why
 

451
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,630
that's why
uke has a prescribed role because uk is

452
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
uke has a prescribed role because uk is
 

453
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,550
uke has a prescribed role because uk is
setting up the context

454
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
setting up the context
 

455
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,630
setting up the context
which is where you learn the strategy

456
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
which is where you learn the strategy
 

457
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,910
which is where you learn the strategy
okay so

458
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
okay so
 

459
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,470
okay so
i understand when i when i extend the

460
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
i understand when i when i extend the
 

461
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,269
i understand when i when i extend the
spiral

462
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
spiral
 

463
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,230
spiral
you can extend it back so learn how to

464
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
you can extend it back so learn how to
 

465
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,710
you can extend it back so learn how to
to disseminate the residual inertia of

466
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
to disseminate the residual inertia of
 

467
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,710
to disseminate the residual inertia of
the first throw okay

468
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
the first throw okay
 

469
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,350
the first throw okay
put weight on them see if you get that

470
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
put weight on them see if you get that
 

471
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,389
put weight on them see if you get that
instinct

472
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
instinct
 

473
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,710
instinct
to get that weight off of them and then

474
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
to get that weight off of them and then
 

475
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,110
to get that weight off of them and then
use that to tire them

476
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
use that to tire them
 

477
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,430
use that to tire them
be cognizant of the dude that's not

478
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
be cognizant of the dude that's not
 

479
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,670
be cognizant of the dude that's not
instinctually pushing up

480
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
instinctually pushing up
 

481
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,310
instinctually pushing up
that person is either unconscious hit

482
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
that person is either unconscious hit
 

483
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,990
that person is either unconscious hit
their head on the throw

484
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,000
their head on the throw
 

485
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,190
their head on the throw
