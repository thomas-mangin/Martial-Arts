1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,550

okay so what I was saying is that

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:04,560
okay so what I was saying is that
 

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,230
okay so what I was saying is that
technique looks like

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,240
technique looks like
 

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,150
technique looks like
something but as you start to dig

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:09,160
something but as you start to dig
 

7
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,789
something but as you start to dig
deeper it's not that and in fact now I

8
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:12,799
deeper it's not that and in fact now I
 

9
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,910
deeper it's not that and in fact now I
can see it doesn't at all look like what

10
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920
can see it doesn't at all look like what
 

11
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,870
can see it doesn't at all look like what
I thought it looked like okay so that's

12
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:17,880
I thought it looked like okay so that's
 

13
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,310
I thought it looked like okay so that's
how that ego tripartite mind is going to

14
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
how that ego tripartite mind is going to
 

15
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,509
how that ego tripartite mind is going to
interpret reality so it interpreted your

16
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:24,519
interpret reality so it interpreted your
 

17
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,189
interpret reality so it interpreted your
variations were all XY counter

18
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:28,199
variations were all XY counter
 

19
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,390
variations were all XY counter
opposition do you see and then you moved

20
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:31,400
opposition do you see and then you moved
 

21
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,350
opposition do you see and then you moved
like that you understood like that and

22
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
like that you understood like that and
 

23
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,549
like that you understood like that and
this is something totally different like

24
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:35,559
this is something totally different like
 

25
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:37,990
this is something totally different like
even like why would you enter on a

26
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000
even like why would you enter on a
 

27
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,910
even like why would you enter on a
straight

28
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:38,920
straight
 

29
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,389
straight
line you know when you go under the arm

30
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:41,399
line you know when you go under the arm
 

31
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,310
line you know when you go under the arm
like why are you entering on the on a

32
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,320
like why are you entering on the on a
 

33
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,950
like why are you entering on the on a
126 line I shouldn't have been on a 126

34
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:45,960
126 line I shouldn't have been on a 126
 

35
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,150
126 line I shouldn't have been on a 126
line this thing's going to keep rotating

36
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:49,160
line this thing's going to keep rotating
 

37
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,150
line this thing's going to keep rotating
so I should enter at a right angle to

38
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
so I should enter at a right angle to
 

39
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,110
so I should enter at a right angle to
the

40
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,120
the
 

41
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,229
the
path that UK is on at the moment I enter

42
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
path that UK is on at the moment I enter
 

43
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,549
path that UK is on at the moment I enter
because they're going to keep coming

44
00:00:59,549 --> 00:00:59,559
because they're going to keep coming
 

45
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,750
because they're going to keep coming
around do you see that and so now I'm

46
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
around do you see that and so now I'm
 

47
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,149
around do you see that and so now I'm
where you want to be in your imagine

48
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
where you want to be in your imagine
 

49
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,870
where you want to be in your imagine
variation of this technique

50
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:09,880
variation of this technique
 

51
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,429
variation of this technique
okay everything is like that

52
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
okay everything is like that
 

53
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,789
okay everything is like that
that's what happens that's what I mean

54
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:15,799
that's what happens that's what I mean
 

55
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,429
that's what happens that's what I mean
when I say that ego tripartite mind is

56
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:18,439
when I say that ego tripartite mind is
 

57
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,350
when I say that ego tripartite mind is
going to

58
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
going to
 

59
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,149
going to
assert everything it will do it to

60
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:23,159
assert everything it will do it to
 

61
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,710
assert everything it will do it to
everything

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:25,720
everything
 

63
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,350
everything
okay um even like for example I know you

64
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
okay um even like for example I know you
 

65
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,749
okay um even like for example I know you
get here and you're you're struggling

66
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
get here and you're you're struggling
 

67
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,109
get here and you're you're struggling
emotionally I can't I can feel it I come

68
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:34,119
emotionally I can't I can feel it I come
 

69
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:35,990
emotionally I can't I can feel it I come
in here and you're

70
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
in here and you're
 

71
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,950
in here and you're
like I could make you cry in an

72
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
like I could make you cry in an
 

73
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,749
like I could make you cry in an
instant

74
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
instant
 

75
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,270
instant
okay you're not you're again whatever

76
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
okay you're not you're again whatever
 

77
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,789
okay you're not you're again whatever
you think the disciplines are you can

78
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:47,799
you think the disciplines are you can
 

79
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,389
you think the disciplines are you can
reverse engineer

80
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:49,399
reverse engineer
 

81
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,950
reverse engineer
it if you're feeling like

82
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:51,960
it if you're feeling like
 

83
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,030
it if you're feeling like
that and you're doing them then what

84
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
that and you're doing them then what
 

85
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,029
that and you're doing them then what
you're doing is not what they

86
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:57,039
you're doing is not what they
 

87
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,109
you're doing is not what they
are okay

88
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:00,119
are okay
 

89
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,910
are okay
just like this technique you're stopping

90
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:02,920
just like this technique you're stopping
 

91
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,469
just like this technique you're stopping
the UK you're on a

92
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:05,479
the UK you're on a
 

93
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:07,749
the UK you're on a
126 grid you're you're on an

94
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
126 grid you're you're on an
 

95
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,389
126 grid you're you're on an
oppositional line of attack like that

96
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
oppositional line of attack like that
 

97
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,869
oppositional line of attack like that
doesn't make sense that can't be right

98
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:13,879
doesn't make sense that can't be right
 

99
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,070
doesn't make sense that can't be right
that can't be

100
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,080
that can't be
 

101
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,309
that can't be
iida okay so the same way if I if I'm at

102
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:19,319
iida okay so the same way if I if I'm at
 

103
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,509
iida okay so the same way if I if I'm at
an emotional state come

104
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:23,519

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:29,480
disciplines or if I think I am they've
 

109
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,949

been ered by the ego tripartite mind I'm

110
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:31,959
been ered by the ego tripartite mind I'm
 

111
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,509

way which too much ego tripartite mind
 

137
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,750
way which too much ego tripartite mind
and the ego tripartite mind is feminine
