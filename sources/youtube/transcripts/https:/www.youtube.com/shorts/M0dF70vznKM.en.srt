all that energy is going down I don't

00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:12,280
all that energy is going down I don't
 

9
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,390
all that energy is going down I don't
need a

10
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:13,400
need a
 

11
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,310
need a
base energy just like I I can do it on

12
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:16,320
base energy just like I I can do it on
 

13
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,429
base energy just like I I can do it on
one leg well of course I can do it on

14
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:18,439
one leg well of course I can do it on
 

15
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:23,029
one leg well of course I can do it on
two without a base okay I'm not leaning

if you're not grounded when he pushes

18
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
if you're not grounded when he pushes
 

19
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,870
if you're not grounded when he pushes
you you will of course get pushing but

20
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:27,880
you you will of course get pushing but
 

21
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,589
you you will of course get pushing but
because you need a bracing angle

22
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:30,599
because you need a bracing angle
 

23
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,150
because you need a bracing angle
because you're not ground voring the

24

energy is not passing through you you're

26
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:33,960
energy is not passing through you you're
 

27
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,830
energy is not passing through you you're
stopping it here at the hand so you need

28
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:35,840
stopping it here at the hand so you need
 

29
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,830
stopping it here at the hand so you need
that foot okay when the energy passes

30
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:38,840
that foot okay when the energy passes
 

31
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,470
that foot okay when the energy passes
through you you don't need that foot

32
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
through you you don't need that foot
 

33
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,869
through you you don't need that foot
even to project him off again if he lets

go I should not go flying forward
 

37
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,709
go I should not go flying forward
because my energy is just going down he

38
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:49,719
because my energy is just going down he
 

39
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,079
because my energy is just going down he
lets go and I don't fly forward
