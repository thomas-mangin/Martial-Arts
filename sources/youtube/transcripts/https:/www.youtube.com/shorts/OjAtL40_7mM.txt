we're going to do
theor I just basic Kimura coming around
and I don't put my leg on him I go for
it and he'll roll out of it
okay so there is nothing protecting the
turn you see in
K he's going to roll out of it there's
nothing stopping that there's a pit okay
if you want to stop that you'll have to
come
into the same kind of position and you
have to depost the other arm so here is
the Kimura here is depost the other arm
and the depost arm he tries to turn he's
lends you can go ahead and try this
arm's blocking him from the turn you see
and so this
is
