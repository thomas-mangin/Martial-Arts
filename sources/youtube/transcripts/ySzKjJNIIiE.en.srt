wants to keep flat if it's up here
then he'll determine

38
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
then he'll determine
 

39
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,470

if he turns over or not
 

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,350
if he turns over or not
if you can so if it's up here and you go

what he doesn't ignore they don't

46
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
what he doesn't ignore they don't
 

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,030
what he doesn't ignore they don't

normally resist
that linkage they will resist that

50
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
that linkage they will resist that
 

51
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,949
that linkage they will resist that

this this is out

58
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879

 

59
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,789

this this is flat

60
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
this this is flat
 

61
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,630
this this is flat
if it's up

62
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
if it's up
 

63
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,550
if it's up
forget it you won't get it

64
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
forget it you won't get it
 

65
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,630
forget it you won't get it
don't go flat

66
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
don't go flat
 

67
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,789
don't go flat
keep it there just a little pressure and

68
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
keep it there just a little pressure and
 

69
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,789
keep it there just a little pressure and
like a bouncing ball

70
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
like a bouncing ball
 

71
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,630
like a bouncing ball
push release

72
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
push release
 

73
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,949
push release
and that release is what he wants he

74
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
and that release is what he wants he
 

75
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,630
and that release is what he wants he
wants to fight back

76
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
wants to fight back
 

77
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,630
wants to fight back
so that little fight back gives you like

78
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
so that little fight back gives you like
 

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,789
so that little fight back gives you like
a spring and you can even do the

80
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
a spring and you can even do the
 

81
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,630
a spring and you can even do the
technique

82
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
technique
 

83
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,700
technique
here

84
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:05,710

 

85
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,589

[Laughter]

86
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599

 

87
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,400

so let's do this
