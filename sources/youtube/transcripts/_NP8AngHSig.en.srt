00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,030

okay so moving on to the the first thing

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:04,040
okay so moving on to the the first thing
 

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,550
okay so moving on to the the first thing
that uh I see as a weakness in people

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:07,560
that uh I see as a weakness in people
 

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,749
that uh I see as a weakness in people
they take the

6
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:09,759
they take the
 

7
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,789
they take the
Ken and I'm so about other films it

8
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:12,799
Ken and I'm so about other films it
 

9
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,510
Ken and I'm so about other films it
should be at your eye level if you're

10
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:16,520
should be at your eye level if you're
 

11
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,830
should be at your eye level if you're
training on your own and doing the

12
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:20,840

 

13
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,429

subur the biggest weakness I see and

14
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:24,439
subur the biggest weakness I see and
 

15
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,790
subur the biggest weakness I see and
we've all done it I've been since since

16
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
we've all done it I've been since since
 

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,429
we've all done it I've been since since
he do it but he said not to do it now

18
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
he do it but he said not to do it now
 

19
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,030
he do it but he said not to do it now
it's these trigger we call trigger

20
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,040
it's these trigger we call trigger
 

21
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,389
it's these trigger we call trigger
fingers so if the trigger fingers and

22
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:37,399
fingers so if the trigger fingers and
 

23
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:40,630
fingers so if the trigger fingers and
you'll see them in high grades as well

24
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
you'll see them in high grades as well
 

25
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,389
you'll see them in high grades as well
High grades he said that because it

26
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:43,399
High grades he said that because it
 

27
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,830
High grades he said that because it
stands out so

28
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
stands out so
 

29
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,869
stands out so
much it's obvious that that would be a

30
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
much it's obvious that that would be a
 

31
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,510
much it's obvious that that would be a
place an attacker would hit because it's

32
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:52,520
place an attacker would hit because it's
 

33
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,150
place an attacker would hit because it's
an obvious uh you they break it you may

34
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:55,160
an obvious uh you they break it you may
 

35
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,270
an obvious uh you they break it you may
not think

36
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:56,280
not think
 

37
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,110
not think
that it's important but it's it stands

38
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,120
that it's important but it's it stands
 

39
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,630
that it's important but it's it stands
out that's the problem okay so you don't

40
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:03,640
out that's the problem okay so you don't
 

41
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,910
out that's the problem okay so you don't
want it stand out so you just curl it a

42
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:06,920
want it stand out so you just curl it a
 

43
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,510
want it stand out so you just curl it a
little just curl it a

44
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:10,520
little just curl it a
 

45
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,149
little just curl it a
little okay and curl this

46
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:15,159

 

47
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,270

one the small finger should be half on

48
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:20,280
one the small finger should be half on
 

49
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,789
one the small finger should be half on
and half

50
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:21,799
and half
 

51
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,429
and half
off the end of the K I don't know why

52
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:26,439
off the end of the K I don't know why
 

53
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,510
off the end of the K I don't know why
and the two fingers should be the ones

54
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:28,520
and the two fingers should be the ones
 

55
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,230
and the two fingers should be the ones
that holding it strong

56
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,240
that holding it strong
 

57
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,069
that holding it strong
but but the weakness that I'd like to

58
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:33,079
but but the weakness that I'd like to
 

59
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,469
but but the weakness that I'd like to
just cover here is Trier

60
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
just cover here is Trier
 

61
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,830
just cover here is Trier
fingers you a lot of people they they'll

62
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
fingers you a lot of people they they'll
 

63
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,870
fingers you a lot of people they they'll
do

64
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:41,880
do
 

65
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,910
do
this rather than that you know so the

66
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
this rather than that you know so the
 

67
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,469
this rather than that you know so the
finger will be over it so the fingers

68
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:49,479
finger will be over it so the fingers
 

69
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,469
finger will be over it so the fingers
are very important to take note of so we

70
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
are very important to take note of so we
 

71
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,029
are very important to take note of so we
need to not do this it is also uh with

72
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:57,039
need to not do this it is also uh with
 

73
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,029
need to not do this it is also uh with
the Joe you'll notice people doing it

74
00:01:59,029 --> 00:01:59,039
the Joe you'll notice people doing it
 

75
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,469
the Joe you'll notice people doing it
with the Joe as well

76
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:01,479
with the Joe as well
 

77
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:04,429
with the Joe as well
it's an unnecessary habit that we get

78
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:04,439
it's an unnecessary habit that we get
 

79
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,749
it's an unnecessary habit that we get
into so we we weakness number

80
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:08,759
into so we we weakness number
 

81
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,830
into so we we weakness number
one so tried to correct that weakness

82
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
one so tried to correct that weakness
 

83
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,470
one so tried to correct that weakness
number two now if you see the gap

84
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
number two now if you see the gap
 

85
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,990
number two now if you see the gap
between my

86
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
between my
 

87
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,830
between my
hands it's much smaller in this

88
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
hands it's much smaller in this
 

89
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,790
hands it's much smaller in this
case than the size of my

90
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
case than the size of my
 

91
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,190
case than the size of my
hand so really since you say it's one of

92
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
hand so really since you say it's one of
 

93
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,190
hand so really since you say it's one of
your hands distance

94
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200

 

95
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,949

so so that's cuz I got large hands

96
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:35,959
so so that's cuz I got large hands
 

97
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,070
so so that's cuz I got large hands
that's the size of my

98
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,080

 

99
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,350

Gap when people are cutting when people

100
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:42,360
Gap when people are cutting when people
 

101
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,309
Gap when people are cutting when people
are cutting normal Cy to

102
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
are cutting normal Cy to
 

103
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,070
are cutting normal Cy to

parallel here to
 

105
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,390
