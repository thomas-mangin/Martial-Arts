1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,270

i'll be okay

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280

 

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,749

just to talk you through it

4
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:05,759
just to talk you through it
 

5
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,629
just to talk you through it
he starts doing his technique and he and

6
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:08,639
he starts doing his technique and he and
 

7
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,310
he starts doing his technique and he and
he moves me

8
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,320
he moves me
 

9
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,910
he moves me
and and

10
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
and and
 

11
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,709
and and
we'll get this on off on off on our

12
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
we'll get this on off on off on our
 

13
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:29,669
we'll get this on off on off on our
bearing

14
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679

 

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,389

he can't get as an osmosis or the

16
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
he can't get as an osmosis or the
 

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,790
he can't get as an osmosis or the
equilibrium because he's so busy saying

18
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
equilibrium because he's so busy saying
 

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,869
equilibrium because he's so busy saying
what he seems to be going i said am i

20
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
what he seems to be going i said am i
 

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,270
what he seems to be going i said am i
doing it he's going with me i must have

22
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
doing it he's going with me i must have
 

23
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,950
doing it he's going with me i must have
it correct but i don't know if i've got

24
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
it correct but i don't know if i've got
 

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,950
it correct but i don't know if i've got
it correct so do you know what i mean by

26
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
it correct so do you know what i mean by
 

27
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,229
it correct so do you know what i mean by
saying that as well

28
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239

 

29
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,670

so there's no

30
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
so there's no
 

31
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,910
so there's no
equilibrium

32
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
equilibrium
 

33
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,270
equilibrium
because even when he's moving you

34
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
because even when he's moving you
 

35
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,549
because even when he's moving you
nobody knows where the balance is

36
00:00:58,549 --> 00:00:58,559
nobody knows where the balance is
 

37
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,590
nobody knows where the balance is
because what each person is thinking oh

38
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
because what each person is thinking oh
 

39
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,910
because what each person is thinking oh
he's helped me

40
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
he's helped me
 

41
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,070
he's helped me
nobody stops and thinks

42
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
nobody stops and thinks
 

43
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,750
nobody stops and thinks
has he got me why are we just going

44
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
has he got me why are we just going
 

45
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,630
has he got me why are we just going
along together is this osmosis become

46
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
along together is this osmosis become
 

47
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,390
along together is this osmosis become
something that has just happened

48
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
something that has just happened
 

49
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,310
something that has just happened
and we just then

50
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
and we just then
 

51
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,550
and we just then
got down there

52
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
got down there
 

53
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,270
got down there
this is what i see is equilibrium

54
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280

 

55
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:33,749

i turned

56
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759

 

57
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:40,870

watch this part

58
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880

 

59
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,950

so yeah i've moved him off his center

60
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
so yeah i've moved him off his center
 

61
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,550
so yeah i've moved him off his center
now

62
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560

 

63
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,429

so this what we've been talking about

64
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439

 

65
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,630

i don't really rate that teacher but

66
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
i don't really rate that teacher but
 

67
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,910
i don't really rate that teacher but
but what he's doing is he's working on

68
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
but what he's doing is he's working on
 

69
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,510
but what he's doing is he's working on
the inner mind

70
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
the inner mind
 

71
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,350
the inner mind
and some

72
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
and some
 

73
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,190
and some
equilibrium

74
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
equilibrium
 

75
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,550
equilibrium
so now

76
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
so now
 

77
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,389
so now
we've made this

78
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
we've made this
 

79
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,949
we've made this
he's not thinking on off or not he's

80
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
he's not thinking on off or not he's
 

81
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,949
he's not thinking on off or not he's
just thinking

82
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
just thinking
 

83
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,710
just thinking
since he's pulling me around and running

84
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
since he's pulling me around and running
 

85
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,710
since he's pulling me around and running
around and i don't know about it

86
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
around and i don't know about it
 

87
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,510
around and i don't know about it
so it means we're we've joined because

88
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
so it means we're we've joined because
 

89
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,589
so it means we're we've joined because
he doesn't have a gap to think for

90
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
he doesn't have a gap to think for
 

91
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,150
he doesn't have a gap to think for
himself or to think about

92
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160

 

93
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,790

he doesn't have a yes no scenario going

94
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
he doesn't have a yes no scenario going
 

95
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,670
he doesn't have a yes no scenario going
on he doesn't have

96
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
on he doesn't have
 

97
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,750
on he doesn't have
i've got him

98
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
i've got him
 

99
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:49,350
i've got him
yes

100
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360

 

101
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,670

cutting down really i was doing that

102
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
cutting down really i was doing that
 

103
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,869
cutting down really i was doing that
with danny

104
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
with danny
 

105
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,229
with danny
this time

106
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
this time
 

107
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,550
this time
i'm doing that with danny

108
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
i'm doing that with danny
 

109
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,030
i'm doing that with danny
he just doesn't know it

110
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040

 

111
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,030

i'm pushing him away mentally all the

112
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
i'm pushing him away mentally all the
 

113
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:16,830
i'm pushing him away mentally all the
time

114
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840

 

115
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,550

okay so that was the mental that was the

116
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
okay so that was the mental that was the
 

117
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,239
okay so that was the mental that was the
going on to the mental side
