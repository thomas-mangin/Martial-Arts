I had to externally yield and and get a

the compression is right here okay and

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,710
the compression is right here okay and
then I keep increasing it as she's

then I keep increasing it as she's

00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,749
then I keep increasing it as she's
driving I keep increasing it you see

so if you watch my

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
so if you watch my
 

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,270
so if you watch my
external I made her do that but you can

see my hands mooved there you see that
 

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,230
see my hands mooved there you see that
so if she's driving driving I'll release

that's

that's
why in order to get the absorption I

why in order to get the absorption I
 

65
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,869
why in order to get the absorption I
have to release the tension and then

66
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
have to release the tension and then
 

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,790
have to release the tension and then
if I move my arms I'm probably not doing

175
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,269
the the
compression and the release yeah um

176
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
compression and the release yeah um
 

177
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,190
compression and the release yeah um
sound of like you're talking about

178
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,200
sound of like you're talking about
 

179

everything yourself
but me as UK also feel compressed in

182
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
but me as UK also feel compressed in
 

183
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,509
but me as UK also feel compressed in
that moment yes so yes um

184
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:36,519
that moment yes so yes um
 

185
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,150

216
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
linking of the UK the UK is going to try
 

217
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,310
linking of the UK the UK is going to try
to link but they can't link because

218
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:27,320

219
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,829

yeah and so and you know we do that a

230
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:46,839
yeah and so and you know we do that a
 

231
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,750
yeah and so and you know we do that a
lot in in our iido right we go

232
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:50,760
lot in in our iido right we go
 

233
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,750

236
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:57,959
balance um but this is a superficial
 

237
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,190

238
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,200

and it's not in alignment with non-c

240
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:04,839
and it's not in alignment with non-c
 

241
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,710
and it's not in alignment with non-c
contestation or Wu way right and so we

242
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
contestation or Wu way right and so we
 

243
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,509
contestation or Wu way right and so we
have to go deeper what does non-c

244
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:10,519
have to go deeper what does non-c
 

245
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,670
have to go deeper what does non-c
contestation really mean total

246
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:12,680
contestation really mean total
 

247
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,069
contestation really mean total
acceptance you see um what is wo way

248
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:17,079
acceptance you see um what is wo way
 

249
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:19,389
acceptance you see um what is wo way
total acceptance right how can I do

250
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:19,399
total acceptance right how can I do
 

251
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,110
total acceptance right how can I do
total acceptance I have to lose the self

252
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,120
total acceptance I have to lose the self
 

253
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,269
total acceptance I have to lose the self
because the self is always a dichotomous

254
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:24,279
because the self is always a dichotomous
 

255
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,870
because the self is always a dichotomous
entity that concentrically expands out

256
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:27,880
entity that concentrically expands out
 

257
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,230
entity that concentrically expands out
dichotomy which is just contestation see

258
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
dichotomy which is just contestation see
 

259
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,629
dichotomy which is just contestation see
and so what we're use here is the poles

260
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:36,639
and so what we're use here is the poles
 

261
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,310
and so what we're use here is the poles
of the pinky and the thumb you see to

262
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
of the pinky and the thumb you see to
 

263
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,509
of the pinky and the thumb you see to
tell you don't push or pull don't open

264
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
tell you don't push or pull don't open
 

265
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,190
tell you don't push or pull don't open
or close just stay right where you're in

266
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,200
or close just stay right where you're in
 

267
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,990
or close just stay right where you're in
and seek the T Den in the middle which

268
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,000
and seek the T Den in the middle which
 

269
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,069
and seek the T Den in the middle which
is neither pinky nor thumb okay and so I

270
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:53,079
is neither pinky nor thumb okay and so I
 

271
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,470
is neither pinky nor thumb okay and so I
don't I don't fight you to get that kind

272
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
don't I don't fight you to get that kind
 

273
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,750
don't I don't fight you to get that kind
of stuff I use the motion and there's

274
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
of stuff I use the motion and there's
 

275
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,470
of stuff I use the motion and there's
the elbow right

276
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:01,480
the elbow right
 

277
00:12:01,480 --> 00:13:04,949
the elbow right
now okay so try some more

278
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:04,959

 

279
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,790

so now let's hold ourselves

280
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:07,800
so now let's hold ourselves
 

281
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:14,030
so now let's hold ourselves
to inward outward

282
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,040

 

283
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:20,470

spirals this is in our

284
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480

 

285
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,110

286
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,120

 

287
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,310

small but it's the

291
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,150

small see can be small or it didn't look

292
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,160
small see can be small or it didn't look
 

293
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,990
small see can be small or it didn't look
like it but inside it's coiling do you

294
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
like it but inside it's coiling do you
 

295
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,710
like it but inside it's coiling do you
understand the the two are coiling so I

296
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
understand the the two are coiling so I
 

297
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,670
understand the the two are coiling so I
don't have to go

298
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
don't have to go
 

299
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,910
don't have to go
outward inward but I have to coil all

300
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
outward inward but I have to coil all
 

301
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,030
outward inward but I have to coil all
right have the

302
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,040

 

303
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,550

okay try it

306
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399

 

307
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,910

you have to find the same y values but

308
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
you have to find the same y values but
 

309
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:28,030
you have to find the same y values but
with these

310

00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,950
okay watch those straight lines all
right

344
00:17:59,950 --> 00:17:59,960
right
 

345
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,390

yes make

346
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400
yes make

spirals act

348
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,120

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:38,950

linearly l g

350
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:38,960

 

351
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:55,070

little more curve on the Y

352
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,080

 

353
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:01,149

hand okay so watch the uh

354
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:01,159

 

355
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:07,990

y hand here see that okay so we want to

356
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
y hand here see that okay so we want to
 

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,870
y hand here see that okay so we want to
go linear there all right you see that

358
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:11,880
go linear there all right you see that
 

359
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,470
go linear there all right you see that
and sometimes sometimes we turn him but

360
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
and sometimes sometimes we turn him but
 

361
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,669
and sometimes sometimes we turn him but
then it's linear there you see that yes

362
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:17,679
then it's linear there you see that yes
 

363
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,789
then it's linear there you see that yes
okay in or if I go spiral now I'm in the

364
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:21,799
okay in or if I go spiral now I'm in the
 

365
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:25,870
okay in or if I go spiral now I'm in the
shoulder that's part of the

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:25,880

 

367
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,070

problem again I'm turning him I go

368
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,080

the center
 

373
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:35,750
the center
okay that's why this is where the

374
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
okay that's why this is where the
 

375
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,350
okay that's why this is where the
internals come in I don't have to touch

376
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,360
internals come in I don't have to touch
 

377
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,750

I don't have to push the shoulder to

378
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:40,760
I don't have to push the shoulder to
 

379
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,789
I don't have to push the shoulder to
make the center go back okay so as

380
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:44,799
make the center go back okay so as
 

381
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,070
make the center go back okay so as
you're doing your spiral

382
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,080
you're doing your spiral
 

383
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,230
you're doing your spiral
here pay pay attention to that feel that

here pay pay attention to that feel that
 

385
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,789

okay so as I do the spiral I'm not going

386
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:53,799
okay so as I do the spiral I'm not going
 

387

keep that connection on the spir you see
 

397
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,110

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
that it doesn't go in the shoulder so
 

399
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,350
