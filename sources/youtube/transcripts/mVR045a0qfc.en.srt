offering you to think about this when
 

259
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,390
offering you to think about this when
you get

260
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
you get
 

261
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,590
you get

and you you do
 

267
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,790
and you you do
the technique of course it works you

268
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
the technique of course it works you
 

269
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,029
