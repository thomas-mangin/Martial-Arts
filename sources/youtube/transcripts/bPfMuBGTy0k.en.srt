5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,410

you're falling out

6
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:27,420

 

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,570

you have to get the physical level first

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:29,580
you have to get the physical level first
 

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,490
you have to get the physical level first
okay

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:31,500
okay
 

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,370
okay
so uh right here

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:34,380
so uh right here
 

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,010
so uh right here
you go one hand

14
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:37,020
you go one hand
 

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,190
you go one hand
and then you do the edit

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,200
and then you do the edit
 

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,850
and then you do the edit
your hair

18
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:46,860

 

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,470

right right when we

20
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:48,480
right right when we
 

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,930
right right when we
already have them right on both hands

22
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:50,940
already have them right on both hands
 

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,450
already have them right on both hands
they say both hands both hands have you

24
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:53,460
they say both hands both hands have you
 

25
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,350
they say both hands both hands have you
feel that okay so both hands have

26
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
feel that okay so both hands have
 

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,930
feel that okay so both hands have
if the hand that's yielding isn't

28
00:00:59,930 --> 00:00:59,940
if the hand that's yielding isn't
 

29
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,970
if the hand that's yielding isn't
getting out of the way and letting him

30
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:01,980
getting out of the way and letting him
 

31
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,609
getting out of the way and letting him
fall in the hand that yields positive

32
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:04,619
fall in the hand that yields positive
 

33
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,750
fall in the hand that yields positive
into adhesion

34
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:08,760

 

35
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,690

and the hand that is going to do the

36
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:11,700
and the hand that is going to do the
 

37
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,670
and the hand that is going to do the
Yong isn't waiting

38
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,680

 

39
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,850

so uh

40
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:19,860
so uh
 

41
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,850
so uh
remember the

42
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:21,860
remember the
 

43
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,550
remember the
Yin aiki yield

44
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:25,560
Yin aiki yield
 

45
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,890
Yin aiki yield
has a young component do you feel that

46
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:27,900
has a young component do you feel that
 

47
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,350
has a young component do you feel that
so what watch how you're pushing you see

48
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:30,360
so what watch how you're pushing you see
 

49
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,390
so what watch how you're pushing you see
you're pushing and you can't push in

50
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
you're pushing and you can't push in
 

51
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,789
you're pushing and you can't push in
there's nowhere to go you see until I

52
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
there's nowhere to go you see until I
 

53
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,609
there's nowhere to go you see until I
make the adhesion and then I move you in

54
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:40,619

 

55
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,190

right so this hand isn't

56
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
right so this hand isn't
 

57
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,490
right so this hand isn't
waiting but it's going to it's going to

58
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:49,500
waiting but it's going to it's going to
 

59
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,910
waiting but it's going to it's going to
ultimately go young you see that but it

60
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:52,920
ultimately go young you see that but it
 

61
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,670
ultimately go young you see that but it
is bringing you in so for example take

62
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
is bringing you in so for example take
 

63
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,889
is bringing you in so for example take
this hand out and you see this hand look

64
00:01:57,889 --> 00:01:57,899
this hand out and you see this hand look
 

65
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,149
this hand out and you see this hand look
where you're going

66
00:01:59,149 --> 00:01:59,159
where you're going
 

67
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,649
where you're going
do you see

68
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:00,659
do you see
 

69
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,050
do you see
so it's not here waiting and doing

70
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,060
so it's not here waiting and doing
 

71
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,749
so it's not here waiting and doing
nothing this kind of you're just

72
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
nothing this kind of you're just
 

73
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,730
nothing this kind of you're just
yielding collapsing

74
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:07,740
yielding collapsing
 

75
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,270
yielding collapsing
okay so the two heads right at contact

76
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280

 

77
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,210

fields are generated and then I move

78
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:17,220
fields are generated and then I move
 

79
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:27,530
fields are generated and then I move
those things together

80
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:27,540

 

81
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,050

and half the other bodies will die later

82
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,060
and half the other bodies will die later
 

83
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,190
and half the other bodies will die later
okay no already in

84
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,200
okay no already in

it just Carries On

104
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,000

[Music]

106
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:17,459

 

107
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,790

but at the physical level there's no

108
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:19,800
but at the physical level there's no
 

109
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,210
but at the physical level there's no
waiting here here pushing okay

110
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:23,220
waiting here here pushing okay
 

111
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,589
waiting here here pushing okay
okay and then likewise as UK

112
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599

 

113
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,589

as he goes around to it so you you feel

114
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:30,599
as he goes around to it so you you feel
 

115
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,410
as he goes around to it so you you feel
that okay there we go that's it right

116
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:33,420
that okay there we go that's it right
 

117
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,690
that okay there we go that's it right
there and then here I don't see

118
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:35,700
there and then here I don't see
 

119
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,250
there and then here I don't see
this collapse

120
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:37,260
this collapse
 

121
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:45,350
this collapse
I leave it on and he turns it

122
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360

 

123
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,309

so we establish it

124
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
so we establish it
 

125
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,110
so we establish it
there it is and I leave it on and I let

126
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
there it is and I leave it on and I let
 

127
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:59,869
there it is and I leave it on and I let
him turn

128
00:03:59,869 --> 00:03:59,879

 

129
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,229

you see that you feel go off

130
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:03,239
you see that you feel go off
 

131
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,490
you see that you feel go off
so

132
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:04,500
so
 

133
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:12,229
so
on and I let him turn my field

134
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239

 

135
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,289

okay you gotta get that physical level

136
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:15,299
okay you gotta get that physical level
 

137
00:04:15,299 --> 00:05:35,450
okay you gotta get that physical level
first okay let's go

138
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:35,460

 

139
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,210

so uh let's see uh play some art

140
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:41,220
so uh let's see uh play some art
 

141
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,370
so uh let's see uh play some art
s

142
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:43,380

 

143
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:50,650

do uh normal what you call normal

144
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:50,660

 

145
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,510

this little keep going as I'm talking

146
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
this little keep going as I'm talking
 

147
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,870
this little keep going as I'm talking
this will turn right in there that the

148
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
this will turn right in there that the
 

149
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,909
this will turn right in there that the
good kids doing where Chris was breaking

150
00:05:58,909 --> 00:05:58,919
good kids doing where Chris was breaking
 

151
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,390
good kids doing where Chris was breaking
Center ago you say that thing it's

152
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
Center ago you say that thing it's
 

153
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,830
Center ago you say that thing it's
okay uh this is the wrong wrong thing

154
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:06,840
okay uh this is the wrong wrong thing
 

155
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,290
okay uh this is the wrong wrong thing
and now that we do the this other

156
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:09,300
and now that we do the this other
 

157
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,469
and now that we do the this other
variant we see you cannot access it

158
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
variant we see you cannot access it
 

159
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,990
variant we see you cannot access it
because you were not doing the right

160
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,000
because you were not doing the right
 

161
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,469
because you were not doing the right
thing okay and you break Center where

162
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
thing okay and you break Center where
 

163
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,570
thing okay and you break Center where
you feel your balance goes you try to

164
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:20,580
you feel your balance goes you try to
 

165
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,150
you feel your balance goes you try to
get control again and then you're just

166
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,160
get control again and then you're just
 

167
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,969
get control again and then you're just
staying ahead of the curve okay but then

168
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:25,979
staying ahead of the curve okay but then
 

169
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,189
staying ahead of the curve okay but then
you're letting her okay

170
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:28,199
you're letting her okay
 

171
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,790
you're letting her okay
so this technique

172
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
so this technique
 

173
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,330
so this technique
uh on the normal cookie Dosa he he's not

174
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,340
uh on the normal cookie Dosa he he's not
 

175
