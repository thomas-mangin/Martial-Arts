00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,630
okay
and then if i keep this here

324
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640

 

325
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,470

you put in the elbow
 

337
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,990
you put in the elbow
where the energy is now

338
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000

541
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,509
is all crap okay wouldn't work okay
try to

542
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
try to
 

543
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,949
try to
focus in on that uh

544
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
focus in on that uh
 

545
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,350
focus in on that uh
i i'm i bring him around he's got no

546
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
i i'm i bring him around he's got no
 

547
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,829
i i'm i bring him around he's got no
balance over here do you see that so

548
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
balance over here do you see that so
 

549
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,069
balance over here do you see that so
eventually it'll lower

550
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
eventually it'll lower
 

551
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,470
eventually it'll lower
it'll lower just because he's falling

552
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480
it'll lower just because he's falling
 

553
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,710
it'll lower just because he's falling
i'm not pushing him down but as he

554
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720
i'm not pushing him down but as he
 

555
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,509
i'm not pushing him down but as he
starts to fall i stay i follow him i'm

556
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
starts to fall i stay i follow him i'm
 

557
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,310
starts to fall i stay i follow him i'm
following him you see

558
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
following him you see
 

559
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,829
following him you see
if i just bring him over there and i

560
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
if i just bring him over there and i
 

561
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,949
if i just bring him over there and i
don't follow him we disconnect

562
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
don't follow him we disconnect
 

563
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,590
don't follow him we disconnect
so as he starts to fall i'm staying with

564
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
so as he starts to fall i'm staying with
 

565
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,389
so as he starts to fall i'm staying with
him staying with him

566
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
him staying with him
 

567
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,230
him staying with him
it looks like and look because he goes

568
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
it looks like and look because he goes
 

569
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,870
it looks like and look because he goes
down my hands on his elbow and then

570
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
down my hands on his elbow and then
 

571
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,269
down my hands on his elbow and then
we're all power hungry

572
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
we're all power hungry
 

573
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,590
we're all power hungry
afraid people it looks like i'm pushing

574
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
afraid people it looks like i'm pushing
 

575
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,749
afraid people it looks like i'm pushing
him down but i'm not pushing him down

576
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:49,759
him down but i'm not pushing him down
 

577
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,829
him down but i'm not pushing him down
i'm leading him out

578
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
i'm leading him out
 

579
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,470
i'm leading him out
and then he falls he's falling and i

580
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,480
and then he falls he's falling and i
 

581
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,749
and then he falls he's falling and i
follow him

582
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
follow him
 

583
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:05,350
follow him
okay

584
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:05,360

 

585
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,550

now as the guy resists i don't think

586
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
now as the guy resists i don't think
 

587
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,230
now as the guy resists i don't think
we'll get there today but you might

588
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
we'll get there today but you might
 

589
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,269
we'll get there today but you might
he's going to try to regain his balance

590
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
he's going to try to regain his balance
 

591
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,389
he's going to try to regain his balance
with the other arm as he tries to put

592
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
with the other arm as he tries to put
 

593
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,509
with the other arm as he tries to put
his basic support back under his line of

594
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
his basic support back under his line of
 

595
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,389
his basic support back under his line of
gravity you see that

596
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
gravity you see that
 

597
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,790
gravity you see that
and he's going to push up

598
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
and he's going to push up
 

599
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,069
and he's going to push up
so here i have the ik adhesion but when

600
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
so here i have the ik adhesion but when
 

601
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,629
so here i have the ik adhesion but when
he pushes up he'll push into

602
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:32,639
he pushes up he'll push into
 

603
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,509
he pushes up he'll push into
the koku projection do you see that and

604
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
the koku projection do you see that and
 

605
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,910
the koku projection do you see that and
so you'll get almost like

606
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
so you'll get almost like
 

607
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,870
so you'll get almost like
he's coming around

608
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880

 

609
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,870

it gets kind of staccato like because

610
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
it gets kind of staccato like because
 

611
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,550
it gets kind of staccato like because
it's like a bouncing ball but even then

612
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
it's like a bouncing ball but even then
 

613
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,790
it's like a bouncing ball but even then
every time you get projected down i have

614
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
every time you get projected down i have
 

615
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,749
every time you get projected down i have
to follow you okay the following is

616
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
to follow you okay the following is
 

617
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,749
to follow you okay the following is
going to be more difficult because the

618
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
going to be more difficult because the
 

619
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,189
going to be more difficult because the
drop is faster but you just stay with it

620
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
drop is faster but you just stay with it
 

621
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,230
drop is faster but you just stay with it
okay

622
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
okay
 

623
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,110
okay
so

624
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
so

627
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,010

around change your minds

628
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,020

um let's take the other hand out
 

637
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,710
um let's take the other hand out
and you can see it doesn't go under me

638
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
and you can see it doesn't go under me

and don't put it under me okay this is

642
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
and don't put it under me okay this is
 

643
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,549
and don't put it under me okay this is
where oh what if he tries to get his

644
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:20,559
where oh what if he tries to get his
 

645
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,630
where oh what if he tries to get his
base of support and then i'm jacked

646
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
base of support and then i'm jacked
 

647
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,150
base of support and then i'm jacked
again i'm fine

648
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
again i'm fine
 

649
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,909

today he's in the technique so try to

654
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
today he's in the technique so try to
 

655
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,230
today he's in the technique so try to
see it don't disturb the technique and

656
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
see it don't disturb the technique and
 

657
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,150
see it don't disturb the technique and
go oh you can

658
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,160
go oh you can
 

659
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,230
