I insist, this is an exercise that can

00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
I insist, this is an exercise that can
 

33
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,310
I insist, this is an exercise that can
highlight some of our weaknesses,

highlight some of our weaknesses,
 

35
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,869
highlight some of our weaknesses,
for example, do I go down to

36
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
for example, do I go down to
 

37
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,110

Okay, so we'll come back to that in a moment.
So, get into position in a

So, get into position in a
 

87
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,749
So, get into position in a
completely artificial way, but

88
00:02:10,749 --> 00:02:10,759
completely artificial way, but
 

89
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,150
completely artificial way, but
the point of this exercise is to manage

the point of this exercise is to manage
 

91
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,910
the point of this exercise is to manage
to have an effect here and here

to have an effect here and here
 

93
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,200
