I'm now from my Center going to choose a
 

57
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,090
I'm now from my Center going to choose a
hand and I'm going to imagine there's a

58
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:35,100
hand and I'm going to imagine there's a

connection and that'll give me the
 

67
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,850
connection and that'll give me the
stimulus of

68
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:49,860
