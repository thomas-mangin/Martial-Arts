38
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
117
 

39
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,389
117
and look at picture number six

40
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399

 

41
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,790

where the hand

42
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
where the hand
 

43
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,389
where the hand
is different than

44
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
is different than
 

45
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,389
is different than
picture number five

46
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
picture number five
 

47
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,149
picture number five
so picture number five is the

48
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
so picture number five is the
 

49
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,109
so picture number five is the

00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
where we take the hand
 

57
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,109
where we take the hand

okay so body science

106
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840

 

107
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,710

there's

there's
 

109
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,430
there's
a hombu style like you know what is the

and there's a film now on youtube saying

116
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
and there's a film now on youtube saying
 

117
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,190
and there's a film now on youtube saying
about the sensitivity

118
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
about the sensitivity
 

119
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,150
about the sensitivity
and we we need to have this sensitivity

120
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
and we we need to have this sensitivity
 

121
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,110
and we we need to have this sensitivity
just because we perhaps put the banner

122
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
just because we perhaps put the banner
 

123
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,030

this wasn't right to think that there's
 

129
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,190
this wasn't right to think that there's
a school of iwama aikido so we just say

130
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
a school of iwama aikido so we just say
 

131
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,910

the seat makes a bit of a noise so
 

287
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,189
the seat makes a bit of a noise so
excuse that but if you

288
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199

 

289
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,990

then

294
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
then
 

295
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,270
then
they keep to your left in this case

296
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
they keep to your left in this case
 

297
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,430
they keep to your left in this case
and you still take them down but you've

298
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
and you still take them down but you've
 

299
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,070
and you still take them down but you've
got a clearer pathway

300
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
got a clearer pathway
 

301
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,990
got a clearer pathway
so it means the sensitivity of your body

302
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
so it means the sensitivity of your body
 

303
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,790
so it means the sensitivity of your body
the sensitivity of your body needs to

304
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
the sensitivity of your body needs to
 

305
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,870
the sensitivity of your body needs to
adjust

306
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
adjust
 

307
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,870
adjust
so this is what i consider is body

308
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
so this is what i consider is body
 

309
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,990
so this is what i consider is body
