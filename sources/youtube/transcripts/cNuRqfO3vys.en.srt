00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:48,110

ring

174
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,120

 

175
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,270

more okay uh one thing I would add here

176
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:52,280
more okay uh one thing I would add here
 

177
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,790
more okay uh one thing I would add here
okay so when when you going here uh

178
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:55,800
okay so when when you going here uh
 

179
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,790
okay so when when you going here uh
notice where the height of his arm okay

180
00:06:59,790 --> 00:06:59,800
notice where the height of his arm okay
 

181
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,909
notice where the height of his arm okay
so I'm not going to bring this up like

182
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:02,919
so I'm not going to bring this up like
 

183
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:08,830
so I'm not going to bring this up like
that and I'm way up here like

184
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:08,840

 

185
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,309

that okay

186
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319

 

187
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,830

so it's a much

188
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
so it's a much
 

189
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,670
so it's a much
smaller Circle okay and it's not

190
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:20,680
smaller Circle okay and it's not
 

191
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,150
smaller Circle okay and it's not
really at his shoulder

192
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:25,160

 

193
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,150

joint okay so if you pay attention what

194
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
joint okay so if you pay attention what
 

195
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,230
joint okay so if you pay attention what
I mean is I'm going to make a big circle

196
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,240
I mean is I'm going to make a big circle
 

197
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,110
I mean is I'm going to make a big circle
with his

198
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
with his
 

199
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,589
with his
hand rotating around his shoulder

200
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
hand rotating around his shoulder
 

201
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,230
hand rotating around his shoulder
jump I'm going to take advantage that he

202
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
jump I'm going to take advantage that he
 

203
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,390
jump I'm going to take advantage that he
has these joints in there so you see

204
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:43,400
has these joints in there so you see
 

205
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,790
has these joints in there so you see
this is wrist nothing's really gone

206
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:45,800
this is wrist nothing's really gone
 

207
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,350
this is wrist nothing's really gone
around his shoulder joint do you see and

208
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
around his shoulder joint do you see and
 

209
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,710
around his shoulder joint do you see and
now I don't want to make that Circle

210
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
now I don't want to make that Circle
 

211
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,110
now I don't want to make that Circle
once once I'm there I go to the elbow

212
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
once once I'm there I go to the elbow
 

213
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,110
once once I'm there I go to the elbow
and the elbow attacks the

214
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,120
and the elbow attacks the
 

215
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,550
and the elbow attacks the
you guys see that

216
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:05,560

 

217
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,710

so that's that's not me

218
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:11,720

 

219
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,110

okay you see that okay all right when

220
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,120
okay you see that okay all right when
 

221
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,869
okay you see that okay all right when
when we doing like

222
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:17,879
when we doing like
 

223
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,990
when we doing like
Mak remember you you're rotating your

224
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
Mak remember you you're rotating your
 

225
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,629
Mak remember you you're rotating your
hands because there has to be a yin and

226
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:25,639
hands because there has to be a yin and
 

227
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,350
hands because there has to be a yin and
yang relationship there not the two

228
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:28,360
yang relationship there not the two
 

229
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,149
yang relationship there not the two
hands going together

230
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:30,159
hands going together
 

231
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,949
hands going together
you see that that looks weird right to

232
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:33,959
you see that that looks weird right to
 

233
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,389
you see that that looks weird right to
you guys but this this is how a lot of

234
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
you guys but this this is how a lot of
 

235
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,550
you guys but this this is how a lot of
the iido world does like ma to move

236
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:39,560
the iido world does like ma to move
 

237
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,589
the iido world does like ma to move
their two hands together but this is a

238
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:42,599
their two hands together but this is a
 

239
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,230
their two hands together but this is a
head do you see and then this one

240
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
head do you see and then this one
 

241
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,509
head do you see and then this one
follows do you guys see that okay so

242
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
follows do you guys see that okay so
 

243
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,150
follows do you guys see that okay so
that's why I said it's like the

244
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160

 

245
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,310

Joe so as you're coming

246
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:57,320
Joe so as you're coming
 

247
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,509
Joe so as you're coming
around I get to the track wrap okay I

248
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
around I get to the track wrap okay I
 

249
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,389
around I get to the track wrap okay I
don't want to Pivot at the shoulder

250
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
don't want to Pivot at the shoulder
 

251
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,590
don't want to Pivot at the shoulder
because there's no there's no control on

252
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:08,600
because there's no there's no control on
 

253
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,310
because there's no there's no control on
his Center as you're doing all that do

254
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:11,320
his Center as you're doing all that do
 

255
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,350
his Center as you're doing all that do
you see it won't happen until you've

256
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:14,360
you see it won't happen until you've
 

257
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,550
you see it won't happen until you've
passed

258
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:15,560
passed
 

259
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,550
passed
everything and then now you can push on

260
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
everything and then now you can push on
 

261
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,790
everything and then now you can push on
that and that that's what you guys are

262
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
that and that that's what you guys are
 

263
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,790
that and that that's what you guys are
experiencing okay so when you come

264
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
experiencing okay so when you come
 

265
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,509
experiencing okay so when you come
around

266
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:26,519
around
 

267
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,350
around
here and this elbow

268
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,360
here and this elbow
 

269
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,750
here and this elbow
instead of making this big so watch the

270
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
instead of making this big so watch the
 

271
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,310
instead of making this big so watch the
degree of rotation when I make this arm

272
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,320
degree of rotation when I make this arm
 

273
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,150
degree of rotation when I make this arm
straight it's got to go tick tick tick

274
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
straight it's got to go tick tick tick
 

275
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,910
straight it's got to go tick tick tick
tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick

276
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
 

277
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,110
tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
tick tick tick tick now I can get on it

278
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,120
tick tick tick tick now I can get on it
 

279
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,350
tick tick tick tick now I can get on it
again on the other one his elbow just

280
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:48,360
again on the other one his elbow just
 

281
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,269
again on the other one his elbow just
has to go to there do you see so you

282
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:52,279
has to go to there do you see so you
 

283
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,990
has to go to there do you see so you
don't want his arm straight where your

284
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,000
don't want his arm straight where your
 

285
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,870
don't want his arm straight where your
two arms are doing the same thing do you

286
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:57,880
two arms are doing the same thing do you
 

287
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,069
two arms are doing the same thing do you
see that instead this arm is doing a

288
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:03,079
see that instead this arm is doing a
 

289
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:06,630
see that instead this arm is doing a
lead it's leading it's leading into it

290
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
lead it's leading it's leading into it
 

291
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,069
lead it's leading it's leading into it
do you see and this one is following the

292
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:13,079

 

293
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,790

lead so a visual cue that you're doing

294
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
lead so a visual cue that you're doing
 

295
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,110
lead so a visual cue that you're doing
that is that his elbow is bent his arm

296
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
that is that his elbow is bent his arm
 

297
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,430
that is that his elbow is bent his arm
is

298
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440

 

299
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,829

bent on the other

300
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
bent on the other
 

301
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,030
bent on the other
one his arm gets straight

302
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,040
one his arm gets straight
 

303
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,389
one his arm gets straight
okay and you don't want that your two

304
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
okay and you don't want that your two
 

305
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,389
okay and you don't want that your two
hands are doing the same thing as

306
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
hands are doing the same thing as
 

307
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,150
hands are doing the same thing as
opposed to following each other

308
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
opposed to following each other
 

309
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,949
opposed to following each other
following each other okay so again you

310
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
following each other okay so again you
 

311
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,110
following each other okay so again you
know I trained the recruits and they

312
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
know I trained the recruits and they
 

313
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,509
know I trained the recruits and they
like you go you said it was like the Joe

314
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:46,519
like you go you said it was like the Joe
 

315
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,150
like you go you said it was like the Joe
and on the Joe the rear hand went

316
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:49,160
and on the Joe the rear hand went
 

317
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,629
and on the Joe the rear hand went
first do you get

318
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:51,639
first do you get
 

319
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,870
first do you get
it the concept is that one hand is Yin

320
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
it the concept is that one hand is Yin
 

321
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,750
it the concept is that one hand is Yin
and one hand is Young they're not doing

322
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:56,760
and one hand is Young they're not doing
 

323
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,629
and one hand is Young they're not doing
the same thing in this technique the KN

324
00:10:59,629 --> 00:10:59,639
the same thing in this technique the KN
 

325
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,829
the same thing in this technique the KN
hand is doing it first and the rear hand

326
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:02,839
hand is doing it first and the rear hand
 

327
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,470
hand is doing it first and the rear hand
is following okay so when I go boom

328
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
is following okay so when I go boom
 

329
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,030
is following okay so when I go boom
through here the Le hand is going first

330
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
through here the Le hand is going first
 

331
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,550
through here the Le hand is going first
okay and that is because once when you

332
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
okay and that is because once when you
 

333
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,030
okay and that is because once when you
project you you have a slight

334
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,040
project you you have a slight
 

335
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,389
project you you have a slight
moment of seizure of the center okay

336
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
moment of seizure of the center okay
 

337
