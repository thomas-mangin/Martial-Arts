00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,550

hi I'm Christopher Hine and today we're

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:02,560
hi I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
 

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,749
hi I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
going to talk about some more a timi

4
00:00:04,749 --> 00:00:04,759
going to talk about some more a timi
 

5
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,150
going to talk about some more a timi
waza so this is the last little part I

6
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,160
waza so this is the last little part I
 

7
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,390
waza so this is the last little part I
was talking to you guys about uh in the

8
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,400
was talking to you guys about uh in the
 

9
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,910
was talking to you guys about uh in the
receiving a timi waza and how not to do

10
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
receiving a timi waza and how not to do
 

11
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,789
receiving a timi waza and how not to do
that silly thing and how distance is

12
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:13,799
that silly thing and how distance is
 

13
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,349
that silly thing and how distance is
important and how to actually correctly

14
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:16,359
important and how to actually correctly
 

15
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,830
important and how to actually correctly
follow the context as as I outline it in

16
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
follow the context as as I outline it in
 

17
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,029
follow the context as as I outline it in
my Approach anyway so if you're

18
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
my Approach anyway so if you're
 

19
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,790
my Approach anyway so if you're
interested in how I talk about that this

20
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:22,800
interested in how I talk about that this
 

21
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,109
interested in how I talk about that this
video is for you I'm going to call Josh

22
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:24,119
video is for you I'm going to call Josh
 

23
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,109
video is for you I'm going to call Josh
over here we're going to go to work

24
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:28,119

 

25
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,589

Josh all right so so let's talk about

26
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
Josh all right so so let's talk about
 

27
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,110
Josh all right so so let's talk about
receiving a Tim waza and this is the

28
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
receiving a Tim waza and this is the
 

29
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,030
receiving a Tim waza and this is the
last one in the receiving series on a

30
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
last one in the receiving series on a
 

31
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,430
last one in the receiving series on a
Timmy waza that I'm going to talk about

32
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
Timmy waza that I'm going to talk about
 

33
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,470
Timmy waza that I'm going to talk about
so I think a really important thing to

34
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:39,480
so I think a really important thing to
 

35
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,310
so I think a really important thing to
remember and that we always forget is

36
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
remember and that we always forget is
 

37
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,190
remember and that we always forget is
that we should be keeping a distance of

38
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
that we should be keeping a distance of
 

39
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,389
that we should be keeping a distance of
our on step ma ey or greater when we're

40
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
our on step ma ey or greater when we're
 

41
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,229
our on step ma ey or greater when we're
dealing with someone who has a weapon

42
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
dealing with someone who has a weapon
 

43
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,590
dealing with someone who has a weapon
right so so in the last series we talked

44
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:52,600
right so so in the last series we talked
 

45
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,670
right so so in the last series we talked
that the reason we have the atimi waza

46
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:54,680
that the reason we have the atimi waza
 

47
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,270
that the reason we have the atimi waza
we have in iido is because there's a

48
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:56,280
we have in iido is because there's a
 

49
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,110
we have in iido is because there's a
weapon at play right and then we talked

50
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:58,120
weapon at play right and then we talked
 

51
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,110
weapon at play right and then we talked
about how our basic ideas about that is

52
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,120
about how our basic ideas about that is
 

53
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,270
about how our basic ideas about that is
to get my hand up and then if my timing

54
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:02,280
to get my hand up and then if my timing
 

55
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,990
to get my hand up and then if my timing
is such I make some kind of blend with

56
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
is such I make some kind of blend with
 

57
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,070
is such I make some kind of blend with
it that's that works really well for me

58
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
it that's that works really well for me
 

59
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,990
it that's that works really well for me
right okay now understand that I

60
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,000
right okay now understand that I
 

61
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,590
right okay now understand that I
shouldn't be waiting for him to get to

62
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
shouldn't be waiting for him to get to
 

63
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,109
shouldn't be waiting for him to get to
the the distance that he wants to attack

64
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:14,119
the the distance that he wants to attack
 

65
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:16,390
the the distance that he wants to attack
me because it's likely that if he gets

66
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
me because it's likely that if he gets
 

67
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,590
me because it's likely that if he gets
to that distance he's going to cut me

68
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:18,600
to that distance he's going to cut me
 

69
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,469
to that distance he's going to cut me
before I can do anything right so I'm

70
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
before I can do anything right so I'm
 

71
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,590
before I can do anything right so I'm
putting myself behind by always doing

72
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:22,600
putting myself behind by always doing
 

73
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,990
putting myself behind by always doing
that so what I'm trying to do is

74
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,000
that so what I'm trying to do is
 

75
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,190
that so what I'm trying to do is
increase the distance to at least this

76
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
increase the distance to at least this
 

77
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,109
increase the distance to at least this
distance or greater so that way I

78
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:30,119
distance or greater so that way I
 

79
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,429
distance or greater so that way I
dictate when he strikes right now I can

80
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
dictate when he strikes right now I can
 

81
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,149
dictate when he strikes right now I can
only dictate it so much because he

82
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:35,159
only dictate it so much because he
 

83
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,429
only dictate it so much because he
always has to choose when to strike so

84
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
always has to choose when to strike so
 

85
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,190
always has to choose when to strike so
there's going to be certain times when

86
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
there's going to be certain times when
 

87
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,590
there's going to be certain times when
I'm looking for him to strike right

88
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:40,600
I'm looking for him to strike right
 

89
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,310
I'm looking for him to strike right
whether he gets me in a corner or

90
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
whether he gets me in a corner or
 

91
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,149
whether he gets me in a corner or
whether um he thinks he's running up on

92
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
whether um he thinks he's running up on
 

93
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,350
whether um he thinks he's running up on
me whatever it is and those are the

94
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
me whatever it is and those are the
 

95
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,749
me whatever it is and those are the
moments I'm looking for and that's when

96
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:46,759
moments I'm looking for and that's when
 

97
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,149
moments I'm looking for and that's when
I have to make my blend so lots and lots

98
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:49,159
I have to make my blend so lots and lots
 

99
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,270
I have to make my blend so lots and lots
of training from this one step distance

100
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
of training from this one step distance
 

101
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,230
of training from this one step distance
is important because ideally if you're

102
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,240
is important because ideally if you're
 

103
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,190
is important because ideally if you're
working it right they won't get inside

104
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
working it right they won't get inside
 

105
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,670
working it right they won't get inside
of that one-step distance once they get

106
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:56,680
of that one-step distance once they get
 

107
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,429
of that one-step distance once they get
inside that one step distance he has all

108
00:01:58,429 --> 00:01:58,439
inside that one step distance he has all
 

109
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,270
inside that one step distance he has all
the advantage right but at the one step

110
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,280
the advantage right but at the one step
 

111
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,590
the advantage right but at the one step
distance I have enough time to actually

112
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
distance I have enough time to actually
 

113
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,429
distance I have enough time to actually
blend successfully with him okay now

114
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
blend successfully with him okay now
 

115
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,950
blend successfully with him okay now
this is where we get away from the I'm

116
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:05,960
this is where we get away from the I'm
 

117
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,190
this is where we get away from the I'm
coming bro with the the the knife way up

118
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,200
coming bro with the the the knife way up
 

119
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,309
coming bro with the the the knife way up
in the air right okay what should be

120
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
in the air right okay what should be
 

121
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,630
in the air right okay what should be
happening is Josh should just be

122
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:11,640
happening is Josh should just be
 

123
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,270
happening is Josh should just be
normally tracking me around right we

124
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
normally tracking me around right we
 

125
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,910
normally tracking me around right we
only got so much room but he should just

126
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:14,920
only got so much room but he should just
 

127
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,910
only got so much room but he should just
be normally trying to track me like this

128
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:16,920
be normally trying to track me like this
 

129
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,430
be normally trying to track me like this
okay now notice he doesn't have to hold

130
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,440
okay now notice he doesn't have to hold
 

131
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,589
okay now notice he doesn't have to hold
the knife up in the air he doesn't have

132
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
the knife up in the air he doesn't have
 

133
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,750
the knife up in the air he doesn't have
to run he doesn't have to Signal

134
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:20,760
to run he doesn't have to Signal
 

135
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,229
to run he doesn't have to Signal
anything my job is to keep him at the

136
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
anything my job is to keep him at the
 

137
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,949
anything my job is to keep him at the
distance where it's difficult for him to

138
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:25,959
distance where it's difficult for him to
 

139
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,110
distance where it's difficult for him to
attack me and he'll have to Lunge in to

140
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,120
attack me and he'll have to Lunge in to
 

141
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,190
attack me and he'll have to Lunge in to
get me right so that's what dick Ates

142
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,200
get me right so that's what dick Ates
 

143
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,550
get me right so that's what dick Ates
that now a lot of times as UK we run in

144
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
that now a lot of times as UK we run in
 

145
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,910
that now a lot of times as UK we run in
like this because we wanted to know

146
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
like this because we wanted to know
 

147
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,630
like this because we wanted to know
we're coming with a yokan and a showman

148
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:35,640
we're coming with a yokan and a showman
 

149
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,869
we're coming with a yokan and a showman
right so we're being nice that you

150
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:37,879
right so we're being nice that you
 

151
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,070
right so we're being nice that you
shouldn't do that he should just keep

152
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,080
shouldn't do that he should just keep
 

153
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,790
shouldn't do that he should just keep
his hands down and I should be trying to

154
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
his hands down and I should be trying to
 

155
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,750
his hands down and I should be trying to
make that distance constantly and then

156
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:42,760
make that distance constantly and then
 

157
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,710
make that distance constantly and then
all of a sudden when he thinks he can

158
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
all of a sudden when he thinks he can
 

159
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,030
all of a sudden when he thinks he can
strike he will lunge and that's when I

160
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
strike he will lunge and that's when I
 

161
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,750
strike he will lunge and that's when I
need to be able to make good blends with

162
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:48,760
need to be able to make good blends with
 

163
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,149
need to be able to make good blends with
him right so my good blend comes because

164
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:51,159
him right so my good blend comes because
 

165
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,030
him right so my good blend comes because
there was an opportunity for him inside

166
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
there was an opportunity for him inside
 

167
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,190
there was an opportunity for him inside
of that distance to make it work so

168
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
of that distance to make it work so
 

169
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,869
of that distance to make it work so
that's how we get rid of the big I'm

170
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
that's how we get rid of the big I'm
 

171
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,949
that's how we get rid of the big I'm
coming for you bro thing and that's how

172
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
coming for you bro thing and that's how
 

173
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,309
coming for you bro thing and that's how
we should always be setting up our Gaza

174
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:01,319
we should always be setting up our Gaza
 

175
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,710
we should always be setting up our Gaza
don't think that I am trying to get the

176
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:03,720
don't think that I am trying to get the
 

177
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,190
don't think that I am trying to get the
knife from him what I'm always trying to

178
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
knife from him what I'm always trying to
 

179
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,830
knife from him what I'm always trying to
do is just keep distance if I could

180
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:06,840
do is just keep distance if I could
 

181
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,110
do is just keep distance if I could
spend all my geaz a time just keeping

182
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
spend all my geaz a time just keeping
 

183
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,789
spend all my geaz a time just keeping
distance from him then that's what I

184
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:10,799
distance from him then that's what I
 

185
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,270
distance from him then that's what I
would do and that's different than the

186
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,280
would do and that's different than the
 

187
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,670
would do and that's different than the
drills right so remember the drills we

188
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
drills right so remember the drills we
 

189
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,390
drills right so remember the drills we
had all the flowing drills right I want

190
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:15,400
had all the flowing drills right I want
 

191
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,070
had all the flowing drills right I want
to practice him coming in and then

192
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:17,080
to practice him coming in and then
 

193
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,470
to practice him coming in and then
switching over and then me having to

194
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
switching over and then me having to
 

195
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,990
switching over and then me having to
deal with that attack and then him

196
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
deal with that attack and then him
 

197
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,390
deal with that attack and then him
switching over and me having to deal

198
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:21,400
switching over and me having to deal
 

199
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,990
switching over and me having to deal
with that attack and so forth and so on

200
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,000
with that attack and so forth and so on
 

201
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,030
with that attack and so forth and so on
right so those drills train us how to

202
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
right so those drills train us how to
 

203
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,390
right so those drills train us how to
adapt to the Blends but in our Geo Wasa

204
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,400
adapt to the Blends but in our Geo Wasa
 

205
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,910
adapt to the Blends but in our Geo Wasa
time we should be trying to keep a great

206
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:28,920
time we should be trying to keep a great
 

207
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,110
time we should be trying to keep a great
distance that's what we're learning is

208
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,120
distance that's what we're learning is
 

209
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,910
distance that's what we're learning is
to keep distance and he'll be practicing

210
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
to keep distance and he'll be practicing
 

211
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,630
to keep distance and he'll be practicing
trying to work us into the corners and

212
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:33,640
trying to work us into the corners and
 

213
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,830
trying to work us into the corners and
as he works us into the corners he's

214
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:34,840
as he works us into the corners he's
 

215
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,350
as he works us into the corners he's
going to find times it's good for him to

216
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,360
going to find times it's good for him to
 

217
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,390
going to find times it's good for him to
attack now I should be highly aware that

218
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
attack now I should be highly aware that
 

219
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,270
attack now I should be highly aware that
time and be ready to blend with it right

220
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,280
time and be ready to blend with it right
 

221
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,789
time and be ready to blend with it right
so that's the basic progression there's

222
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
so that's the basic progression there's
 

223
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,830
so that's the basic progression there's
no big secret there other than to to

224
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
no big secret there other than to to
 

225
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,910
no big secret there other than to to
conceptually understand what's going on

226
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:46,920
conceptually understand what's going on
 

227
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,589
conceptually understand what's going on
I don't want to get in close to a guy

disadvantaged by having to Lunge out far

234
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:54,599
disadvantaged by having to Lunge out far
 

235
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,990
disadvantaged by having to Lunge out far
to get me and in that lunging out far is

236
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,000
to get me and in that lunging out far is
 

237
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,229
to get me and in that lunging out far is

become good for him so really what you
 

247
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,390
become good for him so really what you
should be practicing is how to keep the

super secret mystery but that's
 

255
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,870
