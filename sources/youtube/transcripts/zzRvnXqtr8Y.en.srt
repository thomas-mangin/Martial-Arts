he kind of did it very more common

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
he kind of did it very more common
 

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,870
he kind of did it very more common
way uh

10
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:17,880
way uh
 

11
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,750

okay um looking at the technique his

54
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,040
okay um looking at the technique his
 

55
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,350
okay um looking at the technique his
line is

56
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
line is
 

57
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,069
line is
here this angle here the EDI angle

58
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:45,079
here this angle here the EDI angle
 

59
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:52,630
here this angle here the EDI angle
see the other angle is here see

60
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640

 

61
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,830

so back leg here oriented towards his

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
adjustment that you
 

87
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,790
adjustment that you
did I'll do it again so

88
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:43,800
did I'll do it again so
 

89
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,550
did I'll do it again so
enter and I take that angle and I got

90
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
enter and I take that angle and I got
 

91
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,869
enter and I take that angle and I got
off the line of attack

92
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
off the line of attack
 

93
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,589
off the line of attack
now the other one you stay on the line

94
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:52,599
now the other one you stay on the line
 

95
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,550
now the other one you stay on the line
of attack they see he didn't like

96
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:57,560
of attack they see he didn't like
 

97
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,070
of attack they see he didn't like
that however

98
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,080
that however
 

99
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,509
that however
what you soon

100
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:02,519
what you soon
 

101
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,070
what you soon
learn is that the outer

102
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
learn is that the outer
 

103
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,110
learn is that the outer
deltoid is

104
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:13,400

 

107
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,270

engaged this way do you

108
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:18,280
engaged this way do you
 

109
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,830
engaged this way do you
see and it's a very weak muscle

110
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:22,840

 

111
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,710

group so people start to

112
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
group so people start to
 

113
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,229
group so people start to
go dominate on this hand

114
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
go dominate on this hand
 

115
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,190
go dominate on this hand
which is a big muscle group chest area

116
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,200
which is a big muscle group chest area
 

117
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,710
which is a big muscle group chest area
Okay and then what happens though is

118
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:37,720
Okay and then what happens though is
 

119
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,229
Okay and then what happens though is
your hands are not in the same plane

120
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
your hands are not in the same plane
 

121
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,789
your hands are not in the same plane
anymore you see you're all split up

122
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:47,799

 

123
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,710

here also when the elbow comes to

124
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:51,720
here also when the elbow comes to
 

125
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,110
here also when the elbow comes to
dominate The

126
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
dominate The
 

127
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,830

Movement you now are no better off in

128
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
Movement you now are no better off in
 

129
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,229
Movement you now are no better off in
terms of staying on the line of attack

130
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:01,239
terms of staying on the line of attack
 

131
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,949
terms of staying on the line of attack
in terms of the attack is usually also

132
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
in terms of the attack is usually also
 

133
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,470
in terms of the attack is usually also
the line of their Mass which means it'll

134
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
the line of their Mass which means it'll
 

135
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,750
the line of their Mass which means it'll
be the line of the resistance so when I

136
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
be the line of the resistance so when I
 

137
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,390
be the line of the resistance so when I
come

138
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:13,400
come
 

139
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,830
come

140
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:16,840
around pushing That Elbow is pushing his
 

141
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,909
around pushing That Elbow is pushing his
entire Mass you understand okay

142
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
entire Mass you understand okay
 

143
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,230
entire Mass you understand okay
so I got to move my body into the Emi

144
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
so I got to move my body into the Emi
 

145
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,310
so I got to move my body into the Emi
angle can't go can't go here

00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
into that me angle I just did it with a
 

153
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,749
into that me angle I just did it with a
yield you see I didn't

154
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:44,759

 

155
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,870

enter Then you have it you in the 10

156
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
enter Then you have it you in the 10
 

157
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,270

okay

158
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:52,280

 

159
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,270

um I have to figure out how to keep my

160
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
um I have to figure out how to keep my
 

161
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,790
um I have to figure out how to keep my
hands in the same plane to gain all the

162
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:57,800
hands in the same plane to gain all the
 

163
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,189
hands in the same plane to gain all the
benefits of that

164
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:00,199
benefits of that
 

165
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,749
benefits of that
because this is very open this is very

166
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:02,759
because this is very open this is very
 

167
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,629
because this is very open this is very
Compact and most fighting is compact you

168
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:05,639
Compact and most fighting is compact you
 

169
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,790
Compact and most fighting is compact you
don't you don't do that in real real

170
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
don't you don't do that in real real
 

171
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,310
don't you don't do that in real real
stuff

172
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320

 

173
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,310

um there's a reason

174
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:15,320
um there's a reason
 

175
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,270
um there's a reason
why the deltoid is noted as being weak

176
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,280
why the deltoid is noted as being weak
 

177
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,950
why the deltoid is noted as being weak
which justifies the reason for the elbow

178
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
which justifies the reason for the elbow
 

179
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,270
which justifies the reason for the elbow
hand starting to dominate the technique

180
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,280
hand starting to dominate the technique
 

181
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,550
hand starting to dominate the technique
and it is

182
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:27,560
and it is
 

183
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,749
and it is
because it is done

184
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
because it is done
 

185
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,550

externally only okay and when I go

186
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
externally only okay and when I go
 

187
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,510
externally only okay and when I go
external there's something else you'll

188
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
external there's something else you'll
 

189
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,189
external there's something else you'll
notice his elbow and his hand are in

190
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:44,199
notice his elbow and his hand are in
 

191
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,510
notice his elbow and his hand are in
different planes as mine are in

192
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:46,520
different planes as mine are in
 

193
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,510
different planes as mine are in
different planes so the fact that my

194
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
different planes so the fact that my
 

195
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,990
different planes so the fact that my
hands are in the same plane would have

196
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
hands are in the same plane would have
 

197
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,390
hands are in the same plane would have
to mean that his elbow and his wrist is

198
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:55,400
to mean that his elbow and his wrist is
 

199
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,189
to mean that his elbow and his wrist is
in the same plane so again my hands are

200
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
in the same plane so again my hands are
 

201
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,430
in the same plane so again my hands are
in different ples Al so is his elbow and

202
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:02,440
in different ples Al so is his elbow and
 

203
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,909
in different ples Al so is his elbow and
hand same thing I go over here same

204
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
hand same thing I go over here same
 

205

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:11,960
hand are in different vertical
 

209
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,029
hand are in different vertical
planes as my elbow and hand move out of

210
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
planes as my elbow and hand move out of
 

211
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,469
planes as my elbow and hand move out of
the way are in different planes

212

grip do you understand so I'm not
 

347
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,310
grip do you understand so I'm not
pulling

348
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
pulling
 

349
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,310
pulling
him the right at the moment I don't want

350
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
him the right at the moment I don't want
 

351
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,509
him the right at the moment I don't want
to lift it up but I don't want him

352
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:50,519
to lift it up but I don't want him
 

353
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,190
to lift it up but I don't want him
pushing me down where he wants so I'm

354
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:54,200
pushing me down where he wants so I'm
 

355
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,389
pushing me down where he wants so I'm
not on the positive side and I'm not on

356
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
not on the positive side and I'm not on
 

357
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,430
not on the positive side and I'm not on
the negative side either I'm

358
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:02,440
the negative side either I'm
 

359
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,030
the negative side either I'm
at the middle zero and so when I do

360
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,040
at the middle zero and so when I do
 

361
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,430
at the middle zero and so when I do
that I now am going to get stuck to him

362
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
that I now am going to get stuck to him
 

363
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,590
that I now am going to get stuck to him
he's going to get stuck to me okay so

364
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
he's going to get stuck to me okay so
 

365
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,949
he's going to get stuck to me okay so
you kind of open your grip right and

366
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:15,959
you kind of open your grip right and
 

367
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,829
you kind of open your grip right and
this is the thing that I

368
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:18,839
this is the thing that I
 

369
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,110
this is the thing that I
move okay usually the beginner mistake

370
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
move okay usually the beginner mistake
 

371
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,150
move okay usually the beginner mistake
is they go away and they're pulling him

372
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
is they go away and they're pulling him
 

373
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,670
is they go away and they're pulling him
in you see an adhesion in

374
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
in you see an adhesion in
 

375
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,110
in you see an adhesion in
okay so you're going to stick you're

376
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
okay so you're going to stick you're
 

377
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,269
okay so you're going to stick you're
going to adhere and then you're going to

378
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
going to adhere and then you're going to
 

379
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,389
going to adhere and then you're going to
project okay and he's going away from

380
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:40,399
project okay and he's going away from
 

381
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,790
project okay and he's going away from
you

382
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:41,800
you
 

383
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,990
you
now you have to follow after the

384
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,000
now you have to follow after the
 

385
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,030
now you have to follow after the
projection so he projected he moved that

386
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,040
projection so he projected he moved that
 

387
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,030
projection so he projected he moved that
way so he made Yin space that allows for

388
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
way so he made Yin space that allows for
 

389
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,069
way so he made Yin space that allows for
my EDI which is Yang movement do you

390
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
my EDI which is Yang movement do you
 

391
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,069
my EDI which is Yang movement do you
understand but it's space cannot be

392
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
understand but it's space cannot be
 

393
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,550
understand but it's space cannot be
disconnected from time so when I go

394
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:03,560
disconnected from time so when I go
 

395
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,430
disconnected from time so when I go
here now there's not really in space

396
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
here now there's not really in space
 

397
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,310
here now there's not really in space
it's up for the it's up for grabs

398
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
it's up for the it's up for grabs
 

399
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,030
it's up for the it's up for grabs
because I didn't follow him and now I'm

400
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
because I didn't follow him and now I'm
 

401
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,509
because I didn't follow him and now I'm
going to do a new

402
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:18,519

 

403
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:21,470

movement can't do that with my

404
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:21,480
movement can't do that with my
 

405
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,030
movement can't do that with my
finger

406
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
finger
 

407
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,990
finger
so I have the connection Boom the

408
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,000
so I have the connection Boom the
 

409
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,230
so I have the connection Boom the
projection and I'm already here when he

410
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:31,240
projection and I'm already here when he
 

411
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,670
projection and I'm already here when he
hits that

412
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:32,680
hits that
 

413
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,910
hits that
spot not here when he hits that spot

414
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:37,920
spot not here when he hits that spot
 

415
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,949
spot not here when he hits that spot
okay so I

416
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
okay so I
 

417
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,350
okay so I
could done this is I wouldn't do that

418
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:44,360
could done this is I wouldn't do that
 

419
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,590
could done this is I wouldn't do that
the technique opening is

420
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
the technique opening is
 

421
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,269
the technique opening is
gone so you

422
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:50,279
gone so you
 

423
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,470
gone so you
project

424
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
project
 

425
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,670
project
you already

426
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:56,680

 

427
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:07,710

falling so

428
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:07,720

 

429
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,069

different you

different you
 

431
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,829
different you
see so you'll feel as he as his energy

432
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
see so you'll feel as he as his energy
 

433
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,269
see so you'll feel as he as his energy
hits here and it goes off it's going the

434
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:16,279
hits here and it goes off it's going the
 

435
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,790
hits here and it goes off it's going the
other way you follow to keep that

436
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
other way you follow to keep that
 

437
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,750
other way you follow to keep that
adhesion do you

438
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760

 

439
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,710

understand

440

understand
 

441
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,670
understand
you can't wait there and allow the

you can't wait there and allow the
 

443
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,760
you can't wait there and allow the
separation okay try
