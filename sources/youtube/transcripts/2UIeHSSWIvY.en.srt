of index um that is a term for me I've
 

11
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,110
of index um that is a term for me I've
only recently started using it a lot

12

only recently started using it a lot
 

13
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,749
only recently started using it a lot
although I've been playing with this

14
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:14,759
although I've been playing with this
 

15
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,630
although I've been playing with this
concept a lot I just didn't really have

16
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
concept a lot I just didn't really have
 

17
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,950
concept a lot I just didn't really have
a good term for it basically the index

18
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
a good term for it basically the index
 

19
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,269
a good term for it basically the index

00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:28,679
and I'm using it in that way which is um
 

27
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,269
and I'm using it in that way which is um

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
about and I think it can be outlined a
 

39
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,510
about and I think it can be outlined a
little differently than those Concepts

he might might do that because um I have
 

105
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,230
he might might do that because um I have
gotten far away so maybe he was striking

position over this one so you see it in
 

123
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,589
position over this one so you see it in
the forms all the time you might not

the forms all the time you might not
 

125
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,509
the forms all the time you might not
recognize it but that little piece is in

now we got to understand what's

132
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:28,440
now we got to understand what's

there's a whole bunch of stuff that's
 

137
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,670
there's a whole bunch of stuff that's
going on one is in his mind he has got

138
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
going on one is in his mind he has got
 

139
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,949
going on one is in his mind he has got
the idea that that's a good move for

140
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:37,959
the idea that that's a good move for
 

141
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,229

whatever reason because I'm backing up

142
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:39,239
whatever reason because I'm backing up
 

143
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,070
whatever reason because I'm backing up
or because I'm coming in okay then he

144
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
or because I'm coming in okay then he
 

145
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,430
or because I'm coming in okay then he
has to start the action so the start of

146
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,440
has to start the action so the start of
 

147
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,670
has to start the action so the start of
the action's like right there right

148
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
the action's like right there right
 

149
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,750
the action's like right there right
that's the start of the action he's

150
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:46,760
that's the start of the action he's
 

151
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,670
that's the start of the action he's
begun the action then he has to deliver

152
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
begun the action then he has to deliver
 

153
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,910
begun the action then he has to deliver
the action and then there's the

154
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
the action and then there's the
 

155
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,390
the action and then there's the
conclusion of the action right so that's

156
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:53,400
conclusion of the action right so that's
 

157
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,990
conclusion of the action right so that's
the conclusion of the action so all that

158
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,000
the conclusion of the action so all that
 

159
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,589
the conclusion of the action so all that
stuff has to happen every time he wants

160
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:56,599
stuff has to happen every time he wants
 

161
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,190
stuff has to happen every time he wants
to do something right he doesn't just

162
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,200
to do something right he doesn't just
 

163
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,390
to do something right he doesn't just
think something in his head and then

164
00:02:59,390 --> 00:02:59,400
think something in his head and then
 

165
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,190
think something in his head and then
instantly it happens now there's a

166
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
instantly it happens now there's a
 

167
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,470
instantly it happens now there's a
moment that I catch him in that right so

168
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:05,480
moment that I catch him in that right so
 

169
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,110
moment that I catch him in that right so
meaning that I could say Josh has the

170
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
meaning that I could say Josh has the
 

171
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,110
meaning that I could say Josh has the
intent to come and hit me and I go boom

172
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,120
intent to come and hit me and I go boom
 

173
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,589
intent to come and hit me and I go boom
right so on his intent to hit me I hit

174
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:14,599
right so on his intent to hit me I hit
 

175
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,350
right so on his intent to hit me I hit
him before he can do anything right

176
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
him before he can do anything right
 

177
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,630
him before he can do anything right
that's one index is Josh's intent went

178
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:19,640
that's one index is Josh's intent went
 

179
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,270
that's one index is Josh's intent went
somewhere and I caught the intent okay

180
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,280
somewhere and I caught the intent okay
 

181
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,030
somewhere and I caught the intent okay
could be that Josh has begun his action

182
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,040
could be that Josh has begun his action
 

183
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,070
could be that Josh has begun his action
and I go boom right and I come in there

184
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
and I go boom right and I come in there
 

185
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,789
and I go boom right and I come in there
and I get him so I caught him the index

186
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
and I get him so I caught him the index
 

187
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,190
and I get him so I caught him the index
was right there when he started his

188
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,200
was right there when he started his
 

189
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,710
was right there when he started his
action could be Josh is in the middle of

190
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
action could be Josh is in the middle of
 

191
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,470
action could be Josh is in the middle of
delivery boom right okay could be that

192
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
delivery boom right okay could be that
 

193
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,869
delivery boom right okay could be that
Josh has completed his action boom and

194
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:39,879
Josh has completed his action boom and
 

195
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,910
Josh has completed his action boom and
there are different answers I'll have

196
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
there are different answers I'll have
 

197
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,509
there are different answers I'll have
and different things that I need to do

198
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519
and different things that I need to do
 

199
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,990
and different things that I need to do
for each and every one of those and

200
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
for each and every one of those and
 

201
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,070
for each and every one of those and
depending on where I catch him I'll have

202
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
depending on where I catch him I'll have
 

203
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,750
depending on where I catch him I'll have
a different set of answers so it's

204
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
a different set of answers so it's
 

205
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,830
a different set of answers so it's
important to understand that you know

206
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
important to understand that you know
 

207
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,949
important to understand that you know
when we're looking at forms we're

208
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
when we're looking at forms we're
 

209
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,030
when we're looking at forms we're
looking kind of at snapshots of things

210
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
looking kind of at snapshots of things
 

211
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,429
looking kind of at snapshots of things
but there's a whole giant gray area in

212
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
but there's a whole giant gray area in
 

213
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,470
but there's a whole giant gray area in
between so let's say I caught him at the

214
00:03:59,470 --> 00:03:59,480
between so let's say I caught him at the
 

215
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,470
between so let's say I caught him at the
first index so Josh has the intent he

216
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:01,480
first index so Josh has the intent he
 

217
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,470
first index so Josh has the intent he
hasn't even begun to move yet and I'm so

218
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,480
hasn't even begun to move yet and I'm so
 

219
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,350
hasn't even begun to move yet and I'm so
quick I can get in here now look I'm in

220
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
quick I can get in here now look I'm in
 

221
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,350
quick I can get in here now look I'm in
between his arms so if Josh goes to

222
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
between his arms so if Josh goes to
 

223
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,990
between his arms so if Josh goes to
transition into anything else right I

224
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,000
transition into anything else right I
 

225
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,429
transition into anything else right I
can work with his arms and I can move

226
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:10,439
can work with his arms and I can move
 

227
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,390
can work with his arms and I can move
him wherever I want so that's the next

228
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
him wherever I want so that's the next
 

229
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,350
him wherever I want so that's the next
set of skills on that right let's say

230
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
set of skills on that right let's say
 

231
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,229
set of skills on that right let's say
Josh starts to come in I hit him here

232
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:17,239
Josh starts to come in I hit him here
 

233
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,670
Josh starts to come in I hit him here
before he's even developed into the

234
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:18,680
before he's even developed into the
 

235
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,030
before he's even developed into the
second part of the Starke I'm probably

236
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,040
second part of the Starke I'm probably
 

237
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,590
second part of the Starke I'm probably
going to blast him and he's going to fly

238
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
going to blast him and he's going to fly
 

239
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,030
going to blast him and he's going to fly
away and I won't have to even deal with

240
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
away and I won't have to even deal with
 

241
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,670
away and I won't have to even deal with
him because I hit him at just the right

242
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:24,680
him because I hit him at just the right
 

243
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,350
him because I hit him at just the right
cycle okay let's say he's a little

244
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:26,360
cycle okay let's say he's a little
 

245
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,110
cycle okay let's say he's a little
further in delivery there and I hit him

246
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,120
further in delivery there and I hit him
 

247
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,310
further in delivery there and I hit him
here I'm almost certainly going to have

248
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:29,320
here I'm almost certainly going to have
 

249
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,270
here I'm almost certainly going to have
to cover my head after I hit because

250
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,280
to cover my head after I hit because
 

251
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,110
to cover my head after I hit because
he's far enough forward that even after

252
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,120
he's far enough forward that even after
 

253
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,310
he's far enough forward that even after
I hit him he's probably going to fold

254
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:35,320
I hit him he's probably going to fold
 

255
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,830
I hit him he's probably going to fold
and hit me anyways okay could be that I

256
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
and hit me anyways okay could be that I
 

257
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,189
and hit me anyways okay could be that I
can't even get in there and then I'm

258
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
can't even get in there and then I'm
 

259
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,830
can't even get in there and then I'm
certainly going to have to cover my head

260
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
certainly going to have to cover my head
 

261
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,310
certainly going to have to cover my head
and defend myself okay so you can see

262
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:43,320
and defend myself okay so you can see
 

263
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,590
and defend myself okay so you can see
this kind of practice echoed in uh sin

264
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:46,600
this kind of practice echoed in uh sin
 

265
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,430
this kind of practice echoed in uh sin
no go no and sin no uh and you can see

266
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
no go no and sin no uh and you can see
 

267
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,510
no go no and sin no uh and you can see
this practice um echoed in uh the VOR

268
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:52,520
this practice um echoed in uh the VOR
 

269
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,749
this practice um echoed in uh the VOR
the indis and the no if you say German

270
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:54,759
the indis and the no if you say German
 

271
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,790
the indis and the no if you say German
German work um but the idea is that

272
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
German work um but the idea is that
 

273
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,710
German work um but the idea is that
there's an index of time and in this

274
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
there's an index of time and in this
 

275
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,510
there's an index of time and in this
index of time all all kinds of different

276
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:00,520
index of time all all kinds of different
 

277
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,230
index of time all all kinds of different
stuff can be happening but I think just

278
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
stuff can be happening but I think just
 

279
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,310
stuff can be happening but I think just
being aware that this exists will kind

280
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
being aware that this exists will kind
 

281
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,790
being aware that this exists will kind
of help you understand the forms in a

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:05,800
of help you understand the forms in a
