00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,549

um and again like there's a lot of good

10
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:13,559
um and again like there's a lot of good
 

11
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,430
um and again like there's a lot of good
in what you're doing that's why I'm now

12
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
in what you're doing that's why I'm now
 

13
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,109
in what you're doing that's why I'm now
picking on the on the you know picking

00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:18,119
picking on the on the you know picking
 

15
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,830
picking on the on the you know picking
on the architectural elements because

16
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:20,840
on the architectural elements because
 

17
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,230
on the architectural elements because
they're not a freefor all because they

18
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,240
they're not a freefor all because they
 

19
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,349
they're not a freefor all because they
are

20
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:24,359
are
 

21
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,070
are
extensions of the truth of everything

00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:27,080
extensions of the truth of everything

00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,320
um that for that reason and in that way
 

29
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,510
um that for that reason and in that way

places there acceleration throws so I'm

44
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
places there acceleration throws so I'm
 

45
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,749
places there acceleration throws so I'm
here and I

46
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:06,759
here and I
 

47
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:09,590
here and I
like and I go and you know there's

48
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
like and I go and you know there's
 

49
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,190
like and I go and you know there's
different versions of it or or what have

50
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:12,200
different versions of it or or what have
 

51
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,950
different versions of it or or what have
you it doesn't really freaking matter

52
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
you it doesn't really freaking matter
 

53
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,030
you it doesn't really freaking matter
but all you're really doing is using his

54
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
but all you're really doing is using his
 

55
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,950
but all you're really doing is using his
hand to lower his

56
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:21,960
hand to lower his
 

57
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,950
hand to lower his
head and inertia takes over okay that

58
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
head and inertia takes over okay that
 

59
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,550
head and inertia takes over okay that
that's how they throw

60
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
that's how they throw
 

61
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,230
that's how they throw
okay so it's really nothing than if I

62
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
okay so it's really nothing than if I
 

63
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,630
okay so it's really nothing than if I
was here and I shoved him like that

64
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:37,640
was here and I shoved him like that
 

65
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,030
was here and I shoved him like that
that's that's all it is okay uh and we

66
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
that's that's all it is okay uh and we
 

67
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,670
that's that's all it is okay uh and we
know from my kazushi pattern analysis

68
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
know from my kazushi pattern analysis
 

69
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,630
know from my kazushi pattern analysis
that takes a lot of force to take an

70
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
that takes a lot of force to take an
 

71
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,709
that takes a lot of force to take an
upright body and reverse it in one

72
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:52,719
upright body and reverse it in one
 

73
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,310
upright body and reverse it in one
vertical plane that takes a lot of

74
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:55,320
vertical plane that takes a lot of
 

75
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,990
vertical plane that takes a lot of
energy to turn this what we want to do

76
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,000
energy to turn this what we want to do
 

77
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,149
energy to turn this what we want to do
instead is multiple planes um and so

78
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:03,159
instead is multiple planes um and so
 

79
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,990
instead is multiple planes um and so
then it gets light so this is when I

80
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,000

 

81
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,910

show this

82
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:10,920
show this
 

83
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,990
show this
is this force to move this Topsy Turvy

84
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
is this force to move this Topsy Turvy
 

85
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,750
is this force to move this Topsy Turvy
in one plane is

86
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:18,760
in one plane is
 

87
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,190
in one plane is
extremely um

88
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
extremely um
 

89
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,030
extremely um
cost um it raises the C the energy

90
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,040
cost um it raises the C the energy
 

91
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,470
cost um it raises the C the energy
expenditure you need more of it but if

92
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
expenditure you need more of it but if
 

93
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,150
expenditure you need more of it but if
you tilt it if you if you have this

94
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,160
you tilt it if you if you have this
 

95
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,509
you tilt it if you if you have this
plane and you have this plane and you

96
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:32,519
plane and you have this plane and you
 

97
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,830
plane and you have this plane and you
combine the two it gets very light at

98
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
combine the two it gets very light at
 

99
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,990
combine the two it gets very light at
that point this is heavier because

100
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,000
that point this is heavier because
 

101
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,750
that point this is heavier because
that's acting as a resistance to me

102
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
that's acting as a resistance to me
 

103
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,470
that's acting as a resistance to me
pushing it down but if you take it this

104
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
pushing it down but if you take it this
 

105
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,149
pushing it down but if you take it this
way then as it feeds it around with the

106
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:48,159
way then as it feeds it around with the
 

107
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,910
way then as it feeds it around with the
centrifugal energy it's pushing this one

108
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
centrifugal energy it's pushing this one
 

109
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,830
centrifugal energy it's pushing this one
into that position and so that's the x

110
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:54,840
into that position and so that's the x
 

111
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,430
into that position and so that's the x
pattern uh what it

112
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
pattern uh what it
 

113
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,830
pattern uh what it
does it's what we were doing in EO

114
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:00,840
does it's what we were doing in EO
 

115
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,190
does it's what we were doing in EO
yesterday so when you're when you're

116
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,200
yesterday so when you're when you're
 

117
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,270
yesterday so when you're when you're
here like this this takes a lot of

118
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:06,280
here like this this takes a lot of
 

119
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,149
here like this this takes a lot of
energy to try to get that head down into

120
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
energy to try to get that head down into
 

121
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,390
energy to try to get that head down into
position but when you add not just the

122
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:13,400
position but when you add not just the
 

123
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,550
position but when you add not just the
vertical plane but the horizontal plane

124
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
vertical plane but the horizontal plane
 

125
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,309
vertical plane but the horizontal plane
and you have a spiraling rotating cross

126
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:19,319
and you have a spiraling rotating cross
 

127
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,229
and you have a spiraling rotating cross
it's very light it's very light to do

128
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
it's very light it's very light to do
 

129
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,390
it's very light it's very light to do
that because the other part of his body

130
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
that because the other part of his body
 

131
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,350
that because the other part of his body
is helping lowering his head all right

132
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
is helping lowering his head all right
 

133
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,190
is helping lowering his head all right
so same thing applies in

134
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
so same thing applies in
 

135
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,509
so same thing applies in
uh well you can stay

136
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:34,519
uh well you can stay
 

137
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,789
uh well you can stay
there the first thing I want to point

138
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
there the first thing I want to point
 

139
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,429
there the first thing I want to point
out is in none of none of my techniques

140
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:40,439
out is in none of none of my techniques
 

141
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,190
out is in none of none of my techniques
will you ever throw on the 180 you're

142
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
will you ever throw on the 180 you're
 

143
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,110
will you ever throw on the 180 you're
always going to do the 270 at a minimum

144
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,120
always going to do the 270 at a minimum
 

145
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,789
always going to do the 270 at a minimum
okay so I would like the camera right

146
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
okay so I would like the camera right
 

147
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,710
okay so I would like the camera right
behind

148
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:49,720
behind
 

149
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,830
behind
us so if I do that 180 I'm going to only

150
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
us so if I do that 180 I'm going to only
 

151
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,589
us so if I do that 180 I'm going to only
be in one

152
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599

 

153
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,010

plane and it doesn't matter

154
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,020

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:06,079

 

159
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,110

fact it's still through him in the one

160
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120

 

161
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,710

plane he has to go to the

162
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720

 

163
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,629

270 which is what you saw in the EO

164
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
270 which is what you saw in the EO
 

165
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,510
270 which is what you saw in the EO
yesterday so when you're doing the

166
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
yesterday so when you're doing the
 

167
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,390
yesterday so when you're doing the
EO his head remember Taylor's head comes

168
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
EO his head remember Taylor's head comes
 

169
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,990
EO his head remember Taylor's head comes
around he has come

170
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
around he has come
 

171
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,230
around he has come
around and that's using those two ples

172
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,240
around and that's using those two ples
 

173
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,070
around and that's using those two ples
so that's the first thing I would like

174
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
so that's the first thing I would like
 

175
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,480
so that's the first thing I would like
for you to add coming

176
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:40,490
for you to add coming
 

177
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,710
for you to add coming

around he's going to go this way but not

180
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
around he's going to go this way but not
 

181
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,710
around he's going to go this way but not
by me turning and now doing a vertical

182
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:49,720
by me turning and now doing a vertical
 

183
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:59,749
by me turning and now doing a vertical
plane this way

184
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759

 

185
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,110

you see I'm still entering there and in

186
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
you see I'm still entering there and in
 

187
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:14,430
you see I'm still entering there and in
fact there not there but he is thrown

188
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:14,440

 

189
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,189

there okay we're going to play with that

190
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
there okay we're going to play with that
 

191
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,510
there okay we're going to play with that
uh the next thing is to get out of your

192
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
uh the next thing is to get out of your
 

193
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,270
uh the next thing is to get out of your
arm your arm you you there's this is no

194
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
arm your arm you you there's this is no
 

195
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,909
arm your arm you you there's this is no
pattern this is not a pattern never do

196
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:26,919
pattern this is not a pattern never do
 

197
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,230
pattern this is not a pattern never do
that okay um

198
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
that okay um
 

199
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,070
that okay um
so I'm want to combine two things when

200
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,080
so I'm want to combine two things when
 

201
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,029
so I'm want to combine two things when
he's

202
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:34,039
he's
 

203
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,150
he's
driving I start the angle

204
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
driving I start the angle
 

205
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,870
driving I start the angle
cancellation it's right here that's the

206
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
cancellation it's right here that's the
 

207
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,870
cancellation it's right here that's the
Tilt that I

208
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880

 

209
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,150

want and to do that you are going to

210
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:49,160
want and to do that you are going to
 

211
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,670
want and to do that you are going to
transfer control from the wrist he's

212
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
transfer control from the wrist he's
 

213
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,430
transfer control from the wrist he's
driving into the elbow the elbow's right

214
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:56,440
driving into the elbow the elbow's right
 

215
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,189
driving into the elbow the elbow's right
here and again as we talked about when

216
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:00,199
here and again as we talked about when
 

217
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,350
here and again as we talked about when
when you're doing mid-range grappling

218
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:02,360
when you're doing mid-range grappling
 

219
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,909
when you're doing mid-range grappling
you have to know how to go from wrist

220
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:04,919
you have to know how to go from wrist
 

221
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,029
you have to know how to go from wrist
control elbow control to spinal control

222
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
control elbow control to spinal control
 

223
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,990
control elbow control to spinal control
and back you climb constantly so right

224
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
and back you climb constantly so right
 

225
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,469
and back you climb constantly so right
from the beginning you don't want to be

226
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
from the beginning you don't want to be
 

227
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,430
from the beginning you don't want to be
out on the arm and you're out here on

228
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:14,440
out on the arm and you're out here on
 

229
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,070
out on the arm and you're out here on
the arm okay you go right to Elbow

230
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080

 

231
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,390

control he he drives and you're an elbow

232
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:23,400
control he he drives and you're an elbow
 

233
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,189
control he he drives and you're an elbow
you're you're now in his elbow the elbow

234
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
you're you're now in his elbow the elbow
 

235
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,710
you're you're now in his elbow the elbow
is

236
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:27,720

 

237
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,309

controlling and so we're

238
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
controlling and so we're
 

239
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,870
controlling and so we're
here that's what it should look like it

240
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:33,880
here that's what it should look like it
 

241
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,430
here that's what it should look like it
can't look like this where it's vertical

242
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
can't look like this where it's vertical
 

243
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,189
can't look like this where it's vertical
and

244
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
and
 

245
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,350
and
unbent it's here just like you're

246
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:42,360
unbent it's here just like you're
 

247
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,469
unbent it's here just like you're
driving

248
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:45,479

 

249
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,510

here and then the trick is keep that so

250
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
here and then the trick is keep that so
 

251
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,710
here and then the trick is keep that so
you have to be careful that as you t

252
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720

 

253
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,510

con you go back to vertical

254
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:00,520
con you go back to vertical
 

255
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,790
con you go back to vertical
or as you throw you move your arm and

256
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
or as you throw you move your arm and
 

257
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,990
or as you throw you move your arm and
you came back to

258
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,000
you came back to
 

259
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,830
you came back to
Vertical you keep

260
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
Vertical you keep
 

261
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,670
Vertical you keep
this his leg comes around from the

262
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:12,680
this his leg comes around from the
 

263
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,500
this his leg comes around from the
inertia and that's what

264
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:14,510
inertia and that's what
 

265
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,670
inertia and that's what
[Music]

266
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680

 

267
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,070

throws and if you move your arms you're

268
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,080
throws and if you move your arms you're
 

269
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,230
throws and if you move your arms you're
going to lose it so here's where you had

270
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:25,240
going to lose it so here's where you had
 

271
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,110
going to lose it so here's where you had
control and that's the relationship that

272
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,120
control and that's the relationship that
 

273
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,309
control and that's the relationship that
we now this is the throwing architecture

274
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:31,319
we now this is the throwing architecture
 

275
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,710
we now this is the throwing architecture
the angle the direction you keep

276
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:35,720
the angle the direction you keep
 

277
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,350
the angle the direction you keep
that keep that that

278
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:42,360

 

279
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,790

lowers I'm going to leave the footwork

280
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
lowers I'm going to leave the footwork
 

281
00:07:44,800 --> 00:08:02,430
lowers I'm going to leave the footwork
out to demonstrate this elbow control

282
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:02,440

 

283
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:10,469

starts leaves

284
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479

 

285
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,149

leaves and a lot of people do that

286
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:13,159
leaves and a lot of people do that
 

287
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,070
leaves and a lot of people do that
because they want to they want to use

288
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,080
because they want to they want to use
 

289
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,230
because they want to they want to use
their arm string in here you have your

290
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
their arm string in here you have your
 

291
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,710
their arm string in here you have your
relationship and this just

292
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720

 

293
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,430

lowers into the Thro that's what's

294
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:26,440
lowers into the Thro that's what's
 

295
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,230
lowers into the Thro that's what's
making his head go lower okay

296
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240

 

297
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,269

try

298
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:34,279
try
 

299
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,070
try
now you have to remember the thing with

300
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,080
now you have to remember the thing with
 

301
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,990
now you have to remember the thing with
the uh acceleration throws that they're

302
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
the uh acceleration throws that they're
 

303
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,709
the uh acceleration throws that they're
working in a single plane they're too

304
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
working in a single plane they're too
 

305
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,150
working in a single plane they're too
they cost too much in terms of energy um

306
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
they cost too much in terms of energy um
 

307
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,790
they cost too much in terms of energy um
and then they're not real throws because

308
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,800
and then they're not real throws because
 

309
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,870
and then they're not real throws because
if he's athletic enough he can run out

310
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:51,880
if he's athletic enough he can run out
 

311
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,670
if he's athletic enough he can run out
of my out of my acceleration and re

312
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
of my out of my acceleration and re
 

313
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,470
of my out of my acceleration and re
reestablish his base of support under

314
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
reestablish his base of support under
 

315
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,550
reestablish his base of support under
his line of gravity you won't fall okay

316
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
his line of gravity you won't fall okay
 

317
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,069
his line of gravity you won't fall okay
um and then you're practicing with UK

318
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:06,079
um and then you're practicing with UK
 

319
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,550
um and then you're practicing with UK
who are used to acceleration throws um

320
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:09,560
who are used to acceleration throws um
 

321
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,710
who are used to acceleration throws um
and so it's very common that they throw

322
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
and so it's very common that they throw
 

323
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,030
and so it's very common that they throw
well they are throwing themselves but

324
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
well they are throwing themselves but
 

325
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,350
well they are throwing themselves but
they'll seek agency without even

326
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
they'll seek agency without even
 

327
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,670
they'll seek agency without even
realizing it but you need to be

328
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
realizing it but you need to be
 

329
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,710
realizing it but you need to be
cognizant of when they threw themselves

330
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
cognizant of when they threw themselves
 

331
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,310
cognizant of when they threw themselves
and when you through them um even if

332
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:25,320
and when you through them um even if
 

333
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,230
and when you through them um even if
you're not throwing them for safety

334
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:27,240
you're not throwing them for safety
 

335
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,870
you're not throwing them for safety
reasons you you still need to be C OPP

336
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:29,880
reasons you you still need to be C OPP
 

337
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,710
reasons you you still need to be C OPP
of that so A lot of times um UK and your

338
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
of that so A lot of times um UK and your
 

339
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,069
of that so A lot of times um UK and your
UK were doing this is they're they're

340
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:37,079
UK were doing this is they're they're
 

341
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:40,069
UK were doing this is they're they're
already running forward into the forward

342
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:40,079
already running forward into the forward
 

343
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:46,150
already running forward into the forward
roll see and the downside of that is he

344
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
roll see and the downside of that is he
 

345
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,310
roll see and the downside of that is he
he passed the um throwing architecture

346
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:51,320
he passed the um throwing architecture
 

347
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,670
he passed the um throwing architecture
so if you pay attention he he's passed

348
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:54,680
so if you pay attention he he's passed
 

349
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,150
so if you pay attention he he's passed
it already you see he passed it there's

350
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,160
it already you see he passed it there's
 

351
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,550
it already you see he passed it there's
no there's no throw here now

352
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:01,560

 

353
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,829

you just kind of throw it in past

354
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839

 

355
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,190

see

356
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200

 

357
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,670

um what the things that I have been

358
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:12,680
um what the things that I have been
 

359
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,389
um what the things that I have been
saying do are are doing is as he tries

360
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:16,399
saying do are are doing is as he tries
 

361
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,069
saying do are are doing is as he tries
to go past

362
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
to go past
 

363
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,110
to go past
it you

364
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,120
it you
 

365
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,110
it you
see that won't change that'll make it

366
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
see that won't change that'll make it
 

367
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,150
see that won't change that'll make it
worse for the 270 cuz we're going this

368
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,160
worse for the 270 cuz we're going this
 

369
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,870
worse for the 270 cuz we're going this
way right but my is going that way so as

370
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
way right but my is going that way so as
 

371
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,150
way right but my is going that way so as
he tries to go past

372
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,160
he tries to go past
 

373
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,670
he tries to go past
it you'll hit that leg and now that IND

374
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:36,680
it you'll hit that leg and now that IND
 

375
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,910
it you'll hit that leg and now that IND
will really bite it um and then we're in

376
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
will really bite it um and then we're in
 

377
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,190
will really bite it um and then we're in
that same thing it's it's you're going

378
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
that same thing it's it's you're going
 

379
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,470
that same thing it's it's you're going
to go it's how you going to land and you

380
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:45,480
to go it's how you going to land and you
 

381
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,629
to go it's how you going to land and you
don't want to pay the price of the

382
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:47,639
don't want to pay the price of the
 

383
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,230
don't want to pay the price of the
technique for real okay

384
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:51,240
technique for real okay
 

385
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,949
technique for real okay
so that's important uh in terms of

386
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
so that's important uh in terms of
 

387
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,790
so that's important uh in terms of
actually having a throw that functions

388
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:57,800
actually having a throw that functions
 

389
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,870
actually having a throw that functions
is that they're not doing

390
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
is that they're not doing
 

391
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,870
is that they're not doing
themselves and in this case the way yuk

392
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:03,880
themselves and in this case the way yuk
 

393
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,269
themselves and in this case the way yuk
were doing it themselves there was no

394
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:06,279
were doing it themselves there was no
 

395
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,509
were doing it themselves there was no
throw at all so now I'm deceiving myself

396
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:10,519
throw at all so now I'm deceiving myself
 

397
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,550
throw at all so now I'm deceiving myself
okay if we're doing it right though you

398
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:13,560
okay if we're doing it right though you
 

399
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,790
okay if we're doing it right though you
got to be careful because your UK aren't

400
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:15,800
got to be careful because your UK aren't
 

401
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,670
got to be careful because your UK aren't
going to be used to it they're going to

402
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
going to be used to it they're going to
 

403
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,949
going to be used to it they're going to
try to run past you like anybody would

404
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
try to run past you like anybody would
 

405
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,509
try to run past you like anybody would
in a in a real fight if you were

406
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:22,519
in a in a real fight if you were
 

407
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,509
in a in a real fight if you were
accelerating them and then they end up

408
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:24,519
accelerating them and then they end up
 

409
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,350
accelerating them and then they end up
biting it okay so all that said to take

410
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
biting it okay so all that said to take
 

411
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,350
biting it okay so all that said to take
care of your

412
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:30,360
care of your
 

413
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,829
care of your
UK uh I usually just tell them hey don't

414
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
UK uh I usually just tell them hey don't
 

415
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,790
UK uh I usually just tell them hey don't
throw yourself don't roll yourself and

416
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:35,800
throw yourself don't roll yourself and
 

417
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,269
throw yourself don't roll yourself and
you might have to do that uh so what I

418
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:38,279
you might have to do that uh so what I
 

419
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,110
you might have to do that uh so what I
mean by that is I'll I'll feel them

420
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
mean by that is I'll I'll feel them
 

421
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,670
mean by that is I'll I'll feel them
start to roll run past me with that you

422
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
start to roll run past me with that you
 

423
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,190
start to roll run past me with that you
see and I'll go waves stay back okay

424
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
see and I'll go waves stay back okay
 

425
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,069
see and I'll go waves stay back okay
wait for me to move

426
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:51,079

 

427
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:53,310

you that's probably going to be the

428
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:53,320
you that's probably going to be the
 

429
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,470
you that's probably going to be the
easiest

430
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:55,480
easiest
 

431
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,110
easiest
thing and you can see as I go

432
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
thing and you can see as I go
 

433
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,910
thing and you can see as I go
here I have stopped moving they will

434
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:04,920
here I have stopped moving they will
 

435
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,509
here I have stopped moving they will
take another step past me do you see and

436
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:08,519
take another step past me do you see and
