okay so uh the untrained mind gets into

2
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
okay so uh the untrained mind gets into
 

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,070
okay so uh the untrained mind gets into
patterns and so you can use patterns

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,080
patterns and so you can use patterns
 

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,590
patterns and so you can use patterns
against the person

6
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,600
against the person
 

7
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,790
against the person
so let's say like he's come in a few

8
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
so let's say like he's come in a few
 

9
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,589
so let's say like he's come in a few
times like

10
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,599
times like
 

11
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,749
times like
when you throw the front kick right or

12
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
when you throw the front kick right or
 

13
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,070
when you throw the front kick right or
maybe you're coming you throw the front

14
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
maybe you're coming you throw the front
 

15
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,710
maybe you're coming you throw the front
kick so

16
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
kick so
 

17
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,630
kick so
you get them in a pattern right now he

18
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
you get them in a pattern right now he
 

19
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,150
you get them in a pattern right now he
looks for the front kick

20
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,160
looks for the front kick
 

21
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,070
looks for the front kick
and if you hit him hard enough his body

22
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
and if you hit him hard enough his body
 

23
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,990
and if you hit him hard enough his body
reacts to the pain and so a lot of times

24
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
reacts to the pain and so a lot of times
 

25
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,109
reacts to the pain and so a lot of times
the hands just drop

26
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
the hands just drop
 

27
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,509
the hands just drop
out of a sympathetic unconscious squeeze

28
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
out of a sympathetic unconscious squeeze
 

29
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,870
out of a sympathetic unconscious squeeze
of his body okay

30
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
of his body okay
 

31
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,069
of his body okay
so once you've got him in a pattern then

32
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
so once you've got him in a pattern then
 

33
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,670
so once you've got him in a pattern then
what you're going to do is faint with

34
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
what you're going to do is faint with
 

35
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,950
what you're going to do is faint with
the front kick so

36
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:34,960
the front kick so
 

37
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,990
the front kick so
it looks to him like the front kicks

38
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000
it looks to him like the front kicks
 

39
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,630
it looks to him like the front kicks
coming

40
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
coming
 

41
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,549
coming
but you're looking for the hands to drop

42
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
but you're looking for the hands to drop
 

43
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,270
but you're looking for the hands to drop
in that unconscious sympathetic squeeze

44
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
in that unconscious sympathetic squeeze
 

45
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,950
in that unconscious sympathetic squeeze
so i don't go deep into the front kick

46
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:46,960
so i don't go deep into the front kick
 

47
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,150
so i don't go deep into the front kick
i just fake the front face the butt kick

without taking away from the lead hand
 

67
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,469
without taking away from the lead hand
okay so

68
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
okay so
 

69
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,630

if i go deep into the front kick i took

70
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
if i go deep into the front kick i took

75
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,429
from the lead hand if i don't go deep
enough it doesn't work

76
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
enough it doesn't work
 

77
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,310

148
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
so
 

149
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,909
so
in the faint that that we threw

150
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
in the faint that that we threw
 

151
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,790
in the faint that that we threw
i reached the common ground between the

i reached the common ground between the

i reached the common ground between the

and the forward progress of the jab
 

157
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,670
and the forward progress of the jab
so i bring as much of the kick

158
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
so i bring as much of the kick
 

159
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,189

161
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,189

is where the fake is to the gel

followed by a left hand
 

175
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,310
followed by a left hand
you won't have the

176
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320

 

177
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,070

effect you want

178
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
effect you want
 

179
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,749
effect you want
in your newaza

180
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
in your newaza
 

181
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,350
in your newaza
it was about fulfilling each cycle of

182
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
it was about fulfilling each cycle of
 

183
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,189
it was about fulfilling each cycle of
action so that you can operate inside

184
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
action so that you can operate inside
 

185
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,270
action so that you can operate inside
their cycle of action and that's what

186
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
their cycle of action and that's what
 

187
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,110
their cycle of action and that's what
you're doing here too

188
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
you're doing here too
 

189
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,710
you're doing here too
so i come around boom

190
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
so i come around boom
 

191
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,310
so i come around boom
if i don't have this

192
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
if i don't have this
 

193
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,350
if i don't have this
ground vector here but i have it like

194
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
ground vector here but i have it like
 

195
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,990
ground vector here but i have it like
this then i'm going to have to reach

196
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
this then i'm going to have to reach
 

197
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,710
this then i'm going to have to reach
over

198
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
over
 

199
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,790
over
and that is not marshall i'm not strong

200
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
and that is not marshall i'm not strong
 

201
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,150
and that is not marshall i'm not strong
enough to do that i don't have the

202
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
enough to do that i don't have the
 

203
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,870
enough to do that i don't have the
leverage

204
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
leverage
 

205
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,870
leverage
and i've exposed my rib cage to the

206
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
and i've exposed my rib cage to the
 

207
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,110
and i've exposed my rib cage to the
punch

208
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
punch
 

209
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,830
punch
so you have to complete the cycle of

210
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
so you have to complete the cycle of
 

211
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,550
so you have to complete the cycle of
action

212
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
action
 

213
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,830
action
then inside

214
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
then inside
 

215
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,469
then inside
here where it fits

216
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479

 

217
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,430

if you if you do that his arms already

218
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
if you if you do that his arms already
 

219
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,390
if you if you do that his arms already
there you don't have to pull this down

220
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
there you don't have to pull this down
 

221
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,670
there you don't have to pull this down
so do the first cycle of action boom

222
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
so do the first cycle of action boom
 

223
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,110
so do the first cycle of action boom
inside here this hand hasn't done

224
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
inside here this hand hasn't done
 

225
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,790
inside here this hand hasn't done
anything yet because to do something is

226
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
anything yet because to do something is
 

227
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,150
anything yet because to do something is
to pull

228
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
to pull
 

229
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,909
to pull
this hand just takes his balance this

230
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
this hand just takes his balance this
 

231
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,870
this hand just takes his balance this
way

232
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880

 

233
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,350

so as it takes his balance this way then

234
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
so as it takes his balance this way then
 

235
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,590
so as it takes his balance this way then
it brings the other hand

236
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
it brings the other hand
 

237
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,629
it brings the other hand
to where you want it to be then i just

238
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
to where you want it to be then i just
 

239
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,749
to where you want it to be then i just
keep guiding him

240
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
keep guiding him
 

241
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,309
keep guiding him
and he falls and i stay up with him

242
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319

 

243
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,909

so complete your cycles no

244

no no these are all
young pulls so boom

248
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840

not doing it
 

255
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,830
not doing it
find that inner space

256
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840

 

257

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,469

so that pull you want to do here or

262
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
so that pull you want to do here or

00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
do it on the front side of the circle
 

267
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,110
do it on the front side of the circle
front side of the circle here

268
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120

 

269
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,629

boom up not here

270
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
boom up not here
 

271
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,390
boom up not here
here

272
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400

 

273
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,830

boom front side this room eating me

274
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
boom front side this room eating me
 

275
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,390
boom front side this room eating me
noggin

276
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400

 

277
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:18,070

not here

278
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080

 

279
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,629

keep going around his arm energy around

280
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
keep going around his arm energy around
 

281
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:38,829
keep going around his arm energy around
his arms

282
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839

 

283
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:49,030

so

284
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040

 

285
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,389

stay away from the chloe okay

286
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
stay away from the chloe okay
 

287
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,829
stay away from the chloe okay
so uh let's look at this

288
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
so uh let's look at this
 

289
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,350
so uh let's look at this
positioning here so what i want to do

290
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
positioning here so what i want to do
 

291
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,750
positioning here so what i want to do
is get this shoulder down lower

292
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
is get this shoulder down lower
 

293
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,190
is get this shoulder down lower
so if i go to pull this i don't really

294
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
so if i go to pull this i don't really
 

295
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,430
so if i go to pull this i don't really
do that

296
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
do that
 

297
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,470
do that
because that foot is the countering foot

298
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
because that foot is the countering foot
 

299
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,430
because that foot is the countering foot
that you should expect so when i grab

300
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
that you should expect so when i grab
 

301
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,790
that you should expect so when i grab
the elbow

302
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
the elbow
 

303
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,070
the elbow
and do a pulling a pulling action he's

304
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
and do a pulling a pulling action he's
 

305
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,790
and do a pulling a pulling action he's
going to get that foot under there

306
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
going to get that foot under there
 

307
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,870
going to get that foot under there
and then you're here

308
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880

 

309
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,269

when i use the other hand and do a

310
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
when i use the other hand and do a
 

311
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,870
when i use the other hand and do a
turning action

312
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
turning action
 

313
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,350
turning action
this shoulder got lower it's harder for

314
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
this shoulder got lower it's harder for
 

315
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,070
this shoulder got lower it's harder for
that foot

316
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
that foot
 

317
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,389
that foot
it's not impossible athletes can get

318
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
it's not impossible athletes can get
 

319
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,230
it's not impossible athletes can get
that foot under the under there

320
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
that foot under the under there
 

321
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,269
that foot under the under there
okay but that's exactly what i want

322
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
okay but that's exactly what i want
 

323
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,230
okay but that's exactly what i want
because that sets up the shikaku on the

324
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
because that sets up the shikaku on the
 

325
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,190
because that sets up the shikaku on the
spiral

326
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,200
spiral
 

327
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,949
spiral
you should expect that they're gonna

328
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
you should expect that they're gonna
 

329
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,790
you should expect that they're gonna
step

330
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
step
 

331
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,110
step
so juan look to get that shoulder down

332
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
so juan look to get that shoulder down
 

333
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,070
so juan look to get that shoulder down
he's going to step do it as much again

334
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
he's going to step do it as much again
 

335
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,710
he's going to step do it as much again
and that

336
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
and that
 

337
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,190
and that
sets up the shikaku outside that foot so

338
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
sets up the shikaku outside that foot so
 

339
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,070
sets up the shikaku outside that foot so
stay there

340
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
stay there
 

341
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,910
stay there
so once he takes that step that's what

342
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
so once he takes that step that's what
 

343
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,110
so once he takes that step that's what
sets that up

344
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120

 

345
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,230

so your uke is gonna it's gonna step now

346
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
so your uke is gonna it's gonna step now
 

347
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,870
so your uke is gonna it's gonna step now
and nothing should change for you but

348
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880

then it should be a culture projection
 

393
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,550
then it should be a culture projection
and not a push
