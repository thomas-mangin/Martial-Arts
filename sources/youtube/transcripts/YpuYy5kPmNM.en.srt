1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:14,089

but so this is the tar

2
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:14,099

 

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,470

you hear that do you hear that

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,480
you hear that do you hear that
 

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:27,370
you hear that do you hear that
and sometimes just dirt

6
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:27,380

 

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,710

that's what you should hear

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
that's what you should hear
 

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,810
that's what you should hear
not

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:32,820
not
 

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,690
not
oh

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:35,700

 

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,889

not that

14
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:38,899

 

15
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,590

so the

16
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
so the
 

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,389
so the
this is really good all right

18
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
this is really good all right
 

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,810
this is really good all right
so it could be a lot worse but if you go

20
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:47,820
so it could be a lot worse but if you go
 

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,910
so it could be a lot worse but if you go
there so when you've got the taranuchi

22
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
there so when you've got the taranuchi
 

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,889
there so when you've got the taranuchi
so if you put yuck in it when you've got

24
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:51,899
so if you put yuck in it when you've got
 

25
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,229
so if you put yuck in it when you've got
the tarunucci

26
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
the tarunucci
 

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,170
the tarunucci
you should look at your cane and as you

28
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:57,180
you should look at your cane and as you
 

29
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,450
you should look at your cane and as you
cut it down because it's rubber

30
00:00:59,450 --> 00:00:59,460
cut it down because it's rubber
 

31
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,170
cut it down because it's rubber
it might jump to the left

32
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:03,180
it might jump to the left
 

33
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,050
it might jump to the left
it might jump to the right so these are

34
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,060
it might jump to the right so these are
 

35
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,190
it might jump to the right so these are
all things that if you've got a

36
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
all things that if you've got a
 

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,490
all things that if you've got a
tavernuchi or you try at any stage these

38
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:10,500
tavernuchi or you try at any stage these
 

39
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,370
tavernuchi or you try at any stage these
are things you'll see or you'll get

40
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:13,380
are things you'll see or you'll get
 

41
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,170
are things you'll see or you'll get
you'll get this

42
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:15,180
you'll get this
 

43
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,070
you'll get this
the thing to do is

44
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,080

 

45
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,010

you since you said you squeeze it like

46
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:22,020
you since you said you squeeze it like
 

47
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,130
you since you said you squeeze it like
like ringing water out of a towel at the

48
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:25,140
like ringing water out of a towel at the
 

49
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,350
like ringing water out of a towel at the
very end so you go squeeze

50
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:30,360

 

51
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,010

you then have a little injection going

52
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,020
you then have a little injection going
 

53
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,350
you then have a little injection going
forward

54
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:36,360
forward
 

55
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,870
forward
all right so you don't just

56
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
all right so you don't just
 

57
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,490
all right so you don't just
cut it down

58
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:40,500
cut it down
 

59
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,429
cut it down
but you squeeze you feel the difference

60
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
but you squeeze you feel the difference
 

61
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,569
but you squeeze you feel the difference
in the all right so if you just go down

62
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:47,579
in the all right so if you just go down
 

63
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,230
in the all right so if you just go down
is that if you go forward

64
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,240
is that if you go forward
 

65
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,609
is that if you go forward
is that

66
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:52,619
is that
 

67
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,950
is that
has more power in going forward because

68
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
has more power in going forward because
 

69
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,469
has more power in going forward because
it becomes like a slice all right so

70
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:57,479
it becomes like a slice all right so
 

71
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,289
it becomes like a slice all right so
mustn't go to the left it mustn't go to

72
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:00,299
mustn't go to the left it mustn't go to
 

73
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,550
mustn't go to the left it mustn't go to
the right

74
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:01,560
the right
 

75
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,690
the right
it mustn't bounce

76
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:05,700

 

77
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,809

I used to have a a young student 19

78
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:08,819
I used to have a a young student 19
 

79
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,470
I used to have a a young student 19
years of age I used to hit the tar and

80
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
years of age I used to hit the tar and
 

81
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,030
years of age I used to hit the tar and
keep in it and you could see the tar

82
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,040
keep in it and you could see the tar
 

83
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,210
keep in it and you could see the tar
sort of bead most people that hit the

84
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:17,220
sort of bead most people that hit the
 

85
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,630
sort of bead most people that hit the
target sort of like took them back

86
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
target sort of like took them back
 

87
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,089
target sort of like took them back
so that what you then take from it is

88
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:23,099
so that what you then take from it is
 

89
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,869
so that what you then take from it is
you now use the Bounce from the tire

90
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
you now use the Bounce from the tire
 

91
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,430
you now use the Bounce from the tire
and this is really what we've been

92
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:28,440
and this is really what we've been
 

93
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,250
and this is really what we've been
talking about this morning in Aikido we

94
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,260
talking about this morning in Aikido we
 

95
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,710
talking about this morning in Aikido we
use like I was timing with the partner

96
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:33,720
use like I was timing with the partner
 

97
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,530
use like I was timing with the partner
when I hit that

98
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:36,540
when I hit that
 

99
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,350
when I hit that
I'm going to use the energy to get the

100
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
I'm going to use the energy to get the
 

101
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,530
I'm going to use the energy to get the
can up there

102
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:42,540

 

103
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,170

if I go like that and now mechanically

104
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,180
if I go like that and now mechanically
 

105
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,890
if I go like that and now mechanically
do this this is what I call Basic School

106
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:50,900

 

107
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,890

you feel the difference in the power

108
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:54,900
you feel the difference in the power
 

109
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,830
you feel the difference in the power
so you have to work out

110
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:00,840

 

111
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,229

are you out of breath you know did you

112
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:03,239
are you out of breath you know did you
 

113
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,170
are you out of breath you know did you
put everything into the car

114
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:06,180
put everything into the car
 

115
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,970
put everything into the car
or ah

116
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:10,980

 

117
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,930

or can you use the power that the first

118
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:14,940
or can you use the power that the first
 

119
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,270
or can you use the power that the first
one gave you so the taranuchi is not

120
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
one gave you so the taranuchi is not
 

121
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,710
one gave you so the taranuchi is not
just the tar that you whack away

122
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
just the tar that you whack away
 

123
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,050
just the tar that you whack away
thinking it's going to make your hips

124
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:21,060
thinking it's going to make your hips
 

125
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,550
thinking it's going to make your hips
strong

126
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
strong
 

127
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,309
strong
and then somebody asked me about in the

128
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:25,319
and then somebody asked me about in the
 

129
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,170
and then somebody asked me about in the
31 Carter five six seven eight

130
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:30,180
31 Carter five six seven eight
 

131
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,430
31 Carter five six seven eight
if I take this energy

132
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:36,440

 

133
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,490

then you can do in the 31 Carter

134
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:40,500
then you can do in the 31 Carter
 

135
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,009
then you can do in the 31 Carter
without going like this

136
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:43,019
without going like this
 

137
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,670
without going like this
five six seven

138
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:46,680
five six seven
 

139
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,350
five six seven
eight

140
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:48,360
eight
 

141
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,470
eight
you know one's mechanical physical the

142
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:51,480
you know one's mechanical physical the
 

143
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,190
you know one's mechanical physical the
other one is energized

144
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200

 

145
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,589

and then you you start learning happy

146
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:00,599
and then you you start learning happy
 

147
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,930
and then you you start learning happy
different directions

148
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:02,940
different directions
 

149
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,509
different directions
because you know I was talking about

150
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
because you know I was talking about
 

151
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,869
because you know I was talking about
sensing spiritual and that you're in a

152
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
sensing spiritual and that you're in a
 

153
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,050
sensing spiritual and that you're in a
dimension where time isn't

154
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,060
dimension where time isn't
 

155
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,869
dimension where time isn't
thought of or time

156
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
thought of or time
 

157
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:27,610
thought of or time
is my kind of isn't available

158
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:27,620

 

159
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:34,249

all right so you do the footwork

160
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:34,259

 

161
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,650

and then you just do it and of course I

162
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:36,660
and then you just do it and of course I
 

163
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,330
and then you just do it and of course I
ain't got time at all have I haven't got

164
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:38,340
ain't got time at all have I haven't got
 

165
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,370
ain't got time at all have I haven't got
time to think so so but I'm

166
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:43,380
time to think so so but I'm
 

167
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,150
time to think so so but I'm
I'm working on oh the bounce I'm working

168
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,160
I'm working on oh the bounce I'm working
 

169
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,790
I'm working on oh the bounce I'm working
on the oh oh oh

170
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800

 

171
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,310

so I'm having to demonstrate by

172
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:55,320
so I'm having to demonstrate by
