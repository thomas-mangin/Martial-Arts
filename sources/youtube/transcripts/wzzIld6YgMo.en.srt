so if Taylor was running it and I go

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,090
so if Taylor was running it and I go

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,390
so if Taylor was running it and I go
here that is young versus young that's

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:17,400
here that is young versus young that's
 

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,179
here that is young versus young that's
the class right you understand he's

8
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:20,189
the class right you understand he's
 

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:27,500
the class right you understand he's
coming he's running at me now and I hit

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:27,510
coming he's running at me now and I hit
 

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,009
coming he's running at me now and I hit
him from here that is still young versus

12
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:31,019
him from here that is still young versus
 

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,850
him from here that is still young versus
young to get it okay and that would be a

14
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:34,860
young to get it okay and that would be a
 

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,350
young to get it okay and that would be a
clash that's not a young reconciliation

16
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
clash that's not a young reconciliation
 

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:50,959
clash that's not a young reconciliation
and it's not Aikido and we have to

18
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:50,969
and it's not Aikido and we have to
 

19
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,619
and it's not Aikido and we have to
figure out it's like a physical puzzle

20
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:54,629
figure out it's like a physical puzzle
 

21
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,920
figure out it's like a physical puzzle
we have to figure out how do I in

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:57,930
we have to figure out how do I in
 

23
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,189
we have to figure out how do I in
January a backwards fall right without

24
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,199
January a backwards fall right without
 

25
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:10,420
January a backwards fall right without
it being generated by the obvious okay

26
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:10,430

 

27
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,380

the best way of thinking about this is

28
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:14,390
the best way of thinking about this is
 

29
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,010
the best way of thinking about this is
kokujo is the kind of cut a gash on the

30
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,020
kokujo is the kind of cut a gash on the
 

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,820
kokujo is the kind of cut a gash on the
head okay

32
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:21,830
head okay
 

33
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,179
head okay
so go to the - he comes in and you kind

34
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:26,189
so go to the - he comes in and you kind
 

35
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,590
so go to the - he comes in and you kind
of round this corner and he's actually

36
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
of round this corner and he's actually
 

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,010
of round this corner and he's actually
going forward his energy was coming this

38
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,020
going forward his energy was coming this
 

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,219
going forward his energy was coming this
way and then it made a circle do you see

40
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:37,229
way and then it made a circle do you see
 

41
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,679
way and then it made a circle do you see
it's still going forward even though

42
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:39,689
it's still going forward even though
 

43
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,530
it's still going forward even though
it's now oriented in that same direction

44
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:42,540
it's now oriented in that same direction
 

45
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,499
it's now oriented in that same direction
you get it it's supposed to here and I

46
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:47,509
you get it it's supposed to here and I
 

47
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:52,310
you get it it's supposed to here and I
okay so we have to figure out how to hit

48
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
okay so we have to figure out how to hit
 

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,840
okay so we have to figure out how to hit
cook you home to not be a clash and

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:55,850
cook you home to not be a clash and
 

51
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,800
cook you home to not be a clash and
there's going to be some clues so

52
00:01:59,800 --> 00:01:59,810
there's going to be some clues so
 

53
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:06,170
there's going to be some clues so
anytime I confronted him right this is

54
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,180
anytime I confronted him right this is
 

55
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,870

58
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:12,530
/ so if I go here and I go like this if
 

59
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,309
/ so if I go here and I go like this if
you look at my angle I'm in front of him

60
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:15,319
you look at my angle I'm in front of him
 

61
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,380
you look at my angle I'm in front of him
you see it looks like it works everybody

62
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:20,390
you see it looks like it works everybody
 

63
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,930

00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,050
we're not enter I'm at this back corner
 

119
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,170
we're not enter I'm at this back corner
you see that this is a fighting area

120
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:47,180
you see that this is a fighting area
 

121
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,210
you see that this is a fighting area
where you always want to be so it'll go

122
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:52,220
where you always want to be so it'll go

right here now like this you see and I'm
 

129
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,450
right here now like this you see and I'm
not a tightrope and he leans on me and

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:15,460

 

131
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,600

so your case

132
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:18,610
so your case
 

133
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,170
so your case
Cordia Brown don't lean on me and all

175
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:49,410
go like this okay I give them back to
space okay so I'm not I have just that

176
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:49,420
space okay so I'm not I have just that
 

177
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:55,350
space okay so I'm not I have just that
perfect amount of friction this is the

178
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
perfect amount of friction this is the
 

179
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,230
perfect amount of friction this is the
hard part but if I keep trying to only

180
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
hard part but if I keep trying to only
 

181
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,060
