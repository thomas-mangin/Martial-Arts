see how close that sword into my body

42
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:12,360

 

43
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,740

it happens from unconsciousness and it

44
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:15,750
it happens from unconsciousness and it
 

45
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:35,120
it happens from unconsciousness and it
happens from it's no contest if he

46
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,130
happens from it's no contest if he
 

47
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,540
happens from it's no contest if he
pushes on me right see my hand came into

48
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,550
pushes on me right see my hand came into
 

49
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:48,350
pushes on me right see my hand came into
me right so all things it maintains your

50
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:48,360
me right so all things it maintains your
 

51
00:04:48,360 --> 00:05:05,990
me right so all things it maintains your
pressure by moving my body okay and then

52
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
pressure by moving my body okay and then
 

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,920
pressure by moving my body okay and then
I would do my projection from the elbow

54
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:09,930
I would do my projection from the elbow
 

55
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,950
I would do my projection from the elbow
okay but all things beautiful you're

56
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
okay but all things beautiful you're
 

57
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,550
okay but all things beautiful you're
going to share right I keep the distance

58
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
going to share right I keep the distance
 

59
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,860
going to share right I keep the distance
so this is a form so it's an idealized

60
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:18,870
so this is a form so it's an idealized
 

61
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,940
so this is a form so it's an idealized
situation so disordered is to stay at

62
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:21,950
situation so disordered is to stay at
 

63
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,320
situation so disordered is to stay at
45-degree angle that you've been using

64
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,330
45-degree angle that you've been using
 

65
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,850
45-degree angle that you've been using
the entire time so for example after

66
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:28,860
the entire time so for example after
 

67
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,620
the entire time so for example after
this ski don't go like this

68
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:32,630
this ski don't go like this
 

69
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:39,890
this ski don't go like this
after this ski boom boom so when we come

70
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:39,900
after this ski boom boom so when we come
 

71
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,090
after this ski boom boom so when we come
around you get to pick where you are so

72
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:44,100
around you get to pick where you are so
 

73
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,370
around you get to pick where you are so
I'm gonna come in keep that 45 boom in

74
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:48,380
I'm gonna come in keep that 45 boom in
 

75
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,540
I'm gonna come in keep that 45 boom in
pop then the other way same thing keep

76
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:53,550
pop then the other way same thing keep
 

77
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,800
pop then the other way same thing keep
the 45 boom boom boom

78
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:57,810
the 45 boom boom boom
 

79
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,260
the 45 boom boom boom
okay let's try close

80
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:01,270

 

81
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:10,830

he's got four Spectre Joey

82
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:10,840

 

83
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,090

No so you can see that it is a young

84
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,100
No so you can see that it is a young
 

85
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:24,460
No so you can see that it is a young
line okay especially if I keep my line

86
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,470
line okay especially if I keep my line
 

87
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,920
line okay especially if I keep my line
of gravity inside I can't get around

88
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:28,930

 

89
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:34,240

okay so we can use this to show

90
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,250
okay so we can use this to show
 

91
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,800
okay so we can use this to show
something else okay so as I'm doing the

92
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:37,810
something else okay so as I'm doing the
 

93
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,780
something else okay so as I'm doing the
form I am I'm here and I'm gonna move

94
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:43,790
form I am I'm here and I'm gonna move
 

95
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,200
form I am I'm here and I'm gonna move
that force vector to there do you see

96
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,210
that force vector to there do you see
 

97
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,880
that force vector to there do you see
that that's what the first ship does

98
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:48,890
that that's what the first ship does
 

99
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,800
that that's what the first ship does
when you when you're here like this and

100
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:50,810
when you when you're here like this and
 

101
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,440
when you when you're here like this and
you don't do that it just you can push

102
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,450
you don't do that it just you can push
 

103
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,260
you don't do that it just you can push
off my logic tracker so I'm going to

104
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,270
off my logic tracker so I'm going to
 

105
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,560
off my logic tracker so I'm going to
shift my weight and then turn around

106
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:01,570
shift my weight and then turn around
 

107
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:05,560
shift my weight and then turn around
you'll feel that boom and then this

108
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:05,570
you'll feel that boom and then this
 

109
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:12,250
you'll feel that boom and then this
becomes my pivot point here you see I

110
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:12,260
becomes my pivot point here you see I
 

111
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,770
becomes my pivot point here you see I
can I can't get there if I do it like

112
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:14,780
can I can't get there if I do it like
 

113
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:20,830
can I can't get there if I do it like
that so shift Brown new ground turn

114
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:20,840
that so shift Brown new ground turn
 

115
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,770
that so shift Brown new ground turn
around

116
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:24,780

 

117
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,040

so I'm grounded on the back foot shift

118
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,050
so I'm grounded on the back foot shift
 

119
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,469
so I'm grounded on the back foot shift
to the front foot and then rotate around

120
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:31,479
to the front foot and then rotate around
 

121
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:39,600
to the front foot and then rotate around
that spot so what I'm doing is taking

122
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:39,610
that spot so what I'm doing is taking
 

123
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,950
that spot so what I'm doing is taking
away this contest do you see how you did

124
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:43,960
away this contest do you see how you did
 

125
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,249
away this contest do you see how you did
that so I moved then I'm gonna turn

126
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:47,259
that so I moved then I'm gonna turn
 

127
00:07:47,259 --> 00:08:07,610
that so I moved then I'm gonna turn
around I'm not going here okay oh

128
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:07,620

 

129
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,480

this is your training yes get rid of the

130
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:12,490
this is your training yes get rid of the
 

131
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,920
this is your training yes get rid of the
contention point go forward okay let's

132
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:16,930
contention point go forward okay let's
 

133
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,540
contention point go forward okay let's
try it okay so we're looking at this

134
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:20,550
try it okay so we're looking at this
 

135
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,610
try it okay so we're looking at this
line of gravity we're looking at this

136
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:23,620
line of gravity we're looking at this
 

137
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,399
line of gravity we're looking at this
line of gravity that's between his two

138
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:26,409
line of gravity that's between his two
 

139
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:26,850
line of gravity that's between his two
feet

140
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:26,860
feet
 

141
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,860
feet
it is currently between his two feet

142
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:28,870
it is currently between his two feet
 

143
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:34,170
it is currently between his two feet
right now okay and in the form he should

144
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:34,180
right now okay and in the form he should
 

145
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,719
right now okay and in the form he should
be on the back foot at this point but

146
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:36,729
be on the back foot at this point but
 

147
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,659
be on the back foot at this point but
this is what's common this is this is

148
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:39,669
this is what's common this is this is
 

149
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,350
this is what's common this is this is
what Aikido is for most of us okay so

150
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
what Aikido is for most of us okay so
 

151
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,960
what Aikido is for most of us okay so
I'm now tasked in the midst of pressure

152
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:47,970
I'm now tasked in the midst of pressure
 

153
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,110
I'm now tasked in the midst of pressure
to go forward into it this is going to

154
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,120
to go forward into it this is going to
 

155
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,750
to go forward into it this is going to
be impossible unless I learn how to

156
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:54,760
be impossible unless I learn how to
 

157
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,519
be impossible unless I learn how to
deconstruct the contest okay so we're

158
00:08:59,519 --> 00:08:59,529
deconstruct the contest okay so we're
 

159
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:02,130
deconstruct the contest okay so we're
gonna see because as he moves and he

160
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,140
gonna see because as he moves and he
 

161
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,949
gonna see because as he moves and he
tries to force his way into the contest

162
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:04,959
tries to force his way into the contest
 

163
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,230
tries to force his way into the contest
the pressure at the contest moves his

164
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:07,240
the pressure at the contest moves his
 

165
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,139
the pressure at the contest moves his
line of gravity and he can't come around

166
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:10,149
line of gravity and he can't come around
 

167
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:20,460
line of gravity and he can't come around
try it try your best you see okay so

168
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:20,470
try it try your best you see okay so
 

169
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,410
try it try your best you see okay so
he's trying to get off of that so we're

170
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:22,420
he's trying to get off of that so we're
 

171
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,100
he's trying to get off of that so we're
gonna see this again okay go ahead you

172
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,110
gonna see this again okay go ahead you
 

173
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,310
gonna see this again okay go ahead you
can shift alright now I'm going to tell

174
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,320
can shift alright now I'm going to tell
 

175
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,010
can shift alright now I'm going to tell
you if he was single point pivot the

176
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,020
you if he was single point pivot the
 

177
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,660
you if he was single point pivot the
back

178
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:32,670
back
 

179
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,580
back
would be able to slide back and forth as

180
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:34,590
would be able to slide back and forth as
 

181
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,590
would be able to slide back and forth as
we've demonstrated many times but he's

182
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:36,600
we've demonstrated many times but he's
 

183
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,920
we've demonstrated many times but he's
he's still not single point pivoting he

184
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:39,930
he's still not single point pivoting he
 

185
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:45,140
he's still not single point pivoting he
still got a two-point stance okay and so

186
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,150
still got a two-point stance okay and so
 

187
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,320
still got a two-point stance okay and so
as he goes around go it's gonna this

188
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,330
as he goes around go it's gonna this
 

189
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,300
as he goes around go it's gonna this
line of Bradley's gonna get moved okay

190
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,310
line of Bradley's gonna get moved okay
 

191
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,020
line of Bradley's gonna get moved okay
now again let's say he was powerful

192
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,030
now again let's say he was powerful
 

193
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,960
now again let's say he was powerful
enough because it's still a contest is

194
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:56,970
enough because it's still a contest is
 

195
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,670
enough because it's still a contest is
still force versus force

196
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:58,680
still force versus force
 

197
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,270
still force versus force
so if Sean's force can override

198
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:02,280
so if Sean's force can override
 

199
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,720
so if Sean's force can override
Ronan's force you see and Rodan who's

200
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:05,730
Ronan's force you see and Rodan who's
 

201
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,700
Ronan's force you see and Rodan who's
backwards is like oh it worked

202
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:07,710
backwards is like oh it worked
 

203
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,970
backwards is like oh it worked
but it did not because Ronin did not

204
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:10,980
but it did not because Ronin did not
 

205
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,670
but it did not because Ronin did not
come falling into the void and so

206
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
come falling into the void and so
 

207
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,560
come falling into the void and so
there's no Kazushi that's actually

208
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:15,570
there's no Kazushi that's actually
 

209
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,570
there's no Kazushi that's actually
happening all that's happened is that

210
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:17,580
happening all that's happened is that
 

211
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,240
happening all that's happened is that
the contest has moved towards Sean's

212
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,250
the contest has moved towards Sean's
 

213
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:32,990
the contest has moved towards Sean's
right okay so here we go this is because

214
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,000
right okay so here we go this is because
 

215
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,880
right okay so here we go this is because
you have a young booth if they've been

216
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:34,890
you have a young booth if they've been
 

217
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:40,900
you have a young booth if they've been
young moves are easy but it's a young

218
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:40,910
young moves are easy but it's a young
 

219
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,330
young moves are easy but it's a young

in the midst this job you see that so

222
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:47,580
in the midst this job you see that so
 

223
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,100
in the midst this job you see that so
again most Aikido he's he's here he's

224
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,110
again most Aikido he's he's here he's
 

225
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,900
again most Aikido he's he's here he's
pushy and we were wanting to like this

226
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:55,910
pushy and we were wanting to like this
 

227
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,250
pushy and we were wanting to like this
well of course you wanted to do

228
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:58,260
well of course you wanted to do
 

229
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,180
well of course you wanted to do
that right but that's not sophisticated

230
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,190
that right but that's not sophisticated
 

231
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,390
that right but that's not sophisticated
this is more sophisticated is I'm going

232
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:05,400
this is more sophisticated is I'm going
 

233
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,190
this is more sophisticated is I'm going
to figure out how to get rid of that

234
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
to figure out how to get rid of that
 

235
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,330
to figure out how to get rid of that
point this point he's pushing is first I

start with Tokyo grounding so we're

238
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:13,590
start with Tokyo grounding so we're
 

239
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,600
start with Tokyo grounding so we're
gonna stay here all day

240
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:14,610
gonna stay here all day
 

241
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,269
gonna stay here all day
it's he's just

242
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:16,279
it's he's just
 

243
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,540
it's he's just
into the back way okay instead of a gear

244
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:19,550
into the back way okay instead of a gear
 

245

double weighted and the line of gravity

246
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:21,649
double weighted and the line of gravity
 

247
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:26,889
double weighted and the line of gravity
is between my base and he is taking me

248
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:26,899
is between my base and he is taking me
 

249
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:27,759
is between my base and he is taking me
in the shukaku

250
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:27,769
in the shukaku
 

251
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,480
in the shukaku
do you guys see that so we're here and a

252
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:31,490
do you guys see that so we're here and a
 

253
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,489
do you guys see that so we're here and a
five double awaited you won't even let

254
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:33,499
five double awaited you won't even let
 

255
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:35,650
five double awaited you won't even let
him get on there okay

256
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:35,660
him get on there okay
 

257
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,489
him get on there okay
but as he goes to push boom you see and

258
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:39,499
but as he goes to push boom you see and
 

259
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,040
but as he goes to push boom you see and
I put it on this leg and this legs not

260
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,050
I put it on this leg and this legs not
 

261
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,840
I put it on this leg and this legs not
doing any this legs not doing it okay

262
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:45,850
doing any this legs not doing it okay
 

263
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,259
doing any this legs not doing it okay
now I'm gonna move it and as to take

264
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:50,269
now I'm gonna move it and as to take
 

265
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:52,119
now I'm gonna move it and as to take
this leg off it can't just be a matter

266
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:52,129
this leg off it can't just be a matter
 

267
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,639
this leg off it can't just be a matter
of on here because pressure actually

268
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:54,649
of on here because pressure actually
 

269
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,600
of on here because pressure actually
increased in it you see it's it's in

270
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:58,610
increased in it you see it's it's in
 

271
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,259
increased in it you see it's it's in
here

272
00:11:59,259 --> 00:11:59,269
here
 

273
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:06,730

our drill now because what I find is you

276
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:10,610
our drill now because what I find is you
 

277
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,710
our drill now because what I find is you
become enamored by the throw

278
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
become enamored by the throw
 

279
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,590
become enamored by the throw
so you're here that's not a cheetah that

280
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:20,600
so you're here that's not a cheetah that
 

281
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,639
so you're here that's not a cheetah that
doesn't work either

282
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:21,649
doesn't work either
 

283
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:27,309
doesn't work either
I need him to fall into the void so even

284
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:27,319
I need him to fall into the void so even
 

285
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:30,400
I need him to fall into the void so even
with the yard move there's a void so are

okay so I'm not talking keep the
 

341
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:15,740
okay so I'm not talking keep the
structure okay let's go we're not here

342
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:15,750
structure okay let's go we're not here
 

343
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,110
structure okay let's go we're not here
and I single point pivot this shoulder

344
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,120
and I single point pivot this shoulder
 

345
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,280
and I single point pivot this shoulder
actually goes that way when I double

346
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,290
actually goes that way when I double
 

347
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:33,040
actually goes that way when I double
point pivot this shoulder goes that way

348
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,050

 

349
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,769

so again double-double point pivot

350
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:36,779
so again double-double point pivot
 

351
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,630
so again double-double point pivot
lighting drivers between my feet I

483
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,440
so he's feeling his aggression and the
drug too as they come around

484
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:57,450
drug too as they come around
 

485
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,310
drug too as they come around
he doesn't feel me

486
00:18:59,310 --> 00:18:59,320
he doesn't feel me

489
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,490

Thanks I can be very relaxed do the same

for the stroke but I've been contest

494
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:14,280
for the stroke but I've been contest
 

495
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,210
for the stroke but I've been contest
once okay let's go back to the throw so

496
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:17,220
once okay let's go back to the throw so
 

497
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,370
once okay let's go back to the throw so
the opening we're using is we count 5

498
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:19,380
the opening we're using is we count 5
 

499
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,630
the opening we're using is we count 5
opening but the principles were using

500
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
opening but the principles were using
 

501
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,669
opening but the principles were using
are still for the throw are still to

502
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:25,679
are still for the throw are still to
 

503
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,810
are still for the throw are still to
count 5 principles

504
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:26,820

ok so I'm going to yield the shoulder

506
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,170
ok so I'm going to yield the shoulder
 

507
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,370
ok so I'm going to yield the shoulder
and now I'm here

508
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:34,380
and now I'm here
 

509
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,720
and now I'm here
you see where I'm on the side of his

510
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:35,730
you see where I'm on the side of his
 

511
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,600
you see where I'm on the side of his
head not hooking I'm on the side of the

512
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:38,610
head not hooking I'm on the side of the
 

513
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,750
head not hooking I'm on the side of the
face so we're going to show the physics

514
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
face so we're going to show the physics
 

515
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,700
face so we're going to show the physics
involved okay so if I stay here right

516
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:46,710
involved okay so if I stay here right
 

517
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,930
involved okay so if I stay here right
keep going I can't even do this throw

518
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:49,940
keep going I can't even do this throw
 

519
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,600
keep going I can't even do this throw
this he's going to keep going ok

520
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:53,610
this he's going to keep going ok
 

521
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,830
this he's going to keep going ok
but which is why when you stay here you

522
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
but which is why when you stay here you
 

523
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,250
but which is why when you stay here you
go like that you see so that's the only

524
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:01,260
go like that you see so that's the only
 

525
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,020
go like that you see so that's the only
way but now this is a class this is not

526
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,030
way but now this is a class this is not
 

527
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,380
way but now this is a class this is not
the end reconciliation D contestation so

528
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:09,390
the end reconciliation D contestation so
 

529
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,180
the end reconciliation D contestation so
I'm here so if we come back I'm leaving

530
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,190
I'm here so if we come back I'm leaving
 

531
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:22,310
I'm here so if we come back I'm leaving
ok you can hear some smokey after so

532
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,320
ok you can hear some smokey after so
 

533
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,830
ok you can hear some smokey after so
doubt if I were strong enough I can

534
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:24,840
doubt if I were strong enough I can
 

535
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,409
doubt if I were strong enough I can
generate enough force you will create a

536
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:27,419
generate enough force you will create a
 

537
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,480
generate enough force you will create a
topsy-turvy attack but it's not the

538
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:29,490
topsy-turvy attack but it's not the
 

539
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,270
topsy-turvy attack but it's not the
heart there's the ceiling to it and it's

540
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:32,280
heart there's the ceiling to it and it's
 

541
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,750
heart there's the ceiling to it and it's
much lower than you think it is a

542
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:34,760
much lower than you think it is a
 

543
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,390
much lower than you think it is a
mechanical ceiling so what I'm doing is

544
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
mechanical ceiling so what I'm doing is
 

545
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,070
mechanical ceiling so what I'm doing is
something different just like I'm doing

546
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
something different just like I'm doing
 

547
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,870
something different just like I'm doing
something different I'm not one like

548
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:41,880
something different I'm not one like
 

549
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,820
something different I'm not one like
this I'm actually even unbuttoned

550
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:46,830
this I'm actually even unbuttoned
 

551
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,419
this I'm actually even unbuttoned
forward I'm moving that shoulder bop

552
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:49,429
forward I'm moving that shoulder bop
 

553
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:54,740
forward I'm moving that shoulder bop
okay so I'm just here ok now I have to

554
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:54,750
okay so I'm just here ok now I have to
 

555
00:20:54,750 --> 00:21:00,070
okay so I'm just here ok now I have to
figure out how to get that friction Oh

556
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,080
figure out how to get that friction Oh
 

557
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,600
figure out how to get that friction Oh
as he starts to go we're gonna do a

558
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:02,610
as he starts to go we're gonna do a
 

559
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,830
as he starts to go we're gonna do a
slower it's got

560
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
slower it's got
 

561
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,460
slower it's got
okay I feel it I'm going to start

562
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:07,470
okay I feel it I'm going to start
 

563
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,180
okay I feel it I'm going to start
getting his head to go like this you

564
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,190
getting his head to go like this you
 

565
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,240
getting his head to go like this you
make his hand to photograph because

566
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,250
make his hand to photograph because
 

567
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,950
make his hand to photograph because
that's the Kazushi pattern you see it

568
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:15,960
that's the Kazushi pattern you see it
 

569
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:38,330
that's the Kazushi pattern you see it
okay so I'm with him

570
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:38,340
okay so I'm with him
 

571
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,820
okay so I'm with him
now if I stay here he's gonna come up

572
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:40,830
now if I stay here he's gonna come up
 

573
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,900
now if I stay here he's gonna come up
again you see that yo he's falling this

574
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:44,910
again you see that yo he's falling this
 

575
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:53,050
again you see that yo he's falling this
way and I yield that way you see no here

576
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,060
way and I yield that way you see no here
 

577
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:58,760
way and I yield that way you see no here
like that and now his momentum does the

578
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:58,770
like that and now his momentum does the
 

579
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,210
like that and now his momentum does the
rest

580
00:21:59,210 --> 00:21:59,220
rest
 

581
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,320
rest
I don't do it his legs go out cuz he's

582
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,330
I don't do it his legs go out cuz he's
 

583
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,450
I don't do it his legs go out cuz he's
going forward so I'm gonna leave his

584
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:05,460
going forward so I'm gonna leave his
 

585
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,990
going forward so I'm gonna leave his
head here and his feet keep walking and

586
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,000
head here and his feet keep walking and
 

587
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,430
head here and his feet keep walking and
you go to that line and broccoli is

588
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:10,440
you go to that line and broccoli is
 

589
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,380
you go to that line and broccoli is
gonna fall outside the base of support

590
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:12,390
gonna fall outside the base of support
 

591
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:19,840
gonna fall outside the base of support
you see that so I'm not going around

592
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:19,850
you see that so I'm not going around
 

593
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:26,270
you see that so I'm not going around
whoa again you see my hand go down and

594
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:26,280
whoa again you see my hand go down and
 

595
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,460
whoa again you see my hand go down and
you think that's where the throw is but

596
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:28,470
you think that's where the throw is but
 

597
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,200
you think that's where the throw is but
that's not where the throwing that's

598
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,210
that's not where the throwing that's
 

599
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,560
that's not where the throwing that's
just the I can't even I'm following him

600
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:33,570
just the I can't even I'm following him
 

601
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:40,550
just the I can't even I'm following him
down come around arm around wall this

602
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:40,560
down come around arm around wall this
 

603
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:48,039
down come around arm around wall this
way

604
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:48,049

 

605
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:55,730

around on the faster he goes the smaller

606
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:55,740
around on the faster he goes the smaller
 

607
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,340

bike movement can be the greater that

608
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,350
bike movement can be the greater that
 

609
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,590
bike movement can be the greater that
engagement when you do the other way the

610
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:00,600
engagement when you do the other way the
 

611
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,539
engagement when you do the other way the
faster he goes with the stronger he goes

612
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:02,549
faster he goes with the stronger he goes
 

613
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,090
faster he goes with the stronger he goes
the more classical hobbies of my

614
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:05,100
the more classical hobbies of my
 

615
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,669
the more classical hobbies of my
mechanical baggage this goes away okay

616
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
mechanical baggage this goes away okay
 

617
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,840
mechanical baggage this goes away okay
so you go he goes far and it's very

618
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:11,850
so you go he goes far and it's very
 

619
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:16,310
so you go he goes far and it's very
quick very quick it's just a tilt and

620
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,320
quick very quick it's just a tilt and
 

621
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,980
quick very quick it's just a tilt and
then the legs keep going that's all I'm

622
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:18,990
then the legs keep going that's all I'm
 

623
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,340
then the legs keep going that's all I'm
doing

624
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:19,350
doing
 

625
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:24,110
doing
okay let's try to so let's go back he's

626
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,120
okay let's try to so let's go back he's
 

627
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:39,630
okay let's try to so let's go back he's
pushing I am you being to that

628
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:39,640

 

629
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:47,500

if I stay here what's gonna happen you

630
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:47,510
if I stay here what's gonna happen you
 

631
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,060
if I stay here what's gonna happen you
you're wondering how do I get the tilt

632
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,070
you're wondering how do I get the tilt
 

633
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,780
you're wondering how do I get the tilt
well there is a contest station and what

634
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:55,790
well there is a contest station and what
 

635
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:59,260
well there is a contest station and what
I'm doing is letting off pressure to

636
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,270
I'm doing is letting off pressure to
 

637
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,590
I'm doing is letting off pressure to
keep the friction to get the tilt you

638
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:02,600
keep the friction to get the tilt you
 

639
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,460
keep the friction to get the tilt you

you do taking even avi on this hand

654
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:53,830
you do taking even avi on this hand
 

655
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,040
you do taking even avi on this hand
don't you don't even grab the taller his

656
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,050
don't you don't even grab the taller his
 

657
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,850
don't you don't even grab the taller his
energy was going in he's seen energies

658
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:00,860
energy was going in he's seen energies

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,220
energy was going in he's seen energies
going in and that's what I used to turn

660
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:03,230
going in and that's what I used to turn

them that energy creates a friction here

662
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:06,980
them that energy creates a friction here

he goes and I taking it off

664
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360

 

665
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,700

so he goes and the friction we keeps

666
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:19,710
so he goes and the friction we keeps
 

667
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,180
so he goes and the friction we keeps
going and I just keep taking it all so

668
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:23,190
going and I just keep taking it all so
 

669
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,940
going and I just keep taking it all so
that I can keep it turning now and then

670
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:25,950
that I can keep it turning now and then
 

671
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,700
that I can keep it turning now and then
I have that tilt you see

672
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:28,710
I have that tilt you see
 

673
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,240
I have that tilt you see
so that is why is Deakin testing this

674
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,250
so that is why is Deakin testing this
 

675
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:36,080
so that is why is Deakin testing this
bike he's here he's pushing I am taking

pressure off with the yield do you see

678
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:41,450

 

679
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,740

the same exact thing same exacting here

680
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:45,750
the same exact thing same exacting here
 

681
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,090
the same exact thing same exacting here
the pressure is taking the yield boom oh

682
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,100
the pressure is taking the yield boom oh
 

683
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,800
the pressure is taking the yield boom oh
there we are

684
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:51,810
there we are
 

685
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,180
there we are
and I just keep incremental e taking it

686
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,190
and I just keep incremental e taking it
 

687
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,780
and I just keep incremental e taking it
off till I get

688
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:57,790
off till I get

00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:15,980

 

691
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:21,240

you'll see that this is different okay

692
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,250
