469
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,470
right so as he goes what's what's going
to give me that Vector well if I don't

470
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
to give me that Vector well if I don't
 

471
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,909
to give me that Vector well if I don't
move in with him I'm not going to get it

472
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:34,919
move in with him I'm not going to get it
 

473
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,070

479
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,150
him you see I'm walk I can walk with him
and now I'm doing that same drill but

480
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
and now I'm doing that same drill but
 

481
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,950
and now I'm doing that same drill but
I'm doing it with right adashi so I go

482
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:49,960
I'm doing it with right adashi so I go
 

483
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,710
I'm doing it with right adashi so I go
here and I go here right you see

here and I go here right you see
 

485
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,789
here and I go here right you see
that and that gives me that

486
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799
that and that gives me that
 

487
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,190
that and that gives me that
Vector into his Center so his Center is

488
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
Vector into his Center so his Center is
 

489
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,470
Vector into his Center so his Center is
getting manipulated even if I don't

490
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:03,480
getting manipulated even if I don't
 

491
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,990
getting manipulated even if I don't
knock him down I will check him out

determines how much you knock him down

496
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
determines how much you knock him down
 

497
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,470

is how much his Center comes forward

498
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
is how much his Center comes forward
 

499
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,710
is how much his Center comes forward
just like for example he's here right

500

00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
and I have X range on my punch right and
 

503
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,149
and I have X range on my punch right and
I'm only allowed y uh closing of the Gap

504
