00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
your hand is up
 

339
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,189
your hand is up
right in there okay let's try it okay so

340
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
right in there okay let's try it okay so
 

341
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,870
right in there okay let's try it okay so
you're just mad at resistance now okay

342
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
you're just mad at resistance now okay
 

343
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,029
you're just mad at resistance now okay
he's just he's not my target now he is

344
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
he's just he's not my target now he is
 

345
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,189
he's just he's not my target now he is
representing resistance to target do you

346
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
representing resistance to target do you
 

347
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,230
representing resistance to target do you
understand

348
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
understand
 

349
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,909
understand
so i i'm not doing what you think like

350
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
so i i'm not doing what you think like
 

351
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,430
so i i'm not doing what you think like
boxing hands

352
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
boxing hands
 

353
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,870
boxing hands
i have to be able to punch above my

354
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
i have to be able to punch above my
 

355
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,790
i have to be able to punch above my
weight class so i have to round factor

356
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
weight class so i have to round factor
 

357
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,950
weight class so i have to round factor
everything okay so

358
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
everything okay so
 

359
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,990
everything okay so
when i do my it's not hip rotation

360
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
when i do my it's not hip rotation
 

361
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,550
when i do my it's not hip rotation
it's ground vectoring okay so the ground

362
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
it's ground vectoring okay so the ground
 

363
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,870
it's ground vectoring okay so the ground
vector is going through you see when i

364
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880
vector is going through you see when i
 

365
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,510
vector is going through you see when i
do my cross oh it's going through

366
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
do my cross oh it's going through
 

367
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,230
do my cross oh it's going through
i'm gonna displace matter at a minimum

368
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
i'm gonna displace matter at a minimum
 

369
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,189
i'm gonna displace matter at a minimum
okay

370
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
okay
 

371
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,189
okay
and then the same thing

372
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
and then the same thing
 

373
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,749
and then the same thing
on the hook on the hook

374
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759
on the hook on the hook
 

375
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,510
on the hook on the hook
right i'm not going

376
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
right i'm not going
 

377
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,870
right i'm not going
here like this it's ground vectoring

378
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
here like this it's ground vectoring
 

379
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,830
here like this it's ground vectoring
it through

380
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
it through
 

381
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,710
it through
everything through here boom through

382
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
everything through here boom through
 

383
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,589
everything through here boom through
okay

384

this foot starts on this foot goes to
 

393
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,029
this foot starts on this foot goes to
the other boom and i put his mask into

394
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
the other boom and i put his mask into
 

395
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,270
the other boom and i put his mask into
that foot you got it okay so you're

396
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
that foot you got it okay so you're
 

397
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,909
that foot you got it okay so you're
going to do this drill now your hair

398
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
going to do this drill now your hair
 

399
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,830
going to do this drill now your hair
feel going to be the back wall of the

400
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
feel going to be the back wall of the
 

401
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,950
feel going to be the back wall of the
foot

402
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
foot
 

403
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,830
foot
boom through and then the other one

404
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
boom through and then the other one
 

405
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,790
boom through and then the other one
is over here move starts there and goes

406
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
is over here move starts there and goes
 

407
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,390
is over here move starts there and goes
here pull in okay go

408
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
here pull in okay go
 

409
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,790
here pull in okay go
okay so she's doing these this ground

410
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
okay so she's doing these this ground
 

411
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:37,110
okay so she's doing these this ground
vectoring on this mass she goes

412
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120

 

413
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,310

now

414
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320

 

415

417
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,070

feel that crown cross on that left foot

418
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
feel that crown cross on that left foot
 

419
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,190
feel that crown cross on that left foot
okay

420
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
okay
 

421
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,550

okay
 

423
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,670
okay
let's get a little bit more uh dynamism

424
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
let's get a little bit more uh dynamism
 

425
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,630
let's get a little bit more uh dynamism
to it

426
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
to it
 

427
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,750
to it
um

428
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
um
 

429
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,190
um
he's gonna oh he's gonna get the jab and

430
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
he's gonna oh he's gonna get the jab and
 

431
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,350
he's gonna oh he's gonna get the jab and
i'm gonna work the kimusubi on one of

432
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
i'm gonna work the kimusubi on one of
 

433
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,509
i'm gonna work the kimusubi on one of
these things okay well my target

434
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
these things okay well my target
 

435
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,910
these things okay well my target
selection might change because a lot of

436
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
selection might change because a lot of
 

437
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,990
selection might change because a lot of
you have different styles and once you

438
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
you have different styles and once you
 

439
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,150
you have different styles and once you
go dynamic your style comes out you're

440
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
go dynamic your style comes out you're
 

441
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,389
go dynamic your style comes out you're
not given the openings but the good new

442
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
not given the openings but the good new
 

443
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,150
not given the openings but the good new
is going to give different openings so

444
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
is going to give different openings so
 

445
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,710
is going to give different openings so
that you can train the noggin good okay

446
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
that you can train the noggin good okay
 

447
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,230
that you can train the noggin good okay
key to this though

448
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
key to this though
 

449
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,750
key to this though
is he goes

450
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
is he goes
 

451
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,070
is he goes
and you're caught flat footed do you see

452
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
and you're caught flat footed do you see
 

453
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,790
and you're caught flat footed do you see
that keep keep the musubi you can move

454
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
that keep keep the musubi you can move
 

455
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,150
that keep keep the musubi you can move
around if you want right and get him to

456
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
around if you want right and get him to
 

457
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,070
around if you want right and get him to
beat him with the jab it can be a little

458
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
beat him with the jab it can be a little
 

459
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,470
beat him with the jab it can be a little
more dynamic and then your job is to get

460
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
more dynamic and then your job is to get
 

461
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,070
more dynamic and then your job is to get
that jab jab oh and so i can start

462
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
that jab jab oh and so i can start
 

463
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,910
that jab jab oh and so i can start
working my things do you got it so you

464
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
working my things do you got it so you
 

465
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,710
working my things do you got it so you
can move around a little more all right

466
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
can move around a little more all right
 

467
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,870
can move around a little more all right
and you get those things going okay all

468
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880
and you get those things going okay all
 

469
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,190
and you get those things going okay all
right here we go again don't

470
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
right here we go again don't
 

471
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,509
right here we go again don't
read into the drills you're not fighting

472
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
read into the drills you're not fighting
 

473
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,070
read into the drills you're not fighting
yet it's just a micro moment of the

474
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
yet it's just a micro moment of the
 

475
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,269
yet it's just a micro moment of the
variable

476
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
variable
 

477
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,150
variable
uh the ever changing mind okay so for

478
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
uh the ever changing mind okay so for
 

479
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,230
uh the ever changing mind okay so for
example we go and now you guys are here

480
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
example we go and now you guys are here
 

481
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,990
example we go and now you guys are here
like this

482
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
like this
 

483
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,590
like this
you get it and this is going to be

484
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
you get it and this is going to be
 

485
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,190
you get it and this is going to be
grappling ranging things like that okay

486
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
grappling ranging things like that okay
 

487
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,590
grappling ranging things like that okay
and how did you get there well if how

488
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
and how did you get there well if how
 

489
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,910
and how did you get there well if how
you got there so he's coming close right

490
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
you got there so he's coming close right
 

491
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,430
you got there so he's coming close right
like boom

492
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
like boom
 

493
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,069
like boom
he's in range of your hand strikes you

494
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
he's in range of your hand strikes you
 

495
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,110
he's in range of your hand strikes you
see that

496
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
see that
 

497
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,790
see that
um so

498
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
um so
 

499
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,110
um so
just work oh this was the money that we

500
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
just work oh this was the money that we
 

501
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,910
just work oh this was the money that we
work

502
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
work
 

503
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,470
work
i worked at mine

504
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
i worked at mine
 

505
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,949
i worked at mine
you see that's where the counter happens

506
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
you see that's where the counter happens
 

507
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,670
you see that's where the counter happens
so it's not when i'm in range to throw

508
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
so it's not when i'm in range to throw
 

509
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,230
so it's not when i'm in range to throw
my strikes it's not when it's in range

510
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
my strikes it's not when it's in range
 

511
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,550
my strikes it's not when it's in range
for him to throw his strikes i'm just

512
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
for him to throw his strikes i'm just
 

513
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,710
for him to throw his strikes i'm just
slightly out of that range do you see

514
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
slightly out of that range do you see
 

515
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,790
slightly out of that range do you see
that and then he goes for it anyways

516
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
that and then he goes for it anyways
 

517
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,590
that and then he goes for it anyways
okay

518
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
okay
 

519
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,230
okay
oh likewise

520
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
oh likewise
 

521
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,750
oh likewise
we go back right and he goes he's coming

522
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
we go back right and he goes he's coming
 

523
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,030
we go back right and he goes he's coming
in oh and in real life that would be

524
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
in oh and in real life that would be
 

525
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,550
in oh and in real life that would be
another range do you see we're not

526
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
another range do you see we're not
 

527
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,030
another range do you see we're not
working that range you got it so you

528
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
working that range you got it so you
 

529
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,430
working that range you got it so you
just work the range from the micro drill

530
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
just work the range from the micro drill
 

531
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,150
just work the range from the micro drill
and the micro drill is here he can't

532
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
and the micro drill is here he can't
 

533
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,550
and the micro drill is here he can't
can't reach me from here you see i can't

534
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
can't reach me from here you see i can't
 

535
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,150
can't reach me from here you see i can't
reach him from here

536
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
reach him from here
 

537
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,630
reach him from here
but i stay just outside of that you're

538
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
but i stay just outside of that you're
 

539
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,310
but i stay just outside of that you're
gonna have to do better than that

540
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
gonna have to do better than that
 

541
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,389
gonna have to do better than that
okay boom there it is right there do you

542
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
okay boom there it is right there do you
 

543
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,430
okay boom there it is right there do you
understand okay and then likewise when

544
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
understand okay and then likewise when
 

545
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,910
understand okay and then likewise when
i'm here boom i'm not going to jam my

546
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
i'm here boom i'm not going to jam my
 

547
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,590
i'm here boom i'm not going to jam my
strikes do you see i'm going to keep

548
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
strikes do you see i'm going to keep
 

549
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,590
strikes do you see i'm going to keep
myself in striking rate so i'm in

550
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
myself in striking rate so i'm in
 

551
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,870
myself in striking rate so i'm in
striking right

552
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
striking right
 

553
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,430
striking right
so i can do my strikes okay so they're

554
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
so i can do my strikes okay so they're
 

555
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,069
so i can do my strikes okay so they're
still viable and they're not jammed here

556
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
still viable and they're not jammed here
 

557
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,470
still viable and they're not jammed here
and this is just a little

558
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
and this is just a little
 

559
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,069
and this is just a little
tummy table okay

560
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
tummy table okay
 

561
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,750
tummy table okay
so try it again pay attention to the

562
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
so try it again pay attention to the
 

563
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,190
so try it again pay attention to the
lives very dynamic okay go

564
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
lives very dynamic okay go
 

565
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,190
lives very dynamic okay go
okay um

566
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200

 

567
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,829

so i have to in order for me to start

568
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
so i have to in order for me to start
 

569
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,069
so i have to in order for me to start
getting these counters as i said

570
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079
getting these counters as i said
 

571
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,069
getting these counters as i said
i have to put him where he's bridging

572
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
i have to put him where he's bridging
 

573
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,230
i have to put him where he's bridging
with the jab that's technically what

574
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
with the jab that's technically what
 

575
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,230
with the jab that's technically what
he's trying to do okay

576
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
he's trying to do okay
 

577
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,590
he's trying to do okay
meaning if he if in this drill he moves

578
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
meaning if he if in this drill he moves
 

579
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,829
meaning if he if in this drill he moves
in without throwing any strides oh i'm

580
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
in without throwing any strides oh i'm
 

581
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,190
in without throwing any strides oh i'm
an attacker okay so i'm just outside of

582
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
an attacker okay so i'm just outside of
 

583
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,949
an attacker okay so i'm just outside of
my own range which means i'm just

584
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
my own range which means i'm just
 

585
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,430
my own range which means i'm just
outside of his own range and that's why

586
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
outside of his own range and that's why
 

587
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,269
outside of his own range and that's why
he bridges with it and instead of doing

588
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
he bridges with it and instead of doing
 

589
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,949
he bridges with it and instead of doing
this this time right i do this this time

590
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
this this time right i do this this time
 

591
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,430
this this time right i do this this time
boom you got it okay and towards that
