you adopt that mind because of the
 

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,969
you adopt that mind because of the
body-mind connection you've pretty much

28
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:04,979
body-mind connection you've pretty much
 

29
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,140
body-mind connection you've pretty much

I'll get it over and over and over and

56
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:05,599
I'll get it over and over and over and
 

57
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,469
I'll get it over and over and over and
over again and then what happens in your

58
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
over again and then what happens in your
 

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,419
over again and then what happens in your
mind is you go I've done that technique

60
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:10,429
mind is you go I've done that technique
 

61
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:12,640
mind is you go I've done that technique
five times I got to stop doing that

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:12,650
five times I got to stop doing that
 

63
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,660
five times I got to stop doing that
technique and now you have a repulsion

64
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:16,670
technique and now you have a repulsion
 

65
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,780
technique and now you have a repulsion
to that technique and you have an

66
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:19,790
to that technique and you have an
 

67
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,520
to that technique and you have an

was wrong with eating me nugget if it

70
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:27,799
was wrong with eating me nugget if it
 

71
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,819
was wrong with eating me nugget if it
was matching the energy that you were

72
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:30,829
was matching the energy that you were
 

73
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:35,790
was matching the energy that you were
dealing with do you see that

74
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:35,800

 

75
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,630

because what Jia was a training is is

76
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:39,640
because what Jia was a training is is
 

77
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:46,880
because what Jia was a training is is
really a kind of playing with energy and

78
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:46,890
really a kind of playing with energy and
 

79
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,070
really a kind of playing with energy and
the unfortunate part is that our

80
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
the unfortunate part is that our
 

81
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,740
the unfortunate part is that our
thinking happens in a kind of narrative

82
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:54,750
thinking happens in a kind of narrative
 

83
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,810
thinking happens in a kind of narrative
manner we like to think that there's a

84
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:57,820
manner we like to think that there's a
 

85
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:05,120
manner we like to think that there's a
beginning the middle and an end the door

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,130

 

87
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:11,520

and you're actually having as you're

88
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:11,530
and you're actually having as you're
 

89
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:18,810
and you're actually having as you're
training this kind of hero fantasy which

90
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:18,820
training this kind of hero fantasy which
 

91
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,130
training this kind of hero fantasy which
goes in in sync with that competition

92
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,140
goes in in sync with that competition
 

93
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,800
goes in in sync with that competition
that you're trying to win and try not to

94
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:25,810
that you're trying to win and try not to
 

95
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,330
that you're trying to win and try not to
lose so you go okay here comes my

96
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:30,340
lose so you go okay here comes my
 

97
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,600
lose so you go okay here comes my
attacker now that's the start of it and

98
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:33,610
attacker now that's the start of it and
 

99
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,060
attacker now that's the start of it and
then you do the middle part of this

100
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,070
then you do the middle part of this
 

101
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,760
then you do the middle part of this
movie you're in and then you find the

102
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:38,770
movie you're in and then you find the
 

103
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,530
movie you're in and then you find the
ending which ends with you on the

104
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:40,540
ending which ends with you on the
 

105
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,449
ending which ends with you on the
mountaintop with your arms and the fuse

106
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:42,459
mountaintop with your arms and the fuse
 

107
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:49,640
mountaintop with your arms and the fuse
right really what's happening is it's

108
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:49,650
right really what's happening is it's
 

109
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:56,610
right really what's happening is it's
just the nature of the the way that we

110
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:56,620
just the nature of the the way that we
 

111
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,130
just the nature of the the way that we
have to practice that it appears that

112
00:03:59,130 --> 00:03:59,140
have to practice that it appears that
 

113
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,840
have to practice that it appears that
there's a beginning and an ending but

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:03,850
there's a beginning and an ending but
 

115
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,940
there's a beginning and an ending but
some systems work with energy

116
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:05,950
some systems work with energy
 

117
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,250
some systems work with energy
transference and they don't they don't

118
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:08,260
transference and they don't they don't
 

119
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,840
transference and they don't they don't
have a disconnect that allows a beginner

120
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:12,850
have a disconnect that allows a beginner
 

121
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,470
have a disconnect that allows a beginner
practitioner to feel that oh this is a

122
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:16,480
practitioner to feel that oh this is a
 

123
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,760
practitioner to feel that oh this is a
new beginning so when we we might do

124
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:20,770
new beginning so when we we might do
 

125
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:26,340
new beginning so when we we might do
some you know some of the more the knife

126
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:26,350
some you know some of the more the knife
 

127
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,500
some you know some of the more the knife
flows or we might do some trapping

128
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:28,510
flows or we might do some trapping
 

129
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,830
flows or we might do some trapping
drills and where does it stop and start

130
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
drills and where does it stop and start
 

131
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,630
drills and where does it stop and start
you just keep going with the energy

132
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:33,640
you just keep going with the energy
 

133
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,150
you just keep going with the energy
transference right until the teacher

134
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160

tells you okay switch roles or switch

136
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:38,620
tells you okay switch roles or switch
 

137
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,159
tells you okay switch roles or switch
partners and and then you keep working

138
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:41,169
partners and and then you keep working
 

139
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:44,760
partners and and then you keep working
that drill

140
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:44,770

 

141
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,969

why is that important I think that's

142
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:48,979
why is that important I think that's
 

143
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:52,209
why is that important I think that's
important because one you're really

144
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:52,219
important because one you're really
 

145
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:55,419
important because one you're really
deluding yourself if you think that you

146
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:55,429
deluding yourself if you think that you
 

147
00:04:55,429 --> 00:05:02,049
deluding yourself if you think that you
are going to win a G Wazza and then more

148
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:02,059
are going to win a G Wazza and then more
 

149
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:05,260
are going to win a G Wazza and then more
so that if you do win that G was it that

150
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:05,270
so that if you do win that G was it that
 

151
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,209
so that if you do win that G was it that
that means you're now ready to fight it

152
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:10,219
that means you're now ready to fight it
 

153
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:14,260
that means you're now ready to fight it
doesn't mean that there's no one-to-one

154
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,270
doesn't mean that there's no one-to-one
 

155
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:19,469
doesn't mean that there's no one-to-one
direct correlation between GU aza and

direct correlation between GU aza and
 

157
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:25,299
direct correlation between GU aza and
fighting there is a skill in G us that

158
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:25,309
fighting there is a skill in G us that
 

159
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:29,769
fighting there is a skill in G us that
you need to fight people bigger than you

160
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:29,779
you need to fight people bigger than you
 

161
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,079
you need to fight people bigger than you
stronger than you

162
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:31,089
stronger than you
 

163
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:34,269
stronger than you

406
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:33,610
spontaneous kind what drill would you
 

407
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,520

else going on let's just work on this
right so it's not the end all of your

418
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,370
right so it's not the end all of your
 

419
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,940
right so it's not the end all of your
training but you still have a

420
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:05,950
training but you still have a
 

421
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,090
training but you still have a
responsibility to make sure you're

422
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:09,100
responsibility to make sure you're
 

423
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,570
responsibility to make sure you're
practicing it correctly so that you

424
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:12,580
practicing it correctly so that you
 

425
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:18,050
practicing it correctly so that you
don't rely on setups and favourite moves

426
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,060
don't rely on setups and favourite moves
 

427
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,520
don't rely on setups and favourite moves
because those only work on idiots and

428
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:22,530
because those only work on idiots and
 

429
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,990
because those only work on idiots and
that's from the Marshall perspective

430
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,000
that's from the Marshall perspective
 

431
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,290
that's from the Marshall perspective
from the spiritual perspective it's even

432
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:28,300
from the spiritual perspective it's even
 

433
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:35,580
from the spiritual perspective it's even
worse because that's a federal mind that

434
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:35,590
worse because that's a federal mind that
 

435
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:42,210
worse because that's a federal mind that
is a preference seeking mind that is a

436
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:42,220
is a preference seeking mind that is a
 

437
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:49,130
is a preference seeking mind that is a
resistant mind an avoidance mind it is

438
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:49,140
resistant mind an avoidance mind it is
 

439
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:56,150
resistant mind an avoidance mind it is
spiritually immature

440
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160

 

441
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,880

so it's even more so that when you train

442
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:58,890
so it's even more so that when you train
 

443
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:05,480
so it's even more so that when you train
in these more live environments that you

444
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:05,490
in these more live environments that you
 

445
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,170
in these more live environments that you
really pay attention to the actual goals

446
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:09,180
really pay attention to the actual goals
 

447
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,230
really pay attention to the actual goals
of the training that you are self

448
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
of the training that you are self
 

449
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,140
of the training that you are self

things like doing it even now get five

470
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:52,770
things like doing it even now get five
 

471
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,250
things like doing it even now get five
times in a row yeah you're not gonna do

472
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,260
times in a row yeah you're not gonna do
 

473
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,560
times in a row yeah you're not gonna do
that anymore

474
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:56,570
that anymore
 

475
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,600
that anymore
strangely strangely that doesn't tend to

476
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,610
strangely strangely that doesn't tend to
 

477
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,720
strangely strangely that doesn't tend to
happen because especially when you allow

478
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:02,730
happen because especially when you allow
 

479
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,930
happen because especially when you allow
three or four okay they don't all talk

three or four okay they don't all talk
 

481
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,920
three or four okay they don't all talk
the same because they can't come in at

482
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:09,930
the same because they can't come in at
 

483
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,670
the same because they can't come in at
the same angle and the same time and the
