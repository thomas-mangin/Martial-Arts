principles in your mind

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,520
principles in your mind
 

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,110
principles in your mind
right

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,120
right
 

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,789
right
but never fall down on one knee because

6
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:06,799
but never fall down on one knee because
 

7
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,030
but never fall down on one knee because
there's five other attackers

8
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,040
there's five other attackers
 

9
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,470
there's five other attackers
and when you're down there they can get

10
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480
and when you're down there they can get
 

11
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,830
and when you're down there they can get
you

12
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:11,840
you
 

13
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,910
you
so don't thank you

14
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920

 

15
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,070

so cytosensei he he said um

16
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,080
so cytosensei he he said um
 

17
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,710
so cytosensei he he said um
this is a hombu technique

18
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
this is a hombu technique
 

19
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,349
this is a hombu technique
because you can't lift your arm up when

20
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:25,359
because you can't lift your arm up when
 

21
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,990
because you can't lift your arm up when
somebody is strong

22
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000
somebody is strong
 

23
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,110
somebody is strong
so let's uh where's danny

24
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120

 

25
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,069

so

26
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
so
 

27
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,389
so
we go backwards to go forward so i put

28
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
we go backwards to go forward so i put
 

29
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,750
we go backwards to go forward so i put
my arm up here he comes he takes it down

30
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
my arm up here he comes he takes it down
 

31
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,069
my arm up here he comes he takes it down
we come around here what do i do i try

32
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
we come around here what do i do i try
 

33
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:42,790
we come around here what do i do i try
and

34
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
and
 

35
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,069
and
now lift my arms up

36
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
now lift my arms up
 

37
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,310
now lift my arms up
in kina nagari

38
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320

 

39
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,869

i can do it

40
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:52,879
i can do it
 

41
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,950
i can do it
as long as i exchange my body for my arm

42
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960
as long as i exchange my body for my arm
 

43
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,270
as long as i exchange my body for my arm
if i go here and it comes around here

44
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
if i go here and it comes around here
 

45
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,750
if i go here and it comes around here
when it's down here there's no

46
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
when it's down here there's no
 

47
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,229
when it's down here there's no
there's no way you can bring that arm

48
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
there's no way you can bring that arm
 

49
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,109
there's no way you can bring that arm
higher anymore

50
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
higher anymore
 

51
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,429
higher anymore
hence that's why i use the string method

52
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
hence that's why i use the string method
 

53
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,270
hence that's why i use the string method
because

54
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
because
 

55
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,870
because
you've got a chance you've got a small

56
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
you've got a chance you've got a small
 

57
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,990
you've got a chance you've got a small
window

58
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
window
 

59
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,230
window
here's the window

60
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240

 

61
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,590

to get the technique

62
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600

 

63
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,910

so this

64
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
so this
 

65
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,469
so this
this

66
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
this
 

67
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,310
this
this

68
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
this
 

69
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,390
this
means that once the

70
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
means that once the
 

71
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,630
means that once the
point is chosen

72
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
point is chosen
 

73
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,429
point is chosen
it cannot alter

74
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
it cannot alter
 

75
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,109
it cannot alter
ah but i could redirect him

76
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119

 

77
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,190

what with strength

78
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200

 

79
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,870

i'll get you

80
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
i'll get you
 

81
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,830
i'll get you
i'll do it somehow

82
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840

 

83
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,310

you know so

84
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320

 

85
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,149

so if you want to do this technique

86
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159

 

87
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,230

you have to do it quick

88
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
you have to do it quick
 

89
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,429
you have to do it quick
if you go if you do this technique

90
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
if you go if you do this technique
 

91
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,669
if you go if you do this technique
forget that one i've just done they're

92
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
forget that one i've just done they're
 

93
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,869
forget that one i've just done they're
down there

94
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
down there
 

95
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,070
down there
do

96
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
do
 

97
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,110
do
this technique

98
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120

 

99
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,510

all right so in your toolbox we've all

100
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
all right so in your toolbox we've all
 

101
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,750
all right so in your toolbox we've all
got a toolbox and as we get

102
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
got a toolbox and as we get
 

103
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,750
got a toolbox and as we get
over the years we get

104
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
over the years we get
 

105
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,070
over the years we get
a better spanner and we give the

106
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
a better spanner and we give the
 

107
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,830
a better spanner and we give the
apprentice

108
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
apprentice
 

109
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,229
apprentice
the the cheaper spanners that we bought

110
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
the the cheaper spanners that we bought
 

111
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,270
the the cheaper spanners that we bought
when we were apprentice but we've stuck

112
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
when we were apprentice but we've stuck
 

113
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,550
when we were apprentice but we've stuck
to the job

114
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
to the job
 

115
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,070
to the job
i want the

116
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
i want the
 

117
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,589
i want the
more shinier the better ones as we get

118
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
more shinier the better ones as we get
 

119
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,790
more shinier the better ones as we get
better

120
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
better
 

121
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,190
better
we will start to get things that perhaps

122
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
we will start to get things that perhaps
 

123
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,949
we will start to get things that perhaps
bend a little to get into special places

124
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
bend a little to get into special places
 

125
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,470
bend a little to get into special places
and that's really what you're doing

126
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
and that's really what you're doing
 

127
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,150
and that's really what you're doing
going through the grades

128
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
going through the grades
 

129
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,150
going through the grades
you're you're saying

130
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160

 

131
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,630

yeah but i can do this

132
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
yeah but i can do this
 

133
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,430
yeah but i can do this
so why should i improve on it i remember

134
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
so why should i improve on it i remember
 

135
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,149
so why should i improve on it i remember
teaching at um your seminar one night

136
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
teaching at um your seminar one night
 

137
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,550
teaching at um your seminar one night
and i said to this black belt

138
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
and i said to this black belt
 

139
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,390
and i said to this black belt
you can't do that

140
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
you can't do that
 

141
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,910
you can't do that
it works for me he said

142
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920

 

143
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,630

i've

144
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
i've
 

145
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,670
i've
i i thought i i i

146
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
i i thought i i i
 

147
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,509
i i thought i i i
i thought i won't say no more to him

148
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
i thought i won't say no more to him
 

149
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,869
i thought i won't say no more to him
then because he's obviously got his

150
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
then because he's obviously got his
 

151
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,070
then because he's obviously got his
aikido

152
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
aikido
 

153
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,070
aikido
worked out so why did it take 20 years

154
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
worked out so why did it take 20 years
 

155
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,430
worked out so why did it take 20 years
for me to exchange strength

156
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
for me to exchange strength
 

157
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,149
for me to exchange strength
to coke you you can take coke you but

158
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
to coke you you can take coke you but
 

159
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,589
to coke you you can take coke you but
really it's common sense

160
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
really it's common sense
 

161
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,509
really it's common sense
well i can't do that well what you're

162
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
well i can't do that well what you're
 

163
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,869
well i can't do that well what you're
going to do well i'm trying to do the

164
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
going to do well i'm trying to do the
 

165
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,229
going to do well i'm trying to do the
technique well

166
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
technique well
 

167
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,229
technique well
that technique's not available today you

168
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
that technique's not available today you
 

169
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,110
that technique's not available today you
know

170
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
know
 

171
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,869
know
you've got to do you've got to do

172
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
you've got to do you've got to do
 

173
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,509
you've got to do you've got to do
something else

174
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
something else
 

175
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,390
something else
so

176
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
so
 

177
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,910
so
