I I suppose at the beginning you'll have
 

151
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,110
I I suppose at the beginning you'll have
to like actually imagine your death to

152
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
to like actually imagine your death to
 

153

go of the tension
 

157
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,749
go of the tension
to feel the tissue drop. Although this

00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
to feel the tissue drop. Although this
 

159
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,350
to feel the tissue drop. Although this
morning I told you the tissue could go

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
morning I told you the tissue could go
 

161
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,870
morning I told you the tissue could go
up that's not actually released. Okay.

162
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
up that's not actually released. Okay.

169
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,150
I'm dead. Okay. Sometimes you'll have to
go through

170
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160

 

171
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,629

the Ruby truth. Your kids are not your

172
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
the Ruby truth. Your kids are not your
 

173
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,150
the Ruby truth. Your kids are not your
kids.

174
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160

You have kids.

176
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
You have kids.
 

177
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,150
You have kids.
Um because you'll be thinking I can't

178
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
Um because you'll be thinking I can't
 

179
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,749
Um because you'll be thinking I can't
die now. I got to take care of these

180
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
die now. I got to take care of these
 

181
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,110
die now. I got to take care of these
kids.

182
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
kids.
 

183
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,070
kids.
things like that.

184
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
things like that.
 

185
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,629
things like that.
Um maybe even some some sadness might

186
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
Um maybe even some some sadness might
 

187
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,469
Um maybe even some some sadness might
creep in to your dying sad. Okay. But

188
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
creep in to your dying sad. Okay. But
 

189
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,790
creep in to your dying sad. Okay. But
ultimately what it is is that in the

190
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
ultimately what it is is that in the
 

191
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,110
ultimately what it is is that in the
same way that you're letting the force

192
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,120
same way that you're letting the force
 

193
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,510
same way that you're letting the force
pass through your gravity, you're

194
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
pass through your gravity, you're
 

195
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,830
pass through your gravity, you're
letting the force pass through your

196
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
letting the force pass through your
 

197
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,510
letting the force pass through your
identity.

198
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
identity.
 

199
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,189
identity.
Um,

200
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
Um,
 

201
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,350
Um,
and in the same way that you're not

202
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
and in the same way that you're not
 

203
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,150
and in the same way that you're not
contesting against that force, you're

204
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
contesting against that force, you're
 

205
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,710
contesting against that force, you're
doing the same thing. So, if I were to

206
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
doing the same thing. So, if I were to
 

207
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,270
doing the same thing. So, if I were to
put it poetically,

208
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
put it poetically,
 

209
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,749
put it poetically,
it it feels like in the same way I'm

210
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
it it feels like in the same way I'm
 

211
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,150
it it feels like in the same way I'm
trying to o open my hand and let

212
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
trying to o open my hand and let
 

213
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,469
trying to o open my hand and let
something drop out of it. I'm trying to

214
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
something drop out of it. I'm trying to
 

215
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,990
something drop out of it. I'm trying to
open myself to let myself fall away.

216
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
open myself to let myself fall away.
 

217
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,550
open myself to let myself fall away.
Okay. Um,

218
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
Okay. Um,
 

219
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,350
Okay. Um,
now what the does that mean? Okay.

220
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
now what the does that mean? Okay.
 

221
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,830
now what the does that mean? Okay.
But you're on you're on the Someone said

222
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
But you're on you're on the Someone said
 

223
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,430
But you're on you're on the Someone said
it to you. Okay. Um, so let's go through

224
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
it to you. Okay. Um, so let's go through
 

225
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,510
it to you. Okay. Um, so let's go through
it and let's find that level of

226
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
it and let's find that level of
 

227
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,870
it and let's find that level of
releasing. Okay. That and that level and

228
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
releasing. Okay. That and that level and
 

229
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,110
releasing. Okay. That and that level and
that and therein is the only place

230
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
that and therein is the only place
 

231
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,150
that and therein is the only place
acceptance as we mean it comes in. It's

232
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
acceptance as we mean it comes in. It's
 

233
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,390
acceptance as we mean it comes in. It's
the only place that non-resistance

234
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
the only place that non-resistance
 

235
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,550
the only place that non-resistance
actually comes in. Everything before

236
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
actually comes in. Everything before
 

237
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,430
actually comes in. Everything before
that is resistance and contestation and

238
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
that is resistance and contestation and
 

239
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,070
that is resistance and contestation and
non-acceptance. Okay. But we it's a

240
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
non-acceptance. Okay. But we it's a
 

241
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,990
non-acceptance. Okay. But we it's a
skill. So we have to progress for it.

242
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
skill. So we have to progress for it.
 

243
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,070
skill. So we have to progress for it.
Okay. All right. So, try this same

244
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
Okay. All right. So, try this same
 

245
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,909
Okay. All right. So, try this same
exercise again. And we'll go all the way

246
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
exercise again. And we'll go all the way
 

247
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,670
exercise again. And we'll go all the way
into the throw. Okay. Slow like this.

248
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
into the throw. Okay. Slow like this.
 

249
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,629
into the throw. Okay. Slow like this.

switched his hips so that way he would.
 

295
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,509

00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
We're in the ballpark. That's where it
 

299
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,829
We're in the ballpark. That's where it
happened. That is part of it. Who can

00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
happened. That is part of it. Who can
 

301
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,910
happened. That is part of it. Who can
find it before that one?

302
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:53,920

 

303
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,030

arm to kind

304
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040

 

305
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,630

I can see that from back here. I don't

306
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
I can see that from back here. I don't
 

307
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,269
I can see that from back here. I don't
know about there.

308
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279

 

309
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,990

The the motion wasn't uh synonymous with

310
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
The the motion wasn't uh synonymous with
 

311
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,790
The the motion wasn't uh synonymous with
what was doing. Yeah. Okay. So that's

312
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
what was doing. Yeah. Okay. So that's
 

313
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,949
what was doing. Yeah. Okay. So that's
and that's what allowed me to change my

314
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
and that's what allowed me to change my
 

315
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,590
and that's what allowed me to change my
hips. So there's the agency is in the

316
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
hips. So there's the agency is in the
 

317
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,190
hips. So there's the agency is in the
technique and he wasn't

318
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
technique and he wasn't
 

319
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,430
technique and he wasn't
you're not moving him is how I would say

320
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
you're not moving him is how I would say
 

321
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,070
you're not moving him is how I would say
it. Okay. So, if we come up and do this

322
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080

 

323
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,430

forward away from the wall.

324
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440

 

325
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,310

Okay. So, there's no there's no Look how

326
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
Okay. So, there's no there's no Look how
 

327
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,030
Okay. So, there's no there's no Look how
he went around her. Did you see that?

328
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
he went around her. Did you see that?
 

329
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,829
he went around her. Did you see that?
But her arm stayed here.

00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
Because together we already said there's
 

827
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,909
Because together we already said there's
this is what kaza is is energy work.

828
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:51,919
this is what kaza is is energy work.
 

829
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,510
this is what kaza is is energy work.
Okay. We have the spiritual aspect. We

830
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:55,520
Okay. We have the spiritual aspect. We
 

831
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,230
Okay. We have the spiritual aspect. We
have the energetic aspect. Okay. Say

832
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
have the energetic aspect. Okay. Say
 

833
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,070
have the energetic aspect. Okay. Say
energetic aspect. So it's mudra

834
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,080
energetic aspect. So it's mudra
 

835
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,470
energetic aspect. So it's mudra
oriented. You got to think broader.

836
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:02,480
oriented. You got to think broader.
 

837
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,830
oriented. You got to think broader.
Okay. We already said the mudra was

838
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:05,840
Okay. We already said the mudra was
 

839
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,149
Okay. We already said the mudra was
already in the grip very similar to the

840
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:08,159
already in the grip very similar to the
 

841
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,269
already in the grip very similar to the
zazan mudra. Okay. But their mudra is

842
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:11,279
zazan mudra. Okay. But their mudra is
 

843
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,510
zazan mudra. Okay. But their mudra is
also it doesn't need the actual contact

844
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
also it doesn't need the actual contact
 

845
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,070
also it doesn't need the actual contact
at the grid. It's the mudra is already

846
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,080
at the grid. It's the mudra is already
 

847
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,430
at the grid. It's the mudra is already
there now from different contact points.

848
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
there now from different contact points.
 

849
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,789
there now from different contact points.
You understand? And the

850
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:22,799
You understand? And the
 

851
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,029
You understand? And the
the components that make up the mudra

852
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
the components that make up the mudra
 

853
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,750
the components that make up the mudra
are also taking place within me. It just

854
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
are also taking place within me. It just
 

855
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,549
are also taking place within me. It just
concentrically repeats itself over and

856
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:30,559
concentrically repeats itself over and
 

857
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,190
concentrically repeats itself over and
over and over. So it's in me. It's at

858
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,200
over and over. So it's in me. It's at
 

859
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,470
over and over. So it's in me. It's at
the contact point. It's between us. Do

860
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,480
the contact point. It's between us. Do
 

861
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,470
the contact point. It's between us. Do
you understand? Okay. So the better the

862
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:40,480
you understand? Okay. So the better the
 

863
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,029
you understand? Okay. So the better the
other part of the mudra is, the better

864
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:43,039
other part of the mudra is, the better
 

865
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,230
other part of the mudra is, the better
the this side of the mudra is. Okay? So

866
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,240
the this side of the mudra is. Okay? So
 

867
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,230
the this side of the mudra is. Okay? So
in other words, if I have like a shitty

868
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,240
in other words, if I have like a shitty
 

869
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,230
in other words, if I have like a shitty
finger over here, no matter how much I'm

870
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,240
finger over here, no matter how much I'm
 

871
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,630
finger over here, no matter how much I'm
sending into this thumb, it's not going

872
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:52,640
sending into this thumb, it's not going
 

873
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,950
sending into this thumb, it's not going
to do it. It has to be equally on this

874
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:54,960
to do it. It has to be equally on this
 

875
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,350
to do it. It has to be equally on this
side. All right. So you're doing

876
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
side. All right. So you're doing
 

877
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,230
side. All right. So you're doing
fantastic. Okay. Come back up. And this

happening. Well, if that's the engine
 

959
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,190
happening. Well, if that's the engine
you're working with, then your training

960
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200
you're working with, then your training
 

961
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,909
you're working with, then your training
partner works against that engine. Let

962
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:51,919
partner works against that engine. Let
 

963
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,230
partner works against that engine. Let
me give you something you'd rather get

964
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,240
me give you something you'd rather get
 

965
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,110
me give you something you'd rather get
out of more hammer fish to the face.

966
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,120
out of more hammer fish to the face.
 

967
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,430
out of more hammer fish to the face.
Okay? You're going to keep connection

968
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,440
Okay? You're going to keep connection
 

969
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,909
Okay? You're going to keep connection
and just take the break.

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,789
and just take the break.
Um, now all that said, that's for

972
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:04,799
Um, now all that said, that's for
