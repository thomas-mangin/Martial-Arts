1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,889

foreign

2
00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:02,899

 

3
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:06,530

okay so again the drill

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:06,540
okay so again the drill
 

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,890
okay so again the drill
is uh we put him in a precarious base

6
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:09,900
is uh we put him in a precarious base
 

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,690
is uh we put him in a precarious base
right because he we don't he doesn't

8
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:11,700
right because he we don't he doesn't
 

9
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,610
right because he we don't he doesn't
have a break a basic support going

10
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:13,620
have a break a basic support going
 

11
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,589
have a break a basic support going
forward

12
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:14,599
forward
 

13
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,349
forward
uh and we have a very slow moving Arc

14
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:18,359
uh and we have a very slow moving Arc
 

15
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,710
uh and we have a very slow moving Arc
here going up okay what I mean by that

16
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:21,720
here going up okay what I mean by that
 

17
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,189
here going up okay what I mean by that
is this is on a circumference due to the

18
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
is this is on a circumference due to the
 

19
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,589
is this is on a circumference due to the
ball and socket joint okay

20
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
ball and socket joint okay
 

21
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,009
ball and socket joint okay
and so this makes this a very easy drill

22
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:31,019
and so this makes this a very easy drill
 

23
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,610
and so this makes this a very easy drill
to understand what matching young values

24
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:34,620
to understand what matching young values
 

25
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,490
to understand what matching young values
are again remember cosmologically

26
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:37,500
are again remember cosmologically
 

27
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,209
are again remember cosmologically
when I match young values the Universe

28
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:41,219
when I match young values the Universe
 

29
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,030
when I match young values the Universe
goes I don't see two things and it

30
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,040
goes I don't see two things and it
 

31
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,549
goes I don't see two things and it
treats it as one and the observable uh

32
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:49,559
treats it as one and the observable uh
 

33
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,970
treats it as one and the observable uh
sensation is an adhesion or an increase

34
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:52,980
sensation is an adhesion or an increase
 

35
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,910
sensation is an adhesion or an increase
of friction between those two things

36
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
of friction between those two things
 

37
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,130
of friction between those two things
because

38
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:57,140
because
 

39
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,229
because
homeostasis wants to keep them one thing

40
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
homeostasis wants to keep them one thing
 

41
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,450
homeostasis wants to keep them one thing
and so there's a resistance to them

42
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:02,460
and so there's a resistance to them
 

43
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,230
and so there's a resistance to them
becoming an apartment okay so uh what

44
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
becoming an apartment okay so uh what
 

45
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,969
becoming an apartment okay so uh what
I'm going to do my stance does not

46
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:07,979
I'm going to do my stance does not
 

47
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,789
I'm going to do my stance does not
matter but and actually you don't really

48
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
matter but and actually you don't really
 

49
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,990
matter but and actually you don't really
need much ground path here because he is

50
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,000
need much ground path here because he is
 

51
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,109
need much ground path here because he is
so precariously based and this movement

52
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:18,119
so precariously based and this movement
 

53
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,789
so precariously based and this movement
is so slow uh to what he's doing okay

54
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:21,799
is so slow uh to what he's doing okay
 

55
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,149
is so slow uh to what he's doing okay
but try to work with the idea that

56
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:25,159
but try to work with the idea that
 

57
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:28,910
but try to work with the idea that
you're going to let his yaw movement go

58
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:28,920
you're going to let his yaw movement go
 

59
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,710
you're going to let his yaw movement go
but here I'm into it so I'm not going to

60
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:33,720
but here I'm into it so I'm not going to
 

61
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,330
but here I'm into it so I'm not going to
push it down because that's going to

62
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:35,340
push it down because that's going to
 

63
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,510
push it down because that's going to
ground him and he's bigger than me uh

64
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:38,520
ground him and he's bigger than me uh
 

65
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,569
ground him and he's bigger than me uh
and he'll push me off of him okay

66
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:40,579
and he'll push me off of him okay
 

67
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:45,350
and he'll push me off of him okay
instead I will let him uh come up and I

68
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
instead I will let him uh come up and I
 

69
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,929
instead I will let him uh come up and I
match that young movement and then I

70
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:47,939
match that young movement and then I
 

71
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,910
match that young movement and then I
just pull them off that precarious face

72
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
just pull them off that precarious face
 

73
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,590
just pull them off that precarious face
okay

74
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
okay
 

75
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,429
okay
it's like yeah he goes

76
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439

 

77
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,230

I'm just pulling them off

78
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,240
I'm just pulling them off
 

79
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,569
I'm just pulling them off
okay you see I want you to I don't

80
00:01:59,569 --> 00:01:59,579
okay you see I want you to I don't
 

81
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,789
okay you see I want you to I don't
really care where you put your hands but

82
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:01,799
really care where you put your hands but
 

83
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,010
really care where you put your hands but
try not to hook on things try not to

84
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,020
try not to hook on things try not to
 

85
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,190
try not to hook on things try not to
hook on things okay let the energy do it

86
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
hook on things okay let the energy do it
 

87
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,990
hook on things okay let the energy do it
do its own thing okay as you get uh some

88
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,000
do its own thing okay as you get uh some
 

89
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,570
do its own thing okay as you get uh some
sense of what that feels like that and

90
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:14,580
sense of what that feels like that and
 

91
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,430
sense of what that feels like that and
that's what I really want out of you is

92
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:16,440
that's what I really want out of you is
 

93
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,430
that's what I really want out of you is
that you generate the feeling in you and

94
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
that you generate the feeling in you and
 

95
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,949
that you generate the feeling in you and
you start to match that feeling okay so

96
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:21,959
you start to match that feeling okay so
 

97
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,510
you start to match that feeling okay so
he goes and I match that feeling

98
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:26,520

 

99
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,150

uh once you have that feeling I'd like

100
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,160
uh once you have that feeling I'd like
 

101
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,210
uh once you have that feeling I'd like
for you to try with even less it's not

102
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:32,220
for you to try with even less it's not
 

103
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,030
for you to try with even less it's not
important how much I touch or where I

104
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
important how much I touch or where I
 

105
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,510
important how much I touch or where I
touch so you can you can touch with one

106
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:38,520
touch so you can you can touch with one
 

107
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,150
touch so you can you can touch with one
finger and he's going and you'll be able

108
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,160
finger and he's going and you'll be able
 

109
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,089
finger and he's going and you'll be able
to pull that off okay

110
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:44,099
to pull that off okay
 

111
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,670
to pull that off okay
um do you see that so I tried I do it

112
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:46,680
um do you see that so I tried I do it
 

113
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,670
um do you see that so I tried I do it
here but with flat Palms okay and then

114
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
here but with flat Palms okay and then
 

115
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,949
here but with flat Palms okay and then
later maybe maybe you want to try with

116
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:51,959
later maybe maybe you want to try with
 

117
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,650
later maybe maybe you want to try with
two fingers or maybe do with one finger

118
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:54,660
two fingers or maybe do with one finger
 

119
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,170
two fingers or maybe do with one finger
and you pull it off so if I don't know

120
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:57,180
and you pull it off so if I don't know
 

121
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,650
and you pull it off so if I don't know
if the camera wants to come here you and

122
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:00,660
if the camera wants to come here you and
 

123
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,210
if the camera wants to come here you and
you could feel that there's like a

124
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:02,220
you could feel that there's like a
 

125
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,790
you could feel that there's like a
friction such that his skin moves do you

126
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
friction such that his skin moves do you
 

127
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,190
friction such that his skin moves do you
see that okay so go back down

128
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
see that okay so go back down
 

129
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,830
see that okay so go back down
so he goes up and then I'm just gonna

130
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
so he goes up and then I'm just gonna
 

131
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,830
so he goes up and then I'm just gonna
move to see how his Skin's moving okay

132
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:12,840
move to see how his Skin's moving okay
 

133
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,770
move to see how his Skin's moving okay
and he keeps going and I will pull that

134
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:15,780
and he keeps going and I will pull that
 

135
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,170
and he keeps going and I will pull that
off okay

136
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,180
off okay
 

137
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,250
off okay
um

138
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:22,260

 

139
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,869

you kind of you don't you don't need

140
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,879
you kind of you don't you don't need
 

141
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,970
you kind of you don't you don't need
your base at all because you can ground

142
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:25,980
your base at all because you can ground
 

143
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,550
your base at all because you can ground
after all one base go ahead and you'll

144
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
after all one base go ahead and you'll
 

145
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,229
after all one base go ahead and you'll
pull that off

146
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
pull that off
 

147
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,630
pull that off
okay so try it let's try those three

148
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
okay so try it let's try those three
 

149
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,990
okay so try it let's try those three
things again one

150
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
things again one
 

151
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,589
things again one
two or two and then

152
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
two or two and then
 

153
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,110
two or two and then
three let's see what we get then okay

154
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,120
three let's see what we get then okay
 

155
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,550
three let's see what we get then okay
let's try it

156
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:43,560
let's try it
 

157
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,250
let's try it
all right so if you if you guys should

158
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:46,260
all right so if you if you guys should
 

159
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,830
all right so if you if you guys should
recognize that this is pretty slippery

160
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:48,840
recognize that this is pretty slippery
 

161
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,369
recognize that this is pretty slippery
for me okay uh ground Vector vectoring

162
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:52,379
for me okay uh ground Vector vectoring
 

163
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,050
for me okay uh ground Vector vectoring
doesn't have anything to do with how

164
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,060
doesn't have anything to do with how
 

165
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,930
doesn't have anything to do with how
sticky

166
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:56,940

 

167
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,550

um and the reason you want to understand

168
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
um and the reason you want to understand
 

169
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,850
um and the reason you want to understand
that is

170
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:01,860
that is
 

171
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,369
that is
and why I describe it as matching young

172
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:04,379
and why I describe it as matching young
 

173
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,430
and why I describe it as matching young

values as opposed to pulling on skin or
working faster or anything like that

176
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
working faster or anything like that
 

177

so
 

181
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,289
so

191
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,689
like it's very minor
right but I can make it more Minor by

00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:32,699
right but I can make it more Minor by
 

193
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,290
