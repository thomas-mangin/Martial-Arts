00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:36,919
see it became very
 

427
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,750
see it became very
heavy and in its

428

heavy and in its
 

429
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,190
heavy and in its
heaviness you started to feel very weak

430
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:44,200
heaviness you started to feel very weak
 

431
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,510
heaviness you started to feel very weak
see and the self doesn't want to feel

432
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:47,520
see and the self doesn't want to feel
 

433
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,070
see and the self doesn't want to feel
weak because it's threatening to it

434
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,080
weak because it's threatening to it

00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:53,919
wants to feel powerful and so to
 

437
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,070
wants to feel powerful and so to
continue constructing itself it has you

438
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,080
continue constructing itself it has you
 

439
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,430
continue constructing itself it has you
lift up on those things see lift

440
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,440
lift up on those things see lift
 

441
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,870
lift up on those things see lift
harder but if we

442
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:04,880
harder but if we
 

443
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,310
harder but if we
release that possible

444
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,320
release that possible
 

445
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,909
release that possible
contestation don't lift it let it touch

446
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
contestation don't lift it let it touch
 

447
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,669
contestation don't lift it let it touch
you

448
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
you
 

449
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,789
you
there then you don't feel the weakness

450
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
there then you don't feel the weakness
 

451
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,750
there then you don't feel the weakness
anymore which for a moment we felt was

452
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
anymore which for a moment we felt was
 

453
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,190
anymore which for a moment we felt was
surely there and the only thing I could

454
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:22,200
surely there and the only thing I could
 

455
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,430
surely there and the only thing I could
feel you see but when I

456
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
feel you see but when I
 

457
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,230
feel you see but when I
released and I let you touch the bicep

458
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:29,240
released and I let you touch the bicep
 

459
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,230
released and I let you touch the bicep
and I used the

460
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:31,240
and I used the
 

461
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,110
and I used the
bicep you

462
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
bicep you
 

463
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,710
bicep you
see then I did not feel weak you never

464
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
see then I did not feel weak you never
 

465
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,270
see then I did not feel weak you never
felt strong to me I did not feel

466
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:40,280
felt strong to me I did not feel
 

467
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,190
felt strong to me I did not feel
threatened and so this is the downside

468
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
threatened and so this is the downside
 

469
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,510
threatened and so this is the downside
of the

470
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:44,520

going to feel the
push you're going to use your knowledge

618
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:36,520
push you're going to use your knowledge
 

619
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,830
push you're going to use your knowledge
to tell you that's me pushing on them

620

I'm going to not
 

623
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,950
I'm going to not
push it's going to feel like I'm going

to die keep not pushing because you know
 

627
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,909
to die keep not pushing because you know
it's not true and then find the

628
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:48,919
it's not true and then find the
 

629
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:51,389
it's not true and then find the
technique okay because we're going slow

630
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:51,399
technique okay because we're going slow
 

631
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:54,590
technique okay because we're going slow
and smooth and I'm really feeding you

632
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:54,600
and smooth and I'm really feeding you
 

633
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,909
and smooth and I'm really feeding you
the cues you need for this this is all

634
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
the cues you need for this this is all
 

635
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:58,830
the cues you need for this this is all
doable

636
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:58,840
doable
 

637
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,430
doable
okay all

638
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:00,440
okay all
 

639
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,549
okay all
right um go ahead and get change and

640
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,559
right um go ahead and get change and
 

641
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,310
right um go ahead and get change and
anything else to say on that yeah

642
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:07,320
anything else to say on that yeah
 

643
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,909
anything else to say on that yeah
so when I feel the push because I don't

644
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:11,919
so when I feel the push because I don't
 

645
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,830
so when I feel the push because I don't
want to against it then my tendency is

646
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
want to against it then my tendency is
 

647
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,710
want to against it then my tendency is
to hyper is to hyper

648
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:19,720
to hyper is to hyper
 

649
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,549
to hyper is to hyper
y to let go of that yes and and this is

650
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:25,559
y to let go of that yes and and this is
 

651
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,389
y to let go of that yes and and this is
another trick of that mind because

652
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:28,399
another trick of that mind because

669
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,470
eagle find the one with the eagle and
you turn it over and you go oh here's

670
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:55,480
you turn it over and you go oh here's
 

671
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,750
you turn it over and you go oh here's
one with the eagle do you see not

672
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:57,760
one with the eagle do you see not
 

673

one with the eagle do you see not
realizing is still the head coin on the

674
00:25:59,909 --> 00:25:59,919
realizing is still the head coin on the
 

675
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,190
realizing is still the head coin on the
other side so yeah you have to keep that

676
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:04,200
other side so yeah you have to keep that
 

677

projection is where his join open you
 

1173
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,390
projection is where his join open you
see and now his his balls are there

1174
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:13,400
see and now his his balls are there
 

1175
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,589
see and now his his balls are there
right so now now you have him right you

the reason why you don't want variation
 

1181
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:32,470

00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:15,720
shrink the technique so much um mine is
 

1211
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,870
shrink the technique so much um mine is
still just very gross and like much more

1212
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:19,880
still just very gross and like much more
 

1213

still just very gross and like much more
on the young aspect if you will than

1214
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:23,640
on the young aspect if you will than
 

1215
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,670
on the young aspect if you will than
really that that disappear that you get

1216
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:27,680
really that that disappear that you get
 

1217
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:33,309
really that that disappear that you get
with that yeah um let's first point

1218
00:50:33,309 --> 00:50:33,319
with that yeah um let's first point
 

1219
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:38,349
with that yeah um let's first point
out that there's levels to training okay

1220
00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:38,359
out that there's levels to training okay
 

1221
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:43,030
out that there's levels to training okay
and then let us acknowledge that

1222
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:43,040
and then let us acknowledge that
 

1223
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,430
and then let us acknowledge that
the that mind that we're trying to

1224
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:47,440
the that mind that we're trying to
 

1225
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,990
the that mind that we're trying to
deconstruct always wants the level we're

1226
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,000
deconstruct always wants the level we're
 

1227
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,190
deconstruct always wants the level we're
on to be the highest level even if it's

1228
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:53,200
on to be the highest level even if it's
 

1229
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,230
on to be the highest level even if it's
a piece of level you get like it's

1230
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:56,240
a piece of level you get like it's
 

1231
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,750
a piece of level you get like it's
it it if you just analyze just a

1232
00:50:59,750 --> 00:50:59,760
it it if you just analyze just a
 

1233
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,950
it it if you just analyze just a
little that we're in a total

that's how it goes you see
 

1285
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:25,190
that's how it goes you see
um but this is where we have to go now

1286
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:25,200
um but this is where we have to go now
 

1287
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,710
um but this is where we have to go now
okay you did what you're doing what you

1288
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:28,720
okay you did what you're doing what you
 

1289
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,870
okay you did what you're doing what you
were doing out there is very high very

1290
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:30,880
were doing out there is very high very
 

1291
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,470
were doing out there is very high very
high you can't see it anywhere else but

1292
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:33,480
high you can't see it anywhere else but
 

1293
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,589
high you can't see it anywhere else but
in from this Dojo you just can't it's

1294
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:35,599
in from this Dojo you just can't it's
 

1295
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,710
in from this Dojo you just can't it's
not anywhere

1296
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:38,720
not anywhere
 

1297
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,750
not anywhere
okay but it's and while it is high

1298
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:42,760
okay but it's and while it is high
 

1299
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,309
okay but it's and while it is high
compared to everywhere else and while it

1300
00:52:45,309 --> 00:52:45,319
compared to everywhere else and while it
 

1301
00:52:45,319 --> 00:52:47,750
compared to everywhere else and while it
is a necessary step and I did want you

1302
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:47,760
is a necessary step and I did want you
 

1303
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,750
is a necessary step and I did want you
to be able to do that and I brought you

1304
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:50,760
to be able to do that and I brought you
 

1305
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,990
to be able to do that and I brought you
there we're not going to stay there okay

1306
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:55,000
there we're not going to stay there okay
 

1307
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,349
there we're not going to stay there okay
um and then you should know that after

1308
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:57,359
um and then you should know that after
 

1309
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,190
um and then you should know that after
you learn to get

1310
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,200
you learn to get
 

1311
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,750
you learn to get
smaller I'm going to do something else

1312
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:01,760
smaller I'm going to do something else
 

1313
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,230
smaller I'm going to do something else
which will be totally different from

1314
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:03,240
which will be totally different from
 

1315
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,270
which will be totally different from
that okay um but here let's focus in on

1316
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:08,280
that okay um but here let's focus in on
 

1317
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,309
that okay um but here let's focus in on
this void aspect

1318
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:11,319
this void aspect
 

1319
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:17,910
this void aspect
okay um this is huge because at

1320
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:17,920

 

1321
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,190

the

1322
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:20,200
the
 

1323
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,870
the
cosmologically at the

1324
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:22,880
cosmologically at the
 

1325
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,789
cosmologically at the
center is this void this shunyata this

1326
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:26,799
center is this void this shunyata this
 

1327
00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:28,829
center is this void this shunyata this
emptiness do you

1328
00:53:28,829 --> 00:53:28,839
emptiness do you
 

1329
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:31,670
emptiness do you
see this the da

1330
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:31,680
see this the da
 

1331
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,789
see this the da
is you could have called it void you

1332
00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:34,799
is you could have called it void you
 

1333
00:53:34,799 --> 00:53:38,710
is you could have called it void you
could have called it God because it's

1334
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:38,720
could have called it God because it's
 

1335
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,109
could have called it God because it's
Indescribable without limit no

1336
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:42,119
Indescribable without limit no
 

1337
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:46,270
Indescribable without limit no
delineation our word for that is void

1338
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:46,280
delineation our word for that is void
 

1339
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,510
delineation our word for that is void
okay and that is where we're

1340
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:50,520
okay and that is where we're
 

1341
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,390
okay and that is where we're
headed and that means thereby

1342
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:54,400
headed and that means thereby
 

1343
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,390
headed and that means thereby
concentrically there should be a

1344
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:57,400
concentrically there should be a
 

1345
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,950
concentrically there should be a
void in the middle of my physicality in

1346
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:00,960
void in the middle of my physicality in
 

1347
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,109
void in the middle of my physicality in
the middle of my movements and in the

1348
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:03,119
the middle of my movements and in the
 

1349
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,630
the middle of my movements and in the
middle of my

1350
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:04,640
middle of my
 

1351
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,510
middle of my
energetics do you see and so if I can

1352
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:07,520
energetics do you see and so if I can
 

1353
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,630
energetics do you see and so if I can
now draw your

1354
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:11,640

 

1355
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,349

attention you you should feel I I know

1356
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:15,359
attention you you should feel I I know
 

1357
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,589
attention you you should feel I I know
you do but I don't know if you're aware

1358
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:17,599
you do but I don't know if you're aware
 

1359
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,910
you do but I don't know if you're aware
enough of it you'll

1360
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:20,920
enough of it you'll
 

1361
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,549
enough of it you'll
feel I'm about

1362
00:54:23,549 --> 00:54:23,559
feel I'm about
 

1363
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:27,510
feel I'm about
to feel a y but there's nothing nothing

1364
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:27,520
to feel a y but there's nothing nothing
 

1365
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,030
to feel a y but there's nothing nothing
there

1366
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:30,040
there
 

1367
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,510
there
and next thing you

1368
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:32,520
and next thing you
 

1369
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,390
and next thing you
feel is

1370
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:34,400
feel is

00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,030
feel is
something but it comes from another

1372
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:37,040
something but it comes from another
 

1373
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,109
something but it comes from another
angle where you're where you're not

1374
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:40,119
angle where you're where you're not
 

1375
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:43,190
angle where you're where you're not
expecting it or where it's taking you

1376
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:43,200
expecting it or where it's taking you
 

1377
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,910
expecting it or where it's taking you
off balance you see so the first the

1378
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:46,920
off balance you see so the first the
 

1379
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,230
off balance you see so the first the
first

1380
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:48,240

Contact is on void is on the emptiness

1382
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:51,920
Contact is on void is on the emptiness
 

1383
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,990
Contact is on void is on the emptiness
which makes sense because it's in a no

1384
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,000
which makes sense because it's in a no
 

1385
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,150
which makes sense because it's in a no
self State and so

1386
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:57,160
self State and so
 

1387
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,589
self State and so
you you you're touching me this is the

1388
00:54:59,589 --> 00:54:59,599
you you you're touching me this is the
 

1389
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,750
you you you're touching me this is the
difference it's not that I get out of

1390
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:01,760
difference it's not that I get out of
 

1391
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,829
difference it's not that I get out of
the

1392
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:02,839
the
 

1393
00:55:02,839 --> 00:55:05,230
the
way you're touching

1394
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:05,240
way you're touching
 

1395
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,510
way you're touching
me but that Touch goes through me do you

1396
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:08,520
me but that Touch goes through me do you
 

1397
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,950
me but that Touch goes through me do you
see and that's where you get hyper

1398
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:12,960
see and that's where you get hyper
 

1399
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,710
see and that's where you get hyper
compressed so to speak that's how I I

1400
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:15,720
compressed so to speak that's how I I
 

1401
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,789
compressed so to speak that's how I I
think about it I get you in a deeper

1402
00:55:17,789 --> 00:55:17,799
think about it I get you in a deeper
 

1403
00:55:17,799 --> 00:55:22,710
think about it I get you in a deeper
Yang State inside my body and then all

1404
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,720
Yang State inside my body and then all
 

1405
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,549
Yang State inside my body and then all
of a sudden I just redirect it do you

1406
00:55:27,549 --> 00:55:27,559
of a sudden I just redirect it do you
 

1407
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:30,710
of a sudden I just redirect it do you
see and so you feel like um and I'm sure

1408
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:30,720
see and so you feel like um and I'm sure
 

1409
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,150
see and so you feel like um and I'm sure
it's on the video I haven't seen the

1410
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:32,160
it's on the video I haven't seen the
 

1411
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,549
it's on the video I haven't seen the
video but I'm sure it's

1412
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:36,559

 

1413
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,349

like the UK gets

1414
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:39,359
like the UK gets
 

1415
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:43,309
like the UK gets
in deeper and then all of a sudden like

1416
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:43,319
in deeper and then all of a sudden like
 

1417
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:44,910
in deeper and then all of a sudden like
a like a

percussion do you see but not a hard one

1420
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:48,559
percussion do you see but not a hard one
 

1421
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,430
percussion do you see but not a hard one
it could be hard but it doesn't have to

1422
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:50,440
it could be hard but it doesn't have to
 

1423
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,069
it could be hard but it doesn't have to
be hard do you know what I'm talking

1424
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:52,079
be hard do you know what I'm talking
 

1425
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,190
be hard do you know what I'm talking
about and so this is important this is

1426
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:55,200
about and so this is important this is
 

1427
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,950
about and so this is important this is
very very important

you see so you're doing your zazen

1440
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:18,520
you see so you're doing your zazen
 

1441
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,950
you see so you're doing your zazen
that's the state you hang out in when

that's the state you hang out in when
 

1443
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,910
that's the state you hang out in when
you're doing this okay and so

1444
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:24,920
you're doing this okay and so
 

1445
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,069
you're doing this okay and so
now are Kon or

1446
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
now are Kon or

00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:39,839
drop ego Tri partti mind drop do you see
 

1453
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,870
drop ego Tri partti mind drop do you see
and so this is just repetition of the

1454
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:42,880
and so this is just repetition of the

00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:45,960
skill of deconstructing the self and so
 

1457
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,029
skill of deconstructing the self and so
now you can do

1458
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:48,039
now you can do
 

1459
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:51,430
now you can do
it anywhere you see while you gain the

1460
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:51,440

I keep taking taking it apart taking it

1464
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:57,240
I keep taking taking it apart taking it
 

1465
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,270
I keep taking taking it apart taking it
apart taking it apart you

1466
00:56:59,270 --> 00:56:59,280
apart taking it apart you
 

1467
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,150
apart taking it apart you
see so it's very very key and and so to

1468
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:03,160
see so it's very very key and and so to
 

1469
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,349
see so it's very very key and and so to
make it

1470
00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:04,359
make it
 

1471
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:07,349
make it
smaller obviously I'm not getting

1472
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:07,359
smaller obviously I'm not getting
 

1473
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:11,190
smaller obviously I'm not getting
smaller do you see but I'm letting you

1474
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:11,200
smaller do you see but I'm letting you
 

1475
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,309
smaller do you see but I'm letting you
in more so I don't need the big angles

1476
00:57:15,309 --> 00:57:15,319
in more so I don't need the big angles
 

1477
00:57:15,319 --> 00:57:19,390
in more so I don't need the big angles
of deviation because I'm not in a

1478
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:19,400
of deviation because I'm not in a
 

1479
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,349
of deviation because I'm not in a
physical contest with you as a edge to

1480
00:57:22,349 --> 00:57:22,359
physical contest with you as a edge to
 

1481
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:25,270
physical contest with you as a edge to
an edge you know a border to a border I

1482
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:25,280
an edge you know a border to a border I
 

1483
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,549
an edge you know a border to a border I
just need a little angle offset but if

1484
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:28,559
just need a little angle offset but if
 

1485
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,549
just need a little angle offset but if
you pay attention I'm on the line of

1486
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:31,559
you pay attention I'm on the line of
 

1487
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:35,069
you pay attention I'm on the line of
attack but your energy is not pushing on

1488
00:57:35,069 --> 00:57:35,079
attack but your energy is not pushing on
 

1489
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:37,270
attack but your energy is not pushing on
me it's pushing through me do you see

1490
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:37,280
me it's pushing through me do you see
 

1491
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,069
me it's pushing through me do you see
and so that was all I need to Boom give

1492
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:40,079
and so that was all I need to Boom give
 

1493
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,470
and so that was all I need to Boom give
a

1494
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:41,480
a
 

1495
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,589
a
little deflection to get you off the

1496
00:57:44,589 --> 00:57:44,599
little deflection to get you off the
 

1497
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:48,430
little deflection to get you off the
line do you see that

1498
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:48,440
line do you see that
 

1499
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,230
line do you see that
um so where to

1500
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:51,240
um so where to
 

1501
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:57,029
um so where to
look not in smaller feet work do you see

1502
00:57:57,029 --> 00:57:57,039
look not in smaller feet work do you see
 

1503
00:57:57,039 --> 00:57:59,390
look not in smaller feet work do you see
that would be a physical trying to find

1504
00:57:59,390 --> 00:57:59,400
that would be a physical trying to find
 

1505
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,589
that would be a physical trying to find
a physical solution it's in more let

1506
00:58:03,589 --> 00:58:03,599
a physical solution it's in more let
 

1507
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,789
a physical solution it's in more let
them push more on you so your Technique

1508
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:06,799
them push more on you so your Technique
 

1509
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,710
them push more on you so your Technique
was very nice in that you weren't ever

1510
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:09,720
was very nice in that you weren't ever
 

1511
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,789
was very nice in that you weren't ever
where they could push on you but what

1512
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:12,799
where they could push on you but what
 

1513
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,950
where they could push on you but what
I'm doing is I'm where you can push on

1514
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:14,960
I'm doing is I'm where you can push on
 

1515
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,390
I'm doing is I'm where you can push on
me do you

1516
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:16,400
me do you
 

1517
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,470
me do you
see does that make sense okay so that's

1518
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:19,480
see does that make sense okay so that's
 

1519
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,950
see does that make sense okay so that's
that's where we're going and when you

1520
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:20,960
that's where we're going and when you
 

1521
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,750
that's where we're going and when you
get there you increase the Y

1522
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:23,760
get there you increase the Y
 

1523
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,190
get there you increase the Y
internalization and things like Co you

1524
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:27,200
internalization and things like Co you
 

1525
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,549
internalization and things like Co you
are now increased cuz your y output is

1526
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:31,559
are now increased cuz your y output is
 

1527
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:33,710
are now increased cuz your y output is
increased cuz your y input is increased

1528
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:33,720
increased cuz your y input is increased
 

1529
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,390
increased cuz your y input is increased
you see and so you can make smaller

1530
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:36,400
