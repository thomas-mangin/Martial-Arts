lower legs off the mat and all my
weights on him and second concept is

26
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
weights on him and second concept is
 

27
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,510
weights on him and second concept is
wherever your grips are whatever you're

doing with them you don't you don't
 

31
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,510
doing with them you don't you don't
bring him up into you you don't lift him

32
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:54,520
bring him up into you you don't lift him
 

33
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,750
bring him up into you you don't lift him
up off the ground okay and it's your

34
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
up off the ground okay and it's your
 

35
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,549
up off the ground okay and it's your
elbows that are controlling him so even

36
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:01,559
elbows that are controlling him so even
 

37
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,670
elbows that are controlling him so even
if I'm here my elbows are controlling

38
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:04,680
if I'm here my elbows are controlling
 

39
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,109
if I'm here my elbows are controlling
his body in here if I'm here like this

40
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:08,119
his body in here if I'm here like this
 

41
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:10,670
his body in here if I'm here like this
this elbows here this elbows here is

42
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:10,680
this elbows here this elbows here is
 

43
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,870
this elbows here this elbows here is
controlling okay not my hands pulling in

44
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:13,880
controlling okay not my hands pulling in
 

45
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,230
controlling okay not my hands pulling in
okay uh and that way you can always let

46
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
okay uh and that way you can always let
 

47
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,310
okay uh and that way you can always let
your hands be ready to post and things

48
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
your hands be ready to post and things
 

49
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,310
your hands be ready to post and things
like that if you need to okay so here

50
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
like that if you need to okay so here
 

51
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,590
like that if you need to okay so here
here this is just the first drill and

52
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:22,600
here this is just the first drill and
 

53
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,670
here this is just the first drill and
you just relax and then he feels the

54
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:24,680
you just relax and then he feels the
 

55
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,350
you just relax and then he feels the
weight so you start here on your knees

56
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,360
weight so you start here on your knees
 

57
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,670
weight so you start here on your knees
he can he's the judge of what he feels

58
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:30,680
he can he's the judge of what he feels
 

59
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,749
he can he's the judge of what he feels
how much weight that is and then I'm

60
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:32,759
how much weight that is and then I'm
 

61
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,310
how much weight that is and then I'm
going to use the balls of my feet and

62
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,320
going to use the balls of my feet and
 

63
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,510
going to use the balls of my feet and
take my legs off and just relax on on

64
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:38,520
take my legs off and just relax on on
 

65
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,069
take my legs off and just relax on on
him and he should feel a weight increase

66
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:41,079
him and he should feel a weight increase
 

67
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:44,510
him and he should feel a weight increase
okay do you yes sir okay so we'll try

68
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:44,520
okay do you yes sir okay so we'll try
 

69
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,149
okay do you yes sir okay so we'll try
that uh Discovery L you learn to use the

70
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:47,159
that uh Discovery L you learn to use the
 

71
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,870
that uh Discovery L you learn to use the
balls of your feet so for

72
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
balls of your feet so for
 

73
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,630
balls of your feet so for
example you shouldn't ever be like that

74
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:55,640
example you shouldn't ever be like that
 

75
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,029
example you shouldn't ever be like that
okay if your leg if your knees aren't

76
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:58,039
okay if your leg if your knees aren't
 

77
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,670
okay if your leg if your knees aren't
near him you're on the balls of your

78
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
near him you're on the balls of your
 

79
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,270
near him you're on the balls of your
feet feet makes sense okay so that

80
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:02,280
feet feet makes sense okay so that
 

81
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,709
feet feet makes sense okay so that
that's what we're doing right now and

82
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:03,719
that's what we're doing right now and
 

83
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,149
that's what we're doing right now and
I'm just laying

84
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
I'm just laying
 

85
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,669
I'm just laying
down okay next Discovery learning is the

86
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
down okay next Discovery learning is the
 

87
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,830
down okay next Discovery learning is the
same thing we'll combine that

88
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
same thing we'll combine that
 

89
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,030
same thing we'll combine that
exercise uh and when we come off our

90
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
exercise uh and when we come off our
 

91
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,710
exercise uh and when we come off our
knees we want to make sure that our feet

92
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:17,720
knees we want to make sure that our feet
 

93
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,070
knees we want to make sure that our feet
are wider than our shoulders our hip

94
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
are wider than our shoulders our hip
 

95
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,309
are wider than our shoulders our hip
area so I would don't want to be like

96
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
area so I would don't want to be like
 

97
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,710
area so I would don't want to be like
this it's easy to to roll me okay you

98
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
this it's easy to to roll me okay you
 

99
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,550
this it's easy to to roll me okay you
can try that it's easy to lose balance

100
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:27,560
can try that it's easy to lose balance
 

101
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,670
can try that it's easy to lose balance
but when you're wide like this you can

102
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
but when you're wide like this you can
 

103
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,750
but when you're wide like this you can
be as heavy and uh he tries to roll and

104
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
be as heavy and uh he tries to roll and
 

105
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,030
be as heavy and uh he tries to roll and
you you're posting on that foot to help

106
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,040
you you're posting on that foot to help
 

107
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,750
you you're posting on that foot to help
reinforce things okay second Discovery

108
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:38,760
reinforce things okay second Discovery
 

109
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,110
reinforce things okay second Discovery
learning so the first exercise here is

110
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
learning so the first exercise here is
 

111
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,350
learning so the first exercise here is
you'll go narrow and he'll bridge and

112
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
you'll go narrow and he'll bridge and
 

113
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,990
you'll go narrow and he'll bridge and
roll you and you'll feel you'll lose it

114
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
roll you and you'll feel you'll lose it
 

115
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,470
roll you and you'll feel you'll lose it
and the next one is you you're wider

116
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
and the next one is you you're wider
 

117
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,990
and the next one is you you're wider
than your shoulders and you'll go and

118
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
than your shoulders and you'll go and
 

119
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,949
than your shoulders and you'll go and
you'll feel that resistance okay and

120
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
you'll feel that resistance okay and
 

121
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,869
you'll feel that resistance okay and
then the next Discovery learning

122
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
then the next Discovery learning
 

123
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,430
then the next Discovery learning
exercise is the point of no return so

124
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:58,440
exercise is the point of no return so
 

125
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,910
exercise is the point of no return so
your line of gravity can't be on the

126
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:00,920
your line of gravity can't be on the
 

127
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,949
your line of gravity can't be on the
other side of his spine I can't be over

128
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:03,959
other side of his spine I can't be over
 

129
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,789
other side of his spine I can't be over
here or I'm easily rollable this way

130
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:06,799
here or I'm easily rollable this way
 

131
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:08,949
here or I'm easily rollable this way
okay

132
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
okay
 

133
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,149
okay
so it's best it's ideal if your line of

134
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
so it's best it's ideal if your line of
 

135
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,110
so it's best it's ideal if your line of
gravity is just on your side of his

136
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,120
gravity is just on your side of his
 

137
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,750
gravity is just on your side of his
spine line so when he tries to roll he

138
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:18,760
spine line so when he tries to roll he
 

139
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,070
spine line so when he tries to roll he
feels all the weight of your body if he

140
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
feels all the weight of your body if he
 

141
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,270
feels all the weight of your body if he
comes back towards you he'll feel the

142
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,280
comes back towards you he'll feel the
 

143
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,990
comes back towards you he'll feel the
post of your legs okay so we'll try

144
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
post of your legs okay so we'll try
 

145
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,910
post of your legs okay so we'll try
those two

146
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
those two
 

147
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,910
those two
okay so don't confuse the discovery

148
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
okay so don't confuse the discovery
 

149
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,229
okay so don't confuse the discovery
learning with how you would address what

150
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
learning with how you would address what
 

151
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,910
learning with how you would address what
he's doing and how you deal with it and

152
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:36,920
he's doing and how you deal with it and
 

153
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,509
he's doing and how you deal with it and
and and what you want to do okay the

154
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
and and what you want to do okay the
 

155
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,550
and and what you want to do okay the
concept is wait on him okay uh have a

00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:43,560
concept is wait on him okay uh have a
 

157
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,830
concept is wait on him okay uh have a
good base use your elbows to control

good base use your elbows to control
 

159
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,509
good base use your elbows to control
don't pull them up towards you watch

160
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519

uh so let's do one where he has his legs

194
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,240
uh so let's do one where he has his legs
 

195
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,029
uh so let's do one where he has his legs
down and he's got no frames okay makes

196
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:40,039
down and he's got no frames okay makes
 

197
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:43,029
down and he's got no frames okay makes
sense it's not uncommon so he doesn't

198
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:43,039
sense it's not uncommon so he doesn't
 

199
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,390
sense it's not uncommon so he doesn't
know elbow knee Escape all that kind of

200
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:45,400
know elbow knee Escape all that kind of
 

201

time again if he's going to flare his

358
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:49,279
time again if he's going to flare his
 

359
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,030
time again if he's going to flare his
elbow then you you already have it okay

360
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,040
elbow then you you already have it okay

okay let's try it

436
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000

 

437
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,750

so either I manually walked this

438
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:04,760
so either I manually walked this
 

439
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,790
so either I manually walked this

440
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
out or he pushed on me and I passed it
 

441
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,430
out or he pushed on me and I passed it
okay now he's on the other arm so he

442
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:12,440
okay now he's on the other arm so he
 

443
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,430
okay now he's on the other arm so he
push he's trying to get some space there

444

and again I'll roll
 

447
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,430
and again I'll roll
over the wrist and then lock it in with

448
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
over the wrist and then lock it in with
 

449
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,470
over the wrist and then lock it in with
the

450
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
the
 

451
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,389
the
knee sometimes though they're really

452
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:25,399
knee sometimes though they're really
 

453
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,030
knee sometimes though they're really
strong and they're really using their

00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
strong and they're really using their
 

455
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,590
strong and they're really using their
elbow okay so he's using his elbow you
