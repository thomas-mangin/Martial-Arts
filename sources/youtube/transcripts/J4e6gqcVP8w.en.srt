1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,829

you ain't you haven't got i've been in

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:01,839
you ain't you haven't got i've been in
 

3
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,390
you ain't you haven't got i've been in
real situations and you don't it's

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400
real situations and you don't it's
 

5
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:12,150
real situations and you don't it's
milliseconds you've got milliseconds

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,160

 

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,629

that's that technique you was doing

8
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:14,639
that's that technique you was doing
 

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,510
that's that technique you was doing
i can't lift it up lower it down i can't

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
i can't lift it up lower it down i can't
 

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,230
i can't lift it up lower it down i can't
do anything more so where does it come

12
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
do anything more so where does it come
 

13
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,349
do anything more so where does it come
from

14
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359

 

15
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,150

let's do it simon so you can see

16
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
let's do it simon so you can see
 

17
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,709
let's do it simon so you can see
see this hand

18
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719

 

19
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,030

see now we've got two techniques that

20
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
see now we've got two techniques that
 

21
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,030
see now we've got two techniques that
look exactly the same

22
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040

 

23
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,670

i don't know what foot he's got forward

24
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,680
i don't know what foot he's got forward
 

25
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,630
i don't know what foot he's got forward
so

26
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
so
 

27
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,670
so
i could be like this but it would help

28
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
i could be like this but it would help
 

29
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,310
i could be like this but it would help
if i'm in hand me but i could be like

30
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
if i'm in hand me but i could be like
 

31
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,110
if i'm in hand me but i could be like
this

32
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
this
 

33
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,709
this
because i don't know what foot he's got

34
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
because i don't know what foot he's got
 

35
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,790
because i don't know what foot he's got
forward i have to choose what way i'm

36
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
forward i have to choose what way i'm
 

37
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,470
forward i have to choose what way i'm
going to go

38
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
going to go
 

39
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,590
going to go
so i'm going to

40
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
so i'm going to
 

41
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,590
so i'm going to
go this way or this way

42
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
go this way or this way
 

43
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,910
go this way or this way
this way this way how am i going to lift

44
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
this way this way how am i going to lift
 

45
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,750
this way this way how am i going to lift
my arms up

46
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
my arms up
 

47
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,349
my arms up
i can't lift them up so i'll leave them

48
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
i can't lift them up so i'll leave them
 

49
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,990
i can't lift them up so i'll leave them
where they are

50
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
where they are
 

51
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,070
where they are
i take it out i leave him where he is

52
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
i take it out i leave him where he is
 

53
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,270
i take it out i leave him where he is
i step out here we're back to almost now

54
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
i step out here we're back to almost now
 

55
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,910
i step out here we're back to almost now
category if you think about it and then

56
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
category if you think about it and then
 

57
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,469
category if you think about it and then
i push him down

58
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
i push him down
 

59
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,270
i push him down
so i've now got two techniques that i

60
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
so i've now got two techniques that i
 

61
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,429
so i've now got two techniques that i
don't have to worry about oh how many

62
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
don't have to worry about oh how many
 

63
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,350
don't have to worry about oh how many
techniques we've got to remember

64
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
techniques we've got to remember
 

65
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,030
techniques we've got to remember
because i'm starting to piece them

66
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
because i'm starting to piece them
 

67
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,109
because i'm starting to piece them
together slowly

68
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
together slowly
 

69
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,069
together slowly

if i
do this

74
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
do this
 

75
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,510
do this
and that

76
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
and that
 

77
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,830
and that
from usierdo

78
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
from usierdo
 

79
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,749
from usierdo
i can't bring it

80
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
i can't bring it
 

81
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,510
i can't bring it
i can't bring it up

82
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
i can't bring it up
 

83
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,230
i can't bring it up
but i can leave it there and i can move

84
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
but i can leave it there and i can move
 

85
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,510
but i can leave it there and i can move

okay and then you know the rest

90
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320

 

91
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,429

okay

92
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
okay
 

93
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,950
okay
on a gas mask

94
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
on a gas mask
 

95
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,040
