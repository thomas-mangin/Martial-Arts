1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,754
They will suck the blood out of you and throw you away when they're finished.

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:07,424
Perhaps you'd better not put that on the tape right?

3
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:29,047
How did you start Aikido?

4
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:34,886
When I started, I didn't have any idea of what Aikido was supposed to be.

5
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:38,432
It was a martial art of some sort, it was Aikido.

6
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:43,645
You go on the mat and you're thrown and so on... it was interesting.

7
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,774
I didn't practice it for a particular reason, it was something interesting to do.

8
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,569
I got to know the teacher.

9
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:56,116
He told me about this strange martial art based on love.

10
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:03,123
I was studying philosophy at the University of Sussex and I thought "this is not possible",

11
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,334
so I dismissed it.

12
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:11,006
He was a 3rd Dan, he had been captain of the club in the University of Tokyo.

13
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:15,719
He invited me onto the mat and I think he used shihonage,

14
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,598
I remember going down immediately and thinking "oh, very interesting".

15
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:25,771
His English wasn't very good I think, so he showed.

16
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:32,027
It's a way of teaching that I've become more accustomed to over the years.

17
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:36,948
He showed without much physical or verbal explanation.

18
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,077
It was very attractive.

19
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:48,669
The idea was that you had a kind of physico-physcial relationship with the person you were training with

20
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:56,134
and if he attacked, you were supposed to emerge in an advantageous situation.

21
00:02:56,134 --> 00:03:00,097
If you were the attacker, the situation was reversed so it was really quite fair.

22
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,474
There was no competition at all.

23
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:08,814
Of course, we weren't particularly fit even though at the time, I was doing long distance cross country running

24
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:13,819
so I had plenty of stamina but there were some muscles that didn't really get exercised.

25
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:19,658
I found out afterwards that he was attached to a dojo,

26
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:25,872
which I think would normally be thought of as rather right wing in Japan, politically...

27
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,040
GE: Aren't they all?

28
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:38,301
Well they are, but that one especially so, it was right wing, proudly displaying it, in the Shiseikan Dojo.

29
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:43,807
So, at the time that he practiced with us,

30
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:54,067
he was concerned to portray the Emperor and the Emperor system in a way that he thought had to be understood by non-japanese.

31
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:59,781
and we didn't either really understand it, or we what we understood, we didn't agree with.

32
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:07,289
because we had also read our history of WWII and made our own conclusions,

33
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:12,377
aided by parents and friends who actually fought in the war.

34
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:22,846
I still know him, we are friends, we still correspond from time to time, though he's got older now.

35
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:31,521
He went back to Japan and I used to go in the dojo of Chiba Sensei in London.

36
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:39,738
Chiba Kazuo Sensei was quite different, the way he taught, the way he practiced, and the way he handled himself.

37
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:45,619
I think he felt himself as the closest thing to a traditional Japanese Samurai.

38
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:56,505
The way he interacted with his students, to my mind, was problematic.

39
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,300
His own students wouldn't agree at all, he was a fantastic teacher.

40
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,761
And OK.

41
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:08,975
And then I tried the resolve the contradictions... well, the clash of temperament between those two.

42
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:14,231
I understand that you also studied in America for a while...

43
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,734
My subject area was philosophy

44
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,238
and I had decided to begin at the beginning

45
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:27,202
and I was studying ancient Greek philosophy, pre-Socratics, Plato, Aristotle, stoics.

46
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,163
But to do that properly you need Greek

47
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,334
and so Sussex didn't offer Greek so I went to America.

48
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:39,589
I got a scholarship at Harvard University in the classics department.

49
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:51,351
Well, my initial Japanese friend who was a teacher approached the Aikikai and gave me the name of a teacher.

50
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:56,106
named Kanai Mitsunari Sensei, who was Chiba Sensei's school friend.

51
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,775
And again he was quite different as well.

52
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,403
He wasn't trying to be a Samurai in any sense of the word.

53
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:06,533
I was practicing, he liked it, he'd been sent to teach in America, which he did,

54
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,662
he didn't like the politics and simply got on with practicing

55
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:15,166
He also did Iaido with a few of his Japanese yudansha.

56
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,129
So i had 2 years there, why, because Harvard was a very political university

57
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,300
and my supervisor went back to England

58
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,762
so I decided to follow him back and went to the University of London,

59
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:32,225
and the teacher there was a man named Minoru Kanetsuka.

60
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:39,900
I was at University College London and there was a dojo at the college so I was able to resume my Harvard-type existence.

61
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,820
and trained and did my PhD at well.

62
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,032
That provided a good balance.

63
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:53,622
I got my Shodan in London from Kanetsuka Sensei.

64
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:58,835
I then became a kind of junior instructor in the main dojo in London.

65
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,672
We had to keep a diary of what we taught

66
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,758
It was a very conservative setup.

67
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:10,889
We always began with a big warm-up and then shomenuchi suwariwaza ikkyo.

68
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,976
then hanmi handachi

69
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,897
and only then we'd other taijutsu techniques.

70
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,025
In the second part of the class we'd do weapons.

71
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:29,866
Kanetsuka had a makiwara, you've seen it outside in the garden, and we would do uchikomi, uchikomi, uchikomi, taimenuchi...

72
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:36,998
At the time, he was attracted to the style of Saito Sensei,

73
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:41,378
because the books had come out at that time and he was studying them.

74
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:51,429
Only later did I find out that there were political issues, there was Iwama, and there was Tokyo.

75
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:56,434
Did these teachers all influence your views about Aikido?

76
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:02,607
The experience of training in America was different from the experience of training in England,

77
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:07,112
which was different again form the experience of training with Taho-san the first time.

78
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:13,618
Then going back to England again and seeing Kanetsuka Sensei, who was Chiba Sensei's successor if you like,

79
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,955
and the problems he had with Chiba's own students who were senior.

80
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:23,962
His Aikido was very nice, very good

81
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:30,593
but I kept thinking well, what's an Aikido Sensei supposed to be, what's he supposed to do

82
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,764
what were the job descriptions appart from learning the techniques and teaching them?

83
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,975
You know, what you're supposed to be,

84
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:45,191
especially now that some of the more traditional Shihan complain that it's too much of a busyness.

85
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,654
In soem sense their idea is that it must be some kind of a vocation

86
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:53,992
All of my teachers, in fact, with no exception, have been Japanese.

87
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:59,831
One question is, "Is your focus of Aikido on the technique or on the teacher?"

88
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,126
You practice Aikido to learn techniques or whatever

89
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,337
waza, I think is a better word, I don't like the word technqiue really

90
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:12,761
In my own case, finding a teacher was really secondary.

91
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:18,600
because it depended initially on where I was,

92
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:26,024
then I would look for a dojo and go learn from the teacher in the dojo

93
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:33,948
Other people didn't do this, other people found a teacher and kept with that teacher for most of their Aikido lives.

94
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:40,872
Some people would say that unless you find a teacher that you like and you fit, you can't really start.

95
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,208
I don't really agree.

96
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:50,590
I think that the way you go to a dojo and learn about the art,

97
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:57,055
the way the art fits you and the way you fit the art is defferent from person to person.

98
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:06,731
I found it useful to learn basics from three different teachers, because it was good learning experience.

99
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:15,406
but I never focused especially on one.

100
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:24,165
This is another thing about Aikido, you don't stop training and you don't stop learning something.

101
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,962
As I got older I had to rebuild the way I practice,

102
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:35,343
because I'm no longer a 20-year-old, or a 30, or a 40-year-old,

103
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,554
so you have to do this.

104
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:53,153
To my mind, it's the principles defining the art that are the most important, and not the teacher who manifests the art at any one time.

105
00:10:53,903 --> 00:11:01,744
Different teachers have different ways of doing it, and that's OK, not a problem, but my focus is not.

106
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,415
In a way, it's chiken and egg I suppose because

107
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:12,714
You go to the dojo and you learn what you can learn form the teacher in the dojo, and other people,

108
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:24,559
and that adds to the stock, if you like, of your Aikido knowledge, however you want to call it.

109
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:35,904
With Chiba Sensei, I did find people who believed that Chiba Sensei was a fantastic teacher, as he was,

110
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:47,832
but he was the only one, other teachers weren't really a factor, and I didn't share that view.

111
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:52,837
What brought you to Japan?

112
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:57,675
When I was at Harvard, I had plans of going to Japan.

113
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:04,891
The reason for this is that I bought a book called Aikido written by Kisshomaru Ueshiba.

114
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:13,650
I think you know the book, in English, with photographs of a young Chiba and a young Tamura taking ukemi.

115
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:22,075
In the book, there was an explanation of the founder and Aikido, ans so on.

116
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,245
Training in Japan seemed attractive.

117
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:35,338
I had been told by Chiba Shihan: "Do not go to Japan just to practice Aikido"

118
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:45,348
He said: "Go to Japan with another means of support, another reason for existing than Aikido".

119
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,518
That was his advice and I followed it.

120
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:59,195
It meant finding a university because I thought it was very difficult to go and work for a company, and I'm an academic.

121
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:13,710
So I did this and eventually I was offered positions, and the one that I chose was at Hiroshima University, so I came here.

122
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,215
This house had been lived in by a professor.

123
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:28,308
I have an arrangement such that I don't own it but I partly own it, I rebuild it when it needs rebuilding.

124
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:33,187
The neighbourhood is a traditional Japanese neighbourhood

125
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:40,862
and all the neighbors have been here also for many years, so I'm known as the foreign teacher.

126
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:47,243
I'm Sensei basically in the neighborhood, everybody knows who I am.

127
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,124
I became embedded if you like.

128
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,794
To do this, you need Japanese, there is no question.

129
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:07,930
Hiroshima is not like Tokyo where you can get away with very little Japanese, you need Japanese.

130
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:15,897
There is a very strong dialect also and I had no idea what my Aikido teachers were saying to me for the first few years.

131
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:20,902
Did you train at the Tokyo Hombu Dojo at that time?

132
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:26,824
When I came, a colleague took me to Tokyo and I went to the Hombu.

133
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:33,206
I had met Kisshomaru Ueshiba in America before.

134
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,541
Very interesting...

135
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,503
What I mean is in America I was practicing hard right.

136
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:45,843
Kisshomaru's way was very smooth and very circular, he was very frail in many ways,

137
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:51,391
and clearly, he knew what he was doing.

138
00:14:53,101 --> 00:15:01,150
I hadn't talked to him so when I met Kisshomaru in Hombu, I went to the house next door to the dojo,

139
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:06,155
I was invited in and I was with Fujita Shihan.

140
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:16,290
I found out later that Fujita Shihan had actually started the dojo in Hiroshima when he was a student at Takushoku University.

141
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:22,797
So he went back a long way with the teacher here whose name was Kitahira Sensei.

142
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:31,222
So I met Fujita Sensei and we had a little tour of the Hombu and then we went to the house and I met Kisshomaru.

143
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:38,271
We sat down and had some tea, his wife brought tea and okashi (snacks)

144
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:43,693
We had a talk, he was very happy that I came to Japan and was in Hiroshima,

145
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:49,323
Unfortunately it was a bit far away from Tokyo but he hoped that I would come to the Hombu as often as possible and practice.

146
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:53,161
My colleague was translating.

147
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:59,917
When we'd finish the interview ad we were walking the narrow street form the Hombu to the mai road,

148
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:04,881
I asked him and he said: well, I've got mixed feelings about this actually"

149
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:12,889
"Yeah it's Aikido, the martial arts have a very negative sort of chachet in Japan"

150
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:20,438
"so if a daughter of mine wanted to marry a Hombu Dojo Shihan I would have big problems".

151
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,983
And I thought "oh, very interesting..."

152
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:29,030
How was you practice in Hiroshima?

153
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,533
One thing I did is to stop teaching Aikido.

154
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,662
I went to the dojo.

155
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,916
Fujita Sensei had told the teacher here,

156
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,752
and I began to go to the dojo, I became a member.

157
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:53,888
I became independent, for want of a better word, in around 2003 or 2004.

158
00:16:54,597 --> 00:17:00,019
So 25 years or so, I trained in that dojo, probably.

159
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,396
All the time.

160
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:06,817
So that's long period of time under one teacher I think.

161
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:12,865
When I first came I can remember: "Oh, they're doing it quite differently".

162
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,201
It was rather old-fashioned.

163
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:22,583
I saw Kitihira Sensei do stuff that I had never seen before.

164
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:31,384
That was getting very interesting, it was very sharp, straight Aikido, lots of atemi.

165
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:40,893
One thing that was interesting is that three Shihan would come from the Hombu every year.

166
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:48,109
There was normally Friday, Saturday, and Sunday training sessions.

167
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:54,865
The spring seminar would be run by Tada Sensei,

168
00:17:54,865 --> 00:18:00,913
the autumn seminar, by Yamaguchi Sensei,

169
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:06,127
and then in-between, there'd be a seminar with Fujita Sensei

170
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:10,756
but he would sometimes give up his place to another Shihan

171
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:18,556
and so Rinjiro Shirata came down here once and later, Saito Sensei as well.

172
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:26,355
I knew him from before so I was able to partner him for sword work on the Sunday.

173
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:32,653
That was a very good kind of background.

174
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,364
Kitihira Sensei is now 8th Dan I think.

175
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:41,829
For example once, he stopped everybody and said: "OK, now let's do iriminage"

176
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:46,792
and for 2 hours, we practiced iriminage.

177
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,963
He invited all the senior Yudansha to come on and show what you did.

178
00:18:52,006 --> 00:19:01,432
We all said: "Oh, look at the feet, and the hands, and the head, it's very interesting, its iriminage but it's all different".

179
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:06,604
I was also invited and I went up.

180
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:16,197
We were doing it the way you cut down, make a circle, and then throw, just like Kisshomaru used to do it.

181
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:22,620
The way I moved he said: "You're moving the same way as we are".

182
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:29,210
I think my feet... I was somehow going forward rather than going backwards.

183
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:36,342
Now, I was amazed because Kitihira Sensie had no problem with actually asking everybody to show

184
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:44,308
and then stealing, borrowing, using what he saw, and that to my mind was a very good way.

185
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:52,191
Kitihira Sensei was unusual in the sense that he didn't expect us to imitate his waza.

186
00:19:54,276 --> 00:20:00,908
It was very difficult to do sometimes and he was quite old, his ukemi was not very good because he wasn't young

187
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:06,497
but he was quite strong and he was also learning.

188
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:14,046
I haven't met him for a good while but he used to practice and research all the time.

189
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:20,803
So to my mind, that was a good dojo to go to.

190
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:25,808
So that was a little bit like at Hombu?

191
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:32,815
I don't know, the Hombu is the Hombu, and I've heard conflicting stories about training there.

192
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:40,239
In the Hombu, there are a large number of teachers.

193
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:47,288
I suppose you're meant to go to all the classes but I suppose eventually you tend to favor one or two teachers over the others.

194
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:52,376
Arikawa Sensei told me very proudly that there were very few students in his classes.

195
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:58,466
I didn't ask him why because it was pretty obvious why, after seeing him on the mat!

196
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:05,806
Anyway, he didn't mind this, but here, Kitihira Sensei always taught.

197
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:11,061
Did you take on responsibilities during these 25 years at the Dojo?

198
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:15,816
Eventually, I would sit with him when the Dan examinations were held

199
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:23,741
because I would always ask people to do things that they hadn't prepared for.

200
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:31,373
He found that entertaining in many ways because there was always a panic,

201
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:35,795
I would ask for something, especially the students, and they hadn't practiced it

202
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:41,634
and they would go: "oh he is asking this..." so there were little groups

203
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:47,473
behind the main line up, frantically practicing so that when their turn came they would know.

204
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:52,478
And of course I could see it so I always asked something different that they hadn't prepared for.

205
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:57,483
So if doing techniques in different ways was accepted in the dojo, how about cross-training in different places?

206
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:03,989
Kitihira Sensei did not like students going to other dojos, he made that very clear.

207
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:12,623
I happened to be teaching in another university titled Hiroshima Shurei Univeristy,

208
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:17,711
I was a part-time teacher and there was an Aikido club.

209
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:27,179
Now i wouldn't do this but initially I went and I asked somebody, a colleague, about Aikido and Shudo and they said: "oh we'll go and practice".

210
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:33,185
So I went and met the instructor, who was a student of Nishio Sensei

211
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:42,778
Then I met all these other people who came form the main dojo and said: "Peter, don't tell anybody that I practice here, keep it secret".

212
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:47,616
I though: "How very interesting, yes well..." and I did of course.

213
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,870
It was Nishio Aikido.

214
00:22:51,662 --> 00:23:01,088
But I couldn't train. If it were found that that I was training there, there would have been a terrible explosion.

215
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:05,926
Nishio Sensei was a very interesting person, quite different.

216
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:16,061
I can remember once with a certain Hombu Shihan, being told in great details why Nishio Sensei both was and was not a Hombu Shihan.

217
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,315
The intellectual gymnastics were really quite interesting.

218
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:28,198
One of the reasons why I got to know him quite well was that as I told you, there was a dojo in Saijo, Higashi Hiroshima.

219
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:32,369
That was started by two colleagues of mine.

220
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,413
A lady named Carolin Funck, I met here first.

221
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:40,169
I met her first, she had come to Hiroshima University and she was in the same faculty as I was

222
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,130
They were there with her husband Werner Steinhaus

223
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,301
Now, they said Peter, we need to open a dojo, why don't you open a dojo?

224
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:55,392
And I said: "well, you know..." I was actually quite happy training in Kenshibu as it was, the main dojo.

225
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:08,364
But I encountered problems because the two Germans had a very clear idea of what they wanted to do.

226
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:21,001
I was regarded as the senior of the 3 and Kitihira Sensei and I sort of gradually fell apart in this respect.

227
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:38,268
That cause me to think about issues like "well I'm doing my Aikido, and not his or theirs" so those were questions I hadn't really thought about before.

228
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:48,028
But I agreed to start a dojo, we eventually worked out a common framework so that when we opened the dojo,

229
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:57,830
there'd be no major conflict in how we actually taught the classes because the dojo was going to be run be the three of us, not by one.

230
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,291
So that's how it's worked.

231
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,629
I think we're in our 12th year now.

232
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:11,677
So now, the membership is about 50 and of those there is about 20 there at any one time.

233
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:29,611
Well in one sense it's a typical local dojo, there are no non-Japanese students except for one man who is Korean, and I think there is a Chinese as well,

234
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:37,327
but the teachers are all foreign and I don't think I know any other dojo that's quite like this.

235
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:44,668
where really, I'm the chief instructor, but Carolyn and Werner instruct together.

236
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:50,090
So it's really a dojo where the teaching is shared.

237
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:55,471
So the students also learn to see 3 different ways of doing it.

238
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:59,933
Because I've train for so long that it just sort of comes out.

239
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:04,271
I just do what I do and sometimes, I forget the rules that we agreed

240
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:08,942
Sometimes I don't do ikkyo quite correctly in the way that they've established but they know, the students.

241
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:13,947
We now have, oh I think that the senior students are now 3rd Dan.

242
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:19,119
So it has followed the typical trajectory.

243
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:27,711
and the only difference is that the dojo is a general dojo for Japanese people and all the teachers are foreign.

244
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,923
To my mind, it's a very good situation.

245
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,469
How it will continue, I don't know.

246
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:44,186
I have no plan to go back to England but I can't see myself training when I'm a hundred if I ever live that long.

247
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:52,236
So it might well be that the students will take over and that's fine, we have enough students who want to do this.

248
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:57,241
Are you affiliated to your old dojo?

249
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:07,584
When we built the dojo, initally, the prefecture association approached us and said:

250
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:14,800
"Hadn't you better be independent? Because your dojo is in a very unusual situation"

251
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:25,477
I asked the Hombu and Doshu said "no, keep it a member of Kenshibu for a moment, join the normal, the local organizaton"

252
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:37,406
And we did but, stresses and strains, we somehow changed,

253
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:43,996
So to my mind, it would have been better to be independent from the beginning, and eventually it happened.

254
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:56,383
It happened, really because I was very noisy in informing Hombu about what was going on.

255
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:11,064
Eventually, they said "Go your own way" and I received permission to hold Dan grades examinations and great, that's how it followed.

256
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:21,825
Now that set a precedent and it's more generally accepted that if a Hombu Shihan comes and does a seminar,

257
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:27,789
then they will invite you from the other dojos which are not directly in that group.

258
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:32,794
Are you involved with other dojos?

259
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:39,843
When I stared practicing in Japan, in Hiroshima, I practiced with the other dojo members

260
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,347
and I got to know a few people.

261
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:48,268
One of them, whom you'll meet, I've practiced with him for years.

262
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:56,485
His name is Motooka and when I became independent, he wanted to be independent too.

263
00:28:56,485 --> 00:29:03,575
He has the idea of keeping the old type of Aikido alive somehow,

264
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,829
much more traditional, the way it was taught 40 or 50 years ago.

265
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:14,836
He thinks that's changed, and I don't think I can deny this, that it has changed in some respects.

266
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:22,678
Anyway, he wanted to know how to do it and wether he could follow the same pattern as I did

267
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:30,269
so I took him to the Hombu once and introduced him to Doshu and we talked.

268
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:38,819
I think we met Osawa Sensei who was in charge of the Japanese Dan structure and what not.

269
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:46,535
He said: "You can't give your own Dan ranks yet but what you should do is ask somebody who can.

270
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:51,373
So I was asked if I would go to the dojo to be the chief instructor,

271
00:29:51,373 --> 00:30:04,011
and I was a bit... I said yes but, it was a bit difficult because he was actually senior to me in terms of Dan rank

272
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,974
and here was I going into his dojo.

273
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:18,400
He has his own way of practicing, as I had mine, and so it then occurred that the best thing to do is weapons.

274
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:26,241
Motooka-san was eventually given permission to give his own grades, to recommend promotions.

275
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:33,373
The arrangements are that he does the Kyu grades and I do the Dan grades.

276
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:38,378
What weapons system do you teach?

277
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:48,555
I had picked up from training with Chiba Sensei, especially going to summer schools in America,

278
00:30:49,765 --> 00:31:00,359
I'd learn the 31 jo kata and I'd learned the paired kata, ad also the 13 awase, kumitachi, and so on.

279
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:13,997
Kitihira Sensei had some serious rank in jojutsu and had learned weapons yes, no question,

280
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:19,086
but he didn't practice weapons very much.

281
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:31,139
I think he believed what he was told by Fujita Sensei that by the end of his life, O Sensei didn't actually use weapons, now I've no idea whether that's true or not.

282
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,600
So he didn't teach weapons very much.

283
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,939
Now I had been brought up, from the very beginning,

284
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:44,277
the man who came form Tokyo University did weapons as well,

285
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:50,492
and I discovered in Europe, that every Japanese Shihan had hsi own weapons system

286
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:57,541
and so to my mind, that's very strange, that they don't do weapons in the Hombu but everybody does outside, and of course in Iwama.

287
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:04,214
So we started teaching weapons and I started teaching the kids the 31 kata.

288
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:13,640
So if you go to the dojo this evening early enough, you find them in English, "1, 2, 3, 4..." as they go from 1 to 31.

289
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,643
So it has worked.

290
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:30,490
His dojo is Futabanosato, the main dojo so we have a relationship with our dojo so that our students are members of both.
