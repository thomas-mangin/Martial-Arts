his mass is offering some kind of young
 

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,929
his mass is offering some kind of young
energy and that allows me to push okay

10
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:26,939
energy and that allows me to push okay
 

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,439
energy and that allows me to push okay
which is why if he takes away his
