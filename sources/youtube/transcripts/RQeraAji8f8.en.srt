strikes are closer to range strives are

16
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:27,900
strikes are closer to range strives are
 

17
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,230

closer to the range than katate because

18
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
closer to the range than katate because

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:36,420

 

23
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,870

and then we know on some energy that I

24
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:38,880
and then we know on some energy that I
 

25
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,510
and then we know on some energy that I
address it as it's going up

26
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
address it as it's going up
 

27
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,090
address it as it's going up
I never address it on its way down I

86
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,229
and in that sense it's still different
than this one that I was eating kept in

87
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
than this one that I was eating kept in
 

88
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,089

92
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,150

okay what's key is that okay actually

93
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,160
okay what's key is that okay actually
 

94
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,910
okay what's key is that okay actually
throws the strike is not posting at the

95
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
throws the strike is not posting at the

100
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,270

all right it's it looks much easier but

101
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
all right it's it looks much easier but
 

102
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,770
all right it's it looks much easier but
I'll show you where there's some

103
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:42,780
I'll show you where there's some
 

104
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,190
I'll show you where there's some
differences okay so on the first one my

105
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,200
differences okay so on the first one my
 

106
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,650
differences okay so on the first one my
hand should be the same I'm not going to

107
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:48,660
hand should be the same I'm not going to
 

108

118
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,530

and in this technique I the elbow is

119
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:03,540
