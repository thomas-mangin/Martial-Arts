1
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:57,140
I started Aikido in France, in Paris

2
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,060
with a teacher called Jean-Claude Tavernier.

3
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,355
It was the Mochizuki style of Aikido

4
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:08,360
taught by Hiroo Mochizuki, the son of Minoru Mochizuki.

5
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,820
That lasted for about a year.

6
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,738
Then we met Nakazono Sensei

7
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,490
who came from Marseilles.

8
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,743
It was a revelation because his Aikido was very different.

9
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,620
It was really Aikido.

10
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,499
I followed Nakazono Sensei until I got my second Dan

11
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,252
and when I turned 18, I decided to go to Japan

12
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,087
to improve my Aikido.

13
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,131
My plan was to go for a few months.

14
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:32,301
I thought that 6 months of Aikido in Japan,

15
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,220
or even that just to set foot in Japan would be sufficient.

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,264
But things turned out differently.

17
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,392
All those who have been there know the system,

18
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:44,980
you are quickly caught in the Japanese rhythm,

19
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,691
the ease of living there.

20
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:53,030
It may be different now but at the time, even if it wasn't that easy to find a job,

21
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,868
in Japan, relationships are fairly simple

22
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:02,372
for someone who is young and who doesn't have too many commitments.

23
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:07,836
If someone is hungry to learn, it is quickly comfortable there.

24
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:14,676
Compared to Paris, Tokyo seemed to me like a big country village.

25
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,472
Small streets, houses, no tall buildings...

26
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:23,226
In the neighborhood of the Aikikai, the tallest building was the Aikikai itself.

27
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,229
It was still pretty much like countryside.

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,690
I liked that rhythm,

29
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,446
training, but also the fact that it was easy to make contact with people.

30
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,537
When I arrived, I used to go to all the classes from morning to evening

31
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:46,917
because I did not have much to do then.

32
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:51,213
It was interesting at the time because there were people like Saito Sensei teaching Sunday mornings,

33
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,632
Tohei Koichi Sensei,

34
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,051
Tohei Akira who subsequently went to the US...

35
00:02:56,051 --> 00:03:04,559
I went to all the classes even though I preferred some to others and even if I didn't understand their Aikido.

36
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,145
I didn't understand Doshu's Aikido.

37
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,773
It was so different compared to what I had learnt

38
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,900
that I even doubted his skills.

39
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,573
It took me some time to realize that my views were incorrect.

40
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,954
It did not look like what I had learnt so of course, in my eyes, it was no good.

41
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,505
It is interesting because they wondered who I was, especially Doshu.

42
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,509
Yamaguchi Sensei knew because he got a letter from Nakazono Sensei.

43
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,013
There weren't many foreigners and Doshu wondered who was

44
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,599
that 18-year-old kid so he observed me from afar.

45
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,062
He was a shy man but one day he came to talk to me.

46
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,024
I couldn't speak Japanese so communication wasn't easy

47
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:57,696
but little by little, a relationship formed.

48
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:03,326
I was the same age as his son, the current Doshu, who had a white belt and no hakama at the time.

49
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:08,540
So we often practiced together.

50
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:16,965
Little by little, he started to take me as uke and he truly became one of my Sensei.

51
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:21,386
I followed his classes every morning for years.

52
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:27,017
In addition to that, I mainly followed Yamaguchi Sensei

53
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:32,397
at Hombu Dojo but also in his dojo of Shimokitasawa

54
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:37,360
and at Meiji on Thursday mornings.

55
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,197
These were more like father-and-son relationships

56
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:45,911
he took me under his wing and I used to go to his place.

57
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:50,373
The other Sensei with whom I was close were Saotome Sensei

58
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:56,463
and Masuda Sensei. We used to go out together.

59
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:06,306
At the time, Endo Sensei had just gotten his 4th Dan,

60
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:11,353
Suganuma too, they were starting to teach at the Aikikai but not upstairs.

61
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:17,818
Saotome Sensei was already a 6th Dan and he was teaching for 3 h every Wednesday afternoon.

62
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:22,531
I used to practice with everybody, including Watanabe Sensei

63
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:30,121
and since people were used to see me, I was part of the dojo.

64
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,254
Frankly, I never had this problem.

65
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,881
I never tried to mimic Yamaguchi Sensei

66
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,176
at least in his excessive forms.

67
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:49,057
His forms were not excessive, they were pure, but you saw excess in some of his students

68
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:53,103
not Yasuno for example, but some, including some foreigners who were there

69
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,396
and who mimicked the form.

70
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,314
We often mimic the easiest part,

71
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,818
if a teacher strokes his hair, we stroke ours too.

72
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:09,244
They copied what looked like his casualness even though he was not,

73
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:15,417
his way to play with the partner even though he didn't like playing with the partner.

74
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:20,630
He used to say "Waki ga nai" ; "there should be no opening".

75
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,624
What he liked in me was that I was genuine and did my own Aikido,

76
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:28,424
even though when he taught, I tried my best to do what he showed

77
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,265
because that's what I wanted to do.

78
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:36,187
But when I went to Osawa Sensei's class whose Aikido was totally different, I tried to reproduce Osawa Sensei's Aikido.

79
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:41,234
So I think that I never had such problem of adaptation.

80
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:46,740
Now soemone oustide may have thought that I did

81
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,411
but the Sensei all took me as uke, even Tada Sensei when he returned to Japan in 1974 or 75.

82
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:59,419
He used to teach every Tuesday and I was very often his uke even though our Aikido were completely different.

83
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,965
It is important in Aikido to have a basic formation,

84
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,636
that's why it was important to go to Doshu's class.

85
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:15,143
Not an official Aikido but something that can't be argued with.

86
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:20,899
If you want beginners to have a common language,

87
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:28,907
it's good to explain on shomenuchi how to get out of the line and come back in, etc.

88
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,284
for ikkyo, nikyo, sankyo, yonkyo.

89
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:38,333
And then according to one's sensitivity, to add variations.

90
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:44,756
If one wants to do a straight entry, or like Endo Sensei, to take the hand back a little, etc.

91
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:51,304
But if one doesn't have basics and a common language, one cannot be at ease anywhere.

92
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:56,434
When one sees a new Sensei, it is important to see the overall picture,

93
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:03,191
to remove what one knows, and to focus on what one find different.

94
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,903
At the Aikikai, everybody has the same base.

95
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,661
No, when I arrived in Japan,

96
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,081
I didn't know what was the difference between nikyo omote and ura.

97
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:24,879
For us, nikyo was always like this because the ukemi level wasn't high.

98
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,385
When a Japanese Sensei came to introduce Aikido,

99
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:40,186
the ukemi requirements for things like changing hands etc. were not there so they had to show applications.

100
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:45,567
It was easier for them to show that nikyo was like that and "ouch, it hurts", sankyo...

101
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,236
There was not much omote and ura at the time.

102
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:56,995
When I arrived in Japan, I discovered the structure that Doshu had put in place.

103
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:02,917
That codification was a great discovery.

104
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:11,426
I'd say that at the time in France, we did more an Aikido of applications.

105
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:21,061
No, it was because the level was insufficient.

106
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,188
I travel all over the world,

107
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,567
if you go to a dojo where they only do kokyunage, it means that the teacher is not good.

108
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,613
Because projections and break falls are easy.

109
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:41,331
If you really want to teach katatedori ikkyo, nikyo, sankyo, yonkyo, with the correct hand changes,

110
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:46,002
it is purely technical and it takes time to learn, there is a logic.

111
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:50,840
So teachers needed to know this logic, which wasn't the case.

112
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,717
It still isn't now actually.

113
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:57,597
If you ask someone "Why do we do this" you'll get "because that is how we do it".

114
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,557
Did anyone reflect upon this?

115
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,101
Some did, Yamaguchi Sensei did.

116
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,353
Whenever you asked a question, you got an answer.

117
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,105
There were some things he didn't want to do.

118
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,981
He would never have shown haihanmi katatedori,

119
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,444
maybe only for nikyo ura but for him it wasn't a real grab.

120
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:16,199
On hanmi handachi, apart from shihonage or direct kaitennage,

121
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:21,913
he would never have showed shomenuchi iriminage.

122
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:26,501
For him, it had no meaning.

123
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,837
He might have asked it during examinations

124
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:34,884
but in his teaching as an 8th or 9th Dan, he didn't want to do it himself.

125
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,805
For me it's the same, nowadays there are things that I don't want to do anymore.

126
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:45,145
I no longer want to teach tachidori because it seems very unlikely.

127
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:49,149
I have some experience in other martial arts and in Ken.

128
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:56,781
I don't mind showing a few forms as educatives but I don't believe in it.

129
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,617
For the knife, it's the same.

130
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:07,625
Of course it's a requirement for examinations, so it's important that my assistants teach it.

131
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:12,380
Weapons techniques aren't here to teach how to defend oneself against a knife,

132
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,258
they're here to emphasize priorities.

133
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,303
When there's a knife, even in wood, different priorities arise in the technique.

134
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:24,267
If you do shihonage without a knife, it's better to have your hand come close to your body.

135
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,812
but with the knife you can't because there is another priority.

136
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:35,111
There is a "spicy" aspect to it that emphasizes priorities in the action, but apart from that, it's useless.

137
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:41,201
As a self-defense, it doesn't work.

138
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:46,706
It's a good thing that 3rd to 6th Dan teachers show it,

139
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:52,003
but with the little time I have left to teach and live,

140
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:56,257
relative to the message that I can bring,

141
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,384
even though I'm not better than anyone,

142
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,180
if people are interested in what I do,

143
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:09,270
better to show them what interest me now rather than things that I no longer believe in.

144
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,191
GE: I suspect that with the seminars, they don't have as much access to you as would be necessary...

145
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,902
Yes, it's an ensemble of things.

146
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:22,116
In the life of an Aikidoka, there are stages.

147
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:26,788
You're an Aikidoka too, you're younger than me and at some point, you want to do something different.

148
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:31,209
For me it was boxing, it started with Saotome Sensei,

149
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:36,464
we were using protections and I served as a punching ball.

150
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:41,844
It gives you some experience and after, you have to sort through all that.

151
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:49,060
The problem of Aikido is that it's very vast and yet, it boils down to one single thing.

152
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,731
We always do the same movement in Aikido, it's always the same sensation, whatever the technique.

153
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:59,279
Technique is like a fan, you open it and learn all the forms.

154
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,490
It's a bit like in kenjutsu or karate kata

155
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,617
You learn all the probabilities...

156
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:10,081
All the technique that may happen one day but that will probably never happen...

157
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,833
You learn everything.

158
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,584
But there is only one base

159
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,171
and after a while, you need to close your fan and there's only one technique left.

160
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:23,177
At the beginning you'll work on yokomenuchi ikkyo,

161
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:29,684
you're a little static because you're learning so you go on the side and then come back

162
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:36,941
After that, you have a movement that leads the partner a bit by joining both hands,

163
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,779
Subsequently, you go towards the application, on the point that is behind.

164
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,823
Then you do ikkyo in the same way

165
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:49,162
and after a while, you realize that if you do it properly, whether it is yokomen or shomen, you can do exactly the same movement

166
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,540
because the important part is not the hand, it's the point that's behind

167
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,834
and with some anticipation you're already onto it.

168
00:13:54,834 --> 00:14:02,467
You realize that you needed all these techniques to get to one single thing.

169
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:08,973
For example, right now, I'm working on ryotedori koyuho.

170
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:15,897
I realized that it took me 50 years to understand that it was easier to do it like that.

171
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:24,197
The reason is that it's the same principle, because natural principles are so simple.

172
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,747
You're absolutely right but there is also something else.

173
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:37,960
People practice Aikido for a few years, 10 years or more,

174
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,132
and they do it for a particular reason, whatever it is,

175
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,301
but in fact, they are often mislead into it

176
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,971
because the real reasons reveal themselves afterwards.

177
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:55,561
You realize after a while that you're doing it but that it's miles away from what you initially felt or wanted to be.

178
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,399
In my case at least.

179
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,359
GE: Does your goal change?

180
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:08,699
Yes, because after a while you realize that you keep opening doors that keep getting either wider or narrower.

181
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,036
When they are wider, you keep becoming interested in new things,

182
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:16,666
and when they get narrower, you realize that you're onto the right thing and that you shouldn't let it go.

183
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,584
These are all different perspectives.

184
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,878
That's what practice is about, otherwise, you get bored.

185
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:32,598
If someone reaches 4th of 5th Dan with a good technical level (ikkyo, nikyo, sankyo, yonkyo,) and no injury,

186
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:40,022
but does the same thing 30 years later, it means that he missed the train somehow.

187
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:51,451
He can always do his thing and reproduce the same technical catalog, assuming that he can still kneel down...

188
00:15:52,160 --> 00:16:04,755
If someone asks me to reproduce the same basic techniques as those done by the uchi deshi of the Aikikai, I can do it just like them

189
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:12,513
but that's what I used to do 40 years ago, and today other sensations come into play.

190
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:19,312
Sometimes you get temporarily misdirected though.

191
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,482
For example, I play golf now,

192
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:29,155
I'm not good but I found a great similarity with what I do in Aikido.

193
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,992
Sometimes, if I cheat a bit, I can throw the ball better,

194
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,745
but the teacher tells me "no, your movement isn't correct"

195
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:42,877
"putting your hand like might will help for a couple of months, but it will eventually slow down your progression"

196
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:47,798
because it is something that is outside of the principles.

197
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,717
GE: These are mistakes that you have to go through though...

198
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:54,972
Of course you make them but you need to be honest about it.

199
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:59,227
Any Aikidoka knows that he can pass his movement with strength

200
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,604
but if he is honest with himself, he knows it.

201
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,272
When you cheat you know it.

202
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,443
The real problem is when you don't know that you are cheating.

203
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,444
Yamaguchi Sensei's Aikido was very sharp.

204
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:38,743
His movements and hand positions were based on cuts.

205
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,036
It was very sharp.

206
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:44,457
He studied several schools of weapons.

207
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,878
He had a keen interest in weapons even though he did not teach them.

208
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:53,966
There are no weapons class at the Aikikai because O Sensei opposed it

209
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:58,846
so it was very fuzzy and it led many people to study various weapons systems.

210
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:06,145
At the time, we only knew about Katori, Musoshinden-ryu,

211
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,066
various schools of Iai.

212
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:15,946
Now people study Kashima but at the time, it was unknown.

213
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,742
I discovered Kashima one night at Yamaguchi Sensei's house.

214
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:23,871
He showed me a video of Inaba Sensei

215
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:29,919
who at the time was not known as Inaba Sensei but as Inaba-kun (for Yamaguchi Sensei).

216
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,798
I watched this demonstration and found it interesting

217
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,759
so he offered to introduce me to him.

218
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,040
Inaba was an Aikido student of Yamaguchi Sensei.

219
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,919
He introduced me to Inaba Sensei and Inaba asked if I wanted to learn

220
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,714
but Inaba did not teach at the time, he was a student.

221
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,014
He learned very little from Kuni Sensei.

222
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,940
GE: Was he still a member of the Kashima Shin-ryu when you met him?

223
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,640
Yes he was, although I don't remember whether Kuni Sensei was still alive then.

224
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,103
It's much later that Inaba told me that he never taught me.

225
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:04,602
He taught me in a way, but through training together.

226
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:05,678
GE: It was informal...

227
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,726
It was informal, we were 4.

228
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:14,392
We used to go 3 times during week plus 4 or 5 h on Sunday mornings.

229
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,505
Sometimes, we'd do kesagiri for 4 h without a break.

230
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:22,425
and after he'd serve  as uke for the techniques.

231
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:27,300
I was just a kid so he was like my teacher but he isn't much older than me.

232
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,432
It's when we met a few years ago that he told me "We just trained together".

233
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,400
But in effect, he was teaching me.

234
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:41,680
I learned in Kashima something that fit my character: the direct quality.

235
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,309
What I don't like in certain forms of ken practiced by Aikidoka is the negative aspect.

236
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:53,138
For example, going back while cutting like in a taisabaki.

237
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,603
I prefer to cut, and then go back.

238
00:20:57,603 --> 00:20:59,200
It doesn't matter, it's only a form,

239
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,536
if people like doing that it's fine.

240
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:08,068
In my mind, that direct approach of certain Kashima forms

241
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,039
where you get directly under the attack is very important.

242
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,915
I found that in kickboxing too afterwards.

243
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,210
That's it, it moves and you are already there.

244
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,489
In Aikido, it's the meaning of irimi too,

245
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,562
there is no need to move but something goes off.

246
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,852
I loved the blinding speed of Kashima

247
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,160
so I studied the kata.

248
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,020
I had done a bit of iai and kendo.

249
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,460
GE: Only the ken? [of Kashima]

250
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,257
No, we also did the yari and the jo, but very little.

251
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,704
A little yari awase, jo against ken, and batto-jutsu too.

252
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,097
I did a lot of batto-jutsu but not anymore.

253
00:21:48,200 --> 00:22:00,295
Since I got elbow surgery, I lost the extension so I would have to rework all the gestures I had acquired.

254
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,821
Quite frankly, I am not that interested in it anymore.

255
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,962
GE: Did you study the empty-handed techniques? [of Kashima]

256
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:13,755
At that time, Inaba Sensei did not teach them

257
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,593
but from time to time, I went to Tanaka Sensei's class when Inaba was absent.

258
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,767
Tanaka Sensei came from the Yoshinkan.

259
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,089
His empty-handed techniques were different so I did it too.

260
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,080
GE: But these were not techniques of Kashima Shin-ryu...

261
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,320
No, it was slightly different Aikido but it was Aikido.

262
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:41,538
I saw Inaba Sensei's Aikido and it is very relaxed and fluid but it is not at all my research.

263
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,062
It's something else.

264
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,325
I need to clarify something,

265
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,652
I don't teach Kashima Shin-ryu.

266
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,015
I have no authority to teach it

267
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,748
even though when I came back from Japan, I thought I could.

268
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,761
According to rumors, Inaba Sensei no longer teaches Kashima Shin-ryu either.

269
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:20,813
I decided a long time ago that I would only keep in my ken the kata that are useful for my Aikido.

270
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,133
There are probably other very interesting kata but they bring nothing to my Aikido.

271
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:33,499
The other day, I was watching a video of the soke of Kashima Shin-ryu,

272
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,640
on men tachi zuke for example, they block the hands very close to the tsuba, which I can understand as it is probably more powerful,

273
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,017
but it doesn't interest me because it's not how I do ikkyo.

274
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:45,253
I prefer to do it nearer the tip of the blade.

275
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,466
I don't transform that school,

276
00:23:50,600 --> 00:24:02,487
I just start from that base and keep only the forms that are useful for my Aikidoka.

277
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,189
So things like the open foot are typical Aikido postures.

278
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,720
I teach ken only once per week here

279
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,308
but it's at 11 a.m. so there aren't many people because people are at work and the level isn't high.

280
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,198
I teach ken and jo during long seminars.

281
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,912
If it's a 1-week seminar, I do it for 1 h per day,

282
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:30,297
it relaxes people, they like it, and they are less tired than if they did only Aikido.

283
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:36,908
Regarding the jo, I worked a lot with Saotome Sensei.

284
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,045
He taught me everything.

285
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:49,753
The jo forms that I learned with Inaba Sensei are exactly the same as that of ken, but with a jo.

286
00:24:49,840 --> 00:25:01,852
In Saotome Sensei's and Saito Sensei's jo forms, there are a lot of hasso gaeshi so it's interesting.

287
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:09,052
there's a whole body of work and a playful aspect too it that people enjoy.

288
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,623
but I'm by no means a master-at-arms.

289
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,140
I'm 64 years-old

290
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:33,188
I respect more and more people, a lot more than when I was younger,

291
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:40,996
because I have more understanding and clemency for many things.

292
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,628
I don't feel that I usurp or steal anything.

293
00:27:47,628 --> 00:27:55,711
If I was introducing something different or new principles in my Aikido, I would call it something else

294
00:27:55,711 --> 00:28:01,561
or I would create a new discipline, but that's not at all what I want to do.

295
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,720
Some people say that they do Tissier-style Aikido, but I don't have a style.

296
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,880
My style is that of the Aikikai.

297
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:21,219
My Aikido is not more different than that of Yasuno, Miyamoto, Kanazawa or Endo.

298
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,354
You understand?

299
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:30,242
You may say that there is a Tissier line, to define it,

300
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,654
just like you would say Birankai or something else.

301
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,013
My Aikido is the Aikido of the Aikikai.

302
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,414
It's just my form.

303
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:47,152
I don't think I'm betraying what I learned, or they would tell me.

304
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:57,788
Sure, some people were mildly annoyed...

305
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:04,430
Fujita Sensei, with whom I got on very well used to say that I was a showman.

306
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:10,357
It's probably because I did Bercy but someone had to do it and there would have been someone anyway.

307
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,614
I don't enjoy Bercy, I haven't been for the past 4 or 5 years.

308
00:29:15,614 --> 00:29:18,603
I send my students such as Bruno because I have no interest for it anymore.

309
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,160
It's not what I want to do.

310
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:25,749
What I like to do is more in the line of what I did at the Combat Games.

311
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:34,780
I was recovering from illness and I wanted to do it slowly but I also got criticized for that too.

312
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,320
"He is stopping midway"

313
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,420
I wanted to show steps but people complained about it.

314
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,382
On the other hand, Itto, from the Aikikai called me and said it was great

315
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:50,137
but of course, if you do that in Bercy, you'll get booed because there are things like krav maga and kyokushin.

316
00:29:50,140 --> 00:30:00,233
However, I have hundreds of people who said to me that they started Aikido because they saw me.

317
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,620
Perhaps I'm a showman, but I have to.

318
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,844
The International Aikido Federation is a complex issue.

319
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,406
The Aikikai needs some recognition.

320
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:19,320
I don't know why but it seems very important to them.

321
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:26,000
Doshu wants to be recognized by the Olympic Committee and be part of international organizations.

322
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,298
They have this desire but at same time, don't really want to go for it.

323
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,386
It's a bit complicated.

324
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,135
The IAF is getting organized, it's worth what it's worth.

325
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,578
A lot of people complained that there would be competitions but there was never a question of competing or giving points.

326
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:52,082
The goal, which I liked, was to stop presenting old farts

327
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:58,228
but people under 35 and at a maximum of 4th Dan,

328
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,530
men, women, and youngsters,

329
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,124
to show that Aikido was also that.

330
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:09,600
I was asked to supervise with Miyamoto last time.

331
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:15,620
People come, they show us what they do and we some give advice.

332
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:22,460
Some come with great technique, other not so good, it depends of the country and of the experience, but we try to do something.

333
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,760
The first Games were mediocre but the quality was pretty good in St. Petersburg.

334
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,160
Beautiful images of Aikido.

335
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,289
But of course, there are always people to complain and say that it's not Aikido.

336
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:40,371
I'd like those people to show me their Aikido, to have the courage to do it and to accept criticism too.

337
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:49,410
I go there because I'm asked to, but it could be anyone else.

338
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:57,784
Frankly, I'm not that keen on going but I'm on duty.

339
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:06,784
The last IAF meeting was held in Cluj last September.

340
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,385
Waka Sensei was there with some uchi-deshi but I was not supposed to go.

341
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:22,657
I had not been asked and I had another seminar planned that day.

342
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:30,478
The Aikikai got a little worried and Tani sent a letter to request my presence.

343
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,731
There was no plan at all, seriously, never.

344
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,805
Things fell into place by themselves.

345
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:53,181
I never planned anything, it happened little by little.

346
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,328
Some people say that I am highly mediatized but I never wanted it.

347
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,528
I taught French at the Franco-Japonais institute, it went well because I am pretty good in French.

348
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,640
I did some TV in Japan, I was a model.

349
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:16,477
The first interviews in France went well because I don't stammer.

350
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:22,691
Some people from TV told me that it was quite a change compared to other athletes.

351
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,729
I never called a TV or a journal.

352
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,969
Ask Karate Bushido, it's them who keep asking me.

353
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,660
I don't think I would change anything.

354
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,120
Nothing is perfect.

355
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,913
GE: Things that were misunderstood?

356
00:33:48,913 --> 00:33:52,342
There are always things that are misunderstood, I agree

357
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,942
but it happens every day.

358
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,854
Sure, there are some relationships that I shouldn't have had, that I regret.

359
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,215
But that's not very important.

360
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:14,664
I sometimes took pretty radical positions towards someone and didn't realize that it affected them personally to the point that they stopped doing Aikido.

361
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:22,895
It's not right of me, I was not receptive enough, but then, him too probably didn't realize what I was about.

362
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,138
That sort of things happens every day.

363
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,309
If I had done something really bad perhaps, but that's not the case.

364
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:41,017
I'm OK with it, and it won't get any better with time.

365
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:48,041
I regret the mistakes I made when my knee started to break.

366
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,583
It was a time when we were quite competitive with Shibata and Miyamoto.

367
00:34:53,680 --> 00:35:03,147
My meniscus was broken but I came anyway and stayed for an hour in seiza on the wooden floor, suffering.

368
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,580
It's really stupid but I pretended to be a little samurai.

369
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:21,244
Years later I got surgery and the evening after, I was on the mat, and the the next, day at a seminar in Dijon.

370
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,362
That was stupid.

371
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:30,614
It did change me in the sense that when I see someone with bad knees I tell them that their body is the priority.

372
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,402
It reminds me what Edno Sensei often talks about.

373
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,567
When I met Endo, he was pretty rough and violent.

374
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,086
One day he broke his shoulder during a demonstration with Doshu

375
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:57,050
and Yamaguchi Sensei told him "do you want to continue like this with broken shoulders at your age?"

376
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,453
"if that's Aikido, you'd better stop because you are useless".

377
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,105
So he started to think and he changed his Aikido.

378
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,747
In my case, it didn't change my Aikido, I'd like to be able to practice on my knees.

379
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,797
It's very frustrating to explain something you can't do.

380
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:20,806
That's bad so I ask someone to do it and I give advice but that bothers me.

381
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:30,356
It bothers me because I can't go down, the knee does not bend anymore.

382
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:38,196
I tend to do ikkyo and nikyo techniques on the same side to be able to put the proper knee down.

383
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:46,623
Apart from that, my Aikido career is behind me.

384
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:55,648
I have a lot of pleasure in practice.

385
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:07,324
I still can do what I want when I'm standing but on the day I no longer can, I will stop showing it.

386
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:17,930
I find ridiculous to show people who are young and fit how to it do when you aren't.

387
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,323
It's interesting because it's something I've been thinking about lately.

388
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,516
I've had several generations of students.

389
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,620
I taught most of the teachers from the French Federation, as well as some in the rest of the world.

390
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:48,277
The first generation like Gérard Dumont are a bit outside of this now.

391
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,032
Then there was Patrick Bénézi and Bernard Palmier,

392
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:58,240
then Philippe Gouttard, then those like Pascal Norbely who are a little less known in Japan.

393
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:11,753
The two last generations were Bachraty, Gonzales, Pascal Guillemin who have great careers.

394
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:18,080
Now I have Fabrice Croizé who became 5th Dan with Hélène [Doué],

395
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:23,835
and some young people that you might see later, some 3rd Dan who really want to work.

396
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,424
I'm not demanding, I teach people who want to learn.

397
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,943
As long as they are here, I'll make efforts to be here and teach as much as possible.

398
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,556
I ask nothing in return, I don't play the Sensei, I don't ask that they carry my bag.

399
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,800
I never ask anything.

400
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:57,120
The reason is that my life is beautiful, it can't be better, my family, my kids,

401
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,456
I love what I do, I don't have any problem.

402
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,693
I don't see why I should ask anything.

403
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:12,853
If I can help people for anything, I try to do it but I ask nothing in return.

404
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,175
I noticed that some Aikido teachers had a strong hold on their students

405
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,326
that makes the students stay, perhaps out of interest or due to a domination etc.

406
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,566
I'm not like that.

407
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,605
Therefore, I have a lot of former students with whom I'm still in contact but whom I see very little.

408
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,185
They started their own dojo,

409
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:49,207
they're 50, 55, they have children, so they come from time to time.

410
00:39:49,207 --> 00:39:55,039
What they do is great, but it's not what I do now.

411
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,708
GE: They didn't follow your evolution...

412
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,637
They didn't follow but they have their own evolution.

413
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,475
I have nothing against that.

414
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:15,741
However, if they come at a class now, they feel a little disconnected, they feel that they can't do it.

415
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:26,314
Sometimes it drives them away, so we see each other less.

416
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:38,620
This is why when I returned from Japan in 1976 or 77, I still went back to Japan twice per year, about 4 months per year, for 10 years.

417
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,637
in order to stay connected with Yamaguchi Sensei.

418
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,808
He was coming to France twice per year and I spent 2 months in winter, 2 months in summer in Japan for 10 years.

419
00:40:46,808 --> 00:40:59,270
After that, my son was born in 82 and when you're 5th or 6th Dan, you don't go to Japan in the same manner as before.

420
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:06,823
It was important to keep that connection because Yamaguchi Sensei's Aikido changed every 3 months.

421
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:15,360
The principles stayed the same but it was different, so it was important to keep that connection.
