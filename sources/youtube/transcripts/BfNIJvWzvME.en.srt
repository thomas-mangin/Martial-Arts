we use it's a brutal so we use

110
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
we use it's a brutal so we use
 

111

we use it's a brutal so we use
the training of martial arts

112
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
the training of martial arts
 

113
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,750
the training of martial arts
and here's the one the part you don't

114
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:08,760
and here's the one the part you don't
 

115
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,070
and here's the one the part you don't
like we use the training in martial arts

116
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,080
like we use the training in martial arts
 

117
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,589
like we use the training in martial arts
to generate fear in you

118
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
to generate fear in you
 

119
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,369
to generate fear in you
so that you can reconcile fear

120
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:22,379
so that you can reconcile fear
 

121
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,149
so that you can reconcile fear
you can't work on what you don't put on

122
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
you can't work on what you don't put on
 

123
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,589
you can't work on what you don't put on
the workbench

124
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:30,599

 

125
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,229

do you understand

126
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:33,239
do you understand
 

127
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,390
do you understand
so we use that training

128
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400

 

129
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,729

but the goal is not the martial arts

130
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:40,739
but the goal is not the martial arts
 

131
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,110
but the goal is not the martial arts
training

132

133
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,449

and so for that reason

134
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:47,459
and so for that reason
 

135
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,690
and so for that reason
it's wherever you're facing fear

136
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:50,700
it's wherever you're facing fear
 

137
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,729
it's wherever you're facing fear
that is the training

138
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:52,739
that is the training
 

139
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,369
that is the training
not the technique

140
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:55,379
not the technique
 

141
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,430
not the technique
or not just the technique

142
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:58,440

but in that same way it could be
 

289
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,010
but in that same way it could be
a dojo

290
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,020
a dojo
 

291
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:15,409

295
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,809
right there's the on the dojo etiquette
there's a whole section and in that

there's a whole section and in that
 

297
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:29,749
there's a whole section and in that
section it has the Golden Rule

policy or or the penal code you you
 

303
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,790
policy or or the penal code you you
learn to read the code and

00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:37,800
learn to read the code and
 

305
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,370
learn to read the code and
and it will say like

306
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:40,380
and it will say like
 

307
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,670
and it will say like
a a is against the law B is against the

this code it's like a catch-all do you

316
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:53,339
this code it's like a catch-all do you
 

317
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:54,290
this code it's like a catch-all do you
get it

get it
 

319
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,730
get it
well the golden rule is to catch-all

320
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:58,740

 

321
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,250

00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:17,399
it was like here's a pillow
 

521
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,730
it was like here's a pillow
tuck you in

522
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:21,740

 

523
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,350

and a binky

524
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360

 

525
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,490

but he's yielding he's doing the yield

526
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:31,500
but he's yielding he's doing the yield
 

527
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,310
but he's yielding he's doing the yield
he's doing the yin yield you see the yin

528
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
he's doing the yin yield you see the yin
 

529
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,629
he's doing the yin yield you see the yin
yield into the spiraling geometry

530
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
yield into the spiraling geometry
 

531
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,790
yield into the spiraling geometry
this is an important geometry if you

532
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
this is an important geometry if you
 

533
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,470
this is an important geometry if you
watch the old films of both Sensei

534
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
watch the old films of both Sensei
 

535
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,689
watch the old films of both Sensei
that's all he did this particular one

536
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:44,699
that's all he did this particular one
 

537
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,670
that's all he did this particular one
okay but

538
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:46,680
okay but
 

539
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,910
okay but
if you watch our films where we're doing

540
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
if you watch our films where we're doing
 

541
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,490
if you watch our films where we're doing
anything goes and the guy's punching and

542
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:52,500
anything goes and the guy's punching and
 

543
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,530
anything goes and the guy's punching and
kicking you're gonna watch me do that

544
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:54,540
kicking you're gonna watch me do that
 

545
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,389
kicking you're gonna watch me do that
same Yin yield into the spiraling

546
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
same Yin yield into the spiraling
 

547
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,750
same Yin yield into the spiraling
geometry do you see that because the

548
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
geometry do you see that because the
 

549
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,389
geometry do you see that because the
next thing the guy tries to do is turn

550
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
next thing the guy tries to do is turn
 

551
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,150
next thing the guy tries to do is turn
really sharp into where I'm at and that

552
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,160
really sharp into where I'm at and that
 

553
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:12,050
really sharp into where I'm at and that
takes them into the throws

554
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,060

 

555
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,269

so you just work on this

556
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:14,279
so you just work on this
 

557
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,269
so you just work on this
if you watched on the video again I I

558
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
if you watched on the video again I I
 

559
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,509
if you watched on the video again I I
didn't I I have to teach

560
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:20,519
didn't I I have to teach
 

561
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,210
didn't I I have to teach
the reconciliation of fear to Leah

562
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:23,220
the reconciliation of fear to Leah
 

563
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,370
the reconciliation of fear to Leah
because she's in the dojo

564
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:25,380
because she's in the dojo
 

565
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,069
because she's in the dojo
see

566
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079

 

567
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,090

so I have to bring fear to the technique

568
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:32,100
so I have to bring fear to the technique
 

569
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,269
so I have to bring fear to the technique
the fear we're using here is you're not

570
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
the fear we're using here is you're not
 

571
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,129
the fear we're using here is you're not
in control

572
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:37,139
in control
 

573
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:40,009
in control
it's a great fear it's a primal fear I'm

574
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:40,019
it's a great fear it's a primal fear I'm
 

575
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,750
it's a great fear it's a primal fear I'm
not in control

576
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:41,760
not in control
 

577
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,150
not in control
fear of falling is another Primal Fear

578
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,160

 

579
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,210

so I combined the two

580
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:50,220
so I combined the two
 

581
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,210
so I combined the two
you're coming forward do you see and you

582
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:53,220
you're coming forward do you see and you
 

583
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,030
you're coming forward do you see and you
you you no matter what you want you

584
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,040
you you no matter what you want you
 

585
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,490
you you no matter what you want you
somehow going to you are going to load

586
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:58,500
somehow going to you are going to load
 

587
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,069
somehow going to you are going to load
yourself on my hip even though you don't

588
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:01,079
yourself on my hip even though you don't
 

589
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,769
yourself on my hip even though you don't
want to look I don't want to why am I on

590
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:03,779
want to look I don't want to why am I on
 

591
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:04,850
want to look I don't want to why am I on
your hip

592
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:04,860
your hip
 

593
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,069
your hip
okay

594
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079

 

595
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,470

right it's again go back to the vampires

596
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
right it's again go back to the vampires
 

597
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,389
right it's again go back to the vampires
like the woman that invites the vampire

598
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
like the woman that invites the vampire
 

599
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,009
like the woman that invites the vampire
into the house or in the audience you're

600
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:16,019
into the house or in the audience you're
 

601
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,569
into the house or in the audience you're
like why'd you wipe the vampire in the

602
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:17,579
like why'd you wipe the vampire in the
 

603
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,189
like why'd you wipe the vampire in the
house you can only go waiting if you

604
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:19,199
house you can only go waiting if you
 

605
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,389
house you can only go waiting if you
invite him

606
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:23,399

 

607
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,550

so I don't want to go on the hip [\h__\h]

608
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:25,560
so I don't want to go on the hip [\h__\h]
 

609
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,110
so I don't want to go on the hip [\h__\h]
I'm on the hip

610
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
I'm on the hip
 

611
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,090
I'm on the hip
do you see

612
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,100
do you see
 

613
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,329
do you see
that's enough to generate the fear that

614
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:32,339
that's enough to generate the fear that
 

615
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,550
that's enough to generate the fear that
now lets her practice on acceptance

616
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
now lets her practice on acceptance
 

617
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,009
now lets her practice on acceptance
release of ego

618
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:37,019
release of ego
 

619
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,050
release of ego
okay

620
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:39,060
okay
 

621
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,150
okay
but you've seen me lift and you've seen

622
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,160
but you've seen me lift and you've seen
 

623
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,090
but you've seen me lift and you've seen
me thrown Ronin and Taylor and this is

624
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:44,100
me thrown Ronin and Taylor and this is
 

625
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,829
me thrown Ronin and Taylor and this is
not was I chucking her no it was a very

626
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:47,839
not was I chucking her no it was a very
 

627
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,249
not was I chucking her no it was a very
very gentle throw do you see so I'm not

628
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:52,259
very gentle throw do you see so I'm not
 

629
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,970
very gentle throw do you see so I'm not
going hey you're my Dashie

630
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:55,980
going hey you're my Dashie
 

631
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,230
going hey you're my Dashie
[\h__\h] off

632
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:57,240
[\h__\h] off
 

633
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,990
[\h__\h] off
do you get it this this is the place to

634
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
do you get it this this is the place to
 

635
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,850
do you get it this this is the place to
work on food

636
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:01,860
work on food
 

637
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:08,150
work on food
right it's enough do what you can

638
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,160

 

639
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,590

got it all right

640
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:12,600

 

641
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,289

but in this way it's very confusion

642
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:15,299
but in this way it's very confusion
 

643
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,049
but in this way it's very confusion
because you do what you can and you do

644
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:18,059
because you do what you can and you do
 

645
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,750
because you do what you can and you do
what you can you don't say you don't do

646
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:20,760
what you can you don't say you don't do
 

647
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,470
what you can you don't say you don't do
that because I can't that's very woke

648
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
that because I can't that's very woke
 

649
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,710
that because I can't that's very woke
which is the opposite of confusion Bruto

650
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:27,720
which is the opposite of confusion Bruto
 

651
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,470
which is the opposite of confusion Bruto
has a confusion element to it do you see

652
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
has a confusion element to it do you see
 

653
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,030
has a confusion element to it do you see
so you do

654
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,040
so you do
 

655
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,250
so you do
and you do

656
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:34,260
and you do
 

657
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:41,630
and you do
okay

658
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:41,640

 

659
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,890

but remember here remember

660
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:48,900

 

661
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,409

obviously to me fighting is important I

662
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:51,419
obviously to me fighting is important I
 

663
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,330
obviously to me fighting is important I
have a job I better know how to fight

664
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:53,340
have a job I better know how to fight
 

665
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,850
have a job I better know how to fight
right but it can't it's not what's

666
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:55,860
right but it can't it's not what's
 

667
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:02,690
right but it can't it's not what's
motivating me you can't motivate me

668
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:02,700

 

669
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,150

because even when I do the job what's

670
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,160
because even when I do the job what's
 

671
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,090
because even when I do the job what's
the whole point of the patrol strategy

672
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,100
the whole point of the patrol strategy
 

673
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,010
the whole point of the patrol strategy
get enough

674
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,020
get enough
 

675
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,250
get enough
[\h__\h] do you see that

676
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:12,260
[\h__\h] do you see that
 

677
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,810
[\h__\h] do you see that
there's no way it's going to motivate me

678
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:14,820
there's no way it's going to motivate me
 

679
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,870
there's no way it's going to motivate me
here and there's no way uh technical

680
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:17,880
here and there's no way uh technical
 

681
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:26,570
here and there's no way uh technical
Artistry is going to motivate me

682
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:26,580

 

683
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:32,630

right it's not it's not going to happen

684
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640

 

685
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,370
