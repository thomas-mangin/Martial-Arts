see this this needs to change shape
 

81
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,070
see this this needs to change shape
right that's exactly what we're trying

82
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,080
right that's exactly what we're trying

pushing if he wasn't pushing you'd see

146
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
pushing if he wasn't pushing you'd see
 

147
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,710
pushing if he wasn't pushing you'd see
that you're pulling on the

148

fingers
 

151
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,350
fingers
so everything has to move at the same

152
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
so everything has to move at the same
 

153
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,430
so everything has to move at the same
time but they're different rates they

154
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
time but they're different rates they
 

155
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,590
time but they're different rates they
have to stay in harmony so the qua does

156
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:56,600
have to stay in harmony so the qua does
 

157
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,990
have to stay in harmony so the qua does
move the elbow you see qua moves elbow

158
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
move the elbow you see qua moves elbow
 

159
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,790
move the elbow you see qua moves elbow
not my hand quaw moves the elbow if you

160
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:03,800
not my hand quaw moves the elbow if you
 

161
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,270
not my hand quaw moves the elbow if you
pay attention the elbow's in line with

162
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:06,280
pay attention the elbow's in line with
 

163
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,629
pay attention the elbow's in line with
the shoulder do you see if you move your

164
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
the shoulder do you see if you move your
 

165
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,590
the shoulder do you see if you move your
hand the elbow's not in the line with

166
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:10,600
hand the elbow's not in the line with
 

167
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,710
hand the elbow's not in the line with
the shoulder it came in and it smashed

168
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
the shoulder it came in and it smashed
 

169
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,390
the shoulder it came in and it smashed
here against my body so qua moves the

170
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:17,400
here against my body so qua moves the
 

171
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,189
here against my body so qua moves the
elbow but what drops the elbow is that

172
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:20,199
elbow but what drops the elbow is that
 

173
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,309
elbow but what drops the elbow is that
the hand comes up you see if you leave

174
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:23,319
the hand comes up you see if you leave
 

175
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,469
the hand comes up you see if you leave
your if you just go here the elbow stays

176
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:25,479
your if you just go here the elbow stays
 

177
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,590
your if you just go here the elbow stays
higher than the hand so the elbow

178
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
higher than the hand so the elbow
 

179
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,830
higher than the hand so the elbow
doesn't drop so the hand has to come up

180
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:30,840
doesn't drop so the hand has to come up

on the thumb got it I turn the circle

220
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
on the thumb got it I turn the circle
 

221
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,950
on the thumb got it I turn the circle
turn the

222
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
turn the
 

223
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,189
turn the
circle turn the

224
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:44,199
circle turn the
 

225
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,150
circle turn the
circle what do I what's the engine of

226
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,160
circle what do I what's the engine of
 

227
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,110
circle what do I what's the engine of
the rotation the claw it's done that's

228
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,120
the rotation the claw it's done that's
 

229
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,150
the rotation the claw it's done that's
all I can move don't start seeking more

233
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,430

so I feel the circle I move inside the

234
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:06,440
so I feel the circle I move inside the
 

235
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:20,469
so I feel the circle I move inside the
circle no

236
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479

 

237
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,029

here okay try it

238
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:24,039
here okay try it
 

239
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,629
here okay try it
again just as there's an under turn so

240
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:27,639
again just as there's an under turn so

if you have this flat wrist through the
the whole time there's that would be

244
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:32,360
the whole time there's that would be
 

245
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,869
the whole time there's that would be
under you didn't do it nap okay there's

265
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,390
you see okay I go I go to here there's
tension all through here that's too far

266
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:13,400
tension all through here that's too far
 

267
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,710
tension all through here that's too far
so you can see the elbow came down

268
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:15,720
so you can see the elbow came down
 

269
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,510
so you can see the elbow came down
though compared to the hand so I come

270
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520

 

271
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,710

back so there's no

272
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:23,720
back so there's no
 

273
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,309
back so there's no
tension I don't have it flat the elbows

274
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:27,319
tension I don't have it flat the elbows
 

275
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,990
tension I don't have it flat the elbows
down Okay so

276
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000

down Okay so
don't don't look for more in them by

278
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:35,399
don't don't look for more in them by
 

279
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,269
don't don't look for more in them by
going like

280
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:38,279

 

281
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:45,190

this remember gon is

282
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200

 

283
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,670

from I don't want to get into it but

284
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
from I don't want to get into it but
 

285
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,670
from I don't want to get into it but
there chakra systems so the one in the

286
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
there chakra systems so the one in the
 

287
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,350
there chakra systems so the one in the
pelvis to the one at your hard diaphragm

288
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:56,360
pelvis to the one at your hard diaphragm
 

289
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,790
pelvis to the one at your hard diaphragm
okay that's that's get done

290
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
okay that's that's get done
 

291
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,069
okay that's that's get done
so when I hit that area you see that's

292
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:05,079
so when I hit that area you see that's
 

293
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,710
so when I hit that area you see that's
where it stops I start going past that

294
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
where it stops I start going past that
 

295
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,110
where it stops I start going past that
the elbow is now independent of the qua

296
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120

fingers this is this is too high you're
 

301
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,829
fingers this is this is too high you're
asking for the wrong T remember it

302
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
asking for the wrong T remember it
 

303
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,350
asking for the wrong T remember it

go so now he's pushing he's pushing with
 

317
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,190
go so now he's pushing he's pushing with
spinal displacement okay he's pushing

318
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,200
spinal displacement okay he's pushing
 

319
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,670
spinal displacement okay he's pushing
and I do the

320
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
and I do the
 

321
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,949
