00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
when i was doing tournaments it was
 

335
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,110
when i was doing tournaments it was
worth four points i don't know if it's

336
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
worth four points i don't know if it's
 

337
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,390
worth four points i don't know if it's
still worth four points but

338
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
still worth four points but
 

339
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,310
still worth four points but
so this is this is top position okay now

340
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
so this is this is top position okay now
 

341
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,670
so this is this is top position okay now
this top position

342
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
this top position
 

343
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,390
this top position
is a good position to have because the

344
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
is a good position to have because the
 

345
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,310
is a good position to have because the
weight the major part of josh's weight

346
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
weight the major part of josh's weight
 

347
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,870
weight the major part of josh's weight
is sitting

348
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
is sitting
 

349
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,150
is sitting
on maya's core right maya's legs are

350
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
on maya's core right maya's legs are
 

351
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,550
on maya's core right maya's legs are
locked out behind josh it's really hard

352
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
locked out behind josh it's really hard
 

353
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,469
locked out behind josh it's really hard
for maya to get her legs involved in

354
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
for maya to get her legs involved in
 

355
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,670
for maya to get her legs involved in
josh right so

356
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
josh right so
 

357
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,710
josh right so
she could push against the ground she

358
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
she could push against the ground she
 

359
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,070
she could push against the ground she
might be able to nudge him forward with

360
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
might be able to nudge him forward with
 

361
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,790
might be able to nudge him forward with
her legs but

362
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
her legs but
 

363
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,629
her legs but
really she's probably not gonna like in

364
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
really she's probably not gonna like in
 

365
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,310
really she's probably not gonna like in
a movie whip her legs around his head

366
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
a movie whip her legs around his head
 

367
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,510
a movie whip her legs around his head
and pull him down or something that's

368
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
and pull him down or something that's
 

369
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,110
and pull him down or something that's
probably not gonna happen

370
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
probably not gonna happen
 

371
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,189
probably not gonna happen
so this is a really good pin the only

372
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
so this is a really good pin the only
 

373
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,790
so this is a really good pin the only
thing josh kind of has to deal with is

374
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
thing josh kind of has to deal with is
 

375
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,749
thing josh kind of has to deal with is
her arms a little bit

376
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
her arms a little bit
 

377
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,670
her arms a little bit
arm's relatively weak in this situation

378
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
arm's relatively weak in this situation
 

379
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,469
arm's relatively weak in this situation
so pretty pretty good pin for josh okay

380
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
so pretty pretty good pin for josh okay
 

381
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,150
so pretty pretty good pin for josh okay
so um if maya were to move from this

382
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
so um if maya were to move from this
 

383
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,550
so um if maya were to move from this
position just move around a little bit

384
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
position just move around a little bit
 

385
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,550
position just move around a little bit
okay josh can kind of stay with her and

386
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
okay josh can kind of stay with her and
 

387
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,749
okay josh can kind of stay with her and
she's not trying too hard and he's not

388
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
she's not trying too hard and he's not
 

389
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,110
she's not trying too hard and he's not
trying too hard right now because

390
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
trying too hard right now because
 

391
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,230
trying too hard right now because
they do this and in fact we're going to

392
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
they do this and in fact we're going to
 

393
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,070
they do this and in fact we're going to
see this in just a second okay so what

394
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
see this in just a second okay so what
 

395
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,189
see this in just a second okay so what
we're going to do next you guys can go

396
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
we're going to do next you guys can go
 

397
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,790
we're going to do next you guys can go
ahead and stand up

398
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
ahead and stand up
 

399
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,710
ahead and stand up
all right so what we're going to do next

400
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
all right so what we're going to do next
 

401
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,310
all right so what we're going to do next
is we're going to

402
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
is we're going to
 

403
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,310
is we're going to
run a simulation with these guys and we

404
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
run a simulation with these guys and we
 

405
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,990
run a simulation with these guys and we
put maya in the echo pin and we're going

406
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
put maya in the echo pin and we're going
 

407
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,710
put maya in the echo pin and we're going
to run it for

408
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
to run it for
 

409
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,230
to run it for
for 30 seconds and we're going to see

410
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
for 30 seconds and we're going to see
 

411
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,150
for 30 seconds and we're going to see
how many times maya can escape josh's

412
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
how many times maya can escape josh's
 

413
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,870
how many times maya can escape josh's
pin

414
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
pin
 

415
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,950
pin
from an equal position then we're going

416
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
from an equal position then we're going
 

417
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,550
from an equal position then we're going
to have josh getting top mount

418
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
to have josh getting top mount
 

419
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,830
to have josh getting top mount
we're going to have maya try and escape

420
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
we're going to have maya try and escape
 

421
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,350
we're going to have maya try and escape
top mount for 30 seconds and we're going

422
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
top mount for 30 seconds and we're going
 

423
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,870
top mount for 30 seconds and we're going
to see how how many times she can get

424
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
to see how how many times she can get
 

425
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,270
to see how how many times she can get
that

426
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
that
 

427
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,950
that
now understand these two are about the

428
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
now understand these two are about the
 

429
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,790
now understand these two are about the
same size right so

430
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
same size right so
 

431
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,390
same size right so
not a big difference in size here josh

432
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
not a big difference in size here josh
 

433
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,510
not a big difference in size here josh
has been doing it a little longer than

434
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
has been doing it a little longer than
 

435
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,150
has been doing it a little longer than
maya but

436
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
maya but
 

437
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,550
maya but
my's been doing time too right so it's

438
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
my's been doing time too right so it's
 

439
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,150
my's been doing time too right so it's
not like she's way out class or

440
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
not like she's way out class or
 

441
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,790
not like she's way out class or
something

442
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
something
 

443
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,309
something
technically so this is going to be a

444
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
technically so this is going to be a
 

445
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,309
technically so this is going to be a
pretty fair matchup between these two

446
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
pretty fair matchup between these two
 

447
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,830
pretty fair matchup between these two
now when you watch this you might say

448
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
now when you watch this you might say
 

449
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,990
now when you watch this you might say
oh but an expert and an expert and it's

450
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
oh but an expert and an expert and it's
 

451
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,510
oh but an expert and an expert and it's
like we're not talking about the elite

452
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
like we're not talking about the elite
 

453
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,790
like we're not talking about the elite
level guys we're just talking about

454
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
level guys we're just talking about
 

455
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,309
level guys we're just talking about
regular people who have some training in

456
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
regular people who have some training in
 

457
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,830
regular people who have some training in
ground grappling and regular people have

458
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
ground grappling and regular people have
 

459
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,350
ground grappling and regular people have
some training in aikido and what would

460
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
some training in aikido and what would
 

461
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,710
some training in aikido and what would
that look like so let's check this

462
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
that look like so let's check this
 

463
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:52,180
that look like so let's check this
scenario out

464
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,190

 

465
00:06:52,190 --> 00:07:16,370

[Music]

466
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:16,380

[Music]

470
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199

 

471
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,790

okay all right so that is a comparison

472
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
okay all right so that is a comparison
 

473
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,589
okay all right so that is a comparison
of those two

474
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
of those two
 

475
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,430
of those two
same people doing uh an ekyo style pin

476
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
same people doing uh an ekyo style pin
 

477
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,710
same people doing uh an ekyo style pin
and a brazilian jitsu style pin which is

478
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
and a brazilian jitsu style pin which is
 

479
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,070
and a brazilian jitsu style pin which is
the top mount

480
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
the top mount
 

481
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,869
the top mount
and how easy they are to escape from i.e

482
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
and how easy they are to escape from i.e
 

483
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,550
and how easy they are to escape from i.e
how secure they are so

484
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
how secure they are so
 

485
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,390
how secure they are so
security versus autonomy is going to be

486
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
security versus autonomy is going to be
 

487
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,909
security versus autonomy is going to be
one of the big things we talk about in

488
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
one of the big things we talk about in
 

489
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,909
one of the big things we talk about in
aikido versus brazilian jiu jitsu stuff

490
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
aikido versus brazilian jiu jitsu stuff
 

491
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,189
aikido versus brazilian jiu jitsu stuff
so when we're talking about aikido's

492
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
so when we're talking about aikido's
 

493
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,950
so when we're talking about aikido's
ground game how did aikido's pin

494
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
ground game how did aikido's pin
 

495
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,270
ground game how did aikido's pin
looked compared to brazilian jiu jitsu's

496
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
looked compared to brazilian jiu jitsu's
 

497
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,629
looked compared to brazilian jiu jitsu's

00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
and everybody can draw their own
 

499
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,510
and everybody can draw their own
conclusion

500
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
conclusion
 

501
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,749
conclusion
for me personally the eco looks like

502
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
for me personally the eco looks like
 

503
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,629
for me personally the eco looks like
it's not even

504
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
it's not even
 

505
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,710
it's not even
a quarter as secure as the top mount

506
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
a quarter as secure as the top mount
 

507
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,550
a quarter as secure as the top mount
does the top mount looks good

508
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
does the top mount looks good
 

509
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,390
does the top mount looks good
so that's how that looks let's look at

510
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
so that's how that looks let's look at
 

511
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,390
so that's how that looks let's look at
this situation exact same drill

512
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
this situation exact same drill
 

513
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,869
this situation exact same drill
except both of these guys are going or

514
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
except both of these guys are going or
 

515
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,070
except both of these guys are going or
one of these guys is going to be armed

516
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
one of these guys is going to be armed
 

517
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,430
one of these guys is going to be armed
so the person who's

518
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
so the person who's
 

519
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,749
so the person who's
in the pinned position will be armed and

520
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
in the pinned position will be armed and
 

521
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,589
in the pinned position will be armed and
we'll see how that plays out from both

522
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
we'll see how that plays out from both
 

523
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,550
we'll see how that plays out from both
the eco

524

the eco
 

525
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:46,060

okay so that's how both the top mount

538
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
okay so that's how both the top mount
 

539
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,790
okay so that's how both the top mount
and the eco pin look when someone's

540
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
and the eco pin look when someone's
 

541
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,509
and the eco pin look when someone's
armed

542
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
armed
 

543
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,590
armed
now we can start to kind of think about

544
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
now we can start to kind of think about
 

545
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,150
now we can start to kind of think about
how different that looks right so

546
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
how different that looks right so
 

547
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,190
how different that looks right so
notice that when maya had the

548
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,200
notice that when maya had the
 

549
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,710
notice that when maya had the
knife in the top mount she was able to

550
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
knife in the top mount she was able to
 

551
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,430
knife in the top mount she was able to
usually get a couple good quick stabs in

552
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
usually get a couple good quick stabs in
 

553
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,910
usually get a couple good quick stabs in
right away so if that position was

554
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
right away so if that position was
 

555
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,670
right away so if that position was
obtained without having control the

556
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
obtained without having control the
 

557
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,350
obtained without having control the
knife so meaning the knife came out or

558
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
knife so meaning the knife came out or
 

559
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,790
knife so meaning the knife came out or
the person doing brazilian jitsu didn't

560
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
the person doing brazilian jitsu didn't
 

561
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,070
the person doing brazilian jitsu didn't
know that the knife was out

562
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
know that the knife was out
 

563
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,590
know that the knife was out
then she's probably going to get that

564
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
then she's probably going to get that
 

565
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,710
then she's probably going to get that
one stab you saw that pretty

566
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
one stab you saw that pretty
 

567
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,230
one stab you saw that pretty
consistently even when josh knew that

568
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
consistently even when josh knew that
 

569
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,509
consistently even when josh knew that
there was a knife coming at him

570
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
there was a knife coming at him
 

571
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,509
there was a knife coming at him
it's pretty hard to stop that really

572
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
it's pretty hard to stop that really
 

573
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,190
it's pretty hard to stop that really
exciting fast action there

574
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
exciting fast action there
 

575
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,430
exciting fast action there
okay then we also saw what happened when

576
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
okay then we also saw what happened when
 

577
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,430
okay then we also saw what happened when
josh is controlling the arm

578
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
josh is controlling the arm
 

579
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,710
josh is controlling the arm
with the knife right so now this is a

580
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
with the knife right so now this is a
 

581
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,230
with the knife right so now this is a
little bit of an unfair comparison and

582
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
little bit of an unfair comparison and
 

583
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,110
little bit of an unfair comparison and
the problem i have

584
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
the problem i have
 

585
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,550
the problem i have
in combining these drills for you guys

586
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
in combining these drills for you guys
 

587
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,389
in combining these drills for you guys
right now is that they're two different

588
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
right now is that they're two different
 

589
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,590
right now is that they're two different
systems and they look at things

590
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
systems and they look at things
 

591
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,710
systems and they look at things
differently so

592
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
differently so
 

593
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,430
differently so
in order to have that pin we would have

594
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
in order to have that pin we would have
 

595
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,030
in order to have that pin we would have
to already have known there was a knife

596
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
to already have known there was a knife
 

597
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,509
to already have known there was a knife
in play

598
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
in play
 

599
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,509
in play
or at least assumed there was a knife in

600
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
or at least assumed there was a knife in
 

601
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,670
or at least assumed there was a knife in
place so let's say we assumed that there

602
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
place so let's say we assumed that there
 

603
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,630
place so let's say we assumed that there
was a knife in play

604
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
was a knife in play
 

605
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,069
was a knife in play
and so by assuming that there's a knife

606
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
and so by assuming that there's a knife
 

607
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,069
and so by assuming that there's a knife
in play with that we've we've come down

608
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
in play with that we've we've come down
 

609
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,670
in play with that we've we've come down
and controlled that arm and so if there

610
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
and controlled that arm and so if there
 

611
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,389
and controlled that arm and so if there
was a knife

612
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
was a knife
 

613
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,829
was a knife
if it came from the other side you'd be

614
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
if it came from the other side you'd be
 

615
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,190
if it came from the other side you'd be
well ahead of it if it came from this

616
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
well ahead of it if it came from this
 

617
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,829
well ahead of it if it came from this
side

618
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
side
 

619
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,110
side
either it wouldn't or you would already

620
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
either it wouldn't or you would already
 

621
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,030
either it wouldn't or you would already
have it under control so it's a little

622
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
have it under control so it's a little
 

623
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,509
have it under control so it's a little
bit of an

624
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
bit of an
 

625
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,509
bit of an
unfair comparison to compare those two

626
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
unfair comparison to compare those two
 

627
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,750
unfair comparison to compare those two
that way all right but let's see

628
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:51,760
that way all right but let's see
 

629
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,110
that way all right but let's see
how that looks with autonomy so

630
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
how that looks with autonomy so
 

631
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,350
how that looks with autonomy so
autonomy and why might autonomy be

632
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
autonomy and why might autonomy be
 

633
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,949
autonomy and why might autonomy be
important in those two drills so

634
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
important in those two drills so
 

635
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,030
important in those two drills so
again we're going to run the eco pin

636
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
again we're going to run the eco pin
 

637
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,230
again we're going to run the eco pin
versus the

638
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
versus the
 

639
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,790
versus the
top mount pin with autonomy being the

640
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
top mount pin with autonomy being the
 

641
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,030
top mount pin with autonomy being the
issue and autonomy just means freedom

642
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
issue and autonomy just means freedom
 

643
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,069
issue and autonomy just means freedom
and aikido doesn't put a premium on

644
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
and aikido doesn't put a premium on
 

645
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,829
and aikido doesn't put a premium on
on security but does put a premium on

646
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
on security but does put a premium on
 

647
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,269
on security but does put a premium on
autonomy so let's see how that looks

648
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
autonomy so let's see how that looks
 

649
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,860
autonomy so let's see how that looks
when we play that

650
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:15,870

667
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,150
situation and now we've seen
top mount versus ikkyo in an a situation

668
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
top mount versus ikkyo in an a situation
 

669
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,509
top mount versus ikkyo in an a situation
where you need to get out of the pin

670
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
where you need to get out of the pin
 

671
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,190
where you need to get out of the pin
right so actually escape the pin

672
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
right so actually escape the pin
 

673
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,350
right so actually escape the pin
now why might that be important well if

674
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,360
now why might that be important well if
 

675
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,190
now why might that be important well if
the guy's got a buddy and you're holding

676
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
the guy's got a buddy and you're holding
 

677
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,190
the guy's got a buddy and you're holding
him down and his buddy comes in

678
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
him down and his buddy comes in
 

679
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,030
him down and his buddy comes in
you're way more likely i mean you can

680
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
you're way more likely i mean you can
 

681
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,470
you're way more likely i mean you can
draw your own conclusions but from my

682
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
draw your own conclusions but from my
 

683
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,030
draw your own conclusions but from my
opinion

684
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
opinion
 

685
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,629
opinion
you're way more likely to get out of

686
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
you're way more likely to get out of
 

687
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,190
you're way more likely to get out of
there safely from an eco-style pen

688
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
there safely from an eco-style pen
 

689
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,310
there safely from an eco-style pen
than you are to get out from a top mount

690
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
than you are to get out from a top mount
 

691
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,269
than you are to get out from a top mount
pin right so

692
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
pin right so
 

693
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,190
pin right so
top mount is more secure no doubt about

694
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
top mount is more secure no doubt about
 

695
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,629
top mount is more secure no doubt about
it in my mind you guys can draw your own

696
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
it in my mind you guys can draw your own
 

697
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,509
it in my mind you guys can draw your own
conclusions we

698
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
conclusions we
 

699
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,509
conclusions we
you saw the drill but in my opinion top

700
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
you saw the drill but in my opinion top
 

701
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,030
you saw the drill but in my opinion top
mount is way more secure if i just

702
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
mount is way more secure if i just
 

703
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,550
mount is way more secure if i just
absolutely want to hold person down

704
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
absolutely want to hold person down
 

705
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,110
absolutely want to hold person down
right so

706
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
right so
 

707
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,030
right so
say i know i'm in numbers right most

708
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
say i know i'm in numbers right most
 

709
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,949
say i know i'm in numbers right most
people in this place are on my side

710
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
people in this place are on my side
 

711
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,389
people in this place are on my side
then top mount is probably going to be a

712
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
then top mount is probably going to be a
 

713
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,829
then top mount is probably going to be a
good way to go as long as i'm stronger

714
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
good way to go as long as i'm stronger
 

715
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,829
good way to go as long as i'm stronger
or more skilled or whatever than the guy

716
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
or more skilled or whatever than the guy
 

717
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,870
or more skilled or whatever than the guy
i'm dealing with

718
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
i'm dealing with
 

719
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,710
i'm dealing with
but if i'm in a situation that's unknown

720
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
but if i'm in a situation that's unknown
 

721
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,310
but if i'm in a situation that's unknown
right so he's got more friends than i

722
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
right so he's got more friends than i
 

723
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,190
right so he's got more friends than i
got

724
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
got
 

725
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,389
got
the last thing i want to try and do is

726
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:36,399
the last thing i want to try and do is
 

727
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,069
the last thing i want to try and do is
that top mount because it's very likely

728
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
that top mount because it's very likely
 

729
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,190
that top mount because it's very likely
his friends are going to

730
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
his friends are going to
 

731
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,629
his friends are going to
intervene there and i'm going to be in a

732
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
intervene there and i'm going to be in a
 

733
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,310
intervene there and i'm going to be in a
bad way and i can't escape the pin

734
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
bad way and i can't escape the pin
 

735
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,069
bad way and i can't escape the pin
whereas with the eco you can't escape

736
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
whereas with the eco you can't escape
 

737
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,430
whereas with the eco you can't escape
and i think that's pretty clear from

738
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:45,440
and i think that's pretty clear from
 

739
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,949
and i think that's pretty clear from
what we saw draw your own conclusions

740
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
what we saw draw your own conclusions
 

741
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:47,590
what we saw draw your own conclusions
but

742
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
but
 

743
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,069
but
and to be fair uh about the top mount

744
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
and to be fair uh about the top mount
 

745
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:50,629
and to be fair uh about the top mount
pin

746
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639

my knees a little messed up right now so

748
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
my knees a little messed up right now so
 

749
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,829
my knees a little messed up right now so
i'm not quite as fast as i should be

750
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
i'm not quite as fast as i should be
 

751
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,710
i'm not quite as fast as i should be
to get on josh but you can see that i

752
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
to get on josh but you can see that i
 

753
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,230
to get on josh but you can see that i
was trying my best to get him and

754
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
was trying my best to get him and
 

755
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,670
was trying my best to get him and
and maya was trying her best to get in

756
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
and maya was trying her best to get in
 

757
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,910
and maya was trying her best to get in
there okay now let's look at

758
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
there okay now let's look at
 

759
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,590
there okay now let's look at
one more situation we're going to look

760
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
one more situation we're going to look
 

761
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,350
one more situation we're going to look
at a couple variations

762
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
at a couple variations
 

763
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,230
at a couple variations
for the armed grappling with josh having

764
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
for the armed grappling with josh having
 

765
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,069
for the armed grappling with josh having
the weapon and one of those variations

766
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
the weapon and one of those variations
 

767
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,110
the weapon and one of those variations
is going to be josh

768
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,120
is going to be josh
 

769
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,910
is going to be josh
having the weapon uh in his belt but

770
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
having the weapon uh in his belt but
 

771
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,590
having the weapon uh in his belt but
doesn't have it drawn so he's choosing

772
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
doesn't have it drawn so he's choosing
 

773
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,470
doesn't have it drawn so he's choosing
the eco pin

774
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
the eco pin
 

775
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,069
the eco pin
but he's got a weapon in his belt that

776
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
but he's got a weapon in his belt that
 

777
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,590
but he's got a weapon in his belt that
he could get to right so this is

778
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
he could get to right so this is
 

779
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,949
he could get to right so this is
a typical law enforcement kind of

780
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
a typical law enforcement kind of
 

781
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,470
a typical law enforcement kind of
situation and more important than that

782
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
situation and more important than that
 

783
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,750
situation and more important than that
for the context of aikido

784
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
for the context of aikido
 

785
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,430
for the context of aikido
typical classical old battlefield

786
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440
typical classical old battlefield
 

787
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,030
typical classical old battlefield
situation where i would have a weapon in

788
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
situation where i would have a weapon in
 

789
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,590
situation where i would have a weapon in
my belt

790
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
my belt
 

791
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,430
my belt
and i'm holding some guy down and they

792
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
and i'm holding some guy down and they
 

793
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,790
and i'm holding some guy down and they
start to give me trouble with that so

794
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
start to give me trouble with that so
 

795
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,910
start to give me trouble with that so
we're going to look at a situation like

796
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920
we're going to look at a situation like
 

797
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,310
we're going to look at a situation like
that

798
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
that
 

799
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,190
that
we're also going to look at the

800
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,200
we're also going to look at the
 

801
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,350
we're also going to look at the
situation if josh already has a weapon

802
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
situation if josh already has a weapon
 

803
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,310
situation if josh already has a weapon
in his hand

804
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
in his hand
 

805
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,990
in his hand
and maya's holding his wrist so she's

806
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000
and maya's holding his wrist so she's
 

807
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,269
and maya's holding his wrist so she's
going to be holding his wrist which

808
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
going to be holding his wrist which
 

809
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,389
going to be holding his wrist which
would essentially be a

810
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:40,399
would essentially be a
 

811
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,230
would essentially be a
yakute dory if they stood up but she'll

812
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
yakute dory if they stood up but she'll
 

813
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,310
yakute dory if they stood up but she'll
be holding his wrist in that echo pin

814
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
be holding his wrist in that echo pin
 

815
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,750
be holding his wrist in that echo pin
and the reason that we might go to that

816
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:45,760
and the reason that we might go to that
 

817
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,990
and the reason that we might go to that
echo pin is because she's holding my

818
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
echo pin is because she's holding my
 

819
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,269
echo pin is because she's holding my
wrist i'm trying to force her down force

820
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
wrist i'm trying to force her down force
 

821
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,629
wrist i'm trying to force her down force
her down force her down so what does

822
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
her down force her down so what does
 

823
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,990
her down force her down so what does
that look like so let's look at these

824
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
that look like so let's look at these
 

825
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,069
that look like so let's look at these
two aikido situations both 30 second

826
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
two aikido situations both 30 second
 

827
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,829
two aikido situations both 30 second
drills and see how it looks when
