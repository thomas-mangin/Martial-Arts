1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,809

okay so the shape of coffee Dosa so

2
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:04,819
okay so the shape of coffee Dosa so
 

3
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:08,089
okay so the shape of coffee Dosa so
kokidosa is a Micro Drone

4
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:08,099
kokidosa is a Micro Drone
 

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,530
kokidosa is a Micro Drone
it's

6
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:09,540
it's
 

7
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,290
it's
it's going to isolate out

8
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:12,300
it's going to isolate out
 

9
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,169
it's going to isolate out
several of the elements that make up

10
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:15,179
several of the elements that make up
 

11
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,810
several of the elements that make up
larger drills quinoa

12
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:17,820
larger drills quinoa
 

13
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,109
larger drills quinoa
okay so you're just going to focus in on

14
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
okay so you're just going to focus in on
 

15
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,650
okay so you're just going to focus in on
a few things that you use all the time

16
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:24,660
a few things that you use all the time
 

17
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,910
a few things that you use all the time
in kihon Wasa okay

18
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:28,920

 

19
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,590

um like any micro drill or any drill

20
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
um like any micro drill or any drill
 

21
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,190
um like any micro drill or any drill
as you get better

22
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:36,200
as you get better
 

23
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,410
as you get better
you can do it any number of ways and you

24
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:39,420
you can do it any number of ways and you
 

25
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,510
you can do it any number of ways and you
should you should not be restricted to

26
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
should you should not be restricted to
 

27
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,030
should you should not be restricted to
the one way okay that's why you have

28
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,040
the one way okay that's why you have
 

29
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,670
the one way okay that's why you have
different levels of training so you'll

30
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:46,680
different levels of training so you'll
 

31
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,709
different levels of training so you'll
have like Q one was a training you'll

32
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
have like Q one was a training you'll
 

33
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,549
have like Q one was a training you'll
have GG was a training for example

34
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
have GG was a training for example
 

35
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,310
have GG was a training for example
but at the beginning level there's a

36
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,320
but at the beginning level there's a
 

37
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,709
but at the beginning level there's a
shape you should have the shape you

38
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:57,719
shape you should have the shape you
 

39
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,389
shape you should have the shape you
should do only that

40
00:00:59,389 --> 00:00:59,399
should do only that
 

41
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,029
should do only that
okay

42
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:02,039

 

43
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,070

um so let's look at the shapes we went

44
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
um so let's look at the shapes we went
 

45
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,210
um so let's look at the shapes we went
over so far one we had the hand shape

46
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,220
over so far one we had the hand shape
 

47
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,750
over so far one we had the hand shape
and we had the arm shape so I'm going to

48
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
and we had the arm shape so I'm going to
 

49
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,609
and we had the arm shape so I'm going to
use the hand shape

50
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:13,619
use the hand shape
 

51
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,929
use the hand shape
and I'm going to only use the arm shapes

52
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:17,939
and I'm going to only use the arm shapes
 

53
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,469
and I'm going to only use the arm shapes
at kihon level

54
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:21,479
at kihon level
 

55
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,990
at kihon level
so some of you here you don't you don't

56
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
so some of you here you don't you don't
 

57
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,170
so some of you here you don't you don't
have that shape yet I wouldn't venture

58
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,180
have that shape yet I wouldn't venture
 

59
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,770
have that shape yet I wouldn't venture
out and start doing whatever

60
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:30,780
out and start doing whatever
 

61
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,890
out and start doing whatever
so I only have the inward spiral and

62
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:33,900
so I only have the inward spiral and
 

63
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,789
so I only have the inward spiral and
then the outward spiral

64
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:37,799
then the outward spiral
 

65
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,550
then the outward spiral
and the art is based in yin yang Theory

66
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
and the art is based in yin yang Theory
 

67
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,190
and the art is based in yin yang Theory
so just as a side note again you don't

68
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
so just as a side note again you don't
 

69
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,050
so just as a side note again you don't
need to know the theory behind anything

70
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,060
need to know the theory behind anything
 

71
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,390
need to know the theory behind anything
to do the shape

72
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:47,400
to do the shape
 

73
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,889
to do the shape
but one hand is going to be young and

74
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:51,899
but one hand is going to be young and
 

75
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,530
but one hand is going to be young and
one hand is going to be Yin

76
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:54,540
one hand is going to be Yin
 

77
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,850
one hand is going to be Yin
and by concentric extension one hand is

78
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:58,860
and by concentric extension one hand is
 

79
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,810
and by concentric extension one hand is
doing I key one hand is doing Coq the

80
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:02,820
doing I key one hand is doing Coq the
 

81
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,929
doing I key one hand is doing Coq the
yin hand does I key and the young hand

82
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:05,939
yin hand does I key and the young hand
 

83
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:11,690
yin hand does I key and the young hand
does coke you

84
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:11,700

 

85
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,589

just as in the in the symbol there is a

86
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
just as in the in the symbol there is a
 

87
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,830
just as in the in the symbol there is a
little of its opposite in its field so

88
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:18,840
little of its opposite in its field so
 

89
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,710
little of its opposite in its field so
the ike hand the yin hand has a little

90
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:21,720
the ike hand the yin hand has a little
 

91
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,350
the ike hand the yin hand has a little
Coq

92
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,360
Coq
 

93
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,010
Coq
and the Coq hand the young hand has a

94
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,020
and the Coq hand the young hand has a
 

95
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,890
and the Coq hand the young hand has a
little eye key

96
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:30,900

 

97
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,589

remember the young hand is the is the

98
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
remember the young hand is the is the
 

99
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,350
remember the young hand is the is the
inward pattern and the yin hand is the

100
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,360
inward pattern and the yin hand is the
 

101
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,050
inward pattern and the yin hand is the
outward pattern

102
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:39,060
outward pattern
 

103
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,970
outward pattern
so we're going to use the hand shape the

104
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:40,980
so we're going to use the hand shape the
 

105
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,449
so we're going to use the hand shape the
arm shape as in this drill

106
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:44,459
arm shape as in this drill
 

107
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,449
arm shape as in this drill
now we'll introduce the next basic thing

108
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:47,459
now we'll introduce the next basic thing
 

109
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,009
now we'll introduce the next basic thing
you always want

110
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:49,019
you always want
 

111
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,369
you always want
and that is uh kazushi

112
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:52,379
and that is uh kazushi
 

113
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:55,630
and that is uh kazushi
now kazushi

114
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:55,640
now kazushi
 

115
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,130
now kazushi
in aikida is a particular thing at

116
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,140
in aikida is a particular thing at
 

117
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,850
in aikida is a particular thing at
kihonawaza yes it is a disequilibrium in

118
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:04,860
kihonawaza yes it is a disequilibrium in
 

119
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,890
kihonawaza yes it is a disequilibrium in
their balance yes

120
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:06,900
their balance yes
 

121
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,930
their balance yes
but because you have a specific arm

122
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:11,940
but because you have a specific arm
 

123
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,649
but because you have a specific arm
shape a specific waza shape uh we

124
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:15,659
shape a specific waza shape uh we
 

125
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,770
shape a specific waza shape uh we
mentioned that it is always going to be

126
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:18,780
mentioned that it is always going to be
 

127
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,530
mentioned that it is always going to be
a tilt of their spine

128
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:21,540
a tilt of their spine
 

129
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,750
a tilt of their spine
it will never be

130
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
it will never be
 

131
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,050
it will never be
uh their spine leaning forward leaning

132
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:27,060
uh their spine leaning forward leaning
 

133
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,250
uh their spine leaning forward leaning
backwards or crunching

134
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:30,260
backwards or crunching
 

135
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,710
backwards or crunching
is that a disequilibrium yes but not

136
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:33,720
is that a disequilibrium yes but not
 

137
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,110
is that a disequilibrium yes but not
it's not the one we want in kihon Wasa

138
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,120
it's not the one we want in kihon Wasa
 

139
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,390
it's not the one we want in kihon Wasa
they're always going to tilt they're

140
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
they're always going to tilt they're
 

141
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,649
they're always going to tilt they're
always going to tilt okay they can tilt

142
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:42,659
always going to tilt okay they can tilt
 

143
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,890
always going to tilt okay they can tilt
to the front corner the front corner the

144
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:45,900
to the front corner the front corner the
 

145
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,530
to the front corner the front corner the
back corner or the back corner that's

146
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:48,540
back corner or the back corner that's
 

147
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,990
back corner or the back corner that's
where you're always going to go okay so

148
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,000
where you're always going to go okay so
 

149
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,670
where you're always going to go okay so
you want to look for that in your

150
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:52,680
you want to look for that in your
 

151
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,789
you want to look for that in your
kokudosa so for you here some of you

152
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:55,799
kokudosa so for you here some of you
 

153
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,089
kokudosa so for you here some of you
never get the Tilt in the person okay

154
00:03:59,089 --> 00:03:59,099
never get the Tilt in the person okay
 

155
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,490
never get the Tilt in the person okay
all right

156
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:01,500
all right
 

157
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,410
all right
so

158
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:03,420
so
 

159
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,530
so
we'll go this way will be my young hand

160
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:06,540
we'll go this way will be my young hand
 

161
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,570
we'll go this way will be my young hand
which again is the inward spiral

162
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:11,580

 

163
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,550

this one's the yin head

164
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:13,560
this one's the yin head
 

165
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,770
this one's the yin head
so last video

166
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:15,780
so last video
 

167
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,650
so last video
we did a drill from here

168
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:18,660
we did a drill from here
 

169
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,069
we did a drill from here
immersed spiral and we came back and we

170
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
immersed spiral and we came back and we
 

171
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,249
immersed spiral and we came back and we
did the outward spiral okay

172
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:25,259
did the outward spiral okay
 

173
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,870
did the outward spiral okay
one more time

174
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
one more time
 

175
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,330
one more time
inward

176
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:29,340
inward
 

177
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,710
inward
outward

178
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:33,720

 

179
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,409

so that grid on my chest will still

180
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:36,419
so that grid on my chest will still
 

181
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:37,550
so that grid on my chest will still
apply

182
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:37,560
apply
 

183
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,129
apply
my elbow never goes outside that

184
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:40,139
my elbow never goes outside that
 

185
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,870
my elbow never goes outside that
shoulder line

186
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:41,880
shoulder line
 

187
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,310
shoulder line
stays in and it's going to pass that mid

188
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
stays in and it's going to pass that mid
 

189
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,530
stays in and it's going to pass that mid
chest line

190
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:48,540
chest line
 

191
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,749
chest line
come to the Midway point the elbow

192
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
come to the Midway point the elbow
 

193
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,050
come to the Midway point the elbow
and I use my body

194
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,060
and I use my body
 

195
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,490
and I use my body
and it comes back

196
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:01,500

 

197
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,090

that long line that shoulder line comes

198
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,100
that long line that shoulder line comes
 

199
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,570
that long line that shoulder line comes
down midline

200
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:08,580

 

201
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,770

midline here on my elbow and then

202
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:12,780
midline here on my elbow and then
 

203
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,090
midline here on my elbow and then
out

204
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,100

 

205
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,170

so in kokidosa that's the young hand

206
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:21,180
so in kokidosa that's the young hand
 

207
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,590
so in kokidosa that's the young hand
young hand boom

208
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:24,600
young hand boom
 

209
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,290
young hand boom
if we look at kazushi and we look at her

210
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:27,300
if we look at kazushi and we look at her
 

211
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,930
if we look at kazushi and we look at her
spine I'm going to tilt it

212
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:32,940

 

213
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,090

the in hand

214
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,100
the in hand
 

215
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,450
the in hand
the yin hand is going to

216
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:38,460
the yin hand is going to
 

217
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,210
the yin hand is going to
go inside

218
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:41,220
go inside
 

219
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,450
go inside
so my elbow is going to come in

220
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:44,460
so my elbow is going to come in
 

221
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,550
so my elbow is going to come in
and then on the outside

222
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
and then on the outside
 

223
00:05:46,560 --> 00:06:09,110
and then on the outside
and then yield

224
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120

 

225
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,510

you can see again it's going to tilt her

226
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
you can see again it's going to tilt her
 

227
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,110
you can see again it's going to tilt her
spine

228
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120

 

229
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,430

what I don't want is two young hands

230
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
what I don't want is two young hands
 

231
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,610
what I don't want is two young hands
you see you see that she's she let stay

232
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:22,620
you see you see that she's she let stay
 

233
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,529
you see you see that she's she let stay
there but let go she's perfectly

234
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:24,539
there but let go she's perfectly
 

235
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:28,249
there but let go she's perfectly
balanced okay

236
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:28,259

 

237
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,270

so at the same time this hand goes

238
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,280
so at the same time this hand goes
 

239
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:42,950
so at the same time this hand goes
Yang the sound goes Yin

240
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960

 

241
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,670

don't I'm not doing this

242
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:46,680
don't I'm not doing this
 

243
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,790
don't I'm not doing this
there's a spiral

244
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
there's a spiral
 

245
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,230
there's a spiral
in my hands

246
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:53,240

 

247
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,990

I am still working the patterns

248
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,000
I am still working the patterns
 

249
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,110
I am still working the patterns
so kokudosa

250
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,120
so kokudosa
 

251
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,110
so kokudosa
is just this drill

252
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
is just this drill
 

253
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,990
is just this drill
that we did

254
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,000

 

255
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,110

from yote working the two hands at the

256
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,120
from yote working the two hands at the
 

257
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:20,270
from yote working the two hands at the
same time

258
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,280

 

259
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,189

Okay so

260
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:22,199
Okay so
 

261
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,830
Okay so
Yong Yin tilt

262
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840

 

263
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,110

okay so we had a question here it's it's

264
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,120
okay so we had a question here it's it's
 

265
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,029
okay so we had a question here it's it's
a common question

266
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:32,039
a common question
 

267
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,610
a common question
um it goes back to the first video I

268
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:34,620
um it goes back to the first video I
 

269
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,070
um it goes back to the first video I
only have these two shapes I only have

270
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,080
only have these two shapes I only have
 

271
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,330
only have these two shapes I only have
the the uh Yang or the fire hand and the

272
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:41,340
the the uh Yang or the fire hand and the
 

273
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,309
the the uh Yang or the fire hand and the
water and the yin hand that's all I have

um
 

287
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:02,510
um
I get what I want with those vectors

288
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:02,520
I get what I want with those vectors
 

289
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,210
I get what I want with those vectors
by doing different things with my body

290
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:05,220
by doing different things with my body
 

291
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,309
by doing different things with my body
at different times okay so for example

292
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
at different times okay so for example
 

293
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,230
at different times okay so for example
the yin hand is the outward spiral

294
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:15,240
the yin hand is the outward spiral
 

295
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,150
the yin hand is the outward spiral
of of this drill you see

296
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160

 

297
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,029

there it's clearly obvious what I was

298
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
there it's clearly obvious what I was
 

299
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,010
there it's clearly obvious what I was
doing because you're thinking

300
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,020
doing because you're thinking
 

301
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,830
doing because you're thinking
two-dimensionally and there you go Coke

302
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
two-dimensionally and there you go Coke
 

303
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,809
two-dimensionally and there you go Coke
you whole okay

304
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:29,819
you whole okay
 

305
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,870
you whole okay
but you can make the pattern uh you can

306
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
but you can make the pattern uh you can
 

307
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,170
but you can make the pattern uh you can
shrink it you can have a a big heart so

308
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:36,180
shrink it you can have a a big heart so
 

309
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,209
shrink it you can have a a big heart so
a big heart

310
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:38,219
a big heart
 

311
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,370
a big heart
well you can have a little heart

312
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:40,380
well you can have a little heart
 

313
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,630
well you can have a little heart
okay

314
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:41,640
okay
 

315
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,150
okay
and if I don't stay in this plane

316
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,160
and if I don't stay in this plane
 

317
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,490
and if I don't stay in this plane
I can achieve different things with this

318
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:49,500
I can achieve different things with this
 

319
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,470
I can achieve different things with this
okay so as I move my body you see

320
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
okay so as I move my body you see
 

321
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,530
okay so as I move my body you see
and I make a small heart

322
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:57,540
and I make a small heart
 

323
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,430
and I make a small heart
boom here imagine her little head down

324
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
boom here imagine her little head down
 

325
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,810
boom here imagine her little head down
low

326
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:02,820
low
 

327
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,269
low
over here you see there's your cookie

328
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
over here you see there's your cookie

331
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,070

if I do a little heart move my body

332
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,080
if I do a little heart move my body
 

333
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,190
if I do a little heart move my body
it's duplicating

334
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,200
it's duplicating
 

335
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,769
it's duplicating
what appears to be a straight line

336
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:18,779
what appears to be a straight line
 

337
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,949
what appears to be a straight line
so we'll do it on this side okay so I'm

338
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:21,959
so we'll do it on this side okay so I'm
 

339
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,070
so we'll do it on this side okay so I'm
going to move my body

340
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,080
going to move my body
 

341
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,690
going to move my body
and

342
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:26,700
and
 

343
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,870
and
move my body

344
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:29,880

 

345
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,509

so if you watch my shoulder as a

346
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:32,519
so if you watch my shoulder as a
 

347
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,850
so if you watch my shoulder as a
reference point or you can watch my

348
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:34,860
reference point or you can watch my
 

349
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,110
reference point or you can watch my
chest

350
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,120
chest
 

351
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:45,530
chest
or my center it's going to rotate

352
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:45,540

 

353
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,190

that is important because I don't make

354
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
that is important because I don't make
 

355
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,630
that is important because I don't make
my hand go out like this and back which

356
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:53,640
my hand go out like this and back which
 

357
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,509
my hand go out like this and back which
you do by leaving your shoulder in place

358
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:56,519
you do by leaving your shoulder in place
 

359
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,449
you do by leaving your shoulder in place
so my shoulders in place my arms going

360
00:09:59,449 --> 00:09:59,459
so my shoulders in place my arms going
 

361
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,090
so my shoulders in place my arms going
out and my hands are back

362
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,100
out and my hands are back
 

363
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,610
out and my hands are back
that's gonna work your outer and rear

364
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:04,620
that's gonna work your outer and rear
 

365
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,850
that's gonna work your outer and rear
deltoid which are inferior muscle groups

366
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:07,860
deltoid which are inferior muscle groups
 

367
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,050
deltoid which are inferior muscle groups
so instead my elbow anchors

368
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:12,060
so instead my elbow anchors
 

369
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,329
so instead my elbow anchors
and that's it

370
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:14,339
and that's it
 

371
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,710
and that's it
I don't

372
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:15,720
I don't
 

373
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,370
I don't
use my hand

374
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:19,380

 

375
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,030

so here is the conflict

376
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
so here is the conflict
 

377
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,630
so here is the conflict
I reconcile it boom and then my body

378
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
I reconcile it boom and then my body
 

379
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,430
I reconcile it boom and then my body
goes around it

380
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440

 

381
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,750

he pushes

382
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:32,760
he pushes
 

383
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,269
he pushes
I reconcile at home I'm on the inside

384
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:35,279
I reconcile at home I'm on the inside
 

385
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,810
I reconcile at home I'm on the inside
and now my body moves

386
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:38,820
and now my body moves
 

387
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,250
and now my body moves
and

388
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:40,260
and
 

389
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,590
and
with your shoulder as a reference point

390
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:42,600
with your shoulder as a reference point
 

391
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,190
with your shoulder as a reference point
or a point of articulation

392
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,200

 

393
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:55,910

around

394
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920

 

395
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:06,949

different

396
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959

 

397
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,889

same goes on the young hand
okay

400
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:11,339
okay
 

401
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,290
okay
she if I were to make a completely

402
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:14,300
she if I were to make a completely
 

403
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,269
she if I were to make a completely
two-dimensional inward spiral like I'm

404
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
two-dimensional inward spiral like I'm
 

405
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,550
two-dimensional inward spiral like I'm
drawing a heart on a chalkboard and I

406
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:19,560
drawing a heart on a chalkboard and I
 

407
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,130
drawing a heart on a chalkboard and I
leave my chest still you get something

408

leave my chest still you get something
 

409
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,310
leave my chest still you get something
different and most importantly

410
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:25,320
different and most importantly
 

411
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,670

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:28,680
you get your inner deltoid working
 

413
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,069
you get your inner deltoid working
but my body's gonna move

but my body's gonna move
 

415
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,990
but my body's gonna move
so

416
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,000
so
 

417
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,329
so
you see that the shoulder hasn't

418
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:35,339
you see that the shoulder hasn't
 

419
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,009
you see that the shoulder hasn't
articulated

420
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:37,019
articulated
 

421
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,889
articulated
here or bring the elbow under

422
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:39,899
here or bring the elbow under
 

423
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,690
here or bring the elbow under
then around

424
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:44,700

 

425
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,630

she has the conflict dinner she's going

426
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:47,640
she has the conflict dinner she's going
 

427
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,610
she has the conflict dinner she's going
going come on give me some muscle come

going come on give me some muscle come
 

429
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,490
going come on give me some muscle come
on okay boom

430
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:52,500
on okay boom
 

431
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,690
on okay boom
so I

432
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:53,700
so I
 

433
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,810
so I
risk uh reconcile the conflict boom

434
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:56,820
risk uh reconcile the conflict boom
 

435
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,069
risk uh reconcile the conflict boom
there it's off

436
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:01,079

 

437
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:06,410

boom

438
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:06,420

this is important

444
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:19,320

 

445
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,870

because

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,569
zazen mine
you cannot sit here and go

518
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:47,579

 

519
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,389

heart sheep

520
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
heart sheep
 

521
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,910
heart sheep
Elba

522
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:52,920
Elba
 

523
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,329
Elba
it's too intellectual

524
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:56,339

 

525
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,670

so you enter

526
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:58,680
so you enter
 

527
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,970
so you enter
into that same coordination and again

528
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:01,980
into that same coordination and again
 

529
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,449
into that same coordination and again
this is not the shape of kokidosa but

530
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:05,459
this is not the shape of kokidosa but
 

531
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,930
this is not the shape of kokidosa but
the inside of cookie Dosa okay the shape

532
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:08,940
the inside of cookie Dosa okay the shape
 

533
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,150
the inside of cookie Dosa okay the shape
we just we already did

534
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,160
we just we already did
 

535
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,790
we just we already did
but to do the inside of kokidosa the ego

536
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:15,800
but to do the inside of kokidosa the ego
 

537
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,189
but to do the inside of kokidosa the ego
tripartite mind and the god mind must

538
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
tripartite mind and the god mind must
 

539
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,210
tripartite mind and the god mind must
also be in that perfect equilibrium of

540
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:23,220
also be in that perfect equilibrium of
 

541
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,230
also be in that perfect equilibrium of
Yin Yang reconciliation so I'm not one I

542
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:27,240
Yin Yang reconciliation so I'm not one I
 

543
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,150
Yin Yang reconciliation so I'm not one I
don't want to stay in my ego mind

544
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160

 

545
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:53,230

I have the two

546
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,240

 

547
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,870

then the chi is circulating then it's

548
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880
then the chi is circulating then it's
 

549
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,829
then the chi is circulating then it's
emanating then your energetic body is

550
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:00,839
emanating then your energetic body is
 

551
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,930
emanating then your energetic body is
actually being cultivated

552
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:05,940

 

553
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,170

so if you go too slow

554
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:09,180
so if you go too slow
 

555
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,509
so if you go too slow
I think you're going to be

556
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
I think you're going to be
 

557
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,629
I think you're going to be
operating too much in the egoic mind

558
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
operating too much in the egoic mind
 

559
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,870
operating too much in the egoic mind
okay just kind of go for it

560
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:17,880
okay just kind of go for it
 

561
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,569
okay just kind of go for it
but don't zone out because that's not it

562
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:20,579
but don't zone out because that's not it
 

563
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,790
but don't zone out because that's not it
either that's not an integration

564
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
either that's not an integration
 

565
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,189
either that's not an integration
okay let's go

566
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:28,199

 

567
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,490

okay so uh a question came up here but

568
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:31,500
okay so uh a question came up here but
 

569
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,590
okay so uh a question came up here but
you might find it interesting however

570
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
you might find it interesting however
 

571
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,069
you might find it interesting however
I'll preface this by saying this this is

572
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:37,079
I'll preface this by saying this this is
 

573
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,009
I'll preface this by saying this this is
not the beginner level stuff so you

574
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:40,019
not the beginner level stuff so you
 

575
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,850
not the beginner level stuff so you
stick to the shape shape I gave you okay

576
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:42,860
stick to the shape shape I gave you okay
 

577
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,590
stick to the shape shape I gave you okay
but I already mentioned that there's an

578
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
but I already mentioned that there's an
 

579
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,129
but I already mentioned that there's an
insight to the technique

580
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:49,139
insight to the technique
 

581
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,090
insight to the technique
um that is replicating concentrically

582
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:52,100
um that is replicating concentrically
 

583
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,230
um that is replicating concentrically
the shape which you're doing both

584
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,240
the shape which you're doing both
 

585
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,030
the shape which you're doing both
energetically and then physiologically

586
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,040
energetically and then physiologically
 

587
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,850
energetically and then physiologically
okay so you you have these kind of

588
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:01,860
okay so you you have these kind of
 

589
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,630
okay so you you have these kind of
levels and just for simplicity's sake uh

590
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:05,640
levels and just for simplicity's sake uh
 

591
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,210
levels and just for simplicity's sake uh
we'll call this the spirit level you

592
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:08,220
we'll call this the spirit level you
 

593
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,750
we'll call this the spirit level you
have an energy level

594
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:10,760
have an energy level
 

595
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,150
have an energy level
inner energy

596
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,160
inner energy
 

597
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:25,730
inner energy
and then you have a physical level

598
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:25,740

 

599
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,189

okay

600
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:28,199
okay
 

601
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,730
okay
here at your physical level uh is your

602
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:31,740
here at your physical level uh is your
 

603
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:39,590
here at your physical level uh is your
arm your hand and arm shapes okay

604
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600

 

605
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,810

and your energy level is your yin and

606
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:41,820
and your energy level is your yin and
 

607
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,570
and your energy level is your yin and
yang

608
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:44,580

 

609
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,730

at the spiritual level using our

614
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:55,740
at the spiritual level using our
 

615
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,610
at the spiritual level using our
discourse you have your ego tripartite

616
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:58,620
discourse you have your ego tripartite

all of these things are going to be what

624
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
all of these things are going to be what
 

625
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,230
all of these things are going to be what
I call reconciled or integrated

626
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:15,240
I call reconciled or integrated
 

627
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,210
I call reconciled or integrated
uh

628
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:17,220
uh
 

629
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:23,450
uh
if we have for example a spectrum

630
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:23,460

 

631
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,690

where you have Yin on one side

632
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:26,700
where you have Yin on one side
 

633
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,830
where you have Yin on one side
and Yong on the other

634
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:30,840

 

635
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,870

there is a point on this line

636
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:35,880
there is a point on this line
 

637
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,289
there is a point on this line
where it is neither Yin nor yang

638
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:39,299
where it is neither Yin nor yang
 

639
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:45,110
where it is neither Yin nor yang
it's perfectly reconciled

640
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120

 

641
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,409

this is where you want to be

642
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:48,419
this is where you want to be
 

643
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,070
this is where you want to be
okay this is where your

644
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
okay this is where your
 

645
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,970
okay this is where your
in other words uh your hand shape is

646
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:55,980
in other words uh your hand shape is
 

647
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,090
in other words uh your hand shape is
your arm shape meaning you move your arm

648
00:18:59,090 --> 00:18:59,100
your arm shape meaning you move your arm
 

649
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,090
your arm shape meaning you move your arm
in a way to keep your hand shape

650
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:02,100
in a way to keep your hand shape
 

651
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,210
in a way to keep your hand shape
and you form your hand in a way to keep

652

and you form your hand in a way to keep
 

653
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,789
and you form your hand in a way to keep
your arm shape there's they're not

654
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:07,799
your arm shape there's they're not
 

655
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,950
your arm shape there's they're not
fighting each other if as I watch some

656
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:09,960
fighting each other if as I watch some
 

657
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,810
fighting each other if as I watch some
of your techniques they're all fighting

658
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:11,820
of your techniques they're all fighting
 

659
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,549
of your techniques they're all fighting
each other the hand and arm are fighting

660
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:13,559
each other the hand and arm are fighting
 

661
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,490
each other the hand and arm are fighting
each other okay and then in the same way

uh
 

665
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,150
uh
at the beginner level it appears clear

666
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:23,160
at the beginner level it appears clear
 

667
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,850
at the beginner level it appears clear
and begin hand young hand but as you

watch me going and she feels it she
 

671
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,169
watch me going and she feels it she
can't tell which hand it doesn't feel

672
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:30,179
can't tell which hand it doesn't feel
 

673
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,850
can't tell which hand it doesn't feel
which hand is Yin and which hand is

674
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:31,860
which hand is Yin and which hand is
 

675
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,250
which hand is Yin and which hand is
Young either hand can throw her in

676
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:34,260
Young either hand can throw her in
 

677
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,169
Young either hand can throw her in
exactly the same energy that is

678
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:36,179
exactly the same energy that is
 

679
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,590
exactly the same energy that is
happening okay but inside at a deeper

680
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
happening okay but inside at a deeper
 

681
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,549
happening okay but inside at a deeper
level

level
you have this not I'm not hanging out in

684

you have this not I'm not hanging out in
 

685
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,830
you have this not I'm not hanging out in
some kind of like psychedelic High

686
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
some kind of like psychedelic High
 

687
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,750

um young energy

836
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:21,900
um young energy
 

837
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,370
um young energy
and then

838
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:24,380
and then
 

839
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,250
and then
will reconcile the young energy with Yin

840
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:28,260
will reconcile the young energy with Yin
 

841
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,450
will reconcile the young energy with Yin
energy

00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:29,460
energy
 

843
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,010
energy
and then transfer back to young as they

844
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:34,020
and then transfer back to young as they
 

845
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,330

do the technique uh all the whole while

846
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:37,340
do the technique uh all the whole while
 

847
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,669
do the technique uh all the whole while
while their arms are moving in and young

848
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:40,679
while their arms are moving in and young
 

849
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,250
while their arms are moving in and young
okay so there is a yin and yang

850
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:43,260
okay so there is a yin and yang
 

851
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,549
okay so there is a yin and yang
relationship to Naga and UK as well and

852
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
relationship to Naga and UK as well and

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,430
relationship to Naga and UK as well and
when she offs her hands and I sit here I

854
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,440
when she offs her hands and I sit here I
 

855
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,490
when she offs her hands and I sit here I
have not done anything to generate a Yin

856
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:52,500
have not done anything to generate a Yin
 

857
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,010
have not done anything to generate a Yin
or a yarn here okay

858
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,020
or a yarn here okay
 

859
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,690
or a yarn here okay
so at the physiological level the tactic

860
00:23:59,690 --> 00:23:59,700
so at the physiological level the tactic
 

861
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,169
so at the physiological level the tactic
that I'm using is spinal displacement so

862
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:03,179
that I'm using is spinal displacement so
 

863
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,770
that I'm using is spinal displacement so
and uh at an energetic level that is

864
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:06,780
and uh at an energetic level that is
 

865
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,970
and uh at an energetic level that is
called Q

866
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:07,980
called Q
 

867
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,110
called Q

holding here in space because she can
just hang there and there's nothing to

880
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:32,220
just hang there and there's nothing to
 

881
