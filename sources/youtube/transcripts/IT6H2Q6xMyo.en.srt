00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
his leg comes up right okay when he gets
 

179
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,950
his leg comes up right okay when he gets
here

180
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
here
 

181
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,189
here
there's energy is now spilling on the

182
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
there's energy is now spilling on the
 

183
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,670
there's energy is now spilling on the
outside of that leg it's going this way

184
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
outside of that leg it's going this way
 

185
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,029
outside of that leg it's going this way
okay and all i'm going to do is make

186
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039
okay and all i'm going to do is make
 

187
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,230
okay and all i'm going to do is make
this leg

188
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
this leg
 

189
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,909
this leg
take a little hop that way

190
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
take a little hop that way
 

191
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,270
take a little hop that way
go and that's what does it to him

192
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280

 

193
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,310

it's the same uh kazushi powder we might

194
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
it's the same uh kazushi powder we might
 

195
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,110
it's the same uh kazushi powder we might
have here

196
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
have here
 

197
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,909
have here
forward it's the same one i have here so

198
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
forward it's the same one i have here so
 

199
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,590
forward it's the same one i have here so
i'm going this way

200
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
i'm going this way
 

201
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,710
i'm going this way
making energy go outside that foot and

202
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
making energy go outside that foot and
 

203
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,390
making energy go outside that foot and
the leg will

204
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
the leg will
 

205
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,749
the leg will
come around not him pirate so i'm gonna

206
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
come around not him pirate so i'm gonna
 

207
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,469
come around not him pirate so i'm gonna
go here

208
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
go here
 

209
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,469
go here
there's that that's the energy i want

210
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
there's that that's the energy i want
 

211
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,150
there's that that's the energy i want
and i gotta make him take that little

212
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
and i gotta make him take that little
 

213
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,950
and i gotta make him take that little
hop

214
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
hop
 

215
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,749
hop
and keep it all moving

216
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759

 

217
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,510

then it starts spinning outside that

218
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
then it starts spinning outside that
 

219
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,430
then it starts spinning outside that
foot

you will see that i go here whoa

you'll have to hit that other foot to

250
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
you'll have to hit that other foot to
 

251
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,150
you'll have to hit that other foot to
come inside

252
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
come inside
 

253
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:14,830
come inside
so that the line of gravity falls

254
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840

 

255
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,230

261
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,150

i'm gonna do the same energy thing

262
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
i'm gonna do the same energy thing
 

263
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,589

275
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,909

fade and let that new line go outside

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
fade and let that new line go outside
 

277
00:07:45,919 --> 00:08:07,350

in space

278
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360

 

279
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,830

don't worry about any take down this

285
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,469

okay so if he's doing dopamine

286
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
okay so if he's doing dopamine
 

287
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,870

clash with it
 

291
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,909
clash with it
okay so aikido already has contact i

292
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
okay so aikido already has contact i
 

293
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,630
okay so aikido already has contact i
mean it goes

294
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
mean it goes
 

295
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,589
mean it goes
contact and then i can never clash with

296
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
contact and then i can never clash with
 

297
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:43,909
contact and then i can never clash with
it

298
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
it
 

299
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,710
it
as long as i can yield these the same

300
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
as long as i can yield these the same
 

301
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,910

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
i have to keep attacking his balance so
 

351
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,509
i have to keep attacking his balance so
we're going

352
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
we're going
 

353
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,030
we're going

i'm going like that
 

361
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,269
i'm going like that
not gonna fall his line of gravity is

362
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
not gonna fall his line of gravity is
 

363
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,750
not gonna fall his line of gravity is
not outside his base support

364
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
not outside his base support
 

365
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,990
not outside his base support
and i pushed him and he just moves his

366
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
and i pushed him and he just moves his
 

367
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,509
and i pushed him and he just moves his
base support back under his line of

368
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
base support back under his line of
 

369
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,509
base support back under his line of
gravity

370
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
gravity
 

371
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,069
gravity
