right pay attention what the same
 

103
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,869
right pay attention what the same

direction it's going in the same
 

105
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,449
direction it's going in the same
direction so if we plot look at the

106
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:38,459
direction so if we plot look at the
 

107
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,970
direction so if we plot look at the
distance the wrist is currently from her

108

you see the segmentation
 

151
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,410
you see the segmentation
right right at contact

152
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:42,420

00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,060
so you want to do the movement then
 

175
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,309
so you want to do the movement then
okay

176
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:13,319
okay
 

177
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,009
okay
same thing I'm going to come up

178
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:16,019
same thing I'm going to come up
 

179
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,289
same thing I'm going to come up
but I'm not going to let these hinges

180
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:18,299
but I'm not going to let these hinges
 

181
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,550
but I'm not going to let these hinges
work

182
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:19,560
work
 

183
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,409
work
up

184
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:21,419
up
 

185
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:24,710
up
she she's going she's trying to go in

186
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
she she's going she's trying to go in
 

187
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,110
she she's going she's trying to go in
but I'm not going to let her

188
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,120

 

189
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,409

if we pay attention to the uks

190
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:33,419
if we pay attention to the uks
 

191
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:38,090
if we pay attention to the uks
the UK is disconnect all the time all

192
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,100
the UK is disconnect all the time all
 

193
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,610
the UK is disconnect all the time all
the time okay

194
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:40,620
the time okay
 

195
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,450
the time okay
um

196
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:41,460
um
 

197
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,409
um
so if you pay attention to when so she

198
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:45,419
so if you pay attention to when so she
 

199
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,650
so if you pay attention to when so she
pushes she's now not disconnected but

200
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:48,660
pushes she's now not disconnected but
 

201
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,350
pushes she's now not disconnected but
when does she when does she want that

202
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
when does she when does she want that
 

203
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,850
when does she when does she want that
right there

204
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:52,860
right there
 

205
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,830
right there
let's say that right here is where

206
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:56,840
let's say that right here is where
 

207
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,030
let's say that right here is where
she'll take her Center out of the

208
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
she'll take her Center out of the
 

209
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,629
she'll take her Center out of the
technique and so the internal

210
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
technique and so the internal
 

211
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,129
technique and so the internal
uh energetic manipulation she's trying

212
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:07,139
uh energetic manipulation she's trying
 

213
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,110
uh energetic manipulation she's trying
to desegment it she's trying to

214
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
to desegment it she's trying to
 

215
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,689
to desegment it she's trying to
disconnect it you see and then the

216
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:11,699
disconnect it you see and then the
 

217
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,530
disconnect it you see and then the
hinges will become viable again so this

218
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:15,540
hinges will become viable again so this
 

219
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,969
hinges will become viable again so this
kind of Luca

220
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:16,979
kind of Luca
 

221
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,610
kind of Luca
gives you a great opportunity

222
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:19,620
gives you a great opportunity
 

223
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,749
gives you a great opportunity
to you see there it is again

224
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
to you see there it is again
 

225
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,310
to you see there it is again
so

226
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,320
so
 

227
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,249
so
once once I have her here I have her

228
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:28,259
once once I have her here I have her
 

229
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,170
once once I have her here I have her
Center so you can see if you can move

230
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,180
Center so you can see if you can move
 

231
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,450
Center so you can see if you can move
her in any anywhere you want

232
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:32,460
her in any anywhere you want
 

233
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,590
her in any anywhere you want
but once she goes off balance she's now

234
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
but once she goes off balance she's now
 

235
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,810
but once she goes off balance she's now
changing the angle and disconnecting the

236
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:38,820
changing the angle and disconnecting the
 

237
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,830
changing the angle and disconnecting the
center

238
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
center
 

239
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,770
center
what you have to do as your Advanced is

240
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:42,780
what you have to do as your Advanced is
 

241
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,330
what you have to do as your Advanced is
not go back to a hinge she changed the

242
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:47,340
not go back to a hinge she changed the
 

243
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,670
not go back to a hinge she changed the
vector so you just keep the energy

244
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
vector so you just keep the energy
 

245
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,590
vector so you just keep the energy
instead

246
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
instead
 

247
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,830
instead
got it so I don't want to do the keyhole

248
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:54,840
got it so I don't want to do the keyhole
 

249
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,490
got it so I don't want to do the keyhole
at the cost of bringing her joints back

250
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,500
at the cost of bringing her joints back
 

251
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,830
at the cost of bringing her joints back
in

252
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:00,840

 

253
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,529

I just I have the energy the energy is

254
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:03,539
I just I have the energy the energy is
 

255
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:07,790
I just I have the energy the energy is
what I use

256
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:07,800

 

257
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,430

every time she disconnects

258
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:10,440
every time she disconnects
 

259
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,210
every time she disconnects
I keep that lock on her joints so just

260
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:14,220
I keep that lock on her joints so just
 

261
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,430
I keep that lock on her joints so just
hear that you see how she goes back okay

262
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:16,440
hear that you see how she goes back okay
 

263
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,650
hear that you see how she goes back okay
what she's hoping those to do push this

264
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:18,660
what she's hoping those to do push this
 

265
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,469
what she's hoping those to do push this
push okay but she goes back go back and

266
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:21,479
push okay but she goes back go back and
 

267
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,990
push okay but she goes back go back and
same thing I can't keep going where she

268
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
same thing I can't keep going where she
 

269
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,309
same thing I can't keep going where she
disconnected

270
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:25,319
disconnected
 

271
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,010
disconnected
she goes back and I keep

272
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,020
she goes back and I keep
 

273
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,990
she goes back and I keep
the same thing do you feel how do you

274
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
the same thing do you feel how do you
 

275
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,090
the same thing do you feel how do you
see and the joints don't hinge

276
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,100

 

277
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,930

got it okay Chris

278
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:41,940

 

279
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:47,390

so this I don't want that

280
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,400

 

281
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,189

see

282
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
see
 

283
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:57,529
see
it's just the feeling of

284
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:57,539

 

285
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,749

when does it happen

286
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
when does it happen
 

287
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,029
when does it happen
right when he's about to fall

288
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:02,039
right when he's about to fall
 

289
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,170
right when he's about to fall
okay

290
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,180
okay
 

291
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,890
okay
so maybe I take the keyhole up to that

292
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:06,900
so maybe I take the keyhole up to that
 

293
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,790
so maybe I take the keyhole up to that
part

294
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:07,800
part
 

295
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,629
part
he starts to pull out and hinge do you

296
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:11,639
he starts to pull out and hinge do you
 

297
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,990
he starts to pull out and hinge do you
see now to continue on this now here's

298
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,000
see now to continue on this now here's
 

299
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,969
see now to continue on this now here's
where you can push down on that hand you

300
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:16,979
where you can push down on that hand you
 

301
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:17,809
where you can push down on that hand you
see

302
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:17,819
see
 

303
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,330
see
he'll he he's given back leverage to

304
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:20,340
he'll he he's given back leverage to
 

305
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,610
he'll he he's given back leverage to
himself which is what a resistant person

306
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:22,620
himself which is what a resistant person
 

307
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,689
himself which is what a resistant person
will do

308
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:23,699
will do
 

309
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,330
will do
they will do that and that's why they

310
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:26,340
they will do that and that's why they
 

311
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,089
they will do that and that's why they
this kind of uke is not the best for you

312
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:29,099
this kind of uke is not the best for you
 

313
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,490
this kind of uke is not the best for you
not good development but for my

314
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:31,500
not good development but for my
 

315
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,529
not good development but for my
knowledge of development it'll help me

316
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:33,539
knowledge of development it'll help me
 

317
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:36,230
knowledge of development it'll help me
train so when I feel that you see how I

318
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
train so when I feel that you see how I
 

319
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,270
train so when I feel that you see how I
felt it goes yeah

320
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:38,280
felt it goes yeah
 

321
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,930
felt it goes yeah
you see how I put it back on okay

322
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:41,940

 

323
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,029

so we'll do that one again just so I can

324
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:44,039
so we'll do that one again just so I can
 

325
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,969
so we'll do that one again just so I can
talk it through as I feel him pull that

326
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:46,979
talk it through as I feel him pull that
 

327
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,330
talk it through as I feel him pull that
do you see rather than push here and

328
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:50,340
do you see rather than push here and
 

329
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,749
do you see rather than push here and
give him the mechanical advantage there

330
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
give him the mechanical advantage there
 

331
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,050
give him the mechanical advantage there
right I brought this this way

332
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:57,060
right I brought this this way
 

333
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,529
right I brought this this way
this is going this way see and what you

334
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:00,539
this is going this way see and what you
 

335
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:06,650
this is going this way see and what you
notice is that the hinge stops working

336
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:06,660

 

337
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,469

every time

338
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:09,479
every time
 

339
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,129
every time
there's that little hinge

340
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:13,139
there's that little hinge
 

341
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:19,670
there's that little hinge
there it is again

342
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680

 

343
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,650

so if the camera doesn't feel what you

382
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:15,180
so if the camera doesn't feel what you
 

383
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,030
so if the camera doesn't feel what you
feel but you see if I continue to do it

445
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:10,250

so every little manipulation

446
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:10,260
so every little manipulation
 

447
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,009
so every little manipulation
starts where where it leaked out before

448
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:13,019
starts where where it leaked out before

469
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,530

you're gonna do the technique

470
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:42,540

 

471
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,710

there it is again
 

477
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,410
there it is again
so imagine you're a you're a noggin

478
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:51,420
so imagine you're a you're a noggin
 

479
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,069
so imagine you're a you're a noggin
and Sensei says you get four tries

and
 

483
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,210
and
then your partner gets four try so we

484
00:11:59,210 --> 00:11:59,220
then your partner gets four try so we
 

485
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,069
then your partner gets four try so we
bowed in and we go

486
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:01,079
bowed in and we go
 

487
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,370
bowed in and we go
one

488
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:04,380

 

489
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,850

two

490
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:07,860

 

491
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:14,030

three

492
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,040

 

493
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:26,509

oh my turn

494

um
don't prioritize

502
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:52,500

 

503
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,370

throwing them it's how you throw them

504

do your segmented shoulder

556
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:00,180
do your segmented shoulder
 

557
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,670

I'll now I'll risk it okay and now be
 

567
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,750
I'll now I'll risk it okay and now be
segmented

568
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:14,760
segmented
 

569
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,329
segmented
different body okay

570
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:17,339
different body okay
 

571
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,389
different body okay
so what you want to do is not be afraid

572
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
so what you want to do is not be afraid
 

573
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,090
so what you want to do is not be afraid
because fear segments the body

574
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:23,100
because fear segments the body
 

575
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,569
because fear segments the body
a locked

593
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,490

then it happens right at the fear

594
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:55,500
then it happens right at the fear
 

595
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,810
then it happens right at the fear
response of falling okay

596
00:14:59,810 --> 00:14:59,820

 

597
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,949

so if you if that's the case

598
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:03,959
so if you if that's the case
 

599
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,189
so if you if that's the case
then doing the prescribed in chemical

600
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
then doing the prescribed in chemical
 

601
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,129
then doing the prescribed in chemical

can you see will you segment and then

614
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:25,620
can you see will you segment and then
 

615
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,949
can you see will you segment and then
you go unconscious or will you maintain

616
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:27,959
you go unconscious or will you maintain
 

617
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,650
you go unconscious or will you maintain
awareness in the face of that

618
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:30,660
awareness in the face of that
 

619
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,509

make yourself
be that do that you get eight reps per

626
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:48,300
be that do that you get eight reps per
 

627
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,030
be that do that you get eight reps per
every four not four reps okay

628
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040

 

629
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,430

pay attention to those joints both from

630
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
pay attention to those joints both from
 

631
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,449
pay attention to those joints both from

647
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,949

there seems to be a little

648
00:16:57,949 --> 00:16:57,959

rubs anyone else notice anything
 

653
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,510
rubs anyone else notice anything
there's energy leakage yes there's

654
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
there's energy leakage yes there's
 

655
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,449
there's energy leakage yes there's
energy leakage which which who could who

656
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:08,459
energy leakage which which who could who
 

657
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,610
energy leakage which which who could who
could Define

658
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:10,620
could Define
 

659
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,370
could Define
what is not being impacted as a result

660
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:13,380
what is not being impacted as a result
 

661
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,730
what is not being impacted as a result
of that energy leakage the center the

662
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:16,740
of that energy leakage the center the
 

663
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,949
of that energy leakage the center the
center is not being affected so the

664
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
center is not being affected so the
 

665
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,710
center is not being affected so the
center is being sequentially externally

666
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:21,720
center is being sequentially externally
 

667
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,470
center is being sequentially externally
affected so as you work through each

668
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
affected so as you work through each
 

669
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,789
affected so as you work through each
joint

670
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:25,799
joint
 

671
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,949
joint
then eventually you're pulling on the

672
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:27,959
then eventually you're pulling on the
 

673
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,130
then eventually you're pulling on the
center do you understand that okay so

674
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:31,140
center do you understand that okay so
 

675
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,730
center do you understand that okay so
the same thing is here

676
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:34,740

 

677
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,270

okay so uh when I'm here you see I'm in

678
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,280
okay so uh when I'm here you see I'm in
 

679
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,490
okay so uh when I'm here you see I'm in
the center it's in your Center that's

680
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:40,500
the center it's in your Center that's
 

681
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,110
the center it's in your Center that's
why when you try to disconnect what you

682
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
why when you try to disconnect what you
 

683
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,450
why when you try to disconnect what you
feel this hand is doing

684
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:47,460
feel this hand is doing
 

685
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,950
feel this hand is doing
where is it

686
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
where is it
 

687
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,409
where is it
yeah do you see okay

688
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:51,419
yeah do you see okay
 

689
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:52,850
yeah do you see okay
as opposed to you go ahead and

690
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:52,860
as opposed to you go ahead and
 

691
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,210
as opposed to you go ahead and
disconnect and I disconnect too okay as

692
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:56,220
disconnect and I disconnect too okay as
 

693
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,370
disconnect and I disconnect too okay as
you get and then inversely it's the same

694
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:58,380
you get and then inversely it's the same
 

695
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,730
you get and then inversely it's the same
thing here right so as you as I go into

696
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:01,740
thing here right so as you as I go into
 

697
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,210
thing here right so as you as I go into
your joints because you disconnect it go

698
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:05,220
your joints because you disconnect it go
 

699
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,950
your joints because you disconnect it go
ahead and do your thing do you see it

700
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
ahead and do your thing do you see it
 

701
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,750
ahead and do your thing do you see it
like that now the joints become

702
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:08,760
like that now the joints become
 

703
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,870
like that now the joints become
functional again but if I if you get to

704
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:11,880
functional again but if I if you get to
 

705
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,090
functional again but if I if you get to
that point and you disconnect you see

706
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,100
that point and you disconnect you see
 

707
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,770
that point and you disconnect you see
and I'm still in the

708
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:15,780
and I'm still in the
 

709
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,230
and I'm still in the
the center but from a different vector

710
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
the center but from a different vector
 

711
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,730
the center but from a different vector
and you have to be able to do it on the

712
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:19,740
and you have to be able to do it on the
 

713
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,890
and you have to be able to do it on the
fly in the joints stop functioning every

714
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:21,900
fly in the joints stop functioning every
 

715
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,470
fly in the joints stop functioning every
time the joints function

716
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
time the joints function
 

717
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,510
time the joints function
you're going to lose connection to the

718
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:26,520
you're going to lose connection to the
 

719
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,830
you're going to lose connection to the
center okay

720
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:30,840

 

721
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,250

so if you if you watch her Center and

722
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,260
so if you if you watch her Center and
 

723
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,070
so if you if you watch her Center and
we've just plot it in space is it moving

724
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,080
we've just plot it in space is it moving
 

725
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,890
we've just plot it in space is it moving
is it is it is it moving through the

726
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:39,900
is it is it is it moving through the
 

727
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,810
is it is it is it moving through the
sagittal plane that's

728
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:41,820
sagittal plane that's
 

729
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,250
sagittal plane that's
on the map

730
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:43,260
on the map
 

731
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,130
on the map
or is it rotating

732
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,140
or is it rotating
 

733
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,710
or is it rotating
are the distal ends of her body rotating

734
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
are the distal ends of her body rotating
 

735
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,370
are the distal ends of her body rotating
around her Center okay such that it's

736
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:52,380
around her Center okay such that it's
 

737
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,590
around her Center okay such that it's
because the center is spinning

738
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:54,600
because the center is spinning
 

739
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,190
because the center is spinning
okay like a imagine a

740
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
okay like a imagine a
 

741
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,409
okay like a imagine a
ball bearing when I'm spinning it okay

742
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:00,419
ball bearing when I'm spinning it okay
 

743
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,810
ball bearing when I'm spinning it okay
or I'm actually doing some combination

744
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:02,820
or I'm actually doing some combination
 

745
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,490
or I'm actually doing some combination
of both and they're spiraling through

746
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:04,500
of both and they're spiraling through
 

747
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,110
of both and they're spiraling through
space like the corkscrew roller coaster

748
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,120
space like the corkscrew roller coaster
 

749
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,590
space like the corkscrew roller coaster
so if we plot her body in space do you

750
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
so if we plot her body in space do you
 

751
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,770
so if we plot her body in space do you
see uh and I do this technique here I'm

752
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:12,780
see uh and I do this technique here I'm
 

753
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,049
see uh and I do this technique here I'm
just going around each joint

754
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:15,059
just going around each joint
 

755
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:18,830
just going around each joint
you see that

756
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:18,840

 

757
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,590

until it goes down

758
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
until it goes down
 

759
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,110
until it goes down
again what does that UK usually do

760
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,120
again what does that UK usually do
 

761
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,970
again what does that UK usually do
reconciles the absence of a mechanical

762
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:28,980
reconciles the absence of a mechanical
 

763
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,029
reconciles the absence of a mechanical
advantage of absence of a mechanical

764
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:32,039
advantage of absence of a mechanical
 

765
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,710
advantage of absence of a mechanical
advantage okay so she'll go down

766
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:35,720
advantage okay so she'll go down
 

767
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,090
advantage okay so she'll go down

but because I have my Center

770
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,160
but because I have my Center
 

771
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,730
but because I have my Center
do you see

772
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:46,740

 

773
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,890

go ahead

774
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:48,900
go ahead
 

775
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,130
go ahead
and if I add my intern go ahead if I had

776
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:52,140
and if I add my intern go ahead if I had
 

777
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,470
and if I add my intern go ahead if I had
my internal skills to it

778
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
my internal skills to it
 

779
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,450
my internal skills to it
she's not gonna get me

780
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:56,460
she's not gonna get me
 

781
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,070
she's not gonna get me
okay

782
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,080
okay
 

783
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,909
okay
what I want to do is establish kazushi

784
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:04,919

 

785
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,110

so that her ability to resist is less

786
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,120
so that her ability to resist is less
 

787
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,810
so that her ability to resist is less
doable because you're mechanically being

788
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:11,820
doable because you're mechanically being
 

789
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,130
doable because you're mechanically being
disorganized okay so as opposed to

790
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:16,140
disorganized okay so as opposed to
 

791
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,130
disorganized okay so as opposed to
you pushing

792
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:19,140
you pushing
 

793
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,350
you pushing
and I get out of the way

794
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
and I get out of the way
 

795
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,610
and I get out of the way
she's Perfect Balance do you see

796
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:25,620
she's Perfect Balance do you see
 

797
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,310
she's Perfect Balance do you see
so I'm not getting out of the way you're

798
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
so I'm not getting out of the way you're
 

799
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,650
so I'm not getting out of the way you're
going to have to travel as we move

800
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:30,660
going to have to travel as we move
 

801
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,770
going to have to travel as we move
camera as I get out of the way there's

802
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:33,780
camera as I get out of the way there's
 

803
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,289
camera as I get out of the way there's
perfect balance until

804
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:36,299
perfect balance until
 

805
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:39,350
perfect balance until
she reconciles the energy if she was

806
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,360
she reconciles the energy if she was
 

807
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,169
she reconciles the energy if she was
stronger or until each joint starts

808
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:42,179
stronger or until each joint starts
 

809
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,169
stronger or until each joint starts
working up its way to the factory Center

810
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:45,179
working up its way to the factory Center
 

811
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,390
working up its way to the factory Center
okay

812
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:47,400
okay
 

813
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,730
okay
so

814
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:48,740
so
 

815
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,610
so
instead I'm going to immediately the

816
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:52,620
instead I'm going to immediately the
 

817
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,850
instead I'm going to immediately the
same same feeling that I have there I do

818
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:55,860
same same feeling that I have there I do
 

819
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,470
same same feeling that I have there I do
on a yield

820
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:57,480
on a yield
 

821
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,690
on a yield
okay I don't just get out of the way and

822
00:20:59,690 --> 00:20:59,700
okay I don't just get out of the way and
 

823
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,810
okay I don't just get out of the way and
disconnect the grip from her Center

824
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:02,820
disconnect the grip from her Center
 

825
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,750
disconnect the grip from her Center
same same feeling there I keep that

826
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:05,760
same same feeling there I keep that
 

827
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,930
same same feeling there I keep that
feeling

828
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:08,940

 

829
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,930

so let's look as I take get out of her

830
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:11,940
so let's look as I take get out of her
 

831
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,750
so let's look as I take get out of her
Center watch her steps watch your steps

832
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760

 

833
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,510

what'd she do last night

834
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:20,520
what'd she do last night
 

835
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,850
what'd she do last night
she took that little stutter right so

836
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:22,860
she took that little stutter right so
 

837
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,970
she took that little stutter right so
same feeling there that on there I keep

838
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:25,980
same feeling there that on there I keep
 

839
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,409
same feeling there that on there I keep
boom

840
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:27,419
boom
 

841
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,110
boom
you see okay now wait go stay there

842
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,120
you see okay now wait go stay there
 

843
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,310
you see okay now wait go stay there
where you are

844
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:31,320
where you are
 

845
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,169
where you are
watch me go off

846
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:33,179
watch me go off
 

847
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:37,549
watch me go off
do you see I'm off stand back up

848
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:37,559
do you see I'm off stand back up
 

849
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,250
do you see I'm off stand back up
okay go back where you were okay and

850
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:40,260
okay go back where you were okay and
 

851
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,430
okay go back where you were okay and
same thing do you feel it it's in am I

852

00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:46,500
do you see that
 

1031
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,330
do you see that
but before I segment

1032
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:50,340
but before I segment
 

1033
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:55,250
but before I segment
he keeps that same connection as I am

1034
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:55,260
he keeps that same connection as I am
 

1035
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,789
he keeps that same connection as I am
attempting to do that okay do you see so

1036
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:58,799
attempting to do that okay do you see so
 

1037
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,490
attempting to do that okay do you see so
again project me

1038
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:01,500
again project me
 

1039
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,070
again project me
you see that so I'm taking you Kimmy

1040
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,080
you see that so I'm taking you Kimmy
 

1041
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,649
you see that so I'm taking you Kimmy
he's keeping that same feeling he'll

1042
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:06,659
he's keeping that same feeling he'll
 

1043
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:09,350
he's keeping that same feeling he'll
move wherever he needs to move to at any

1044
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,360

1045
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,610
move wherever he needs to move to at any
point be able to project me again

1046
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:13,620

 

1047
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,810

Center I keep reconciling it to free my

1048
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:17,820
Center I keep reconciling it to free my
 

1049
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:23,390
Center I keep reconciling it to free my
Center

1050
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:23,400

 

1051
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,049

okay now we're down at the bottom and

1052
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:27,059
okay now we're down at the bottom and
 

1053
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,110
okay now we're down at the bottom and
I'll show you I have my Center which

1054
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,120
I'll show you I have my Center which
 

1055
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,510
I'll show you I have my Center which
should mean I can do what to him

1056
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:32,520
should mean I can do what to him
 

1057
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,169
should mean I can do what to him
project

1058
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:36,179

 

1059
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,370

there

1060
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:37,380
there
 

1061
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,649
there
but I am okay

1062
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:39,659
but I am okay
 

1063
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:43,850
but I am okay
so I receive his projection again he's

1064
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:43,860
so I receive his projection again he's
 

1065
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,350
so I receive his projection again he's
not trying to

1066
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:45,360
not trying to
 

1067
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,710
not trying to
just deal with my joints he's got that

1068
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
just deal with my joints he's got that
 

1069
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,690
just deal with my joints he's got that
same feeling

1070
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:50,700
same feeling
 

1071
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,490
same feeling
and now he projects my Center

1072
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:55,500

 

1073
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,370

that is

1074
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:58,380

 

1075
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,789

but that's also a lion okay so he's not

1076
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:01,799
but that's also a lion okay so he's not
 

1077
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:06,649
but that's also a lion okay so he's not
just attacking my joints and I go ah

1078
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:06,659

 

1079
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,549

there's little counters that I'm doing

1080
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:10,559
there's little counters that I'm doing
 

1081
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:17,930
there's little counters that I'm doing
now to this point if I over counter

1082
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:17,940

 

1083
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,350

then he would because in his task just

1084
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
then he would because in his task just
 

1085
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,169
then he would because in his task just
keep connection that much faster

1086
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:24,179
keep connection that much faster
 

1087
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,210
keep connection that much faster
do you get it that's what you were doing

1088
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:26,220
do you get it that's what you were doing
 

1089
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,490
do you get it that's what you were doing
so you you over countered too quickly

1090
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:28,500
so you you over countered too quickly
 

1091
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,970
so you you over countered too quickly
and you weren't ready for the

1092
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:30,980
and you weren't ready for the
 

1093
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,710
and you weren't ready for the
continuation why is it a problem

1094
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:33,720
continuation why is it a problem
 

1095
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,570
continuation why is it a problem
let's say

1096
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:35,580
let's say
 

1097
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,730
let's say
I start to fall

1098
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:37,740
I start to fall
 

1099
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,190
I start to fall
and I'm going that way

1100
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,200
and I'm going that way
 

1101
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,830
and I'm going that way
don't don't change this okay

1102
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:42,840
don't don't change this okay
 

1103
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,870
don't don't change this okay
don't change leave it in space where it

1104
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:44,880
don't change leave it in space where it
 

1105
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,669
don't change leave it in space where it
is um I'm gonna fall this way

1106
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:49,679

 

1107
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,430

looks like it works

1108
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:52,440
looks like it works
 

1109
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,890
looks like it works
but I'm gonna do that slow and you're

1110
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:54,900
but I'm gonna do that slow and you're
 

1111
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,210
but I'm gonna do that slow and you're
gonna see that he's gonna have to go

1112
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:56,220
gonna see that he's gonna have to go
 

1113
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,789
gonna see that he's gonna have to go
over the top to keep the center

1114
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
over the top to keep the center
 

1115
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,870
over the top to keep the center
and at this point as I start to fall I'm

1116
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:02,880
and at this point as I start to fall I'm
 

1117
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,730
and at this point as I start to fall I'm
now going against

1118
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:04,740
now going against
 

1119
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,930
now going against
the lock as I put him back into there

1120
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:08,940
the lock as I put him back into there
 

1121
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,010
the lock as I put him back into there
you see that so and now your knockout

1122
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:13,020
you see that so and now your knockout
 

1123
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,430
you see that so and now your knockout
has a choice don't break my wrist right

1124
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:16,440
has a choice don't break my wrist right
 

1125
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,169
has a choice don't break my wrist right
you get it

1126
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:18,179
you get it
 

1127
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:21,470
you get it
or break our wrist okay

1128
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:21,480
or break our wrist okay
 

1129
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,289
or break our wrist okay
so don't fall

1130
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:24,299
so don't fall
 

1131
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:27,830
so don't fall
instead just reconcile and again you can

1132
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:27,840
instead just reconcile and again you can
 

1133
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,669
instead just reconcile and again you can
see

1134
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:28,679
see
 

1135
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,010
see
just reconcile

1136
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,020
just reconcile
 

1137
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:36,649
just reconcile
and he'll continue

1138
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:36,659

 

1139
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:49,310

okay

1140
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:49,320

 

1141
00:28:49,320 --> 00:29:08,810

I don't why are you not switching

1142
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:08,820

 

1143
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,190

okay so again you're in his joint if we

1144
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
okay so again you're in his joint if we
 

1145
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,710
okay so again you're in his joint if we
if we you're in her joint too so if we

1146
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:15,720
if we you're in her joint too so if we
 

1147
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,470
if we you're in her joint too so if we
watch how much of the move has started

1148
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
watch how much of the move has started
 

1149
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,330
watch how much of the move has started
there's not he's just standing there do

1150
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:20,340
there's not he's just standing there do
 

1151
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,370
there's not he's just standing there do
you see this is where a resistant

1152
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:22,380
you see this is where a resistant
 

1153
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,669
you see this is where a resistant
opponent punches you in the face okay so

1154
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:25,679
opponent punches you in the face okay so
 

1155
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,110
opponent punches you in the face okay so
you would go no no nothing in the center

1156
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,120
you would go no no nothing in the center
 

1157
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,870
you would go no no nothing in the center
nothing now here says the joints worked

1158
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:32,880
nothing now here says the joints worked
 

1159
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,610
nothing now here says the joints worked
their way up until they affected his

1160
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:34,620
their way up until they affected his
 

1161
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,990
their way up until they affected his
posture

1162
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,000
posture
 

1163
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,630
posture
as as a sense of something different

1164
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
as as a sense of something different
 

1165
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,110
as as a sense of something different
he'll he's in a crowd right and because

1166
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,120
he'll he's in a crowd right and because
 

1167
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,990
he'll he's in a crowd right and because
you can project at any point which means

1168
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,000
you can project at any point which means
 

1169
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,149
you can project at any point which means
I'm anti-centered right I'm not going to

1170
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:47,159
I'm anti-centered right I'm not going to
 

1171
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,909
I'm anti-centered right I'm not going to
be in his arm not in his arm okay the

1172
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:49,919
be in his arm not in his arm okay the
 

1173
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,130
be in his arm not in his arm okay the
second contact becomes sick so I'm gonna

1174
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,140
second contact becomes sick so I'm gonna
 

1175
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,490
second contact becomes sick so I'm gonna
I'm gonna move through the architectural

1176
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:55,500
I'm gonna move through the architectural
 

1177
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,029
I'm gonna move through the architectural
pattern of Nico okay and I'll stop at

1178
00:29:59,029 --> 00:29:59,039
pattern of Nico okay and I'll stop at
 

1179
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,450
pattern of Nico okay and I'll stop at
various increments and Inspire geometry

1180
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:02,460
various increments and Inspire geometry
 

1181
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,330
various increments and Inspire geometry
and you'll see that I can always project

1182
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:05,340
and you'll see that I can always project
 

1183
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,830
and you'll see that I can always project
okay so I'm going to start to move

1184
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:09,840
okay so I'm going to start to move
 

1185
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,529
okay so I'm going to start to move
they've been that first floor and again

1186
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:15,539

 

1187
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:16,909

keep moving

1188
00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:16,919
keep moving
 

1189
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,490
keep moving
and again there's there it is right

1190
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:19,500
and again there's there it is right
 

1191
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,830
and again there's there it is right
there okay

1192
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:21,840
there okay
 

1193
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,130
there okay
uh I'm gonna go in under the technique
