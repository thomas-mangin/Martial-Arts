okay there's two sides of the form

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,370
okay there's two sides of the form
 

49
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,360
okay there's two sides of the form
you're going to use two different

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,370
you're going to use two different
 

51
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:36,120
you're going to use two different
strategies it's not quite as clear as it

52
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,130
strategies it's not quite as clear as it
 

53
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,510
strategies it's not quite as clear as it
was with the Vulcan of the job they have

54
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:39,520
was with the Vulcan of the job they have
 

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,930
was with the Vulcan of the job they have
had their obvious advantages but the

56
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:42,940
had their obvious advantages but the
 

57
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,430
had their obvious advantages but the
jobs very versatile so he will

58
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
jobs very versatile so he will
 

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:55,550
jobs very versatile so he will
eventually adopt a kind of circular and

60
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:55,560
eventually adopt a kind of circular and
 

61
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,430
eventually adopt a kind of circular and
more of a tactic my side is going to be

62
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:02,440
more of a tactic my side is going to be
 

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,390
more of a tactic my side is going to be
very quick and I'm trying to do it were

64
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
very quick and I'm trying to do it were
 

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,130
very quick and I'm trying to do it were
linear faster tactic so I will be trying

66
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:11,140
linear faster tactic so I will be trying
 

67
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,809
linear faster tactic so I will be trying
to new neutralize his actions so that I

68
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:15,819
to new neutralize his actions so that I
 

69
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,830
to new neutralize his actions so that I
can get past his barbering Jolie and get

70
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
can get past his barbering Jolie and get
 

71
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,500
can get past his barbering Jolie and get
to that spinal ring okay he'll be trying

72
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:22,510
to that spinal ring okay he'll be trying
 

73
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,890
to that spinal ring okay he'll be trying
to smother me you see and so I see

74
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:25,900
to smother me you see and so I see
 

75
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,740
to smother me you see and so I see
smothers me that's why I have to do

76
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:28,750
smothers me that's why I have to do
 

77
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,380
smothers me that's why I have to do
begin neutralization to get past those

78
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:31,390
begin neutralization to get past those
 

79
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:37,050
begin neutralization to get past those
things all right so on the first one he

80
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,060
things all right so on the first one he
 

81
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,880
things all right so on the first one he
goes on here

82
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:40,890

 

83
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:45,540

so the Jo comes in and you shift your

84
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:45,550
so the Jo comes in and you shift your
 

85
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,310
so the Jo comes in and you shift your
weight and you're already on the other

86
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:47,320
weight and you're already on the other
 

87
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,500
weight and you're already on the other
side of the weapon don't step out with

88
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:52,510
side of the weapon don't step out with
 

89
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,840
side of the weapon don't step out with
your center of gravity between because

90
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:54,850
your center of gravity between because
 

91
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,909
your center of gravity between because
you did not do that small circle don't

92
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
you did not do that small circle don't
 

93
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,640
you did not do that small circle don't
do this one either this just not here

94
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:02,650
do this one either this just not here
 

95
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,820
do this one either this just not here
it's not doing the right technique it's

96
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:05,830
it's not doing the right technique it's
 

97
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,820
it's not doing the right technique it's
not consistent with the rest of the job

98
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:07,830
not consistent with the rest of the job
 

99
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,820
not consistent with the rest of the job
strategy and then your rage gets off so

100
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:11,830
strategy and then your rage gets off so
 

101
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,820
strategy and then your rage gets off so
if you let's look at it he there's his

102
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:14,830
if you let's look at it he there's his
 

103
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,310
if you let's look at it he there's his
final displacement so that would be

104
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:17,320
final displacement so that would be
 

105
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,550
final displacement so that would be
where his finest to stay there

106
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
where his finest to stay there
 

107
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,040
where his finest to stay there
energy line position now I'm going to do

108
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,050
energy line position now I'm going to do
 

109
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,990
energy line position now I'm going to do
it front of us over and I'm going to

110
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,000
it front of us over and I'm going to
 

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,420
it front of us over and I'm going to
step out let's say I do this

112
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:29,430

 

113
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,180

so usually how that works is that he

114
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,190
so usually how that works is that he
 

115
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,540
so usually how that works is that he
does not ever penetrate you see here

116
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:36,550
does not ever penetrate you see here
 

117
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,670
does not ever penetrate you see here
does not ever penetrate and then this

118
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:38,680
does not ever penetrate and then this
 

119
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,580
does not ever penetrate and then this
worked you see but that first one is

120
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:41,590
worked you see but that first one is
 

121
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,340
worked you see but that first one is
wrong because he hasn't tried of

122
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,350
wrong because he hasn't tried of
 

123
00:05:44,350 --> 00:06:09,210
wrong because he hasn't tried of
smothering me right so he's there so

124
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:09,220

 

125
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,250

so already here don't bring this one no

126
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:12,260
so already here don't bring this one no
 

127
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,590
so already here don't bring this one no

beginner one stood up down that that's

134
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,320
beginner one stood up down that that's
 

135
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,470
beginner one stood up down that that's
not very quick so watch that one to know

here's the deviation right here he's

142
00:06:59,590 --> 00:06:59,600
here's the deviation right here he's
 

143
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,600
here's the deviation right here he's
already at 1/4 off my body on my cinema

144
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:03,610
already at 1/4 off my body on my cinema

angle slow okay you're going to see a

148
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:15,350
angle slow okay you're going to see a
 

149
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:25,060
angle slow okay you're going to see a
very subtle hand change so as I move the

150
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,070
very subtle hand change so as I move the
 

151
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,880
very subtle hand change so as I move the
weapon moves I fold it with this hand

152
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:27,890
weapon moves I fold it with this hand
 

153
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,840
weapon moves I fold it with this hand

the right hat think the right hand where
 

159
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:43,690
the right hat think the right hand where
it is and that's the hatching boom then

160
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:43,700
it is and that's the hatching boom then
 

161
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,570
it is and that's the hatching boom then
the right hand is going to come up to

162
