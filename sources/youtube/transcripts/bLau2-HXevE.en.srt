you just sink okay so it doesn't really
 

173
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,189
you just sink okay so it doesn't really
matter if he's pushing or

174
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
matter if he's pushing or
 

175
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,990
matter if he's pushing or
pulling um so we are going to add uh

176
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,000
pulling um so we are going to add uh
 

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,309
pulling um so we are going to add uh
we'll go back to a spinal displacement

178
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:53,319
we'll go back to a spinal displacement
 

179
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,430
we'll go back to a spinal displacement
okay and same thing I ground it all the

180
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:56,440
okay and same thing I ground it all the
 

181
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,390
okay and same thing I ground it all the
same releasing I'm going to work

182
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
same releasing I'm going to work
 

183
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,270
same releasing I'm going to work
everything the same

184
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,280
everything the same
 

185
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,589
everything the same
uh I'm going to add movement to it now

186
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:02,599
uh I'm going to add movement to it now
 

187
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,469
uh I'm going to add movement to it now
okay so as I start to move I don't want

188
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:05,479
okay so as I start to move I don't want
 

189
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:07,670
okay so as I start to move I don't want
to start tensing

190
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
to start tensing
 

191
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,390
to start tensing
okay so I do the same thing I'm going to

192
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:11,400
okay so I do the same thing I'm going to
 

193
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,550
okay so I do the same thing I'm going to
start adding movement to it just a

194
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
start adding movement to it just a
 

195
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,149
start adding movement to it just a
simple movement

196
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:17,159
simple movement
 

197
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:22,670
simple movement
going to this angle here

198
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:22,680

 

199
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,189

okay so I'm in

200
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
okay so I'm in
 

201
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,670
okay so I'm in
Sea okay ground that start the spiral

202
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:30,680
Sea okay ground that start the spiral
 

203
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,829
Sea okay ground that start the spiral
this creates this Zone here and that's

204
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
this creates this Zone here and that's
 

205
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,949
this creates this Zone here and that's
where I move first this leg then I come

206
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:37,959
where I move first this leg then I come
 

207
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:40,990
where I move first this leg then I come
up on my feet okay and we're just stop

208
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:41,000
up on my feet okay and we're just stop
 

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,389
up on my feet okay and we're just stop
here you can you can dve does

Kiza and we'll have him he's still
 

223
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:10,590
Kiza and we'll have him he's still
pushing that whole time

224
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:10,600

 

225
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,190

00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
matter come around and we're going to
 

233
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,590

drive drive drive okay sink okay uh
maybe come this angle so you can see

242
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
maybe come this angle so you can see
 

243
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,509
maybe come this angle so you can see
that I I don't want to move like this

244
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:44,519
that I I don't want to move like this
 

245
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,509
that I I don't want to move like this
you see cuz I'm I don't have the angle

246
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
you see cuz I'm I don't have the angle
 

247
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,870
you see cuz I'm I don't have the angle
cancellation I'm on the inside of his

248
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:49,880
cancellation I'm on the inside of his
 

249
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,430
cancellation I'm on the inside of his
arm and then you're available

250
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
arm and then you're available
 

251
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,550
arm and then you're available
here it's a very small detail but as he

252
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:57,560
here it's a very small detail but as he
 

253
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,910
here it's a very small detail but as he
pushes this energy goes out way then I

254
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:00,920
pushes this energy goes out way then I
 

255
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,190
pushes this energy goes out way then I
go here this is difficult for a lot of

256
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
go here this is difficult for a lot of
 

257
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,470
go here this is difficult for a lot of
people cuz he's he's thrusting like that

258
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
people cuz he's he's thrusting like that
 

259
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,630
people cuz he's he's thrusting like that
and so you go like that but it's not

260
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:09,640
and so you go like that but it's not
 

261
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,829
and so you go like that but it's not
true okay so I can move now okay now I

262
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:14,839
true okay so I can move now okay now I
 

263
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,630
true okay so I can move now okay now I
hold

264
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640

 

265
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,630

this again ground his energy start the

266
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:25,640
this again ground his energy start the
 

267
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,750
this again ground his energy start the
ouward spiral then you can move to the

268
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
ouward spiral then you can move to the
 

269
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,350
ouward spiral then you can move to the
outside you don't lose that Integrity

270
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:30,360
outside you don't lose that Integrity
 

271
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,829
outside you don't lose that Integrity
you can't push that

272
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:31,839
you can't push that
 

273
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,230
you can't push that
arm not even if I'm moving then you keep

274
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
arm not even if I'm moving then you keep
 

275
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,320
arm not even if I'm moving then you keep
that

276
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,330

from here and moving it
 

391
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,749
from here and moving it
here inside the

392
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:22,759
here inside the
 

393
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:25,790
here inside the
circle which is what you would do if you

394
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:25,800
circle which is what you would do if you
 

395
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,470
circle which is what you would do if you
wanted to trap and and reverse the

396
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,480
wanted to trap and and reverse the
 

397
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,509

is you can't step through because at
that point they're going to have your

518
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,440
that point they're going to have your
 

519
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,230
that point they're going to have your
Center so as you try to move that

520
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:53,240
Center so as you try to move that
 

521
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,029
Center so as you try to move that
knee it's not going to go through it's

522
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:56,039
knee it's not going to go through it's
 

523
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:59,630
knee it's not going to go through it's
like you'll have to go you have to get

524
00:24:59,630 --> 00:24:59,640
like you'll have to go you have to get
 

525
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,190
like you'll have to go you have to get
that

526
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
that
 

527
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,990
that
off and then we have the the bent arm

528
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,000
off and then we have the the bent arm
 

529
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,750
off and then we have the the bent arm
TI and then I'm going just enter okay so

530
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:10,760
TI and then I'm going just enter okay so
 

531
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,310
TI and then I'm going just enter okay so
those are our Catch 22 so you'll

532
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,320
those are our Catch 22 so you'll
 

533
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,590
those are our Catch 22 so you'll
feel he's got it you want to you

534
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
feel he's got it you want to you
 

535
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,590
feel he's got it you want to you
want to keep doing that you see you

536
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:20,600
want to keep doing that you see you
 

537
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,110
want to keep doing that you see you
can't do that cuz you get you don't have

538
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
can't do that cuz you get you don't have
 

539
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,510
can't do that cuz you get you don't have
the

540
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:24,520
the
 

541
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,389
the
uh the M Integrity the guy just going to

542
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:28,399
uh the M Integrity the guy just going to
 

543
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:30,710
uh the M Integrity the guy just going to
close and really what happens is this

544
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:30,720
close and really what happens is this
 

545
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,029
close and really what happens is this
one becomes the strike as we know okay

546
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:34,039
one becomes the strike as we know okay
 

547
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:38,110
one becomes the strike as we know okay
so you'll have to can't

548
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,120
so you'll have to can't
 

549
00:25:38,120 --> 00:26:03,470
so you'll have to can't
bend cuz you're you're not moving

550
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:03,480

 

551
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,750

me so so you feel it I go
 

577
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,470
me so so you feel it I go
here and then I go like this it's like

578
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,480
here and then I go like this it's like
 

579
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,149
here and then I go like this it's like
whoa what happened to the throws where

580
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:50,159
whoa what happened to the throws where
 

581
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,669

he's going across the M

582
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:52,679
he's going across the M
 

583
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,510
he's going across the M
okay so there is some movement I'm going

584
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:55,520
okay so there is some movement I'm going
 

585
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,990
okay so there is some movement I'm going
to show you that part first okay

586
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,000
to show you that part first okay
 

587

you're in my get out of my shoulder get
 

589
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:02,830
you're in my get out of my shoulder get
in my Center

590
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:02,840
in my Center
 

591
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,870
in my Center
lower okay so you look how I'm moving

592
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:05,880
lower okay so you look how I'm moving
 

593
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,149
lower okay so you look how I'm moving
you see you see

594
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:08,159
you see you see
 

595
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,669
you see you see
that not

596

that not
 

597
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,269
that not
here turn there's some

598
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:14,279
here turn there's some
 

599
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,190
here turn there's some
movement here you see the arm lengthens

600
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:18,200
movement here you see the arm lengthens
 

601
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,269
movement here you see the arm lengthens
and then on

602
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:25,279

 

603
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:32,350

here there's absorption moove me

604
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:32,360

 

605
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,789

right feel how we see okay right there's

606
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
right feel how we see okay right there's
 

607
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,630
right feel how we see okay right there's
a there's a right there on the

608
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
a there's a right there on the
 

609
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,789
a there's a right there on the
edge as you

610
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:42,799
edge as you
 

611
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:53,070
edge as you
go I move and roll out pressure is off

612
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,080

 

613
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,630

high can't get that in can't get that in

614
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:58,640
high can't get that in can't get that in
 

615
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:14,350
high can't get that in can't get that in
in my Center lower there you go

616
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:14,360

 

617
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,029

pressure so we be in there that KNE is

618
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039
pressure so we be in there that KNE is
 

619
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,509
pressure so we be in there that KNE is
what you don't

620
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:20,519
what you don't
 

621
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:23,830
what you don't
want absorb with the

622
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:23,840
want absorb with the
 

623
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,149
want absorb with the
knee when you feel the pressure on the

624
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:27,159
knee when you feel the pressure on the
 

625
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:29,830
knee when you feel the pressure on the
center absor absorb with the knee more

626
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:29,840
center absor absorb with the knee more
 

627
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,389
center absor absorb with the knee more
till it's off now you start to go around

628
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:32,399
till it's off now you start to go around
 

629
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,470
till it's off now you start to go around
it yeah so but don't lose extension okay

630
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:37,480
it yeah so but don't lose extension okay
 

631
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,669
it yeah so but don't lose extension okay
so for example stand

632
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:39,679
so for example stand
 

633
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,389
so for example stand
up you're here you're driving your

634
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:43,399
up you're here you're driving your
 

635
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:49,470
up you're here you're driving your
UK uh how far do I step back or deviate

636
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:49,480
UK uh how far do I step back or deviate
 

637
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,070
UK uh how far do I step back or deviate
it depends to what what do I try to find

638
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,080
it depends to what what do I try to find
 

639
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,750
it depends to what what do I try to find
zero point zero

640
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:54,760
zero point zero
 

641
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,789
zero point zero
pressure so you push right and I move to

642
00:28:59,789 --> 00:28:59,799
pressure so you push right and I move to
 

643
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:04,669
pressure so you push right and I move to
zero

644

feel whoa do you see
 

663
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,190
feel whoa do you see
I got I got to go to zero pressure and

664
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,200
I got I got to go to zero pressure and
 

665
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,149
I got I got to go to zero pressure and
then I got to deconstruct the projection

666
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:04,159
then I got to deconstruct the projection
 

667
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,830
then I got to deconstruct the projection
point this what you do in all of two

where that leg moves do you think but

672
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,000
where that leg moves do you think but
 

673
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,590
where that leg moves do you think but
you still have the projection Point

674
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
you still have the projection Point
 

675
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,470
you still have the projection Point
you're going to get me so I have to do

676
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,480
you're going to get me so I have to do
 

677
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,990
you're going to get me so I have to do
