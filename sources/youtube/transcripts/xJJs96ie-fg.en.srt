but what we're doing here is we're

68
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
but what we're doing here is we're
 

69
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,990
but what we're doing here is we're
getting a timing

70
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
getting a timing
 

71
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,350
getting a timing
we're getting that we're getting the

72
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
we're getting that we're getting the
 

73
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,510
we're getting that we're getting the
timing going

74
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520

 

75
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,350

it's as if

76
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
it's as if
 

77
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,870
it's as if
his ken

78
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
his ken
 

79
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,789
his ken
and my finger

80
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
and my finger
 

81
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,469
and my finger
has a piece of string tied to it

82
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479

 

83
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,469

okay

84
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
okay
 

85
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,910
okay
it comes from the partner practice

86
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920

 

87
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,789

yeah

88
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
yeah
 

89
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,270
yeah
all right just just do that so this

90
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
all right just just do that so this
 

91
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,030
all right just just do that so this
person will cut

92
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
person will cut
 

93
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,270
person will cut
reasonably slow at first the higher the

94
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
reasonably slow at first the higher the
 

95
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,950
reasonably slow at first the higher the
rank faster that you the cat should be

96
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
rank faster that you the cat should be
 

97
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,400
rank faster that you the cat should be
hey

98

so
the higher the rank the the faster you

108
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
the higher the rank the the faster you
 

109
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,590
the higher the rank the the faster you
should be cutting

110
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600

 

111
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,429

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,309
am i in line with the attacker no now
i've gone smaller and i've actually gone

178
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
i've gone smaller and i've actually gone
 

179
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,030
i've gone smaller and i've actually gone
off the line

180
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040

 

181
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,869

without knowing it

182
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
without knowing it
 

183
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,390
without knowing it
i've already gone in self-defense mode

184
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
i've already gone in self-defense mode
 

185
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,390
i've already gone in self-defense mode
but what about the guy now starts

186
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
but what about the guy now starts
 

187
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,589
but what about the guy now starts
actually cutting where he's twigged that

188
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
actually cutting where he's twigged that
 

189
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,309
actually cutting where he's twigged that
i've gone

190
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319

 

191
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,190

that then starts bouncing me out because

192
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
that then starts bouncing me out because
 

193
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,270
that then starts bouncing me out because
i wasn't ready for him to come over a

194
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
i wasn't ready for him to come over a
 

195
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,990
i wasn't ready for him to come over a
few centimeters

196
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
few centimeters
 

197
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,589
few centimeters
so the pus

198
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
so the pus
 

199
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,830
so the pus
one thing about scentsy was

200
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
one thing about scentsy was
 

201
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,070
one thing about scentsy was
he was a stickler for being precise and

202
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
he was a stickler for being precise and
 

203
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,630
he was a stickler for being precise and
if you weren't precise exactly every

204
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
if you weren't precise exactly every
 

205
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,869
if you weren't precise exactly every
time he'd shout and shout at you so if

206
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
time he'd shout and shout at you so if
 

207
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,869
time he'd shout and shout at you so if
you're on the line

208
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
you're on the line
 

209
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,429
you're on the line
hey

210
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439

 

211
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,190

and not now

212
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
and not now
 

213
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,710
and not now
it's no good

214
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
it's no good
 

215
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,630
it's no good
so if you start on the line

216
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640

 

217
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,589

hey

218
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599

so
 

231
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,310
so
be precise know where you are it's it

232
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
be precise know where you are it's it
 

233

be precise know where you are it's it
must he used to say it's not like

234
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960

 

235
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,110

it's not like you're not a machine you

236
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
it's not like you're not a machine you
 

237
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,960
it's not like you're not a machine you
know each time

238
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:36,970
know each time
 

239
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,350
know each time
[Applause]

240
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
[Applause]
 

241
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,270

243
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,870

you've got to center yourself each time

244
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
you've got to center yourself each time
 

245
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,629
you've got to center yourself each time
if he starts pumping away and just

246
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
if he starts pumping away and just
 

247
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,189
if he starts pumping away and just
attacking

248
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
attacking
 

249
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,430
attacking
it just slow him up a little bit

250
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440

 

251
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,030

you know it's your aikido it's your

252
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
you know it's your aikido it's your
 

253
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:04,390

255
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,310

this one tacks the head

256
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320

 

257
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,230

this one goes underneath now

258
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
this one goes underneath now
 

259
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,230
this one goes underneath now
underneath

260
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
underneath
 

261
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,029
underneath
so

262
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
so
 

263
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,230
so
what i like about this one is

264
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
what i like about this one is
 

265
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,270
what i like about this one is
if we're in a car

266
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
if we're in a car
 

267
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,909
if we're in a car
and i decide to change gears it might be

268
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
and i decide to change gears it might be
 

269
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,430
and i decide to change gears it might be
a different speed

270
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
a different speed
 

271
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,110
a different speed
than perhaps somebody else driving the

272
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
than perhaps somebody else driving the
 

273
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,510
than perhaps somebody else driving the
car so i might like to change

274
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
car so i might like to change
 

275
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,909
car so i might like to change
gear every 3000 revs

276
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
gear every 3000 revs
 

277
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,510
gear every 3000 revs
and you might like to change it two and

278
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
and you might like to change it two and
 

279
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,350
and you might like to change it two and
a half thousand webs

280
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
a half thousand webs
 

281
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,670
a half thousand webs
so what i have to do is first i

282
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
so what i have to do is first i
 

283
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,550
so what i have to do is first i
i marry his timing let's do it real slow

284
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
i marry his timing let's do it real slow
 

285
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,310
i marry his timing let's do it real slow
at this slow up and down

286
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
at this slow up and down
 

287
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,110
at this slow up and down
here i'm up same speed

288
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
here i'm up same speed
 

289
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,670
here i'm up same speed
then i have to quickly accelerate

290
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
then i have to quickly accelerate
 

291
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,110
then i have to quickly accelerate
because i need to be then ahead of him

292
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
because i need to be then ahead of him
 

293
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,990
because i need to be then ahead of him
if i'm here and then

294
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
if i'm here and then
 

295
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,230
if i'm here and then
if i can't get there now

296
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
if i can't get there now
 

297
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,390
if i can't get there now
get in there

298
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
get in there
 

299
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,550
get in there
by the time he reaches the bottom

300
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560

 

301
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,270

so it's no good going

302
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
so it's no good going
 

303
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,029
so it's no good going
i can't do the technique i want to show

304
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
i can't do the technique i want to show
 

305
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,590
i can't do the technique i want to show
you i can do what i done and lost the

306
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
you i can do what i done and lost the
 

307
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,670
you i can do what i done and lost the
thing what i can do is a coat of gosh

308
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680

 

309
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,430

okay

310
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
okay
 

311
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,510
okay
but the one we're going to do

312
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
but the one we're going to do
 

313
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,350
but the one we're going to do
is very slowly

314
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
is very slowly
 

315
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,390
is very slowly
up now i have to accelerate so i'm there

316
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400

 

317
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,950

i'll talk about this more in a minute

318
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
i'll talk about this more in a minute
 

319
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,110
i'll talk about this more in a minute
this point in a minute

320
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120

 

321
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,870

so i have to accelerate

322
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
so i have to accelerate
 

323
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,909
so i have to accelerate
from the top to the bottom

324
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919

 

325
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,189

and you punch

326
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
and you punch
 

327
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,510
and you punch
from here

328
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
from here
 

329
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,870
from here
okay on a glass mask

330
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:52,880

 

331
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,270

the detail we're going to come in closer

332
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
the detail we're going to come in closer
 

333
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,230
the detail we're going to come in closer
with the camera for the detail

334
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
with the camera for the detail
 

335
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,469
with the camera for the detail
what happens is at the bottom of the

336
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
what happens is at the bottom of the
 

337
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,990
what happens is at the bottom of the
strike

338
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
strike
 

339
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,629
strike
your hands in the middle here but what

340
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
your hands in the middle here but what
 

341
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,950
your hands in the middle here but what
happens is when you push your hand

the hole
 

347
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,830
the hole
here

348

here
 

349
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,390
here
hit pop you go like that and it

747
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,470

i'd take underneath

748
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
i'd take underneath
 

749
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,269
i'd take underneath
but

750
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
but
 

751
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,990

753
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,749
but look i can't trap his hand now
so i can't track his hand and why would

754
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:31,759
so i can't track his hand and why would
 

755
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,430
so i can't track his hand and why would
he turn why would he turn that

756
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440

 

757
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,389

if he now does the ski

758

that's so so raku can be done from skis

762
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
that's so so raku can be done from skis
 

763
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,870

because they're turning

764
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
because they're turning
 

765
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,910
because they're turning
their hand usually

766
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
their hand usually
 

767
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,189
their hand usually
so i just

768
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
so i just
 

769
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,870
so i just
i was thinking about this and i thought

770
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
i was thinking about this and i thought
 

771
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,110
i was thinking about this and i thought
well a lot of people don't get that but

772
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
well a lot of people don't get that but
 

773
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,670
well a lot of people don't get that but
if they start to learn the angle they

774
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
if they start to learn the angle they
 

775
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,470
if they start to learn the angle they
can actually see how

776
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
can actually see how
 

777
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,110
can actually see how
you know you can start to

778
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
you know you can start to
 

779
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,870
you know you can start to
mold things

780
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
mold things
 

781
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,470
mold things
so what is this

782
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
so what is this
 

783
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,030
so what is this
what is this technique

784
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
what is this technique
 

785
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,269
what is this technique
what is this technique

786
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279
what is this technique
 

787
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,350
what is this technique
nicki oh

power there
 

813
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,910
power there
and when the and because we take

814
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920
