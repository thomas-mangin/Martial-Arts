of so I'm going to single pivot rotation

56
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
of so I'm going to single pivot rotation
 

57
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,870
of so I'm going to single pivot rotation
has stopped there's no more rotation

58

when I step back I just step back and

60
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
when I step back I just step back and
 

61
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,749
when I step back I just step back and
now I have to bring her into position

62
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:50,759
now I have to bring her into position
 

63
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,709
now I have to bring her into position
that's what I do there then I shift

64
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:54,719
that's what I do there then I shift

then shift forward single pivot

80
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,040

 

81
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,390

rotation out movement is straight

82
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400

 

83
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:46,869

back okay let's

84
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879

 

85
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,990

try all right so let's define double

86
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,000
try all right so let's define double
 

87
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,990
try all right so let's define double
pivot and double

88
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
pivot and double
 

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,990
pivot and double
pivot obviously when you use both feet

90
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,000
pivot obviously when you use both feet
 

91
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,949
pivot obviously when you use both feet
to rotate that's going to be double

92
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
to rotate that's going to be double
 

93
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,550
to rotate that's going to be double
pivot so

94
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
pivot so
 

95
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,190
pivot so
if I go here and then both feet turn

96
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
if I go here and then both feet turn
 

97
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,750
if I go here and then both feet turn
that's a double

98
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
that's a double
 

99
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,229
that's a double
pivot but let's define it

100
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
pivot but let's define it
 

101
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,910
pivot but let's define it
kinesiologic double pivot is any time I

102
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:17,920
kinesiologic double pivot is any time I
 

103
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,789
kinesiologic double pivot is any time I
rotate and my line of gravity is in the

00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:21,799
rotate and my line of gravity is in the
 

105
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,550
rotate and my line of gravity is in the
middle of my basis support

106
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
middle of my basis support
 

107
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,430
middle of my basis support
elements so my line of gravity is a

108
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
elements so my line of gravity is a
 

109
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,589
elements so my line of gravity is a
perpendicular line traveling from my

110
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:30,599
perpendicular line traveling from my
 

111
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,789
perpendicular line traveling from my
center of

00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:31,799
center of
 

113
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,869
center of

00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
gravity to the
 

115
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,229
gravity to the
ground so when you turn on both

116
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:39,239
ground so when you turn on both
 

117
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,030
ground so when you turn on both
feet your line of gravity is in the keep

118
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,040
feet your line of gravity is in the keep
 

119
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,309
feet your line of gravity is in the keep
your R please your line of gravity is in

120
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
your R please your line of gravity is in
 

121
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,589
your R please your line of gravity is in
the middle that's what makes it double

122
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:46,599
the middle that's what makes it double
 

123
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,070
the middle that's what makes it double
pivot

124
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,080
pivot
 

125
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,550
pivot
okay you're double pivoting on the first

126
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
okay you're double pivoting on the first
 

127
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,110
okay you're double pivoting on the first
move so when you

128
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,120
move so when you
 

129
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,190
move so when you
turn you're on both feet the line of

130
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
turn you're on both feet the line of
 

131
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,390
turn you're on both feet the line of
gravity

132
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
gravity
 

133
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,390
gravity
is in the middle so your first turn on

134
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
is in the middle so your first turn on
 

135
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,750
is in the middle so your first turn on
you is the double

136
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:06,760
you is the double
 

137
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,470
you is the double
pivot you have to shift your weight onto

one leg you can go back or you can go
 

141
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,629
one leg you can go back or you can go
forward but you always

142
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639

143
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,430
forward but you always
turn on one leg can you see how you're

144
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
turn on one leg can you see how you're
 

145
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,310
turn on one leg can you see how you're
doing

146
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
doing

149
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,469
that not two
leg there times here and then I go

150
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:27,479
leg there times here and then I go
 

151
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,270
leg there times here and then I go
forward I'm on that leg

152
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,280

 

153
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,469

in this move I enter and that's when I

154
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:35,479
in this move I enter and that's when I
 

155
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:38,029
in this move I enter and that's when I
shift and that's when I turn I'm on the

156
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:38,039
shift and that's when I turn I'm on the
 

157
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:39,350
shift and that's when I turn I'm on the

foot which is why this foot can slide

162
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
foot which is why this foot can slide
 

163
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,150

foot so the line of gravity is on that

170
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
foot so the line of gravity is on that
 

171
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,189
foot so the line of gravity is on that
foot I step back

172
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:00,199
foot I step back
 

173
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,870
foot I step back
I reset the

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,629
I reset the
drill I'm going to move again onto that

176
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:05,639
drill I'm going to move again onto that
 

177
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,230
drill I'm going to move again onto that
foot and that's where I

178
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
foot and that's where I
 

179
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,990
foot and that's where I
turn and again I'm on that foot with the

180
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,000
turn and again I'm on that foot with the
 

181
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,150
turn and again I'm on that foot with the
line of

182
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,160

 

183
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,430

gravity so we do the

184
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
gravity so we do the
 

185
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,230
gravity so we do the
drill e meee shift onto the front foot

186
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
drill e meee shift onto the front foot
 

187
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,870
drill e meee shift onto the front foot
all is

188
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:27,880
all is
 

189
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,870
all is
there step back no rotation you see no

190
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:31,880
there step back no rotation you see no
 

191
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,309
there step back no rotation you see no
rotation you don't want to turn with the

192
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:34,319
rotation you don't want to turn with the
 

193
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,510
rotation you don't want to turn with the
line of gravity between your feet you

194
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:36,520
line of gravity between your feet you
 

195
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,710
line of gravity between your feet you
kind of linearly move that's what I did

196
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:39,720
kind of linearly move that's what I did
 

197
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,390
kind of linearly move that's what I did
there

198
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:41,400

turn okay try it again a very common
 

209
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,749
turn okay try it again a very common
thing is you use one foot to turn the

210
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
thing is you use one foot to turn the
 

211
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,790
thing is you use one foot to turn the
other foot that's why people double

212
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:09,800
other foot that's why people double

single pivot not double pivot and

264
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,080
single pivot not double pivot and
 

265
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,430
single pivot not double pivot and
they're interrelated

266
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
they're interrelated
 

267
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:49,469
they're interrelated
okay um the first one

268
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:49,479

 

269
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,350

is I am going

270
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:52,360
is I am going
 

271
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,110
is I am going
to uh

to uh
 

273
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,710
to uh
change the cross Vector at which and

274
00:07:59,710 --> 00:07:59,720
change the cross Vector at which and
 

275
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,029
change the cross Vector at which and
rotation happens so for

276
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
rotation happens so for
 

277
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,790
rotation happens so for
example if we're here and I pivot on

278
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
example if we're here and I pivot on
 

279
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,710
example if we're here and I pivot on
both

280
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:09,720

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,589

feet

282
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
feet
 

283
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,149
feet
the grip in relation to where my Center

284
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:15,159
the grip in relation to where my Center
 

285
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,070
the grip in relation to where my Center
is I am going to always be on the front

286
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,080
is I am going to always be on the front
 

287
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,110
is I am going to always be on the front
side of this of the grip so I have this

288
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,120
side of this of the grip so I have this
 

289
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,589
side of this of the grip so I have this
kind of pull to what I'm

290
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:26,599

 

291
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,990

doing this way

292
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000

 

293
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,550

or I move my hand to here it's still

294
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
or I move my hand to here it's still
 

295
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,589
or I move my hand to here it's still
it's there on my Center my hand but

296
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
it's there on my Center my hand but
 

297
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,470
it's there on my Center my hand but
she's still way over there on that side

298
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:45,480
she's still way over there on that side
 

299
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,190
she's still way over there on that side
and it turns into a pool about there you

300
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,200
and it turns into a pool about there you
 

301
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,150
and it turns into a pool about there you
feel that

302
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,160

 

303
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,389

yes and when I single point pivot I get

304
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:55,399
yes and when I single point pivot I get
 

305
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,670
yes and when I single point pivot I get
to the other side of that so let's

306
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:00,680
to the other side of that so let's
 

307
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,550
to the other side of that so let's
look

308
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
look
 

309
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,069
look
obviously we'll we'll mark my elbow okay

310
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:06,079
obviously we'll we'll mark my elbow okay
 

311
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,590
obviously we'll we'll mark my elbow okay
in my Y

312
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600

 

313
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,550

Line it is on this

314
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
Line it is on this
 

315
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,110
Line it is on this
side the east side of the grip she is

316
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,120
side the east side of the grip she is
 

317
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,230
side the east side of the grip she is
completely on the west side of the

318
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,240
completely on the west side of the
 

319
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,110
completely on the west side of the
grip when I shift my

320
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,120
grip when I shift my
 

321
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,470
grip when I shift my
weight all of a sudden my elbow is on

322
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:25,480
weight all of a sudden my elbow is on
 

323
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,670
weight all of a sudden my elbow is on
the other side of the grip my shoulders

324
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:28,680
the other side of the grip my shoulders
 

325
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,110
the other side of the grip my shoulders
on the other side of the grid so I'm

326
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,120
on the other side of the grid so I'm
 

327
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,670
on the other side of the grid so I'm
pivoting with more of a

328
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
pivoting with more of a
 

329
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,310
pivoting with more of a
push than the

330
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:41,320

 

331
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,470

pull more of a

332
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:45,480

 

333
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,750

push if she throws a

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:48,760
push if she throws a
 

335
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,310

here so i t con I'm in the

348
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:11,720
here so i t con I'm in the
 

349
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,509
here so i t con I'm in the
back as opposed

350
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:14,519
back as opposed
 

351
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,870
back as opposed
to not quite

352
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880

 

353
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,509

that so what I'm doing here with a

354
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
that so what I'm doing here with a
 

355
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,670
that so what I'm doing here with a
single point pivot is I'm moving to from

356
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
single point pivot is I'm moving to from
 

357
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,990
single point pivot is I'm moving to from
the negative side of the circle to the

358
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
the negative side of the circle to the
 

359
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,949
the negative side of the circle to the
positive side of the circle in my angle

360
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
positive side of the circle in my angle
 

361
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,150
positive side of the circle in my angle
deviation okay and that changes my

362
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
deviation okay and that changes my
 

363
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,750
deviation okay and that changes my
energy into a pushing energy versus a

364
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:36,760
energy into a pushing energy versus a
 

365
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,470
energy into a pushing energy versus a
pulling energy and that is important for

366
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
pulling energy and that is important for
 

367
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,870
pulling energy and that is important for
the second point when you use a pulling

368
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:43,880
the second point when you use a pulling
 

369
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,870
the second point when you use a pulling
energy on a rotation eventually that

370
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
energy on a rotation eventually that
 

371
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,230
energy on a rotation eventually that
pulling energy the oppos the equal and

372
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:49,240
pulling energy the oppos the equal and
 

373
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,310
pulling energy the oppos the equal and
opposite reaction is going to cut

374
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
opposite reaction is going to cut
 

375
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,470
opposite reaction is going to cut
through the shikaku of your stance of

376
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:55,480
through the shikaku of your stance of
 

377
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,470
through the shikaku of your stance of
your double pivot stance and you're

378
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
your double pivot stance and you're
 

379
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,629
your double pivot stance and you're
going to feel very very

380
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:00,639
going to feel very very
 

381
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,670
going to feel very very
weak um you're going to feel unable to

382
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
weak um you're going to feel unable to
 

383
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,310
weak um you're going to feel unable to
hold your balance against resistance now

384
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
hold your balance against resistance now
 

385
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,150
hold your balance against resistance now
this problem is neutralized by the

386
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,160
this problem is neutralized by the
 

387
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,590
this problem is neutralized by the
fedorite UK who will never pull on you

388
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
fedorite UK who will never pull on you
 

389
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,910
fedorite UK who will never pull on you
okay but every once in a while you still

390
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
okay but every once in a while you still
 

391
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,430
okay but every once in a while you still
see them mess up and you see the nogget

392
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:18,440
see them mess up and you see the nogget
 

393
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,990
see them mess up and you see the nogget
lose their balance okay

394
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,000
lose their balance okay
 

395
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,870
lose their balance okay
so if she's

396
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:23,880
so if she's
 

397
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,990
so if she's
doing um if she's going to do the double

398
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,000
doing um if she's going to do the double
 

399
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,310
doing um if she's going to do the double
pivot 10 con and you do that yeah you

400
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
pivot 10 con and you do that yeah you
 

401
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,790
pivot 10 con and you do that yeah you
never know that just swing your foot

402
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
never know that just swing your foot
 

403
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,430
never know that just swing your foot
around that one this is very common okay

404
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:36,440
around that one this is very common okay
 

405
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,310
around that one this is very common okay
do it again that okay this is this is

406
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
do it again that okay this is this is
 

407
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,230
do it again that okay this is this is
what Tenon is for everyone in the

408
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:43,240
what Tenon is for everyone in the
 

409
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,350
what Tenon is for everyone in the
fedorite world so R 10 con is she has to

410
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:46,360
fedorite world so R 10 con is she has to
 

411
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,310
fedorite world so R 10 con is she has to
shift her weight onto here all the

412
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
shift her weight onto here all the
 

413
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,750
shift her weight onto here all the
rotation happens there and then this is

414
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:50,760
rotation happens there and then this is
 

415
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,190
rotation happens there and then this is
a tactical repositioning of one's person

416
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,200
a tactical repositioning of one's person
 

417
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,949
a tactical repositioning of one's person
the other one the line of gravity is in

418
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
the other one the line of gravity is in
 

419
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,710
the other one the line of gravity is in
the middle of the feet as they swing

420
00:11:59,710 --> 00:11:59,720
the middle of the feet as they swing
 

421
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,750
the middle of the feet as they swing
around this way that's a double pivot

422
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:02,760
around this way that's a double pivot
 

423
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,310
around this way that's a double pivot
okay so if

424
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:05,320
okay so if
 

425
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,269
okay so if
she if if I have uh let's do the r

426
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:10,279
she if if I have uh let's do the r
 

427
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:13,829
she if if I have uh let's do the r
version okay so she's going to single

428
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
version okay so she's going to single
 

429
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,550
version okay so she's going to single
pivot and try to get as much as she can

430
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
pivot and try to get as much as she can
 

431
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,629
pivot and try to get as much as she can
on the other side of that Circle so she

432
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:19,639
on the other side of that Circle so she
 

433
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,509
on the other side of that Circle so she
can push this hand forward and I'm going

434
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:22,519
can push this hand forward and I'm going
 

435
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,509
can push this hand forward and I'm going
to try to pull her I'm trying to pull

436
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:24,519
to try to pull her I'm trying to pull
 

437
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,509
to try to pull her I'm trying to pull
her this way okay she got some pull in

438
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:28,519
her this way okay she got some pull in
 

439
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,590
her this way okay she got some pull in
there and there should be no pull in

440
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:30,600
there and there should be no pull in
 

441
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,350
there and there should be no pull in
there okay so this is why I was saying

442
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
there okay so this is why I was saying
 

443
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,870
there okay so this is why I was saying
you were double pivoting okay so here

444
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:35,880
you were double pivoting okay so here
 

445
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,870
you were double pivoting okay so here
here's what it is um you start pulling

446
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:39,880
here's what it is um you start pulling
 

447
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,150
here's what it is um you start pulling
on me you see that cuz my line of

448
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,160
on me you see that cuz my line of
 

449
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,150
on me you see that cuz my line of
gravity here that's the pull so when you

450
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,160
gravity here that's the pull so when you
 

451
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,030
gravity here that's the pull so when you
pull on me pull back on me I can't turn

452
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
pull on me pull back on me I can't turn
 

453
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,670
pull on me pull back on me I can't turn
do you see that if I push here and you

454
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:54,680
do you see that if I push here and you
 

455
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,110
do you see that if I push here and you
pull back on me it doesn't it's not me

456
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,120
pull back on me it doesn't it's not me
 

457
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,550
pull back on me it doesn't it's not me
going this way way cuz we turning that

458
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:01,560
going this way way cuz we turning that
 

459
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,110
going this way way cuz we turning that
way you

460
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
way you
 

461
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,829
way you
see so let's watch the difference I'll

462
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
see so let's watch the difference I'll
 

463
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,030
see so let's watch the difference I'll
try it again and I don't know what angle

464
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,040
try it again and I don't know what angle
 

465
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,470
try it again and I don't know what angle
is going to show it okay because my Mass

466
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:11,480
is going to show it okay because my Mass
 

467
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,110
is going to show it okay because my Mass
is always on the negative side of the

468
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,120
is always on the negative side of the
 

469
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,110
is always on the negative side of the
circle in the double

470
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,120
circle in the double
 

471
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,189
circle in the double
pivot you going

472
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:19,199
pivot you going
 

473
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,990
pivot you going
straight is

474
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
straight is
 

475
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,110
straight is
here right

476
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,120
here right
 

477
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,030
here right
there if I change that to a pull you

478
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,040
there if I change that to a pull you
 

479
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,350
there if I change that to a pull you
going back

480
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,360

 

481
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,430

eventually I am fighting that do you see

482
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:34,440
eventually I am fighting that do you see
 

483
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,030
eventually I am fighting that do you see
that and I can't turn and the more I

484
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,040
that and I can't turn and the more I
 

485
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,389
that and I can't turn and the more I
take this

486
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:39,399
take this
 

487
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,550
take this
away pull the more I lose that Integrity

488
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
away pull the more I lose that Integrity
 

489
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,389
away pull the more I lose that Integrity
on the other one there's no pull ability

490
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:49,399
on the other one there's no pull ability
 

491
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,110
on the other one there's no pull ability
you see and i t con into free space okay

492
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
you see and i t con into free space okay
 

493
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,269
you see and i t con into free space okay
there's no

494
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
there's no
 

495
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,150
there's no
rotation that I'm using

496
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,160
rotation that I'm using
 

497
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,069
rotation that I'm using
with my line of gravity in between my

498
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:01,079
with my line of gravity in between my
 

499
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:05,030
with my line of gravity in between my
two feet okay so let's see if we can

500
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
two feet okay so let's see if we can
 

501
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,069
two feet okay so let's see if we can
clean you up you got to get completely

502
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
clean you up you got to get completely
 

503
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,509
clean you up you got to get completely
to the other side and on one foot so you

504
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:10,519
to the other side and on one foot so you
 

505
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,829
to the other side and on one foot so you
got to step over

506
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:12,839
got to step over
 

507
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,110
got to step over
