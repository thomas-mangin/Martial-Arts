4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
with the ken we do these
 

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,310
with the ken we do these
spurs

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,320

 

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,030

and we try and get the pieces right

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,040

 

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,070

but what we're doing is like the walking

10
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080
but what we're doing is like the walking
 

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,109
but what we're doing is like the walking
this morning in there we're thinking

12
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
this morning in there we're thinking
 

13
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,470
this morning in there we're thinking
about

14
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,480
about
 

15
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,589
about
getting it correct but a lot of it we're

16
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
getting it correct but a lot of it we're
 

17
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,269
getting it correct but a lot of it we're
doing

18
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279

 

19
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,549

there's a blank

20
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559

 

21
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,590

and we might then make a mistake

22
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600

 

23
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,750

and it destroys us for a moment so you

24
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
and it destroys us for a moment so you
 

25
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,830
and it destroys us for a moment so you
pull yourself together

26
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840
pull yourself together
 

27
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,069
pull yourself together
hey ah

28
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
hey ah
 

29
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,069
hey ah
and then you try harder because you've

30
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
and then you try harder because you've
 

31
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,910
and then you try harder because you've
just made a mistake so you pull yourself

32
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
just made a mistake so you pull yourself
 

33
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,510
just made a mistake so you pull yourself
together

34
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
together
 

35
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,069
together
so you've then added another problem

36
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
so you've then added another problem
 

37
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,990
so you've then added another problem
because you've then added power

38
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
because you've then added power
 

39
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,029
because you've then added power
you've added strength you've added want

40
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
you've added strength you've added want
 

41
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,270

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,149
you've added lots of problems into the
suburi

44
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159

 

45
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,630
