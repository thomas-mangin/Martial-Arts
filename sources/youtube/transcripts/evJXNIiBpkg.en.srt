and the way you get as many reps in is
 

21
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,619
and the way you get as many reps in is
by isolating it from all the other

his energy right and then what what I
need to do is a third energies at

164
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:01,720
need to do is a third energies at
 

165
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,820
need to do is a third energies at
another point that I can vector off of

166
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:04,830
another point that I can vector off of
 

167
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,440
another point that I can vector off of
so this case is that round and that's

168
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,450
so this case is that round and that's
 

169
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,880
so this case is that round and that's
the first one that we're teaching but I

170
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:10,890
the first one that we're teaching but I
 

171
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,340
the first one that we're teaching but I
don't think as he's going right I think

172
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:14,350
don't think as he's going right I think
 

173
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,640
don't think as he's going right I think
you can get a third energy inside your

174
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:17,650
you can get a third energy inside your
 

175
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,510
you can get a third energy inside your
body too you see I'm doing that so off

176
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
body too you see I'm doing that so off
 

177
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,290
body too you see I'm doing that so off
of my other muscles my skeletal system

178
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:25,300
of my other muscles my skeletal system
 

179
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,960
of my other muscles my skeletal system
my spine all that kind of stuff so if

180
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:27,970
my spine all that kind of stuff so if
 

181
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,560
my spine all that kind of stuff so if
that's the case right go ahead you're

182
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:31,570
that's the case right go ahead you're
 

183
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,040
that's the case right go ahead you're
fine

184
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,050
fine
 

185
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,990
fine
right look at me like this so can I

186
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,000
right look at me like this so can I
 

187
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,040
right look at me like this so can I
still do it push yes right I can still

188
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,050
still do it push yes right I can still
 

189
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:41,520
still do it push yes right I can still
do it

190
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:41,530
do it
 

191
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,130
do it
but it's harder right and this is not

192
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:44,140
but it's harder right and this is not

I bet I have to bend my knees I have to
let the weight of my upper body spread

210
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:10,480
let the weight of my upper body spread
 

211
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,290
let the weight of my upper body spread
through my feet right so I feel the

212
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:13,300
through my feet right so I feel the
 

213

217
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,450
sure my arches aren't caving in that the
outside of my foot is down so energy is

218
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:21,460
outside of my foot is down so energy is
 

219
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,950

00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:30,009
single push do you see you have
 

323
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:32,460
single push do you see you have
connection on the single push right well

324
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,470
connection on the single push right well
 

325
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,850
connection on the single push right well
you just keep that dynamic keep that

326
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:35,860
you just keep that dynamic keep that
 

327
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,730
you just keep that dynamic keep that
dynamic she just let it go over there

328
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:38,740
dynamic she just let it go over there
 

329
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,420
dynamic she just let it go over there
right so he keeps Amy it's got to keep

330
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,430
right so he keeps Amy it's got to keep
 

331
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:48,769
right so he keeps Amy it's got to keep
moving okay

332
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:48,779

 

333
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:56,129

so let's do also next development is try

334
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:56,139
so let's do also next development is try
 

335
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:59,879
so let's do also next development is try
to remember your friction don't go any

336
00:09:59,879 --> 00:09:59,889
to remember your friction don't go any
 

337
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:02,009
to remember your friction don't go any
faster that you're losing your friction

338
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:02,019
faster that you're losing your friction
 

339
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,340
faster that you're losing your friction
so keep it so even though you're on the

340
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,350
so keep it so even though you're on the
 

341
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,949
so keep it so even though you're on the
outside right and you go to push on this

342
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:07,959
outside right and you go to push on this
 

343
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,710
outside right and you go to push on this
it shouldn't slide it's it's an

344
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
it shouldn't slide it's it's an
 

345
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,530
it shouldn't slide it's it's an
extension of that idea keep the

346
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:13,540
extension of that idea keep the
 

347
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,139
extension of that idea keep the
connection in there so even though I'm

348
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:16,149
connection in there so even though I'm
 

349
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,980
connection in there so even though I'm
not grabbing him I'm actually able to

350
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:19,990
not grabbing him I'm actually able to
 

351
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,860
not grabbing him I'm actually able to
turn him do you see that though right

352
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:24,870
turn him do you see that though right
 

353
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,799
turn him do you see that though right
you can look up on the outside you see

354
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:28,809
you can look up on the outside you see
 

355
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:32,490
you can look up on the outside you see
that it's doable in the same way that as

356
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:32,500
that it's doable in the same way that as
 

357

I'm going here I hear him on the inside

358
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:35,019
I'm going here I hear him on the inside
 

359
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:37,110
I'm going here I hear him on the inside
right so I lift my arm can slide if I

360
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
right so I lift my arm can slide if I
 

361
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,929
right so I lift my arm can slide if I
wanted to right but it can keep moving

362
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:39,939
wanted to right but it can keep moving
 

363
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,590
wanted to right but it can keep moving
in you see that it's the same thing then

364
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
in you see that it's the same thing then
 

365
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,160
in you see that it's the same thing then
you have to do with the disc

366
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,170
you have to do with the disc
 

367
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,220
you have to do with the disc
okay so you're just writing the energy

368
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:48,230
okay so you're just writing the energy
 

369
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,559
okay so you're just writing the energy
Here I am on the outside don't go around

about that so stop doing this because it
 

423
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:12,759
about that so stop doing this because it
does a couple things so we'll make a

00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:15,439
side note here is as you code you're
 

427
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:18,999
side note here is as you code you're
starting to toss the hot up whenever you

431
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:24,129
yield yield one way or another you're
starting to twist the heart and then now

432
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:24,139
starting to twist the heart and then now
 

433
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,979
starting to twist the heart and then now
you're decompressing it it's not swollen

434
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:26,989
you're decompressing it it's not swollen
 

435
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:32,990
you're decompressing it it's not swollen
okay so here stand so that it's

436
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,000
okay so here stand so that it's
 

437
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,920
okay so here stand so that it's
in the center okay don't do this stuff

438
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:36,930
in the center okay don't do this stuff
 

439
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,460
in the center okay don't do this stuff
this you you I don't want to say it's

440
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:40,470
this you you I don't want to say it's
 

441
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,160
this you you I don't want to say it's
not theoretically possible but

442
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,170
not theoretically possible but
 

443
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,910
not theoretically possible but
definitely if it is you are becoming

444
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:46,920
definitely if it is you are becoming
 

445
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,550
definitely if it is you are becoming
less martially efficient and it's going

446
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:49,560
less martially efficient and it's going
 

447
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,770
less martially efficient and it's going
to be really hard to get it there to

448
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:51,780
to be really hard to get it there to
 

449
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,410
to be really hard to get it there to
develop it from that point okay so back

450
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:54,420
develop it from that point okay so back
 

451
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,080
develop it from that point okay so back
