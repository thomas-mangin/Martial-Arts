pattern so if we look at I need to have

252
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:14,599
pattern so if we look at I need to have
 

253
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:15,390
pattern so if we look at I need to have
his

254
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:15,400
his
 

255
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,510
his
energy go past his

256
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:18,520
energy go past his
 

257
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,909
energy go past his
hand

258
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919

 

259
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,749

here his

260
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
here his
 

261
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,510
here his
hand cannot remain in front of his

262
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
hand cannot remain in front of his
 

263
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,150

264
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
body because then when you you push if
 

265
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,790
body because then when you you push if
you were able to you'd be pushing

266
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
you were able to you'd be pushing
 

267
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,670
you were able to you'd be pushing
against his y energy and if you could

268
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
against his y energy and if you could
 

269
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,230
against his y energy and if you could
overpower it you'd have him going in a

270
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
overpower it you'd have him going in a
 

271
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,990
overpower it you'd have him going in a
different kazushi not the E kazushi so I

272
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
different kazushi not the E kazushi so I
 

273
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,430
different kazushi not the E kazushi so I
have to move in a way that his hand is

274
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
have to move in a way that his hand is
 

275
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,830
have to move in a way that his hand is
not in front of his body you guys see

276
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
not in front of his body you guys see
 

277
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,430
not in front of his body you guys see
that so I have to take the first

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:27,480
energetically here I'm going to reach
 

513
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:37,790
energetically here I'm going to reach
for him and then yield to

514
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:37,800

 

515
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,430

it you understand you're doing that in

516
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:40,440
it you understand you're doing that in
 

517
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,110
it you understand you're doing that in
the whole form but it starts earlier on

518
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,120
the whole form but it starts earlier on
 

519
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,470
the whole form but it starts earlier on
so the very beginning let's just go you

00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
different so there's a it's going to go
 

531
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,470
different so there's a it's going to go
in first as I reach for it and then I'm

532
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
in first as I reach for it and then I'm
 

533
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,670
in first as I reach for it and then I'm
going to yield for

534
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:10,680
going to yield for
 

535
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,230
going to yield for
it

536
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
it
 

537
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,430
it
boom and turn and this is how he passes

538
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440

 

539
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:27,509

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:14,669

okay let's

572
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:14,679

 

573
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:19,270

go all right the next one is the

574
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
go all right the next one is the
 

575
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,669
go all right the next one is the
projection so again the Marshall viable

576
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:22,679
projection so again the Marshall viable
 

577
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,270
projection so again the Marshall viable
concept is that you always project in

578
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
concept is that you always project in
 

579
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,549
concept is that you always project in
the center you that's what actually and

580
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
the center you that's what actually and
 

581
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,830
the center you that's what actually and
then energetically it's the center

582
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:30,840
then energetically it's the center
 

583
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,270
then energetically it's the center

okay so in this case as he comes in and

588
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:39,640
okay so in this case as he comes in and
 

589
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,549
okay so in this case as he comes in and
at that point where I deviate and I'm

590
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:41,559
at that point where I deviate and I'm
 

591
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,149
at that point where I deviate and I'm
out here here is where his tonden is

592
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:45,159
out here here is where his tonden is
 

593
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,710
out here here is where his tonden is
generated by his Yang energy so that

594
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:47,720
generated by his Yang energy so that
 

595
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,990
generated by his Yang energy so that
means it goes into me and it's going to

596
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
means it goes into me and it's going to
 

597
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,190
means it goes into me and it's going to
form the lower tonden field and I keep

598
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
form the lower tonden field and I keep
 

599
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,549
form the lower tonden field and I keep
that and as it does it in me it'll do it

600
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:55,559
that and as it does it in me it'll do it
 

601
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,909
that and as it does it in me it'll do it
in him and that's what I move so I know

602
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
in him and that's what I move so I know
 

603
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,909
in him and that's what I move so I know
it looks like I'm just shoving up his

604
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
it looks like I'm just shoving up his
 

605
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,630
it looks like I'm just shoving up his
skeleton but that's actually going over

606
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
skeleton but that's actually going over
 

607
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,630
skeleton but that's actually going over
his tonden you see that it's going over

608
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:09,640
his tonden you see that it's going over
 

609
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,070
his tonden you see that it's going over
his

610
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,080
his
 

611
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,750
his
tonden and that is no more correct than

612
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
tonden and that is no more correct than
 

613
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,789
tonden and that is no more correct than
when you came in front of his tonden

614
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:15,799
when you came in front of his tonden
 

615
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:19,310
when you came in front of his tonden
with that waist turned you see so when

616
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:19,320
with that waist turned you see so when
 

617
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,029
with that waist turned you see so when
you get to that spot and you feel that

618
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,039
you get to that spot and you feel that
 

619
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,350
you get to that spot and you feel that
you are look how I dropped you see and I

620
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:26,360
you are look how I dropped you see and I
 

621
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,750
