91
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,570
is very much almost like a psychology
nowadays so it's almost irrelevant what

but the seed was there okay that you
could look at the mind

106

pre-modern times they never did really
 

113
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,630
pre-modern times they never did really
okay they never did when you get deeper

114
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:05,640
okay they never did when you get deeper
 

115
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,610

they didn't really but there was room
for it hence what we have today

122
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,000
for it hence what we have today
 

123
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,570

133
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,330
only a kind of philosophy and of the
mind it's just there's too much history

134
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:32,340
mind it's just there's too much history
 

135
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,050
mind it's just there's too much history
and too much obviousness to deny that

136
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,060
and too much obviousness to deny that
 

137
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,390
and too much obviousness to deny that
there is a body component and more

138
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
there is a body component and more
 

139
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,009
there is a body component and more
importantly there's an energetic

140
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:40,019
importantly there's an energetic
 

141
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,770
importantly there's an energetic
component and so you have to deal with

142
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:42,780
component and so you have to deal with
 

143
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,649
component and so you have to deal with
those things okay Aikido

00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:24,840
okay that's key
 

171
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,710
okay that's key
and it has a body component so let's

172
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:27,720
and it has a body component so let's
 

173
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,930
and it has a body component so let's
just take this one and what are you

174
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:29,940
just take this one and what are you
 

175
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,330
just take this one and what are you
trying to do in this tradition

176
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:32,340
trying to do in this tradition
 

177
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,810
trying to do in this tradition
well it's holding that

178
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:35,820
well it's holding that
 

179
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,469
well it's holding that
there was a Dao the Dow split and

180
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:39,479
there was a Dao the Dow split and
 

181
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,290
there was a Dao the Dow split and
manifested yin and yang and from yin and

182
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:42,300
manifested yin and yang and from yin and
 

183
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,629
manifested yin and yang and from yin and
yang the rest of the world was created

184
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
yang the rest of the world was created
 

185
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,330
yang the rest of the world was created
the rest of the cosmos was created

186
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:47,340
the rest of the cosmos was created
 

187
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,050
the rest of the cosmos was created
well this is a kind of uh

188
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,060
well this is a kind of uh
 

189
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,330
well this is a kind of uh
it's hard to say is it doulas is it

190
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:53,340
it's hard to say is it doulas is it
 

191
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,210
it's hard to say is it doulas is it
monus it's both okay because you can't

192
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:56,220
monus it's both okay because you can't
 

193
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,689
monus it's both okay because you can't
reverse it so when I lose the

194
00:04:59,689 --> 00:04:59,699
reverse it so when I lose the
 

195
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,510
reverse it so when I lose the
distinction between yin and yang I get

196
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:02,520
distinction between yin and yang I get
 

197
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,749
distinction between yin and yang I get
back to the nameless okay so what you're

198
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
back to the nameless okay so what you're
 

199
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,469
back to the nameless okay so what you're
trying to do in Aikido

200
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:09,479
trying to do in Aikido
 

201
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,430
trying to do in Aikido
is in my verbiage

202
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:12,440
is in my verbiage
 

203
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,689
is in my verbiage
transcend yin and Young

204
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:14,699
transcend yin and Young
 

205
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,330
transcend yin and Young
you're trying to do that energetically

206
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:17,340
you're trying to do that energetically
 

207
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,390
you're trying to do that energetically
when you energetically transcend yin and

208
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
when you energetically transcend yin and
 

209
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,590
when you energetically transcend yin and
yang

210
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
yang
 

211
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,270
yang
physically

212
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
physically
 

213
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,290
physically
you'll generate a non-contesting

214
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:26,300
you'll generate a non-contesting
 

215
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,490
you'll generate a non-contesting
marshall tactical application

216
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:31,500

 

217
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,150

you will also generate an IQ adhesion

218
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,160
you will also generate an IQ adhesion
 

219
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,150
you will also generate an IQ adhesion
here because two things will become one

220
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160

 

221
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,029

and at a spiritual level the two minds

222
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:44,039
and at a spiritual level the two minds
 

223
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,550
and at a spiritual level the two minds
will also be reconciled so just like

224
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
will also be reconciled so just like
 

225
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,650
will also be reconciled so just like
there's two things and they're going to

226
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:48,660
there's two things and they're going to
 

227
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,870
there's two things and they're going to
become one thing the two minds will

228
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
become one thing the two minds will
 

229
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,409
become one thing the two minds will
become one thing too okay

230
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:54,419
become one thing too okay
 

231
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,529
become one thing too okay
meaning if I can generate

232
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:57,539
meaning if I can generate
 

233
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,170
meaning if I can generate
a Reconciliation again and yang I'm

234
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:00,180
a Reconciliation again and yang I'm
 

235
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,529
a Reconciliation again and yang I'm
going to have aiki at an energetic level

236
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:02,539
going to have aiki at an energetic level
 

237
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:06,770
going to have aiki at an energetic level
at the spiritual level my mind will

238
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:06,780
at the spiritual level my mind will
 

239
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,810
at the spiritual level my mind will
actually

240
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:07,820
actually
 

241
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,249
actually
organize itself

242
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:10,259
organize itself
 

243
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,110
organize itself
so to speak

244
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,120
so to speak
 

245
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,850
so to speak
in a way very much like a tradition

246
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:15,860
in a way very much like a tradition
 

247
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,830
in a way very much like a tradition
that's working just on the mind just on

248
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
that's working just on the mind just on
 

249
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,469
that's working just on the mind just on
the mind of Enlightenment gets to do

250
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:21,479
the mind of Enlightenment gets to do
 

251
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,850
the mind of Enlightenment gets to do
okay so you can in this tradition hey

252
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:25,860
okay so you can in this tradition hey
 

253
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,770
okay so you can in this tradition hey
you can develop that in lightly's mind

254
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:30,780

 

255
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,930

by working on yourself energetically

256
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:32,940
by working on yourself energetically
 

257
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,330
by working on yourself energetically
okay and so that that is what you're

258
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,340
okay and so that that is what you're
 

259
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,309
okay and so that that is what you're
trying to do now

260
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:37,319
trying to do now
 

261
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,189
trying to do now
how do you do that

262
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:40,199
how do you do that
 

263
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,230
how do you do that
well

264
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
well
 

265
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,529
well
you have this idea

266
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:45,539
you have this idea
 

267
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,650
you have this idea
that the way to reconcile yin and yawn

268
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:48,660
that the way to reconcile yin and yawn
 

269
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:56,090
that the way to reconcile yin and yawn
because it's often represented like this

270
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,100

 

271
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,969

if you spin these things

272
00:06:58,969 --> 00:06:58,979
if you spin these things
 

273
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,270
if you spin these things
okay so for example let us just say that

274
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,280
okay so for example let us just say that
 

275
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,430
okay so for example let us just say that
this is Young

276
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:04,440
this is Young
 

277
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,670
this is Young
and this one is here

278
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
and this one is here
 

279
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,730
and this one is here
okay so the vertical line is Young and

280
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:10,740
okay so the vertical line is Young and
 

281
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,969
okay so the vertical line is Young and
the horizontal line is Yin well if I

282
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:13,979
the horizontal line is Yin well if I
 

283
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,290
the horizontal line is Yin well if I
rotate

284
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,300
rotate
 

285
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,290
rotate
the young Line is now horizontal making

286
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:18,300
the young Line is now horizontal making
 

287
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,110
the young Line is now horizontal making
it Yin so theoretically I transition

288
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
it Yin so theoretically I transition
 

289
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,189
it Yin so theoretically I transition
Yong to Yin you see that I made that and

290
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
Yong to Yin you see that I made that and
 

291
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,589
Yong to Yin you see that I made that and
now they just keep expanding this

292
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
now they just keep expanding this
 

293
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,230
now they just keep expanding this
concept and they go if I keep spinning

294
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
concept and they go if I keep spinning
 

295
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,770
concept and they go if I keep spinning
it see Yang keeps turning into Yin Yin

296
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:33,780
it see Yang keeps turning into Yin Yin
 

297
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,930
it see Yang keeps turning into Yin Yin
keeps turning into young they no longer

298
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:35,940
keeps turning into young they no longer
 

299
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,390
keeps turning into young they no longer
exist in this kind of polar opposition

300
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
exist in this kind of polar opposition
 

301
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,790
exist in this kind of polar opposition
to each other and I keep mixing it and

302
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
to each other and I keep mixing it and
 

303
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,210
to each other and I keep mixing it and
mixing it okay and as I mix them I

304
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:44,220
mixing it okay and as I mix them I
 

305
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,950
mixing it okay and as I mix them I
change their values ever they don't

306
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:45,960
change their values ever they don't
 

307
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,650
change their values ever they don't
maintain their oppositional

308
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:48,660
maintain their oppositional
 

309
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,629
maintain their oppositional
nature

310
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
nature
 

311
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,909
nature
they start to transcend because they

312
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:52,919
they start to transcend because they
 

313
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,830
they start to transcend because they
lose their dichotomous relationship to

314
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:54,840
lose their dichotomous relationship to
 

315
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,189
lose their dichotomous relationship to
each other so what Aikido does in this

316
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:58,199
each other so what Aikido does in this
 

317
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,450
each other so what Aikido does in this
simple understanding is it rotates them

318
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:02,460
simple understanding is it rotates them
 

319
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,390
simple understanding is it rotates them
both as I just did two dimensionally

320
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:05,400
both as I just did two dimensionally
 

321
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,710
both as I just did two dimensionally
this way

322
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
this way
 

323
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,309
this way
and also this way it rotates them and

324
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
and also this way it rotates them and
 

325
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,370
and also this way it rotates them and
then it takes that whole cross

326
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:13,380
then it takes that whole cross
 

327
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,070
then it takes that whole cross
and it is spinning it horizontally

328
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
and it is spinning it horizontally
 

329
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,369
and it is spinning it horizontally
vertically as it's moving it on a spiral

330
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:19,379
vertically as it's moving it on a spiral
 

331
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,210
vertically as it's moving it on a spiral
horizontally vertically okay and this is

332
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:23,220
horizontally vertically okay and this is
 

333
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,170
horizontally vertically okay and this is
going to reconcile yin and yang you're

334
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,180
going to reconcile yin and yang you're
 

335
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,210
going to reconcile yin and yang you're
going to get it you'll see an adhesion

336
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,220
going to get it you'll see an adhesion
 

337
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,389
going to get it you'll see an adhesion

I feel the bouncing and now I'm going to
 

597
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,310
I feel the bouncing and now I'm going to
start rotating it so the field in this

598
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
start rotating it so the field in this
 

599
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,410
start rotating it so the field in this
case because you grab my right hand the

600
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:54,420
case because you grab my right hand the
 

601
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,530
case because you grab my right hand the
rotating cross is going to turn to the

602
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:57,540
rotating cross is going to turn to the
 

603
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,269
rotating cross is going to turn to the
right first before it comes to the left

605
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,730

so it goes to the right it doesn't

629
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,710
now I'm going to go the other way with
the spiraling rotating cross so it's

going to go to the left whoa comes
around it went up and then it goes down

634
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,300
around it went up and then it goes down
 

635
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,930
around it went up and then it goes down
home and this is where the technique

636
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:47,940
home and this is where the technique
 

637
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,930
home and this is where the technique
ends on the down so I've done both sides

638
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:50,940
ends on the down so I've done both sides
 

639
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,730

Grace I'm not gonna go that way I go
this way

672
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:11,640
this way
 

673
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,630
this way
I'm not going to go this way I go that

674
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
I'm not going to go this way I go that
 

675
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:29,990
I'm not going to go this way I go that
way

676
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000

 

677
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,150

my mind

678
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
my mind
 

679
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,850
my mind
you'll start to feel it if you can do it

680
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:37,860

 

681
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,010

you'll hit

682
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,020
you'll hit
 

683
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:59,510
you'll hit
that state of mind you want

684
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520

 

685
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,810

all right let's try it

686
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:02,820

 

687
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,169

okay so the question that my Desi

688
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:06,179
okay so the question that my Desi
 

689
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,110
okay so the question that my Desi
brought up is uh they're getting pushed

690
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
brought up is uh they're getting pushed
 

691
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,049
brought up is uh they're getting pushed
over okay uh why is that happening

692
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:12,059
over okay uh why is that happening
 

693
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,990
over okay uh why is that happening
because she cannot internalize the young

694
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,000
because she cannot internalize the young
 

695
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,230
because she cannot internalize the young
energy if you cannot internalize the

696
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
energy if you cannot internalize the
 

697
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,669
energy if you cannot internalize the
young energy

698
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
young energy
 

699
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,330
young energy
you cannot generate the tonden field you

700
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:23,340
you cannot generate the tonden field you
 

701
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,630
you cannot generate the tonden field you
won't get the rebounding young energy

702
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
won't get the rebounding young energy
 

703
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,510
won't get the rebounding young energy
you won't be able to convert Yong to Yin

704
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
you won't be able to convert Yong to Yin
 

705
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,450
you won't be able to convert Yong to Yin
and then yin to Yang and then you won't

706
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:32,460
and then yin to Yang and then you won't
 

707
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,430
and then yin to Yang and then you won't
be able to rotate the tandoned field

708
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:34,440
be able to rotate the tandoned field
 

709
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,490
be able to rotate the tandoned field
because it doesn't exist and the 2G do

710
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:37,500
because it doesn't exist and the 2G do
 

711
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,549
because it doesn't exist and the 2G do
not exist either okay all that happens

712
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:40,559
not exist either okay all that happens
 

713
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,490
not exist either okay all that happens
is that the young energy is coming up

714
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:43,500
is that the young energy is coming up
 

715
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,549
is that the young energy is coming up

angle
 

755
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,270
angle
you have you can probably generate more

you have you can probably generate more
 

757
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,150
you have you can probably generate more
young energy than I could when I tried

758
