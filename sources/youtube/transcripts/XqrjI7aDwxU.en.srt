she's going there she goes
so if you slow down the film she moves

68
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
so if you slow down the film she moves
 

69
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,310
so if you slow down the film she moves
first

70
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
first
 

71
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,389
first
but it looks like i moved first but i

72
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
but it looks like i moved first but i
 

73
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,749
but it looks like i moved first but i
didn't move first but

74
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
didn't move first but

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:58,870
didn't move first but
i'm not waiting for you

76
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880

 

77
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,990

okay so her intent

108
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
okay so her intent
 

109
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,550
okay so her intent

is what i use to get the
 

111
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,470
is what i use to get the
tilt going so if we're doing cookie hole

112
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
tilt going so if we're doing cookie hole
 

113
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,550
tilt going so if we're doing cookie hole
right i get the tilt going it's the same

114
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
right i get the tilt going it's the same
 

115
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,470
right i get the tilt going it's the same
thing

116
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
thing
 

117
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,430
thing
so her intent won't move out of the way

118
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
so her intent won't move out of the way
 

119
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,030
so her intent won't move out of the way
but you still have to have your ik

120
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
but you still have to have your ik
 

121
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,869
but you still have to have your ik
adhesion so you can actually

122
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
adhesion so you can actually
 

123
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,869
adhesion so you can actually
get that extra inch of over penetration

124
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
get that extra inch of over penetration
 

125
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,790
get that extra inch of over penetration
okay so i'm not going to go here like

126
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
okay so i'm not going to go here like
 

127
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,910
okay so i'm not going to go here like
this because she can just come in again

128
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
this because she can just come in again
 

129
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,990
this because she can just come in again
i have to be able to yield and stick

130
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
i have to be able to yield and stick
 

131
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,750
i have to be able to yield and stick
enough to get her past me okay so you're

132
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
enough to get her past me okay so you're
 

133
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,309
enough to get her past me okay so you're
same way as i go to the cookie hole this

134
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
same way as i go to the cookie hole this
 

135
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,550
same way as i go to the cookie hole this
hand is doing an ip adhesion on this

136
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
hand is doing an ip adhesion on this
 

137
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,190
hand is doing an ip adhesion on this
side

138
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
side
 

139
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,830
side
and then this one picks up for the pokey

140
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
and then this one picks up for the pokey
 

141
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,869
and then this one picks up for the pokey
projection

142
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
projection
 

143
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,110
projection
so the same thing when she goes i seek

144
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
so the same thing when she goes i seek
 

145
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,229
so the same thing when she goes i seek
that other hand

146
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
that other hand
 

147
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,390
that other hand
okay no matter where that other hand is

148
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
okay no matter where that other hand is
 

149
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,869
okay no matter where that other hand is
so let's say it's coming up to my

150
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
so let's say it's coming up to my
 

151
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,750
so let's say it's coming up to my
other part you see my body goes whoa and

152
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
other part you see my body goes whoa and
 

153
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,589
other part you see my body goes whoa and
then you find the

154
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
then you find the
 

155
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,869
then you find the
uh adhesion and the projection so i seek

156
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
uh adhesion and the projection so i seek
 

157
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,110
uh adhesion and the projection so i seek
the other hand and do the same technique

158
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
the other hand and do the same technique
 

159
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,589
the other hand and do the same technique
okay don't just focus on this hand

160
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
okay don't just focus on this hand
 

161
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,949
okay don't just focus on this hand
because that hand might punch you or

162
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
because that hand might punch you or
 

163
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,350
because that hand might punch you or
something okay so you seek the other

164
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
something okay so you seek the other
 

165
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,149
something okay so you seek the other
hand

166
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
hand
 

167
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:10,789
hand
and you do your internal aspects where

168
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799

 

169
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,830

if you get on

170
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
if you get on
 

171
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,229
if you get on
in the same way let's say i'm going here

172
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
in the same way let's say i'm going here
 

173
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,749
in the same way let's say i'm going here
and this one is just

174
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
and this one is just
 

175
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,790
and this one is just
too strong then yield to the outside

176
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800

 

177
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,950

just like all your other techniques so

178
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
just like all your other techniques so
 

179
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,710
just like all your other techniques so
don't be afraid to go like

180
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
don't be afraid to go like
 

181
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,870
don't be afraid to go like
too strong home then do it on the

182
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
too strong home then do it on the
 

183
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,469
too strong home then do it on the
outside okay

184
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
outside okay
 

185
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,310
outside okay
don't always have to be on the inside

186
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
don't always have to be on the inside
 

187
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,510
don't always have to be on the inside
just see contact wherever you are okay

188
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
just see contact wherever you are okay
 

189
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,350
just see contact wherever you are okay
all right so let's work on the body

190
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
all right so let's work on the body
 

191
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,510
all right so let's work on the body
reading okay so as she goes i

192
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
reading okay so as she goes i
 

193
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,870
reading okay so as she goes i
i'm already uh reaching for that

194
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
i'm already uh reaching for that
 

195
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,790
i'm already uh reaching for that
connection right so she goes and i'm

196
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
connection right so she goes and i'm
 

197
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,390
connection right so she goes and i'm
already reaching for it

198
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
already reaching for it
 

199
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,590
already reaching for it
so this time when i feel her go i'm

200
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
so this time when i feel her go i'm
 

201
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,870
so this time when i feel her go i'm
gonna just push

202
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
gonna just push
 

203
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,990
gonna just push
okay so i'm using the same ground vector

204
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
okay so i'm using the same ground vector
 

205
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,030
okay so i'm using the same ground vector
as she goes and

206
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
as she goes and
 

207
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,070
as she goes and
push and then

208
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
push and then
 

209
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,870
push and then
i have to hit her in her intention right

210
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
i have to hit her in her intention right
 

211
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,590
i have to hit her in her intention right
so that

212
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
so that
 

213
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,990
so that
i hold this back and then she's the one

214
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
i hold this back and then she's the one
 

215
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,070
i hold this back and then she's the one
that takes her feet forward and causes

216
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
that takes her feet forward and causes
 

217
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,350
that takes her feet forward and causes
the balance you get it

218
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
the balance you get it
 

219
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,950
the balance you get it
i'm not i'm not shoving you okay so

220
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
i'm not i'm not shoving you okay so
 

221
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,110
i'm not i'm not shoving you okay so
as she goes i just hold that and then

222
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
as she goes i just hold that and then
 

223
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,510
as she goes i just hold that and then
her i allow her legs to come underneath

224
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
her i allow her legs to come underneath
 

225
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,070
her i allow her legs to come underneath
okay

226
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
okay
 

227
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,629
okay
so that's the idea

228
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639

 

229
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,710

and this just i want you to be calmer

230
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
and this just i want you to be calmer
 

231
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,070
and this just i want you to be calmer
because you're trying to go like this

232
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
because you're trying to go like this
 

233
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,510
because you're trying to go like this
you tend to root yourself

234
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
you tend to root yourself
 

235
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,710
you tend to root yourself
okay so you're just calm

236
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720

 

237
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,430

and we're still working on drawing from

238
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
and we're still working on drawing from
 

239
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,830
and we're still working on drawing from
outside the square range right so i'm

240
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
outside the square range right so i'm
 

241
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:50,830
outside the square range right so i'm
here

242
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840

 

243
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,909

whoa

244
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919

 

245
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,189

okay all right let's try it okay so

246
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
okay all right let's try it okay so
 

247
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,629
okay all right let's try it okay so
i have my mid-foot vector he goes

248
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
i have my mid-foot vector he goes
 

249
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,390
i have my mid-foot vector he goes
and that's that's what i'm doing so do

250
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
and that's that's what i'm doing so do
 

251
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,909
and that's that's what i'm doing so do
you see how my hands stay

252
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
you see how my hands stay
 

253
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,510
you see how my hands stay
there okay he leaves my hand

254
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
there okay he leaves my hand
 

255
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,790
there okay he leaves my hand
okay so as opposed to i go then

256
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
okay so as opposed to i go then
 

257
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,710
okay so as opposed to i go then
then i'm going to start drawing i need i

258
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
then i'm going to start drawing i need i
 

259
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,550
then i'm going to start drawing i need i
want to finish this test that's what the

260
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
want to finish this test that's what the
 

261
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,590
want to finish this test that's what the
drill is

262
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
drill is
 

263
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,870
drill is
finish your task and then

264
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
finish your task and then
 

265
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,990
finish your task and then
drop okay because usually as we go for

266
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
drop okay because usually as we go for
 

267
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,230
drop okay because usually as we go for
a retention issue is you're like here

268
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
a retention issue is you're like here
 

269
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,309
a retention issue is you're like here
but you didn't get out of the way and

270
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
but you didn't get out of the way and
 

271
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,469
but you didn't get out of the way and
you're not really out of a retention

272
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
you're not really out of a retention
 

273
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,189
you're not really out of a retention
uh dilemma okay so this is kind of just

274
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
uh dilemma okay so this is kind of just
 

275
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,710
uh dilemma okay so this is kind of just
an abstract like

276
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
an abstract like
 

277
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,870
an abstract like
occupy myself fully of course i'm

278
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
occupy myself fully of course i'm
 

279
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,629
occupy myself fully of course i'm
working on the ground vector of course

280
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
working on the ground vector of course
 

281
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,670
working on the ground vector of course
i'm reading the body

282
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
i'm reading the body
 

283
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,990
i'm reading the body
but i want to do this fully and then

284
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
but i want to do this fully and then
 

285
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,590
but i want to do this fully and then
draw fully

286
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600

 

287
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,430

close so i want you so it triggers you

288
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440

 

289
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,990

okay all right let's go okay so when we

290
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
okay all right let's go okay so when we
 

291
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,830
okay all right let's go okay so when we
had the last drone he's going for the

292
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
had the last drone he's going for the
 

293
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,350
had the last drone he's going for the
gun and i moved out of the way what

294
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
gun and i moved out of the way what
 

295
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,550
gun and i moved out of the way what
happens is

296
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
happens is
 

297
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,350
happens is
that you go hurry up and get to the gun

298
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
that you go hurry up and get to the gun
 

299
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,990
that you go hurry up and get to the gun
and now you're

300
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
and now you're
 

301
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,230
and now you're
in here but you're still not quite out

302
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
in here but you're still not quite out
 

303
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,070
in here but you're still not quite out
of that dilemma do you see that

304
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
of that dilemma do you see that
 

305
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,469
of that dilemma do you see that
and now you're drawing and oh now i

306
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
and now you're drawing and oh now i
 

307
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,749
and now you're drawing and oh now i
gotta defend myself

308
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
gotta defend myself
 

309
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,110
gotta defend myself
okay defend the weapon so

310
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
okay defend the weapon so
 

311
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,350
okay defend the weapon so
you have to train yourself to be calm

312
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
you have to train yourself to be calm
 

313
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,790
you have to train yourself to be calm
enough to get yourself

314
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
enough to get yourself
 

315
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,029
enough to get yourself
out of the retention dilemma so as we're

316
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
out of the retention dilemma so as we're
 

317
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,110
out of the retention dilemma so as we're
doing the last one i come here bull

318
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
doing the last one i come here bull
 

319
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,309
doing the last one i come here bull
project he's going

320
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
project he's going
 

321
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,189
project he's going
that way you see that's what i want i

322
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
that way you see that's what i want i
 

323
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,070
that way you see that's what i want i
don't stop

324
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
don't stop
 

325
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,749
don't stop
him uh i don't disengage from him before

326
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
him uh i don't disengage from him before
 

327
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,469
him uh i don't disengage from him before
he's

328
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
he's
 

329
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,230
he's
go done going that way okay so

330
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
go done going that way okay so
 

331
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,270
go done going that way okay so
uh this is just a drill to

332
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
uh this is just a drill to
 

333
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,990
uh this is just a drill to
uh micro drill where he's coming in and

334
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
uh micro drill where he's coming in and
 

335
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,029
uh micro drill where he's coming in and
you're going to go like this

336
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
you're going to go like this
