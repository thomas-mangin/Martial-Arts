i'm gonna go
like a cushion all right

44
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799

 

45
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,870

you also he can fall very gently

46
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
you also he can fall very gently
 

47
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,749
you also he can fall very gently
underneath me here

48
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759

 

49
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,789

also you can turn in the

50
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
also you can turn in the
 

51
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,830
also you can turn in the
in the soft high breakfall so that's

52
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
in the soft high breakfall so that's
 

53
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,990
in the soft high breakfall so that's
what allows him to set up the forward

54
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
what allows him to set up the forward
 

55
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,950
what allows him to set up the forward
break ball okay but we don't want that

56
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
break ball okay but we don't want that
 

57
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,749
break ball okay but we don't want that
because

58
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
because
 

59
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,789
because
where he's turning for that front high

60
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
where he's turning for that front high
 

61
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,950
where he's turning for that front high
breakfall

62
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
breakfall
 

63
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,789
breakfall
is where he can do any one of those

64
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
is where he can do any one of those
 

65
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,429
is where he can do any one of those
counters he's not in my control

66
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439

 

67
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,710

so what we want to do instead

68
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
so what we want to do instead
 

69
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,749
so what we want to do instead
is start to tilt him

70
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
is start to tilt him
 

71
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,990
is start to tilt him
and he never passes back through here

72
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
and he never passes back through here
 

73
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,990
and he never passes back through here
he's on this tilt here

74
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
he's on this tilt here
 

75
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,910
he's on this tilt here
then we want to do it at a certain

76
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
then we want to do it at a certain
 

77
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,350
then we want to do it at a certain
timing so as i tilt him

78
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
timing so as i tilt him
 

79
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,390
timing so as i tilt him
if i stop his forward progress he can

80
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
if i stop his forward progress he can
 

81
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,270
if i stop his forward progress he can
still

82
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
still
 

83
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,190
still
turn on this foot and then do any of all

84
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
turn on this foot and then do any of all
 

85
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,830
turn on this foot and then do any of all
those other things

86
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
those other things
 

87
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,869
those other things
so you have to check him with his

88
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
so you have to check him with his
 

89
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,190
so you have to check him with his
forward progress

90
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200

 

91
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,190

you have to keep his energy going that

92
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
you have to keep his energy going that
 

93
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,790
you have to keep his energy going that
way

94
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
way
 

95
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,110
way
as you tilting him tilting

96
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
as you tilting him tilting
 

97
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,430
as you tilting him tilting
but moving so he moves go ahead and move

98
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
but moving so he moves go ahead and move
 

99
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,750
but moving so he moves go ahead and move
he's going like this

100
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760

 

101
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,869

then he can't turn the foot then he

102
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
then he can't turn the foot then he
 

103
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,270
then he can't turn the foot then he
can't

104
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
can't
 

105
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,070
can't
counter because he never passes through

106
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
counter because he never passes through
 

107
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,150
counter because he never passes through
his posture

108
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
his posture
 

109
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,229
his posture
he can't turn because energy's going

110
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
he can't turn because energy's going
 

111
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,910
he can't turn because energy's going
that way and he can't

112
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
that way and he can't
 

113
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,550
that way and he can't
posture because i never bring his head

114
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
posture because i never bring his head
 

115
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,949
posture because i never bring his head
back inside his base of support

116
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
back inside his base of support
 

117
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,830
back inside his base of support
so he has to go forward

118
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840

 

119
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,030

until forward

120
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
until forward
 

121
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,070
until forward
and tilt

122
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080

 

123
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,110

okay let's try that okay so

124
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
okay let's try that okay so
 

125
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,270
okay let's try that okay so
she's allowed to keep going and there's

126
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
she's allowed to keep going and there's
 

127
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,149
she's allowed to keep going and there's
the

128
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
the
 

129
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,229
the
that's the kazushi you want you see do

130
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
that's the kazushi you want you see do
 

131
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,750
that's the kazushi you want you see do
you get it and so

132
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
you get it and so
 

133
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,030
you get it and so
john's observation was she

134
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
john's observation was she
 

135
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,630
john's observation was she
she's already falling

136
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640
she's already falling
 

137
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,070
she's already falling
you don't really need the throw and

138
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
you don't really need the throw and
 

139
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,229
you don't really need the throw and
that's exactly right okay

140
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
that's exactly right okay
 

141
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,710
that's exactly right okay
so but the throw is doing something else

142
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
so but the throw is doing something else
 

143
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,509
so but the throw is doing something else
okay

144
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
okay
 

145
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,149
okay
so i'll use

146
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159

 

147
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,390

so as he's coming around boom

148
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
so as he's coming around boom
 

149
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,750
so as he's coming around boom
i have to be wary of this arm

150
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
i have to be wary of this arm
 

151
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,789
i have to be wary of this arm
okay and my technique

152
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
okay and my technique
 

153
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,949
okay and my technique
needs to happen in front of this

154
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
needs to happen in front of this
 

155
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,070
needs to happen in front of this
do you see not

156
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080

 

157

me
 

229
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,990
me
okay so that's what the

230
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
okay so that's what the

232
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
second part of the throat does he's
 

233
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,390
second part of the throat does he's
already falling in the first part

234
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
already falling in the first part
 

235
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,710
already falling in the first part
in the second part i'm doing a body lock

236
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
in the second part i'm doing a body lock
 

237
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,670
in the second part i'm doing a body lock
and project him out from under me he he

238
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
and project him out from under me he he
 

239
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,189
and project him out from under me he he
doesn't get to choose just

240
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
doesn't get to choose just
 

241
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,150
doesn't get to choose just
we're here he doesn't get to choose out

242
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
we're here he doesn't get to choose out
 

243
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,790
we're here he doesn't get to choose out
he goes

244
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
he goes
 

245
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:07,110
he goes
okay so we go in take his balance

246
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
okay so we go in take his balance
 

247
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,150
okay so we go in take his balance
not underneath you not underneath

248
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
not underneath you not underneath
 

249
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,150
not underneath you not underneath
not underneath you he doesn't get to

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
not underneath you he doesn't get to
 

251
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,510
not underneath you he doesn't get to
choose that

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
choose that
 

253
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,870
choose that
so

254
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880

 

255
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,150

you see that that's a counter
 

263
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,110
you see that that's a counter
and it's because you didn't understand

264
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
and it's because you didn't understand
 

265
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,230
and it's because you didn't understand
the elbow check

266
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
the elbow check
 

267
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,790
the elbow check
in the technique okay so i'm doing

268
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
in the technique okay so i'm doing
 

269
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,870
in the technique okay so i'm doing
everything we'll go slow so you can see

270
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
everything we'll go slow so you can see
 

271
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,790
everything we'll go slow so you can see
i know that i got to get that arm

272
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
i know that i got to get that arm
 

273
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,309
i know that i got to get that arm
behind my uh rib cage

274
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
behind my uh rib cage
 

275
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,870
behind my uh rib cage
okay that that's where the body lock

276
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
okay that that's where the body lock
 

277
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,870
okay that that's where the body lock
exists that's where the body

278
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
exists that's where the body
 

279
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,309
exists that's where the body
body lock exists if i have the gap

280
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
body lock exists if i have the gap
 

281
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,350
body lock exists if i have the gap
if i have a gap there's no body lock

282
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
if i have a gap there's no body lock
 

283
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,230
if i have a gap there's no body lock
you're

284
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
you're
 

285
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,670
you're
just accelerating him okay

286
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
just accelerating him okay
 

287
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,790
just accelerating him okay
so this part of the technique i have to

288
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
so this part of the technique i have to
 

289
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,629
so this part of the technique i have to
feel that elbow

290
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
feel that elbow
 

291
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,589
feel that elbow
behind my rib cage that's that's the

292
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
behind my rib cage that's that's the
 

293
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,469
behind my rib cage that's that's the
technique

294
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
technique
 

295
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,430
technique
and usually when you don't feel that

296
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
and usually when you don't feel that
 

297
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,430
and usually when you don't feel that
it's because you moved in front of the

298
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
it's because you moved in front of the
 

299
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,270
it's because you moved in front of the
you're now in front of luke and there's

300
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
you're now in front of luke and there's
 

301
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,270
you're now in front of luke and there's
no check on his elbow so this arm can

302
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
no check on his elbow so this arm can
 

303
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,909
no check on his elbow so this arm can
come around

304
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
come around
 

305
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,950
come around
okay so it's still different that he's

306
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
okay so it's still different that he's
 

307
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,990
okay so it's still different that he's
down

308
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,000

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,710
i know that i gotta get on the other
side of this scene

314
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
side of this scene
 

315
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,870
side of this scene
in front of in front of his hip if i'm

316

i can't put it somewhere else because i

320
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
i can't put it somewhere else because i
 

321
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,270
i can't put it somewhere else because i
didn't really clear the guard so

322
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
