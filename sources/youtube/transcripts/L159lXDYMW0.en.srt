23
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:08,520
So I'm saying that even if this technique becomes law,
 

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,350

00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:14,360

 

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,510

that's all. It

00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:18,520

 

28
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,350

varies from country to country, so it

00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360

 

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,710

might turn into a battle. That can't be helped,

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,469
might turn into a battle. That can't be helped,

00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479

 

33
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:58,830

so it will flow. Kotori
