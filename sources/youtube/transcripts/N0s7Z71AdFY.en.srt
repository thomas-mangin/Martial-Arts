grip yep okay it's even
 

175
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,069
grip yep okay it's even
easier on this one okay so instead of

176

what you did is this but you use the the
 

181
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,030
what you did is this but you use the the
two hands

182

caught for

196
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320

 

197
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:11,990

see using both

198
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000

 

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,590

hands that more down need more

200
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
hands that more down need more
 

201
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,470
hands that more down need more
down there you

202
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480

 

203
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,990

go so that one you you got to do

204
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,000
go so that one you you got to do
 

205
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,030
go so that one you you got to do
something different if you want that if

206
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
something different if you want that if
 

207
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,350
something different if you want that if
you want that little

208
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360

 

209
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,230

if you're if you're going to take that

210
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,240
if you're if you're going to take that
 

211
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,350
if you're if you're going to take that
one then you can't do that one this way

212
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:36,360
one then you can't do that one this way
 

213
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,509
one then you can't do that one this way
it's fighting that you get

214
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
it's fighting that you get
 

215
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,790
it's fighting that you get
it this one has to be

216
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800
it this one has to be
 

217
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,750
it this one has to be
tighter see that

218
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
tighter see that
 

219
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,670
tighter see that
okay if you do it don't pick anything

220
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:48,680
okay if you do it don't pick anything
 

221
00:12:48,680 --> 00:13:02,750
okay if you do it don't pick anything
you should just feel what's happening

222
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:02,760

 

223
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,790

so what happened on that one if you did

224
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
so what happened on that one if you did
 

225
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,150
so what happened on that one if you did
want her to do the

226
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,160
want her to do the
 

227
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:14,829
want her to do the
roll why didn't

228
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:14,839

 

229
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,829

she uh my angle with the stick hand

230
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839
she uh my angle with the stick hand
 

231
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,470
she uh my angle with the stick hand
stick hand was then I don't know it's

232
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:21,480
stick hand was then I don't know it's
 

233
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,230
stick hand was then I don't know it's
too too high the other hand hi okay so

234
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:25,240
too too high the other hand hi okay so
 

235
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,550
too too high the other hand hi okay so
same thing like you want their hip to go

236
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:27,560
same thing like you want their hip to go
 

237
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,590
same thing like you want their hip to go
over then the head head has to lower so

238
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:30,600
over then the head head has to lower so
 

239
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,590
over then the head head has to lower so
on this one her front hip was too high

240
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
on this one her front hip was too high
 

241
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,790
on this one her front hip was too high
if you lower the that arm maybe you

242
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
if you lower the that arm maybe you
 

243
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,590
if you lower the that arm maybe you
lower that more and then that'll be

244
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:38,600
lower that more and then that'll be
 

245
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:57,710
lower that more and then that'll be
enough to get the hip over

246
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:57,720

 

247
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,030

okay take your stick is kind of

248
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040

 

249
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,710

wavering as he grabs your stick is doing

250
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
wavering as he grabs your stick is doing
 

251
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,189
wavering as he grabs your stick is doing
you get that like why would it do that

252
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
you get that like why would it do that
 

253
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,629
you get that like why would it do that
if he grabs and then I connect to him

254
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:12,639
if he grabs and then I connect to him
 

255
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,790

is it why should my stick have any kind
 

259
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,829
is it why should my stick have any kind
of wavering at all you see that you

260
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
of wavering at all you see that you
 

261
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,790

come back let's start over remember
 

999
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,270
come back let's start over remember
again here trap you're trapping the Joe

1000
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:34,280
again here trap you're trapping the Joe
 

1001
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,109
again here trap you're trapping the Joe
is what you're

1002
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:37,119

 

1003
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,829

doing so what I mean by trapping is you

1004
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:40,839
doing so what I mean by trapping is you
 

1005
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:42,710
doing so what I mean by trapping is you
make open-ended

1006
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:42,720
make open-ended
 

1007
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,309
make open-ended
triangles do you get it and then the the

1008
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:46,319
triangles do you get it and then the the
 

1009
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:49,069
triangles do you get it and then the the
then the thing is there so I'm moving

1010
00:53:49,069 --> 00:53:49,079
then the thing is there so I'm moving
 

1011
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:51,549
then the thing is there so I'm moving
like that and then I catch it you see

1012
00:53:51,549 --> 00:53:51,559
like that and then I catch it you see
 

1013
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:55,109
like that and then I catch it you see
then I'll have

1014
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:55,119

 

1015
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,630

it is it is the same thing with the

1016
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:57,640
it is it is the same thing with the
 

1017
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,990
it is it is the same thing with the
punches that's what I do got to touch

1018
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,000
punches that's what I do got to touch
 

1019
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,190
punches that's what I do got to touch
his Center but I'm not ever going to

1020
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:03,200
his Center but I'm not ever going to
 

1021
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,109
his Center but I'm not ever going to
catch like this so I'm here like that

1022
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:06,119
catch like this so I'm here like that
 

1023
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:09,069
catch like this so I'm here like that
you see and then quack I can get the the

1024
00:54:09,069 --> 00:54:09,079
you see and then quack I can get the the
 

1025
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,710
you see and then quack I can get the the
arm bar there in that in that little

1026
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:10,720
arm bar there in that in that little
 

1027
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,230
arm bar there in that in that little
trap that's there you get it so same

1028
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:13,240
trap that's there you get it so same
 

1029
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,190
trap that's there you get it so same
thing

1030
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:14,200
thing
 

1031
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,230
thing
here don't go for the Joe go for the

1032
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:17,240
here don't go for the Joe go for the
 

1033
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:26,870
here don't go for the Joe go for the
deviation and you feel the energy okay
