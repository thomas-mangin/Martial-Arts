00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,829

patching.

2
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:07,839

 

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,390

See, it throws in there.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
See, it throws in there.
 

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,709
See, it throws in there.
That's it. It throws in there. If I do I

6
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
That's it. It throws in there. If I do I
 

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,630
That's it. It throws in there. If I do I
do no more than swapping over.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:20,640

 

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,509

It needs very little power cuz what he

10
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
It needs very little power cuz what he
 

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,429
It needs very little power cuz what he
does is he's actually the one going,

12
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
does is he's actually the one going,
 

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,670
does is he's actually the one going,
"Oh, I shouldn't have done that." cuz

14
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:27,680
"Oh, I shouldn't have done that." cuz
 

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,389
"Oh, I shouldn't have done that." cuz
he's so he throws his own balance

16
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
he's so he throws his own balance
 

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,190
he's so he throws his own balance
off balance.

18
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200

 

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,869

He's thinking, "Yeah, I think I can

20
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
He's thinking, "Yeah, I think I can
 

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,590
He's thinking, "Yeah, I think I can
still get his leg." But what he doesn't

22
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
still get his leg." But what he doesn't
 

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,630
still get his leg." But what he doesn't
realize is what he doesn't realize is

24
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
realize is what he doesn't realize is
 

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,910
realize is what he doesn't realize is
I'm already going well before

26
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
I'm already going well before
 

27
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,750
I'm already going well before
I just want to clear that up. I can read

28
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
I just want to clear that up. I can read
 

29
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,470
I just want to clear that up. I can read
his mind.

30
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480

 

31
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,549

What I do is at my length I just drop

32
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
What I do is at my length I just drop
 

33
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,430
What I do is at my length I just drop
this real quick there. see them

34
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
this real quick there. see them
 

35
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,670
this real quick there. see them
before he before he's even got in the

36
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
before he before he's even got in the
 

37
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,390
before he before he's even got in the
full cat. I don't want to give you too

38
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
full cat. I don't want to give you too
 

39
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,789
full cat. I don't want to give you too
much away

40
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
much away
 

41
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,230
much away
but that point there

42
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
but that point there
 

43
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,310
but that point there
of

44
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
of
 

45
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,870
of
that

46
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
that
 

47
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,910
that
is

48
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920

 

49
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,490

the same point in the nagging

50
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:25,500

 

51
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,270

[Applause]

52
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
[Applause]
 

53
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,749
[Applause]
the same point in the kagi. All these

54
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
the same point in the kagi. All these
 

55
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,710
the same point in the kagi. All these
things take time. But as here, if you

56
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
things take time. But as here, if you
 

57
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,310
things take time. But as here, if you
come here, right, he's he's comfortable,

58
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
come here, right, he's he's comfortable,
 

59
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,069
come here, right, he's he's comfortable,
isn't he? You know what I mean? He's

60
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
isn't he? You know what I mean? He's
 

61
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,069
isn't he? You know what I mean? He's
there. He's locked, but he's locked. So,

62
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
there. He's locked, but he's locked. So,
 

63
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,950
there. He's locked, but he's locked. So,
if he tries to come up, he shouldn't

64
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
if he tries to come up, he shouldn't
 

65
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,469
if he tries to come up, he shouldn't
come up. But your aim eventually is to

66
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
come up. But your aim eventually is to
 

67
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,830
come up. But your aim eventually is to
have now the projection of extension

68
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840

 

69
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,590

mind

70
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
mind
 

71
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,749
mind
breath position.

72
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759

 

73
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,749

So what I'm going to do now is I'm going

74
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going
 

75
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,469
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going
to put my mind breath

76
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
to put my mind breath
 

77
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,469
to put my mind breath
on

78
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
on
 

79
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,510
on
this projection. So when he comes up,

80
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
this projection. So when he comes up,
 

81
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,869
this projection. So when he comes up,
he's got that feeling

82
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
he's got that feeling
 

83
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,949
he's got that feeling
that feeling of the only escape route is

84
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
that feeling of the only escape route is
 

85
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:28,070
that feeling of the only escape route is
that way. He knows that the escape route

86
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080

 

87
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,750

is up. So here it's up and I can push

88
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
is up. So here it's up and I can push
 

89
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,470
is up. So here it's up and I can push
down. He doesn't actually see this

90
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,480
down. He doesn't actually see this
 

91
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,350
down. He doesn't actually see this
escape route.

92
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
escape route.
 

93
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,030
escape route.
See, there's no escape route there, is

94
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
See, there's no escape route there, is
 

95
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,350
See, there's no escape route there, is
there?

96
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
there?
 

97
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,630
there?
>> No.

98
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
>> No.
 

99
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,830
>> No.
So I've got to make him and me feel that

100
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
So I've got to make him and me feel that
 

101
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,350
So I've got to make him and me feel that
that is the way and it has to be before

102
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
that is the way and it has to be before
 

103
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,350
that is the way and it has to be before
this knee comes in.

104
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360

 

105
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,270

I've already shown you that this is

106
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
I've already shown you that this is
 

107
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,270
I've already shown you that this is
important. If you go from here to here,

108
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
important. If you go from here to here,
 

109
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,869
important. If you go from here to here,
you've missed that face there.

110
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879

 

111
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,030

See here there. See, he doesn't think of

112
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
See here there. See, he doesn't think of
 

113
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,350
See here there. See, he doesn't think of
coming up. What he thinks of you got

114
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
coming up. What he thinks of you got
 

115
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,030
coming up. What he thinks of you got
lovely extension in his shoulder, but

116
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
lovely extension in his shoulder, but
 

117
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,470
lovely extension in his shoulder, but
that doesn't bother me cuz this is the

118
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
that doesn't bother me cuz this is the
 

119
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,070
that doesn't bother me cuz this is the
only clear route for him to go to. Then

120
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
only clear route for him to go to. Then
 

121
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,110
only clear route for him to go to. Then
when you add the knee, he goes away.

122
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
when you add the knee, he goes away.
 

123
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,599
when you add the knee, he goes away.
Hopefully Ind.
