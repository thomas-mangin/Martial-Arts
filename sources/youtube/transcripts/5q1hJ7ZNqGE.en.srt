1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,310

So

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,320
So
 

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,030
So
when when we train

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,040
when when we train
 

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,749
when when we train
we actually have to train

6
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:07,759
we actually have to train
 

7
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,190
we actually have to train
uh that means we have a goal in mind. It

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
uh that means we have a goal in mind. It
 

9
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,470
uh that means we have a goal in mind. It
should be the next thing you need uh in

10
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,480
should be the next thing you need uh in
 

11
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,029
should be the next thing you need uh in
the progression of your skill and

12
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
the progression of your skill and
 

13
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,870
the progression of your skill and
everything we do should be oriented

14
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:18,880
everything we do should be oriented
 

15
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,109
everything we do should be oriented
towards the attainment of that skill.

16
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
towards the attainment of that skill.
 

17
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,509
towards the attainment of that skill.
That is training. Okay. Uh practicing is

18
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
That is training. Okay. Uh practicing is
 

19
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,029
That is training. Okay. Uh practicing is
when you're just doing something

20
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
when you're just doing something
 

21
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,150
when you're just doing something
uh over and over again. Um we don't want

22
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160
uh over and over again. Um we don't want
 

23
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,229
uh over and over again. Um we don't want
to practice. Okay. So, as I mentioned on

24
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239
to practice. Okay. So, as I mentioned on
 

25
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,389
to practice. Okay. So, as I mentioned on
the thread,

26
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
the thread,
 

27
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,910
the thread,
um

28
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
um
 

29
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,389
um
you don't want to accumulate bad reps

30
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
you don't want to accumulate bad reps
 

31
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,229
you don't want to accumulate bad reps
because that's what you get good at.

32
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
because that's what you get good at.
 

33
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,430
because that's what you get good at.
You're only good at what you repeat. Um

34
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
You're only good at what you repeat. Um
 

35
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,190
You're only good at what you repeat. Um
the universe doesn't know the difference

36
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
the universe doesn't know the difference
 

37
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,110
the universe doesn't know the difference
between that was a bad rep or this was a

38
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
between that was a bad rep or this was a
 

39
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,590
between that was a bad rep or this was a
good rep. just reinforces whatever you

40
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
good rep. just reinforces whatever you
 

41
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,150
good rep. just reinforces whatever you
were doing. Okay, this is one reason why

42
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
were doing. Okay, this is one reason why
 

43
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,349
were doing. Okay, this is one reason why
again at the micro level uh if I'm

44
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
again at the micro level uh if I'm
 

45
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,389
again at the micro level uh if I'm
constantly daily um practicing

46
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
constantly daily um practicing
 

47
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,630
constantly daily um practicing
contestation, I get pretty freaking good

48
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
contestation, I get pretty freaking good
 

49
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,910
contestation, I get pretty freaking good
at contestation. And so I spend more

50
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
at contestation. And so I spend more
 

51
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,550
at contestation. And so I spend more
time practicing contestation, less time

52
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
time practicing contestation, less time
 

53
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,710
time practicing contestation, less time
practicing non-contestation. It's going

54
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
practicing non-contestation. It's going
 

55
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,310
practicing non-contestation. It's going
to be very hard to get good at

56
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
to be very hard to get good at
 

57
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,030
to be very hard to get good at
non-contestation. All right. Hence all

58
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
non-contestation. All right. Hence all
 

59
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,270
non-contestation. All right. Hence all
the four disciplines, hence the bedrock

60
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
the four disciplines, hence the bedrock
 

61
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,070
the four disciplines, hence the bedrock
practices because they fill up their

62
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
practices because they fill up their
 

63
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,910
practices because they fill up their
your day with the problem of

64
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
your day with the problem of
 

65
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,510
your day with the problem of
non-contestation.

66
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
non-contestation.
 

67
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,870
non-contestation.
We're not unconsciously or consciously

68
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
We're not unconsciously or consciously
 

69
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,109
We're not unconsciously or consciously
repeating more reps in non-contest in

70
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
repeating more reps in non-contest in
 

71
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,670
repeating more reps in non-contest in
contestation. Okay. So likewise, when

72
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
contestation. Okay. So likewise, when
 

73
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,870
contestation. Okay. So likewise, when
we're doing this, we can't we can't keep

74
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
we're doing this, we can't we can't keep
 

75
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,469
we're doing this, we can't we can't keep
doing the wrong stuff. So, as I've

76
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
doing the wrong stuff. So, as I've
 

77
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,789
doing the wrong stuff. So, as I've
mentioned before, when I teach shooting

78
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
mentioned before, when I teach shooting
 

79
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,910
mentioned before, when I teach shooting
to people and they will not do the

80
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
to people and they will not do the
 

81
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,710
to people and they will not do the
fundamentals as I'm telling them, we

82
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
fundamentals as I'm telling them, we
 

83
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,550
fundamentals as I'm telling them, we
just done. We're we're done because

84
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
just done. We're we're done because
 

85
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,230
just done. We're we're done because
you're just wasting ammunition right now

86
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
you're just wasting ammunition right now
 

87
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,990
you're just wasting ammunition right now
and you're getting good at doing crappy

88
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
and you're getting good at doing crappy
 

89
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,950
and you're getting good at doing crappy
 Okay. Uh it's a lot different in

90
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
Okay. Uh it's a lot different in
 

91
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,109
Okay. Uh it's a lot different in
law enforcement because we have, you

92
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
law enforcement because we have, you
 

93
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,030
law enforcement because we have, you
know, we have like that paramilitary

94
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
know, we have like that paramilitary
 

95
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,830
know, we have like that paramilitary
organization and we get to and get in

96
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
organization and we get to and get in
 

97
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,270
organization and we get to and get in
their face, you know, and they go,

98
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
their face, you know, and they go,
 

99
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,789
their face, you know, and they go,
"What's what's the matter? You got a

100
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
"What's what's the matter? You got a
 

101
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,150
"What's what's the matter? You got a
problem with me? All right. you

102
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
problem with me? All right. you
 

103
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,910
problem with me? All right. you
eyeballing me now and all that kind of

104
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
eyeballing me now and all that kind of
 

105
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,670
eyeballing me now and all that kind of
stuff. Why don't you just do what I say?

106
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
stuff. Why don't you just do what I say?
 

107
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,110
stuff. Why don't you just do what I say?
What you got a character issue? You

108
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
What you got a character issue? You
 

109
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,030
What you got a character issue? You
know, okay, we're not going to do that.

110
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
know, okay, we're not going to do that.
 

111
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,910
know, okay, we're not going to do that.
But what we do is like what coaches do

112
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
But what we do is like what coaches do
 

113
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,110
But what we do is like what coaches do
and coaches will reel you in and get you

114
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
and coaches will reel you in and get you
 

115
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,309
and coaches will reel you in and get you
and dial you in. Okay, your good coaches

116
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
and dial you in. Okay, your good coaches
 

117
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,390
and dial you in. Okay, your good coaches
like Tristan, I told you like he's

118
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
like Tristan, I told you like he's
 

119
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,390
like Tristan, I told you like he's
playing with that that one coach, Coach

120
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
playing with that that one coach, Coach
 

121
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,589
playing with that that one coach, Coach
Reed, and he needs Tristan to get to

122
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
Reed, and he needs Tristan to get to
 

123
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,309
Reed, and he needs Tristan to get to
another level of play. And it's this

124
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
another level of play. And it's this
 

125
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,869
another level of play. And it's this
combination somewhere in between law law

126
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879
combination somewhere in between law law
 

127
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,990
combination somewhere in between law law
enforcement, paramilitary, and uh you

128
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
enforcement, paramilitary, and uh you
 

129
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,229
enforcement, paramilitary, and uh you
know your your good coach who's going,

130
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
know your your good coach who's going,
 

131
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,430
know your your good coach who's going,
we're going to work on what we need to

132
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
we're going to work on what we need to
 

133
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,070
we're going to work on what we need to
work on. Okay. But he did eventually

134
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
work on. Okay. But he did eventually
 

135
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,150
work on. Okay. But he did eventually
make Tristan go, "Hey, Trist, you're

136
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
make Tristan go, "Hey, Trist, you're
 

137
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,589
make Tristan go, "Hey, Trist, you're
like a black hole. Tristan, you're a

138
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,599
like a black hole. Tristan, you're a
 

139
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,110
like a black hole. Tristan, you're a
black hole." Which because he wants him

140
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
black hole." Which because he wants him
 

141
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,990
black hole." Which because he wants him
to pass the ball uh when he drives and

142
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
to pass the ball uh when he drives and
 

143
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,670
to pass the ball uh when he drives and
three, he gets a threeon-one. He wants

144
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
three, he gets a threeon-one. He wants
 

145
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,589
three, he gets a threeon-one. He wants
him to find the open man. And he's like,

146
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
him to find the open man. And he's like,
 

147
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,509
him to find the open man. And he's like,
"Tristan, you're a black hole." And he

148
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
"Tristan, you're a black hole." And he
 

149
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,030
"Tristan, you're a black hole." And he
kept saying, he's Tristan, come over

150
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
kept saying, he's Tristan, come over
 

151
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,670
kept saying, he's Tristan, come over
here. Come over here. Tell me, coach,

152
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
here. Come over here. Tell me, coach,
 

153
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,910
here. Come over here. Tell me, coach,
I'm a black hole. Coach, I'm a black

155
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,550
I'm a black hole. Coach, I'm a black
hole. Okay, got the idea? All right. So,

156
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
hole. Okay, got the idea? All right. So,
 

157
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,630
hole. Okay, got the idea? All right. So,
we're we have to float somewhere around

158
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
we're we have to float somewhere around
 

159
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,589
we're we have to float somewhere around

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
Okay? So, what were we feeling in this
 

169
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,869
Okay? So, what were we feeling in this
drill?

170
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
drill?
 

171
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,509
drill?
Anything at all? Bring it to a conscious

172
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
Anything at all? Bring it to a conscious
 

173
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,030
Anything at all? Bring it to a conscious
level. Yes.

174
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040

 

175
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:45,190

Okay. Um, let's see. Let's go.

176
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200

 

177
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,630

again.
Freeze. Okay. Is there any pressure on

182
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
Freeze. Okay. Is there any pressure on
 

183
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,830
Freeze. Okay. Is there any pressure on
you right now?

184
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
you right now?
 

185
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,070
you right now?
Just a tiny bit. Everyone understand how

186
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
Just a tiny bit. Everyone understand how
 

187
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,869
Just a tiny bit. Everyone understand how
low the the spinal displacement is right

188
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
low the the spinal displacement is right
 

189
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,949
low the the spinal displacement is right
now.

190
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
now.
 

191
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,830
now.
Does your pinky normally do that?

192
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840

 

193
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,789

Okay. So, probably not. But there's

194
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
Okay. So, probably not. But there's
 

195
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,270
Okay. So, probably not. But there's
already tension in the tendon. Do do you

196
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
already tension in the tendon. Do do you
 

197
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,830
already tension in the tendon. Do do you
see that? But we're not we're not aware

198
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
see that? But we're not we're not aware
 

199
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,949
see that? But we're not we're not aware
of it. Okay. So, we'll do we'll bring

200
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
of it. Okay. So, we'll do we'll bring
 

201
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,830
of it. Okay. So, we'll do we'll bring
some awareness to it.

202
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840

 

203
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,070

Okay. And again, real quick from

Okay. And again, real quick from
 

205
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,870
Okay. And again, real quick from
yesterday as he's driving, drive, drive,

207
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,030
yesterday as he's driving, drive, drive,
drive, drive. Um, my hand shape, what's

208
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
drive, drive. Um, my hand shape, what's
 

209
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,230
drive, drive. Um, my hand shape, what's
on the other side of the grip in no way

210
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
on the other side of the grip in no way
 

211
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,510
on the other side of the grip in no way
can maintain positional integrity.

212
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
can maintain positional integrity.
 

213
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,350
can maintain positional integrity.
Does everyone understand that? What's on

214
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
Does everyone understand that? What's on
 

215
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,230
Does everyone understand that? What's on
the other side of his grip is not

216
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
the other side of his grip is not
 

217
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,749
the other side of his grip is not
helping

218
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
helping
 

219
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,110
helping
my wrist stay in space in the same

220
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
my wrist stay in space in the same
 

221
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,150
my wrist stay in space in the same
place. It's not possible. It doesn't

222
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
place. It's not possible. It doesn't
 

223
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,629
place. It's not possible. It doesn't
have a a jet engine that's pulling me

224
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
have a a jet engine that's pulling me
 

225
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,909
have a a jet engine that's pulling me
that way. Do you understand? Yet in my

226
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
that way. Do you understand? Yet in my
 

227
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,469
that way. Do you understand? Yet in my
unconscious contestation,

228
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
unconscious contestation,
 

229
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,790
unconscious contestation,
I am bringing flexion into this that has

230
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
I am bringing flexion into this that has
 

231
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,390
I am bringing flexion into this that has
nothing to do

232
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
nothing to do
 

233
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,029
nothing to do
with that. Do you got it? Does that make

234
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
with that. Do you got it? Does that make
 

235
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,110
with that. Do you got it? Does that make
sense? Okay. Here's though. Extend that

236
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
sense? Okay. Here's though. Extend that
 

237
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,950
sense? Okay. Here's though. Extend that
idea.

238
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960

 

239
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,189

I'm here like that. That was not

240
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
I'm here like that. That was not
 

241
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,790
I'm here like that. That was not
necessary. This flexion was not

242
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
necessary. This flexion was not
 

243
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,790
necessary. This flexion was not
necessary. And what I want to put before

244
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
necessary. And what I want to put before
 

245
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,670
necessary. And what I want to put before
you is

246
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
you is
 

247
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,990
you is
this forearm flexion is not necessary.

248
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
this forearm flexion is not necessary.
 

249
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,310
this forearm flexion is not necessary.
So think about it.

250
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
So think about it.
 

251
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,110
So think about it.
What does your forearm muscles do

252
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
What does your forearm muscles do
 

253
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,710
What does your forearm muscles do
mechanically? Yes, it it closes my

254
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
mechanically? Yes, it it closes my
 

255
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,310
mechanically? Yes, it it closes my
fingers.

256
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
fingers.
 

257
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,029
fingers.
Is the ability to close or open my

258
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
Is the ability to close or open my
 

259
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,189
Is the ability to close or open my
fingers have anything to do with my

260
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
fingers have anything to do with my
 

261
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,909
fingers have anything to do with my
wrist staying in the same vertical

262
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
wrist staying in the same vertical
 

263
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,550
wrist staying in the same vertical
plane? It doesn't. Do Do you get it? But

264
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
plane? It doesn't. Do Do you get it? But
 

265
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,830
plane? It doesn't. Do Do you get it? But
yet I flexed it. I flexed them. Okay.

266
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
yet I flexed it. I flexed them. Okay.
 

267
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,909
yet I flexed it. I flexed them. Okay.
Does that make sense? Okay. Now, what

268
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
Does that make sense? Okay. Now, what
 

269
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,870
Does that make sense? Okay. Now, what
does my bicep and tricep muscles do to

270
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
does my bicep and tricep muscles do to
 

271
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,990
does my bicep and tricep muscles do to
bend my arm? Extend my arm.

272
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
bend my arm? Extend my arm.
 

273
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,430
bend my arm? Extend my arm.
Does that have is anyone trying to bend

274
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
Does that have is anyone trying to bend
 

275
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,550
Does that have is anyone trying to bend
my arm or stop me from extending my arm

276
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
my arm or stop me from extending my arm
 

277
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,870
my arm or stop me from extending my arm
in this drill? No. But I'm flexing them.

278
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
in this drill? No. But I'm flexing them.
 

279
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,150
in this drill? No. But I'm flexing them.
Okay. So,

280
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
Okay. So,
 

281
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,350
Okay. So,
what's happening is I enter into the

282
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
what's happening is I enter into the
 

283
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,230
what's happening is I enter into the
contestation and I start overall flexing

284
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
contestation and I start overall flexing
 

285
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,270
contestation and I start overall flexing
my muscles. that tension comes in and it

286
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
my muscles. that tension comes in and it
 

287
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,150
my muscles. that tension comes in and it
doesn't have anything to do. So my my

288
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
doesn't have anything to do. So my my
 

289
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,629
doesn't have anything to do. So my my
hand has nothing to do with that

290
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
hand has nothing to do with that
 

291
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,870
hand has nothing to do with that
ability. My forearm has nothing to do

292
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
ability. My forearm has nothing to do
 

293
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,510
ability. My forearm has nothing to do
with that ability.

294
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
with that ability.
 

295
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:55,110
with that ability.
My tricep bicep has nothing to do drive.

296
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120

 

297
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,710

What is keeping that in space at a

298
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
What is keeping that in space at a
 

299
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,629
What is keeping that in space at a
minimum? What I want you to understand

300
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
minimum? What I want you to understand
 

301
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,110
minimum? What I want you to understand
it's not any of these muscles.

302
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
it's not any of these muscles.
 

303
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,550
it's not any of these muscles.
I have to risk releasing them. Okay,

304
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
I have to risk releasing them. Okay,
 

305
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,189
I have to risk releasing them. Okay,
does that make sense? All right, so

306
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
does that make sense? All right, so
 

307
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,350
does that make sense? All right, so
you're going to do the following drill.

308
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
you're going to do the following drill.
 

309
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,510
you're going to do the following drill.
You're going to uh drive. Drive. He has

313
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,670
to drive. I am going to shake my hand.
I'm going to wiggle my fingers.

314
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
I'm going to wiggle my fingers.
 

315
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,990
I'm going to wiggle my fingers.
Okay. I'm going to shake my whole arm.

316
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay. I'm going to shake my whole arm.
 

317
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,909
Okay. I'm going to shake my whole arm.
Don't go so high because he'll lose or

318
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
Don't go so high because he'll lose or
 

319
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,390
Don't go so high because he'll lose or

the coach the coach is setting you up.
Do it like this so we get the result we

398
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
Do it like this so we get the result we
 

399
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,550
Do it like this so we get the result we

400
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
want. Okay. So when I shook my arms,
 

401
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,509
want. Okay. So when I shook my arms,
what did I say not to do?

402
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
what did I say not to do?
 

403
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,870
what did I say not to do?
not to make too big a deviation. The

404
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
not to make too big a deviation. The
 

405
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,230
not to make too big a deviation. The
reason why is push. And you can see how

406
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
reason why is push. And you can see how
 

407
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,310
reason why is push. And you can see how
you can get your power into it, right?

408
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
you can get your power into it, right?
 

409
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,230
you can get your power into it, right?
Keep pushing. You're going to get tired.

410
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240

411
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,310
Keep pushing. You're going to get tired.
Keep pushing. But once I go like here,

412
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
Keep pushing. But once I go like here,
 

413
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,949
Keep pushing. But once I go like here,
she can't ever get her power into it. Do

414
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:44,959
she can't ever get her power into it. Do
 

415
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,430

418
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
trying to take force off of her. Uh,
 

419
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,990
trying to take force off of her. Uh,
does that make sense? So when I'm

training?
No, that that's not important. We didn't

606
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,480
No, that that's not important. We didn't
 

607
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,710
No, that that's not important. We didn't
even talk about that yesterday. Not so

608
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
even talk about that yesterday. Not so
 

609
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,510
even talk about that yesterday. Not so

important here.
 

611
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,150
important here.
Do you do you see that? Do you see the

612
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
Do you do you see that? Do you see the
 

613
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,789
Do you do you see that? Do you see the
angling? Okay. That the shoulders are

614
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:14,799
angling? Okay. That the shoulders are
 

615
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,430
angling? Okay. That the shoulders are
this one's forward. Do you got it? Okay.

616
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
this one's forward. Do you got it? Okay.
 

617
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,310
this one's forward. Do you got it? Okay.
Now, why

618
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
Now, why
 

619
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,110
Now, why
there's something else?

620
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
there's something else?
 

621
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,430
there's something else?
He's He's obviously trying not to be

622
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
He's He's obviously trying not to be
 

623
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,750
He's He's obviously trying not to be
turned. Do you see that? So, he

624
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:27,760
turned. Do you see that? So, he
 

625
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,950
turned. Do you see that? So, he
contested against the turn that he felt.

626
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:30,960
contested against the turn that he felt.
 

627
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,549
contested against the turn that he felt.
Okay. Now go to what's making him

628
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
Okay. Now go to what's making him
 

629
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,789
Okay. Now go to what's making him
turnable

630
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:36,799
turnable
 

631
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,430
turnable
because when we contest we start the

632
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,440
because when we contest we start the
 

633
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,430
because when we contest we start the
whole rippling

634
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
whole rippling
 

635
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,150
whole rippling

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
we have the non-contestation and it
 

639
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,830
we have the non-contestation and it
ripples out the contestation ripples out

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
ripples out the contestation ripples out
 

641
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,630
ripples out the contestation ripples out
too. So you're going to see uh where

642
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:54,640
too. So you're going to see uh where
 

643
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,430
too. So you're going to see uh where
this is being exacerbated by something

644
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,440
this is being exacerbated by something
 

645
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,590
this is being exacerbated by something
that had that he did from the very

646
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
that had that he did from the very
 

647
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,110
that had that he did from the very
start.

648
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120

 

649
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:13,029

No. Come and look around the body.

650
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039

 

651
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,230

What were the instructions yesterday?

652
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,240
What were the instructions yesterday?
 

653
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,230
What were the instructions yesterday?
Where is his elbow related to his

654
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240
Where is his elbow related to his
 

655
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,190
Where is his elbow related to his
shoulder? is outside the shoulder. Do

656
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,200
shoulder? is outside the shoulder. Do
 

657
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,789
shoulder? is outside the shoulder. Do
you see that? And that generates

658
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:24,799
you see that? And that generates
 

659
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,390
you see that? And that generates
this

660
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
this
 

661
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,710
this
this. Do you see? So, let me in. See his

662
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:30,720
this. Do you see? So, let me in. See his
 

663
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,029
this. Do you see? So, let me in. See his
elbows out out here. And so, I if if I

664
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
elbows out out here. And so, I if if I
 

665
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,029
elbows out out here. And so, I if if I
just push because I gripped on the

666
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
just push because I gripped on the
 

667
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,510
just push because I gripped on the
outside. I didn't grip here. Make a

668
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
outside. I didn't grip here. Make a
 

669
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,549
outside. I didn't grip here. Make a
fist. I'm not gripping here.

670
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
fist. I'm not gripping here.
 

671
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,950
fist. I'm not gripping here.
There has to be a slight Yes. But yes.

672
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:46,960
There has to be a slight Yes. But yes.
 

673
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,150
There has to be a slight Yes. But yes.
So, you'll feel it now. You see? Okay.

674
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
So, you'll feel it now. You see? Okay.
 

675
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,230
So, you'll feel it now. You see? Okay.
And again, my coach should have just

676
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
And again, my coach should have just
 

677
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,789
And again, my coach should have just
been able to do that. But you, what's

678
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:54,799
been able to do that. But you, what's
 

679
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,830
been able to do that. But you, what's
happening is when you're down, you feel

680
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
happening is when you're down, you feel
 

681
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,470
happening is when you're down, you feel
your own flexion

682
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,480
your own flexion
 

683
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,909
your own flexion
and you feel like you're doing

684
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
and you feel like you're doing
 

685
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,430
and you feel like you're doing
something.

686
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
something.
 

687
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,710
something.
You need to do as UK the same thing he's

688
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
You need to do as UK the same thing he's
 

689
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,150
You need to do as UK the same thing he's
doing. He is letting energy go down. I

690
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,160
doing. He is letting energy go down. I
 

691
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,909
doing. He is letting energy go down. I
let energy go down. And that's what's

692
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
let energy go down. And that's what's
 

693
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,510
let energy go down. And that's what's
moving. And he could feel that shoulder

694
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
moving. And he could feel that shoulder
 

695
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,150
moving. And he could feel that shoulder
biting now. Okay. Does that make sense?

696
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,160
biting now. Okay. Does that make sense?
 

697
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,909
biting now. Okay. Does that make sense?
Okay. Okay. So, let's have another team

698
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:17,919
Okay. Okay. So, let's have another team
 

699
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,669
Okay. Okay. So, let's have another team
go. I don't care who. Go. Watch

700
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679

 

701
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,350

down.

702
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360

 

703
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,510

Okay. Stop.

704
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
Okay. Stop.
 

705
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,110
Okay. Stop.
You see that? See the angle again? We're

706
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
You see that? See the angle again? We're
 

707
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,590
You see that? See the angle again? We're
already in the contestation. Do Do you

708
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600
already in the contestation. Do Do you
 

709
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,110
already in the contestation. Do Do you
see that? Trying to get Trying to get

710
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
see that? Trying to get Trying to get
 

711
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,430
see that? Trying to get Trying to get
here. Okay.

712
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
here. Okay.
 

713
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,190
here. Okay.
There's already

714
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200

 

715
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,350

a weakness in the torso in the in the in

716
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
a weakness in the torso in the in the in
 

717
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,310
a weakness in the torso in the in the in
the spine. So don't move. You don't

718
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
the spine. So don't move. You don't
 

719
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,789
the spine. So don't move. You don't
move. Now let go.

720
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:54,799

 

721
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,710

Do you see it? Okay. So your first thing

722
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
Do you see it? Okay. So your first thing
 

723
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,630
Do you see it? Okay. So your first thing
is you're relax you're relaxing,

724
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:02,640
is you're relax you're relaxing,
 

725
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,230
is you're relax you're relaxing,
right? But what were we told yesterday?

726
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
right? But what were we told yesterday?
 

727
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,110
right? But what were we told yesterday?
Releasing is not relaxing. I can't go

728
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
Releasing is not relaxing. I can't go
 

729
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,830
Releasing is not relaxing. I can't go
like this. What were we told in Zazen?

730
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
like this. What were we told in Zazen?
 

731
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,549
like this. What were we told in Zazen?
My spine has to do

732
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559

 

733
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,630

reaching up. You can't. If you relax,

734
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:20,640
reaching up. You can't. If you relax,
 

735
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,590
reaching up. You can't. If you relax,
it doesn't do it. So, you have no energy

736
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600
it doesn't do it. So, you have no energy
 

737
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,549
it doesn't do it. So, you have no energy
going through your spine. Okay? And

738
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:26,559
going through your spine. Okay? And
 

739
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,750
going through your spine. Okay? And
which you can expose. Okay? All right.

740
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:29,760
which you can expose. Okay? All right.
 

741
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,470
which you can expose. Okay? All right.
So, my point here is that all these

742
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:32,480
So, my point here is that all these
 

743
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,270
So, my point here is that all these
things are showing up, but I'm just not

744
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,280
things are showing up, but I'm just not
 

745
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,430
things are showing up, but I'm just not
conscious of them. Just like I'm not

746
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
conscious of them. Just like I'm not
 

747
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,470
conscious of them. Just like I'm not
conscious of the habitual flexion I have

748
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:40,480
conscious of the habitual flexion I have
 

749
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,310
conscious of the habitual flexion I have
all day against the gravity that's

750
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,320
all day against the gravity that's
 

751
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,669
all day against the gravity that's
working on me. You see? And I never feel

752
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
working on me. You see? And I never feel
 

753
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,230
working on me. You see? And I never feel
the rebounding force or the pressing up

754
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
the rebounding force or the pressing up
 

755
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,470
the rebounding force or the pressing up
of the earth. I never feel those forces.

756
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
of the earth. I never feel those forces.
 

757
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,710
of the earth. I never feel those forces.
Okay? But imagine in your art

758
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
Okay? But imagine in your art
 

759
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,350
Okay? But imagine in your art
that's one with the universe. We're

760
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
that's one with the universe. We're
 

761
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,549
that's one with the universe. We're
supposed to be able to feel those

762
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
supposed to be able to feel those
 

763
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,390
supposed to be able to feel those
forces. And if I can feel them, I can

764
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:00,400
forces. And if I can feel them, I can
 

765
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,630
forces. And if I can feel them, I can
use them. You see? And that's where and

766
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,640
use them. You see? And that's where and
 

767
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,029
use them. You see? And that's where and
if I can use them then I don't have to

768
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
if I can use them then I don't have to
 

769
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,470
if I can use them then I don't have to
use these other forces that make me

770
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
use these other forces that make me
 

771
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,270
use these other forces that make me
waste energy and things like that. Okay.

772
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
waste energy and things like that. Okay.
 

773
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,909
waste energy and things like that. Okay.
So let's I'll get to a conscious level

774
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
So let's I'll get to a conscious level
 

775
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,390
So let's I'll get to a conscious level
so we can answer the question again.

776
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,400
so we can answer the question again.
 

777
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,110
so we can answer the question again.
Where's my flexion? Okay. All right. Go

778
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,120
Where's my flexion? Okay. All right. Go
 

779
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,350
Where's my flexion? Okay. All right. Go
for it.

780
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,360

 

781
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,270

And we already know release is not

782
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,280
And we already know release is not
 

783
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,510
And we already know release is not
relaxed.

784
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:29,520
relaxed.
 

785
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,909
relaxed.
The spine is reaching upward.

786
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919
The spine is reaching upward.
 

787
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,310
The spine is reaching upward.
We want our elbow inside our outer rim.

788
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320

 

789
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,470

Not too much bend on that arm. Rio,

790
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
Not too much bend on that arm. Rio,
 

791
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,350
Not too much bend on that arm. Rio,
extend it more. Extend it more. If you

792
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
extend it more. Extend it more. If you
 

793
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,590
extend it more. Extend it more. If you
need them to do less pressure, do less

794
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:47,600
need them to do less pressure, do less
 

795
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,510
need them to do less pressure, do less
pressure. If you need more pressure, do

796
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,520
pressure. If you need more pressure, do
 

797
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,350
pressure. If you need more pressure, do
more pressure.

798
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,360

 

799
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,669

If I bend my arm, I'll I have to use my

800
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
If I bend my arm, I'll I have to use my
 

801
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:03,510
If I bend my arm, I'll I have to use my
tricep. So, just a slight bend.

802
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,520

 

803
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:16,630

Too much arm bend.

804
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640

 

805
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,549

Good. Coach each other.

806
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
Good. Coach each other.
 

807
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,470
Good. Coach each other.
Look for hand flexion. Look for shoulder

808
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
Look for hand flexion. Look for shoulder
 

809
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:38,310
Look for hand flexion. Look for shoulder
pushing in. Look for the biceps.

810
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320

 

811
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,510

Too much bicep. Extend more

812
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,520
Too much bicep. Extend more
 

813
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:54,149
Too much bicep. Extend more
and leave your hand in that position.

814
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159

 

815
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,029

Okay.

816
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
Okay.
 

817
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,149
Okay.
Where are you flexing

818
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:00,159
Where are you flexing
 

819
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,870
Where are you flexing
against the spinal displacement?

820
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:04,880
against the spinal displacement?
 

821
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,870
against the spinal displacement?
Where where do you feel it? Bicep,

822
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:06,880
Where where do you feel it? Bicep,
 

823
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,830
Where where do you feel it? Bicep,
shoulder, hand. Right. Where do you feel

824
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
shoulder, hand. Right. Where do you feel
 

825
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,430
shoulder, hand. Right. Where do you feel
it?

826
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
it?
 

827
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,310
it?
Okay. Where do you feel it? Okay. Got

828
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,320
Okay. Where do you feel it? Okay. Got
 

829
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,909
Okay. Where do you feel it? Okay. Got
Got it. All right. What we have to do is

830
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:17,919
Got it. All right. What we have to do is
 

831
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,310
Got it. All right. What we have to do is
when we feel that tension is we have to

832
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320
when we feel that tension is we have to
 

833
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,149
when we feel that tension is we have to
release it like in zen. Okay.

834
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159
release it like in zen. Okay.
 

835
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,990
release it like in zen. Okay.
That is a macro version of the gravity

836
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
That is a macro version of the gravity
 

837
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,510
That is a macro version of the gravity
that is working on us in zazen. We just

838
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
that is working on us in zazen. We just
 

839
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,950
that is working on us in zazen. We just
made everything grosser. Okay. Like in

840
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
made everything grosser. Okay. Like in
 

841
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,029
made everything grosser. Okay. Like in
the face of that gravity, I release

842
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:37,039
the face of that gravity, I release
 

843
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,710
the face of that gravity, I release
tension

844
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
tension
 

845
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,230
tension
in some way. I don't ever fall. I get to

846
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,240
in some way. I don't ever fall. I get to
 

847
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,510
in some way. I don't ever fall. I get to
stay in this mountain shape. Okay. Same

848
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
stay in this mountain shape. Okay. Same
 

849
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,870
stay in this mountain shape. Okay. Same
thing's going to happen here.

850
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:48,880
thing's going to happen here.
 

851
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,070
thing's going to happen here.
But it's very hard to believe in it.

852
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
But it's very hard to believe in it.
 

853
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,750
But it's very hard to believe in it.
Okay.

854
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:53,760
Okay.
 

855
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,669
Okay.
So

856
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:57,679

 

857
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,710

I will make the following point.

858
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720
I will make the following point.
 

859
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,149
I will make the following point.
Shape does not matter.

860
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:06,159
Shape does not matter.
 

861
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,830
Shape does not matter.
Okay. But shape will assist you at the

862
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:11,840
Okay. But shape will assist you at the
 

863
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,070
Okay. But shape will assist you at the
beginning because of the space

864
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,080
beginning because of the space
 

865
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,230
beginning because of the space
requirement. Okay. So, um, as I

866
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
requirement. Okay. So, um, as I
 

867
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,549
requirement. Okay. So, um, as I
demonstrated yesterday, he's he's

868
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:20,559
demonstrated yesterday, he's he's
 

869
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,669
demonstrated yesterday, he's he's
driving and it kind of looks like I'm

870
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:23,679
driving and it kind of looks like I'm
 

871
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,070
driving and it kind of looks like I'm
doing skeletal alignment. Do do you

872
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
doing skeletal alignment. Do do you
 

873
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:34,230
doing skeletal alignment. Do do you
understand? Okay. But I'm not. He He can

874
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,240
understand? Okay. But I'm not. He He can
 

875
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,510
understand? Okay. But I'm not. He He can
Where's the skeletal alignment?

876
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
Where's the skeletal alignment?
 

877
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,990
Where's the skeletal alignment?
That should go way back here. This

878
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,000
That should go way back here. This
 

879
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,230
That should go way back here. This
should start to burn.

880
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,240
should start to burn.
 

881
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,750
should start to burn.
Does that make sense? There's He's

882
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,760
Does that make sense? There's He's
 

883
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,470
Does that make sense? There's He's
pushing. There's no skeletal alignment.

884
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,480
pushing. There's no skeletal alignment.
 

885
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,470
pushing. There's no skeletal alignment.
You can move just as freely. If I to

886
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480
You can move just as freely. If I to
 

887
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,110
You can move just as freely. If I to
flex,

888
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,120
flex,
 

889
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,549
flex,
everything starts to burn. Okay.

890
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:56,559
everything starts to burn. Okay.
 

891
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,789
everything starts to burn. Okay.
Same thing we were doing yesterday. He's

892
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:00,799
Same thing we were doing yesterday. He's
 

893
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,549
Same thing we were doing yesterday. He's
driving

894
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
driving
 

895
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,630
driving
this. The posture that I'm in

896
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
this. The posture that I'm in
 

897
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,510
this. The posture that I'm in
doesn't isn't push isn't necessary at

898
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:09,520
doesn't isn't push isn't necessary at
 

899
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,549
doesn't isn't push isn't necessary at
all. Staying still is not necessary

900
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
all. Staying still is not necessary
 

901
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,990
all. Staying still is not necessary
either. Okay.

902
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,000

 

903
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,590

So the takeaway here is the form is not

904
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,600
So the takeaway here is the form is not
 

905
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,110
So the takeaway here is the form is not
important

906
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,120
important
 

907
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,149
important
but we'll use form to help cultivate the

908
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:24,159
but we'll use form to help cultivate the
 

909
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,950
but we'll use form to help cultivate the
faith we need to let go of the muscle

910
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
faith we need to let go of the muscle
 

911
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,070
faith we need to let go of the muscle
tension and eventually the skeletal

912
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,080
tension and eventually the skeletal
 

913
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,630
tension and eventually the skeletal
alignment. Okay.

914
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:32,640
alignment. Okay.
 

915
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,950
alignment. Okay.
The other reason for understanding form

916
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:34,960
The other reason for understanding form
 

917
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,390
The other reason for understanding form
and this is very important is

918
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
and this is very important is
 

919
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,149
and this is very important is
energetically

920
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:40,159
energetically
 

921
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,470
energetically
form is not important.

922
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
form is not important.
 

923
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,630
form is not important.
Marshially form is very important.

924
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:46,640
Marshially form is very important.
 

925
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,149
Marshially form is very important.
If for example

926
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:50,159
If for example
 

927
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,590
If for example
energetically this works

928
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,600
energetically this works
 

929
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,390
energetically this works
partially this does not work. Okay.

930
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:58,400
partially this does not work. Okay.
 

931
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,110
partially this does not work. Okay.
So, for marshall reasons, I do want to

932
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,120
So, for marshall reasons, I do want to
 

933
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,590
So, for marshall reasons, I do want to
understand how to organize my body.

934
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:03,600
understand how to organize my body.
 

935
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,669
understand how to organize my body.
Okay? And this is going to get you in

936
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
Okay? And this is going to get you in
 

937
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,909
Okay? And this is going to get you in
the ballpark.

938
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:09,919
the ballpark.
 

939
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,430
the ballpark.
One,

940
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
One,
 

941
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,110
One,
never let your elbow go outside your

942
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,120
never let your elbow go outside your
 

943
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,789
never let your elbow go outside your
shoulder.

944
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799
shoulder.
 

945
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:23,190
shoulder.
Okay? The adding to yesterday's class,

946
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
Okay? The adding to yesterday's class,
 

947
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,029
Okay? The adding to yesterday's class,
if my hand tension has nothing to do

948
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
if my hand tension has nothing to do
 

949
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,990
if my hand tension has nothing to do
with my wrist positional integrity, my

950
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,000
with my wrist positional integrity, my
 

951
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,909
with my wrist positional integrity, my
forearm tension has nothing to do with

952
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:31,919
forearm tension has nothing to do with
 

953
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:38,149
forearm tension has nothing to do with
it. My tricep, so uh come on over, Rio.

954
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:38,159
it. My tricep, so uh come on over, Rio.
 

955
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,750
it. My tricep, so uh come on over, Rio.
Okay. Uh he's driving and you squeeze.

956
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:43,760
Okay. Uh he's driving and you squeeze.
 

957
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,390
Okay. Uh he's driving and you squeeze.
Is there mushy as hell? like like uh my

958
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:46,400
Is there mushy as hell? like like uh my
 

959
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,549
Is there mushy as hell? like like uh my
mom was she was 80. Okay. Like mom gets

960
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:50,559
mom was she was 80. Okay. Like mom gets
 

961
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,789
mom was she was 80. Okay. Like mom gets
a muscle, right? It's very mushy. It has

962
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:52,799
a muscle, right? It's very mushy. It has
 

963
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,269
a muscle, right? It's very mushy. It has
nothing to do with positional integrity.

964
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:57,279

 

965
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,909

Where would you say

966
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919
Where would you say
 

967
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,510
Where would you say
the positional integrity is? It is. I

968
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:03,520
the positional integrity is? It is. I
 

969
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,350
the positional integrity is? It is. I
know it's not here. It's not here. It's

970
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,360
know it's not here. It's not here. It's
 

971
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,389
know it's not here. It's not here. It's
not here.

972
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:08,399
not here.
 

973
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,870
not here.
What if this moves?

974
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:10,880
What if this moves?
 

975
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,990
What if this moves?
Do you understand? He goes

976
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000

 

977
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,590

I lost it. It moved. Okay.

978
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:21,600

 

979
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,470

What's keeping this? Where does this

980
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
What's keeping this? Where does this
 

981
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,630
What's keeping this? Where does this
want to go? Is my shoulder going to blow

982
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:26,640
want to go? Is my shoulder going to blow
 

983
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,870
want to go? Is my shoulder going to blow
off and go backwards and that's why this

984
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:28,880
off and go backwards and that's why this
 

985
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,310
off and go backwards and that's why this
move? No. It rotates around my spine.

986
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,320
move? No. It rotates around my spine.
 

987
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,350
move? No. It rotates around my spine.
You see that? Okay.

988
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:35,360
You see that? Okay.
 

989
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,590
You see that? Okay.
That's why if I keep my spine reaching

990
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:39,600
That's why if I keep my spine reaching
 

991
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,269
That's why if I keep my spine reaching
the muscles that affect that

992
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:43,279
the muscles that affect that
 

993
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,149
the muscles that affect that
extension go also stop the rotation. The

994
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
extension go also stop the rotation. The
 

995
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,269
extension go also stop the rotation. The
shoulder becomes unified

996
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:51,279
shoulder becomes unified
 

997
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,070
shoulder becomes unified
uh and it's like

998
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,080
uh and it's like
 

999
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,110
uh and it's like
there's a board across my back. Okay.

1000
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,120
there's a board across my back. Okay.
 

1001
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,750
there's a board across my back. Okay.
The shoulders marshially are a very weak

1002
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
The shoulders marshially are a very weak
 

1003
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,269
The shoulders marshially are a very weak
point. A very weak point. Yes. lots of

1004
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:03,279
point. A very weak point. Yes. lots of
 

1005
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,990
point. A very weak point. Yes. lots of
movement, but lots of movement means

1006
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,000
movement, but lots of movement means
 

1007
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,789
movement, but lots of movement means
loss of structural integrity. Loss of

1008
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
loss of structural integrity. Loss of
 

1009
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,830
loss of structural integrity. Loss of
structural integrity is where energy

1010
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:11,840
structural integrity is where energy
 

1011
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,430
structural integrity is where energy
could leak out. Okay? Uh I was watching

1012
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:15,440
could leak out. Okay? Uh I was watching
 

1013
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,389
could leak out. Okay? Uh I was watching
a wrestling coach and they the athlete,

1014
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:20,399
a wrestling coach and they the athlete,
 

1015
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,909
a wrestling coach and they the athlete,
he's at Olympic level. the athlete made

1016
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:23,919
he's at Olympic level. the athlete made
 

1017
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,269
he's at Olympic level. the athlete made
a big deal out of natural movement

1018
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:27,279
a big deal out of natural movement
 

1019
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,110
a big deal out of natural movement
and he would do all those kind of um

1020
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,120
and he would do all those kind of um
 

1021
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,669
and he would do all those kind of um
what's that guy's name? Ido Portal.

1022
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:33,679
what's that guy's name? Ido Portal.
 

1023
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,110
what's that guy's name? Ido Portal.
Okay, if you've seen him um or they're

1024
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,120
Okay, if you've seen him um or they're
 

1025
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,870
Okay, if you've seen him um or they're
moving, you know, like they pretend

1026
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:38,880
moving, you know, like they pretend
 

1027
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,870
moving, you know, like they pretend
they're cats and they move like cats and

1028
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:40,880
they're cats and they move like cats and
 

1029
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,070
they're cats and they move like cats and
things. And it was supposed to translate

1030
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,080
things. And it was supposed to translate
 

1031
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,310
things. And it was supposed to translate
into he would be highly mobile in

1032
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,320
into he would be highly mobile in
 

1033
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,430
into he would be highly mobile in
wrestling. And later what happened is

1034
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:49,440
wrestling. And later what happened is
 

1035
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,710
wrestling. And later what happened is
that he was very prone to injury

1036
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
that he was very prone to injury
 

1037
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,029
that he was very prone to injury
um with that mobility because there was

1038
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:55,039
um with that mobility because there was
 

1039
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,750
um with that mobility because there was
a loss of st stability.

1040
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:57,760
a loss of st stability.
 

1041
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,950
a loss of st stability.
Um and what they ended up doing was

1042
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:00,960
Um and what they ended up doing was
 

1043
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,510
Um and what they ended up doing was
compound lifting him which which builds

1044
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:05,520
compound lifting him which which builds
 

1045
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,669
compound lifting him which which builds
uh structural integrity which we said

1046
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:07,679
uh structural integrity which we said
 

1047
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,750
uh structural integrity which we said
yesterday. Okay. Um where on those spine

1048
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:13,760
yesterday. Okay. Um where on those spine
 

1049
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,789
yesterday. Okay. Um where on those spine
alignment muscles? Okay. Those spine

1050
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:16,799
alignment muscles? Okay. Those spine
 

1051
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,669
alignment muscles? Okay. Those spine
alignment muscles are different from

1052
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:19,679
alignment muscles are different from
 

1053
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,909
alignment muscles are different from
these muscles.

1054
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:21,919
these muscles.
 

1055
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,070
these muscles.
I can barely feel them. That's part of

1056
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,080
I can barely feel them. That's part of
 

1057
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,789
I can barely feel them. That's part of
the problem. You see? And so I can

1058
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:26,799
the problem. You see? And so I can
 

1059
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,110
the problem. You see? And so I can
barely experience them. Um and so they

1060
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,120
barely experience them. Um and so they
 

1061
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,510
barely experience them. Um and so they
don't do they don't do the same thing to

1062
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:33,520
don't do they don't do the same thing to
 

1063
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,230
don't do they don't do the same thing to
my body, mind, to my consciousness when

1064
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,240
my body, mind, to my consciousness when
 

1065
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,310
my body, mind, to my consciousness when
I'm flexing my shoulders and my arms and

1066
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,320
I'm flexing my shoulders and my arms and
 

1067
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,310
I'm flexing my shoulders and my arms and
things like that. So you're going to

1068
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,320
things like that. So you're going to
 

1069
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,230
things like that. So you're going to
drive. I'm flexing and then I'll start

1070
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
drive. I'm flexing and then I'll start
 

1071
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,310
drive. I'm flexing and then I'll start
to release everything.

1072
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,320
to release everything.
 

1073
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,669
to release everything.
Okay? And I'm now relaxed. I don't feel

1074
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:47,679
Okay? And I'm now relaxed. I don't feel
 

1075
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,230
Okay? And I'm now relaxed. I don't feel
the he can't go. He's not going to push

1076
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,240
the he can't go. He's not going to push
 

1077
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,950
the he can't go. He's not going to push
me anywhere. And I don't feel the need

1078
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:52,960
me anywhere. And I don't feel the need
 

1079
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,630
me anywhere. And I don't feel the need
to hurry up and get out of this

1080
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:54,640
to hurry up and get out of this
 

1081
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,669
to hurry up and get out of this
situation. Okay. So, there is some

1082
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:57,679
situation. Okay. So, there is some
 

1083
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,750
situation. Okay. So, there is some
muscular use. They're very hard to

1084
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:01,760
muscular use. They're very hard to
 

1085
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,950
muscular use. They're very hard to
become aware of. I would imagine some of

1086
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:04,960
become aware of. I would imagine some of
 

1087
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,149
become aware of. I would imagine some of
them are even involuntarily controlled.

1088
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:08,159
them are even involuntarily controlled.
 

1089
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,110
them are even involuntarily controlled.
Okay? Meaning, if you go to flex, you're

1090
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,120
Okay? Meaning, if you go to flex, you're
 

1091
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,590
Okay? Meaning, if you go to flex, you're
going to flex the other muscles. If you

1092
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:13,600
going to flex the other muscles. If you
 

1093
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,669
going to flex the other muscles. If you
task yourself with just extension

1094
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:17,679
task yourself with just extension
 

1095
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,190
task yourself with just extension
kind of unconsciously you're using them.

1096
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,200
kind of unconsciously you're using them.
 

1097
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,029
kind of unconsciously you're using them.
Okay.

1098
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:23,039
Okay.
 

1099
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,710
Okay.
But that's what helped keeps the

1100
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:24,720
But that's what helped keeps the
 

1101
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,590
But that's what helped keeps the
shoulder in place. Go. And that's why

1102
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:27,600
shoulder in place. Go. And that's why
 

1103
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,190
shoulder in place. Go. And that's why
yesterday

1104
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,200
yesterday
 

1105
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,110
yesterday
I could keep the elbow in place because

1106
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,120
I could keep the elbow in place because
 

1107
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,950
I could keep the elbow in place because
it's the shoulder in place. If we go

1108
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:32,960
it's the shoulder in place. If we go
 

1109
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,549
it's the shoulder in place. If we go
here, it's the same thing. He he cannot

1110
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:36,559
here, it's the same thing. He he cannot
 

1111
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,269
here, it's the same thing. He he cannot
make that happen. Okay. And when I

1112
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:39,279
make that happen. Okay. And when I
 

1113
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,310
make that happen. Okay. And when I
understand what that's doing, I he's

1114
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,320
understand what that's doing, I he's
 

1115
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,590
understand what that's doing, I he's
driving. I can move and he can't do it.

1116
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:45,600
driving. I can move and he can't do it.
 

1117
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,909
driving. I can move and he can't do it.
And I can come back and he can't do

1118
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:47,919
And I can come back and he can't do
 

1119
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,830
And I can come back and he can't do
anything about it. Okay. So, it has

1120
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840
anything about it. Okay. So, it has
 

1121

not that here. And dealing with the
 

1129
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,029
not that here. And dealing with the
Marshall problem of a ball and socket

1130
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:05,039
Marshall problem of a ball and socket
 

1131
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,870
Marshall problem of a ball and socket
joint and learning how to stabilize it

1132
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,880
joint and learning how to stabilize it
 

1133
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,590
joint and learning how to stabilize it
to my core. Okay. All right. So, um,

1134
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:11,600
to my core. Okay. All right. So, um,
 

1135
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,269
to my core. Okay. All right. So, um,
here's what we're going to do to get us

1136
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:13,279
here's what we're going to do to get us
 

1137
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,669
here's what we're going to do to get us
in the ballpark. You're going to form la

1138
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:15,679
in the ballpark. You're going to form la
 

1139
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,509
in the ballpark. You're going to form la
gong. It looks like that.

1140
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:19,519
gong. It looks like that.
 

1141
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,909
gong. It looks like that.
There's a couple key things to note.

1142
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:21,919
There's a couple key things to note.
 

1143
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,789
There's a couple key things to note.
There's a cup in the middle of your palm

1144
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:24,799
There's a cup in the middle of your palm
 

1145
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,630
There's a cup in the middle of your palm
that you could pour water and it would

1146
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:26,640
that you could pour water and it would
 

1147
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,549
that you could pour water and it would
stay there. Okay. That cup though is not

1148
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:30,559
stay there. Okay. That cup though is not
 

1149
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,909
stay there. Okay. That cup though is not
formed by me curling my metacarpals.

1150
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:33,919
formed by me curling my metacarpals.
 

1151
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,470
formed by me curling my metacarpals.
The metacarpals, these bones in my hand

1152
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:36,480
The metacarpals, these bones in my hand
 

1153
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,230
The metacarpals, these bones in my hand
are extending

1154
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,240

 

1155
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,110

until I feel that tension came into the

1156
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,120
until I feel that tension came into the
 

1157
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,870
until I feel that tension came into the
forearm.

1158
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:44,880
forearm.
 

1159
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,430
forearm.
Dial it back. This hand shape

1160
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,440
Dial it back. This hand shape
 

1161
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,149
Dial it back. This hand shape
and the forearm tension is not there and

1162
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:52,159
and the forearm tension is not there and
 

1163
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,430
and the forearm tension is not there and
you get mushy arms. Okay,

1164
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,440
you get mushy arms. Okay,
 

1165
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,549
you get mushy arms. Okay,
it looks like that.

1166
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:58,559
it looks like that.
 

1167
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,350
it looks like that.
The next thing is the palm, that cup is

1168
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:03,360
The next thing is the palm, that cup is
 

1169
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,509
The next thing is the palm, that cup is
in skeletal alignment with your forearm,

1170
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:07,519
in skeletal alignment with your forearm,
 

1171
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,350
in skeletal alignment with your forearm,
with your elbow, with your shoulder. So,

1172
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:11,360
with your elbow, with your shoulder. So,
 

1173
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,190
with your elbow, with your shoulder. So,
he's here. What would be incorrect is my

1174
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,200
he's here. What would be incorrect is my
 

1175
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,870
he's here. What would be incorrect is my
fingers

1176
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:16,880
fingers
 

1177
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,389
fingers
are in alignment with the elbow. And you

1178
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:20,399
are in alignment with the elbow. And you
 

1179
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,710
are in alignment with the elbow. And you
don't want to do that. I'm going to

1180
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:22,720
don't want to do that. I'm going to
 

1181
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,029
don't want to do that. I'm going to
watch what I do. I'm going to move

1182
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:27,039
watch what I do. I'm going to move
 

1183
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,590
watch what I do. I'm going to move
laong into that elbow alignment. You see

1184
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:31,600
laong into that elbow alignment. You see
 

1185
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,590
laong into that elbow alignment. You see
where I'm at? Okay.

1186
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:35,600

 

1187
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,029

Boom. I'm here. The elbow's never

1188
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:39,039
Boom. I'm here. The elbow's never
 

1189
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,909
Boom. I'm here. The elbow's never
outside my shoulder.

1190
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:41,919
outside my shoulder.
 

1191
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,509
outside my shoulder.
Okay. And now I just have to figure out

1192
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:45,519
Okay. And now I just have to figure out
 

1193
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,430
Okay. And now I just have to figure out
how much extension is on the arm.

1194
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440
how much extension is on the arm.
 

1195
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,509
how much extension is on the arm.
So, we did yesterday's drill. He stood

1196
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:51,519
So, we did yesterday's drill. He stood
 

1197
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,070

up.

1198
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,080
up.
 

1199
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,950
up.
And I want you just to bend over 90

1200
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:56,960
And I want you just to bend over 90
 

1201
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,190
And I want you just to bend over 90
degrees with your thumbs pointing

1202
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,200
degrees with your thumbs pointing
 

1203
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,509
degrees with your thumbs pointing
towards me.

1204
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:01,519
towards me.
 

1205
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,190
towards me.
And the natural bend in his arm is kata

1206
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,200
And the natural bend in his arm is kata
 

1207
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,470

Extend your arms, please. That was
 

1211
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,109
Extend your arms, please. That was
hyperextension. And he's not going to

1212
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:15,119
hyperextension. And he's not going to
 

1213
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,750
hyperextension. And he's not going to
hold them against gravity. Too much

1214
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:17,760
hold them against gravity. Too much
 

1215
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,589
hold them against gravity. Too much
bend. He just relaxes

1216
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:21,599
bend. He just relaxes
 

1217
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,869

control those muscles that are given

1228
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960
control those muscles that are given
 

1229
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,909
control those muscles that are given
spinal integrity.

1230
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:45,919
spinal integrity.
 

1231
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,550
spinal integrity.
and he now releases the tension that

1232
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:48,560
and he now releases the tension that
 

1233
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:55,349

Okay, got it. All right, let's do it a

1236
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:58,640
Okay, got it. All right, let's do it a
 

1237
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,109
Okay, got it. All right, let's do it a
little differently. Put your arm with

1238
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:01,119
little differently. Put your arm with
 

1239
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,950
little differently. Put your arm with
your bend. Let's do this one.

1240
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:04,960
your bend. Let's do this one.
 

1241
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,870
your bend. Let's do this one.
That's not going to work. He's going to

1242
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:06,880
That's not going to work. He's going to
 

1243
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,670
That's not going to work. He's going to
want to extend against it. He puts his

1244
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:09,680
want to extend against it. He puts his
 

1245
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,829
want to extend against it. He puts his
elbow out. He's going to feel that

1246
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:11,839
elbow out. He's going to feel that
 

1247
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,990
elbow out. He's going to feel that
pressure and this weak point at this at

1248
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,000
pressure and this weak point at this at
 

1249
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,710
pressure and this weak point at this at
this part. He puts his hand here like

1250
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:16,720
this part. He puts his hand here like
 

1251
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,630
this part. He puts his hand here like
that. He's going to over rely on

1252
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640
that. He's going to over rely on
 

1253
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,870
that. He's going to over rely on
skeletal alignment. And so he's going to

1254
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:20,880
skeletal alignment. And so he's going to
 

1255
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,030
skeletal alignment. And so he's going to
push that shoulder forward like he is.

1256
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,040
push that shoulder forward like he is.
 

1257
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,510

00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:28,480
You all know what we're looking
 

1261
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,550
You all know what we're looking
elbow in. Okay. Shoulder square. Extend

1262
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:32,560
elbow in. Okay. Shoulder square. Extend
 

1263
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,030
elbow in. Okay. Shoulder square. Extend
the spine. It will unconsciously,

1264
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,040
the spine. It will unconsciously,
 

1265
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,190
the spine. It will unconsciously,
subconsciously flex the muscles we need

1266
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,200
subconsciously flex the muscles we need
 

1267
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,190
subconsciously flex the muscles we need
flex, releasing the other muscles we

1268
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,200
flex, releasing the other muscles we
 

1269
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:56,150
flex, releasing the other muscles we
don't want flex. All right. Go for it.

1270
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,160

 

1271
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,950

Coach each other.

00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:00,960

 

1273
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,790

If you can coach them, you can go back

1274
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:02,800
If you can coach them, you can go back
 

1275
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:10,710
If you can coach them, you can go back
home and train yourself.

1276
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:10,720

 

1277
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,510

You got you have to uh activate those

1278

00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:09,430
Okay.
Question.

1448
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:09,440

 

1449
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:16,630

Okay. So, um,

1450
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:16,640

 

1451
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,750

is the is the shape important?

1452
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:19,760
is the is the shape important?
 

1453
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,069
is the is the shape important?
No. Okay. But it is when

1454
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:24,079
No. Okay. But it is when
 

1455
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,710
No. Okay. But it is when
when you're starting out. Okay. So, um,

1456
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:28,720
when you're starting out. Okay. So, um,
 

1457
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,309
when you're starting out. Okay. So, um,
but let's look at that a little

1458
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:30,319
but let's look at that a little
 

1459
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,870
but let's look at that a little
differently. Okay.

1460
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:32,880
differently. Okay.
 

1461
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,790
differently. Okay.
an opponent

1462
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:34,800
an opponent
 

1463
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,069
an opponent
mar so energetically shape not important

1464
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:38,079
mar so energetically shape not important
 

1465
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,750
mar so energetically shape not important
marshially

1466
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:39,760
marshially
 

1467
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,309
marshially
opponents will make shape important all

1468
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:42,319
opponents will make shape important all
 

1469
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,990
opponents will make shape important all
the time so an opponent will try to get

1470
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:46,000
the time so an opponent will try to get
 

1471
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,109
the time so an opponent will try to get
under you okay for example in this case

1472
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:53,119
under you okay for example in this case
 

1473
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,270
under you okay for example in this case
I don't want us to go into what I today

1474
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:57,280
I don't want us to go into what I today
 

1475
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,870
I don't want us to go into what I today
call tai chi land where you you're going

1476
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:00,880
call tai chi land where you you're going
 

1477
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,150
call tai chi land where you you're going
to do energetic solution for that

1478
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,160
to do energetic solution for that
 

1479
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,670
to do energetic solution for that
because the opponent experiences the

1480
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:07,680
because the opponent experiences the
 

1481
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,910
because the opponent experiences the
energetics

1482
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:09,920
energetics
 

1483
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,349
energetics
exactly like any external force. So

1484
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:13,359
exactly like any external force. So
 

1485
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,510
exactly like any external force. So
whatever you're doing energetically,

1486
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:15,520
whatever you're doing energetically,
 

1487
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,069
whatever you're doing energetically,
let's say so he can't get under me

1488
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:18,079
let's say so he can't get under me
 

1489
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,829
let's say so he can't get under me
energetically.

1490
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:19,839
energetically.
 

1491
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,750
energetically.
Um they just said continue to adapt and

1492
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:23,760
Um they just said continue to adapt and
 

1493
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,230
Um they just said continue to adapt and
it's very very fast. So this go to the

1494
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:26,240
it's very very fast. So this go to the
 

1495
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,630
it's very very fast. So this go to the
good taichi article and this is what I

1496
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:28,640
good taichi article and this is what I
 

1497
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,550
good taichi article and this is what I
said happened. what happens. I pointed

1498
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:32,560
said happened. what happens. I pointed
 

1499
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,990
said happened. what happens. I pointed
it out in the Sefue Nico video when he

1500
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,000
it out in the Sefue Nico video when he
 

1501
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,670
it out in the Sefue Nico video when he
was against the wrestler. That is just

1502
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
was against the wrestler. That is just
 

1503
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,870
was against the wrestler. That is just
what happens. And anybody who actually

1504
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:40,880
what happens. And anybody who actually
 

1505
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,069
what happens. And anybody who actually
takes the energetics into

1506
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:44,079
takes the energetics into
 

1507
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,990
takes the energetics into
um

1508
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,000
um
 

1509
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,630
um
you know another sport like wrestling or

1510
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:48,640
you know another sport like wrestling or
 

1511
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,950
you know another sport like wrestling or
boxing or MMA, you that's just what

1512
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:50,960
boxing or MMA, you that's just what
 

1513
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,790
boxing or MMA, you that's just what
happens. Anyone that tries to arrest

1514
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:52,800
happens. Anyone that tries to arrest
 

1515
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,950
happens. Anyone that tries to arrest
that 80 pound year old girl, that's what

1516
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:54,960
that 80 pound year old girl, that's what
 

1517
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,150
that 80 pound year old girl, that's what
you just learn. Okay? People adapt. Uh

1518
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:58,160
you just learn. Okay? People adapt. Uh
 

1519
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,589
you just learn. Okay? People adapt. Uh
that is the nature of resistance. Okay.

1520
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:01,599
that is the nature of resistance. Okay.
 

1521
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,150
that is the nature of resistance. Okay.
Um so let's deal with this a different

1522
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,160
Um so let's deal with this a different
 

1523
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,550
Um so let's deal with this a different
way because as your skill develops

1524
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:06,560
way because as your skill develops
 

1525
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,390
way because as your skill develops
you'll learn how to do this

1526
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:08,400
you'll learn how to do this
 

1527
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,990
you'll learn how to do this
energetically. But let's get to the a

1528
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,000
energetically. But let's get to the a
 

1529
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,190
energetically. But let's get to the a
more martial thing. Okay. So

1530
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,200
more martial thing. Okay. So
 

1531
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,190
more martial thing. Okay. So
we do kokiho,

1532
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,200
we do kokiho,
 

1533
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,430
we do kokiho,
right? And normally you'll go you'll do

1534
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:21,440
right? And normally you'll go you'll do
 

1535
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,309
right? And normally you'll go you'll do
something like that, right? Okay. Let's

1536
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:24,319
something like that, right? Okay. Let's
 

1537
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,710
something like that, right? Okay. Let's
just have you practice cokeho and and

1538
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:26,720
just have you practice cokeho and and
 

1539
00:44:26,720 --> 00:45:08,950
just have you practice cokeho and and
see where we're at. Okay, go.

1540
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:08,960

 

1541
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,630

You can do the pin, you can do the

1542
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:10,640
You can do the pin, you can do the
 

1543
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:46,470
You can do the pin, you can do the
throw, it doesn't matter.

1544
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,480

 

1545
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,630

Okay.

1546
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:50,640

 

1547
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:56,150

So, uh, Rio, come on out.

1548
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,160

 

1549
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,990

Concentrically, I should practice

1550
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,000
Concentrically, I should practice
 

1551
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,069
Concentrically, I should practice
non-contestation all the way through.

1552
00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:00,079
non-contestation all the way through.
 

1553
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,829
non-contestation all the way through.
So, energetically, we understood it. uh

1554
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:03,839
So, energetically, we understood it. uh
 

1555
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,710
So, energetically, we understood it. uh
meditatively we understood it we have to

1556
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:06,720
meditatively we understood it we have to
 

1557
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,710
meditatively we understood it we have to
understand it marshally as well so we

1558
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:08,720
understand it marshally as well so we
 

1559
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,030
understand it marshally as well so we
already mentioned from yesterday's class

1560
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,040
already mentioned from yesterday's class
 

1561
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,510
already mentioned from yesterday's class
I never actually push against that

1562
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:13,520
I never actually push against that
 

1563
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,470
I never actually push against that
person do I have the capacity to do it

1564
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:16,480
person do I have the capacity to do it
 

1565
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,750
person do I have the capacity to do it
and do I test for it like maintaining

1566
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:19,760
and do I test for it like maintaining
 

1567
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,710
and do I test for it like maintaining
positional integrity yes but I don't

1568
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:22,720
positional integrity yes but I don't
 

1569
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,349
positional integrity yes but I don't
want to do it marshally okay and again

1570
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:25,359
want to do it marshally okay and again
 

1571
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,430
want to do it marshally okay and again
this is the difference from the taichi

1572
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:27,440
this is the difference from the taichi
 

1573
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,430
this is the difference from the taichi
energetics is they they will push right

1574
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:29,440
energetics is they they will push right
 

1575
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,069
energetics is they they will push right
back on the on the line of attack the

1576
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:32,079
back on the on the line of attack the
 

1577
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,710
back on the on the line of attack the
angle of attack and just do it

1578
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:34,720
angle of attack and just do it
 

1579
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,430
angle of attack and just do it
internally. But marshally, no, that's we

1580
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:37,440
internally. But marshally, no, that's we
 

1581
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,270
internally. But marshally, no, that's we
don't want to do it. We want to maintain

1582
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,280
don't want to do it. We want to maintain
 

1583
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,430
don't want to do it. We want to maintain
concentrically the idea of

1584
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:41,440
concentrically the idea of
 

1585
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,750
concentrically the idea of
non-contestation as a guiding principle

1586
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:43,760
non-contestation as a guiding principle
 

1587
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,870
non-contestation as a guiding principle
for life. Okay? All right. So, as we go,

1588
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:48,880
for life. Okay? All right. So, as we go,
 

1589
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,430
for life. Okay? All right. So, as we go,
there's the contestation right there.

1590
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:51,440
there's the contestation right there.
 

1591
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,349
there's the contestation right there.
You see that?

1592
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:53,359
You see that?
 

1593
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,230
You see that?
It's the same thing as when we drive

1594
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:56,240
It's the same thing as when we drive
 

1595
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,550
It's the same thing as when we drive
that shoulder into him into into the

1596
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:58,560
that shoulder into him into into the
 

1597
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,790
that shoulder into him into into the
partner on the push. Okay? So again, so

1598
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:02,800
partner on the push. Okay? So again, so
 

1599
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,710
partner on the push. Okay? So again, so
we go that part right there is what we

1600
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:06,720
we go that part right there is what we
 

1601
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,829
we go that part right there is what we
don't want. So if I I have the internal

1602
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:09,839
don't want. So if I I have the internal
 

1603
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,950
don't want. So if I I have the internal
skills, he gave yong aspect

1604
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:12,960
skills, he gave yong aspect
 

1605
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,950
skills, he gave yong aspect
and you'll be able to go. But usually

1606
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:14,960
and you'll be able to go. But usually
 

1607
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,190
and you'll be able to go. But usually
what we do is no spinal displacement,

1608
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:17,200
what we do is no spinal displacement,
 

1609
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,790
what we do is no spinal displacement,
but there it's there. Do you see the

1610
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
but there it's there. Do you see the
 

1611
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,589
but there it's there. Do you see the
opposition? Okay. And so it's not

1612
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:21,599
opposition? Okay. And so it's not
 

1613
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,390
opposition? Okay. And so it's not
exposed. Okay?

1614
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:24,400
exposed. Okay?
 

1615
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,349
exposed. Okay?
We don't want to do that. Okay? Because

1616
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:27,359
We don't want to do that. Okay? Because
 

1617
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,950
We don't want to do that. Okay? Because
that's when he's getting I'm getting

1618
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:28,960
that's when he's getting I'm getting
 

1619
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,190
that's when he's getting I'm getting
under you. Do you feel that? Okay, does

1620
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:31,200
under you. Do you feel that? Okay, does
 

1621
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,910
under you. Do you feel that? Okay, does
that make sense? Okay, so come back out

1622
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:35,920
that make sense? Okay, so come back out
 

1623
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,270
that make sense? Okay, so come back out
and we'll use Chris now.

1624
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:41,280

 

1625
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,270

So this hand I yield that way.

1626
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:47,280
So this hand I yield that way.
 

1627
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,390
So this hand I yield that way.
This is your yin hand.

1628
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:50,400
This is your yin hand.
 

1629
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,870
This is your yin hand.
If you pay attention to this, there's

1630
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:52,880
If you pay attention to this, there's
 

1631
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,870
If you pay attention to this, there's
two yang hands. Do you see that? And my

1632
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:56,880
two yang hands. Do you see that? And my
 

1633
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,190
two yang hands. Do you see that? And my
universe is concentric with yinyang

1634
00:47:59,190 --> 00:47:59,200
universe is concentric with yinyang
 

1635
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,950
universe is concentric with yinyang
theory. I should never have two yong

1636
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:00,960
theory. I should never have two yong
 

1637
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,349
theory. I should never have two yong
hands. Two yong hands are right away in

1638
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:03,359
hands. Two yong hands are right away in
 

1639
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,670
hands. Two yong hands are right away in
contestation in me and obviously a

1640
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:05,680
contestation in me and obviously a
 

1641
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,230
contestation in me and obviously a
contestation in him. So we have to learn

1642
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:08,240
contestation in him. So we have to learn
 

1643
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:15,030
contestation in him. So we have to learn
the yin hand.

1644
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:15,040

 

1645
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,710

And this is our outward spiral. So the

1646
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:18,720
And this is our outward spiral. So the
 

1647
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,270
And this is our outward spiral. So the
elbow is going to move

1648
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:23,280

 

1649
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:30,549

with my movement out of the way.

1650
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:30,559

 

1651
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:39,190

He's driving. No.

1652
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:39,200

 

1653
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:47,270

No. Too late.

1654
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280

 

1655
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,470

Too early. What do I do? I let him push

1656
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:50,480
Too early. What do I do? I let him push
 

1657
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,230
Too early. What do I do? I let him push
my hand.

1658
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:54,240

 

1659
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,549

As he's pushing my hand, what I do

1660
00:48:56,549 --> 00:48:56,559
As he's pushing my hand, what I do
 

1661
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,950
As he's pushing my hand, what I do
though is not that.

1662
00:48:58,950 --> 00:48:58,960
though is not that.
 

1663
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,069
though is not that.
As he pushes my hand, I yield to that

1664
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:02,079
As he pushes my hand, I yield to that
 

1665
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,510
As he pushes my hand, I yield to that
push. You see how I'm doing that?

1666
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:05,520
push. You see how I'm doing that?
 

1667
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,710
push. You see how I'm doing that?
Watch his spine

1668
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:08,720
Watch his spine
 

1669
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,309
Watch his spine
too young. Do you see his spine?

1670
00:49:12,309 --> 00:49:12,319
too young. Do you see his spine?
 

1671
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,510
too young. Do you see his spine?
Is he balanced? Is his line of gravity

1672
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:15,520
Is he balanced? Is his line of gravity
 

1673
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,069
Is he balanced? Is his line of gravity
in his base of support? The answer is

1674
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:18,079
in his base of support? The answer is
 

1675
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,190
in his base of support? The answer is
yes.

1676
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:23,200

 

1677
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,750

What do you think? He's not balanced.

1678
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:25,760
What do you think? He's not balanced.
 

1679
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,670
What do you think? He's not balanced.
Okay.

1680
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:27,680
Okay.
 

1681
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,630
Okay.
So, again, you do this in a fight, the

1682
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:30,640
So, again, you do this in a fight, the

So, again, you do this in a fight, the
dude adjust

1684
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:33,680
dude adjust
 

1685
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,430
dude adjust
because he can because he's balanced

1686
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:37,440
because he can because he's balanced
 

1687
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,069
because he can because he's balanced
balance right away.

1688
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:40,079
balance right away.
 

1689
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,190
balance right away.

Your angle of articulation
 

1697
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,829
Your angle of articulation
should not change. It will only change

should not change. It will only change
 

1699
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,309
should not change. It will only change
because it got pressed just like the

So I have to non-contest.

1704
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:06,640
So I have to non-contest.

He needs to push, Sean. And you should
 

1723

If I were to pull him, which muscle
 

1735

1737
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:12,790
group am I using? The outer deltoid,
back deltoate. It's very weak. Okay.

1738
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:12,800

 

1739
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,309

I am going to rotate around the

I am going to rotate around the
contestation point where we're here.

contestation point where we're here.
 

1743
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,510
contestation point where we're here.
Then I move my body.

1744
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:23,520
Then I move my body.
 

1745
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,910
Then I move my body.
You see that? I don't ever take the

00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:29,920
You see that? I don't ever take the
 

1747

You see that? I don't ever take the
elbow

1748

elbow
 

1749
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,710

outside my outer rim.

1750
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:34,720
outside my outer rim.
 

1751
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,510
outside my outer rim.
So because of where I am as the axis of

So because of where I am as the axis of
rotation that is different from this.

00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:42,400
rotation that is different from this.
 

1755
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,309
rotation that is different from this.
This is still in alignment with the

This is still in alignment with the
 

1757
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,109
This is still in alignment with the
shoulder. Don't pull here. You just went

1758
00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:47,119
shoulder. Don't pull here. You just went
 

1759
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,990
shoulder. Don't pull here. You just went
outside it. Okay.

1760
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:50,000
outside it. Okay.
 

1761
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,750
outside it. Okay.
Boom.

Then
 

1765
00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:08,390
Then
drive with your body.

the spine is moving the shoulder, not
 

1773
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,950
the spine is moving the shoulder, not
the arm moving inside the ball and

00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:26,960
the arm moving inside the ball and
 

1775
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,589
the arm moving inside the ball and
socket joint. There's a timing issue to

1776
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:29,599
socket joint. There's a timing issue to
 

1777
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,710
socket joint. There's a timing issue to
it.

1779
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,950

And it's effortless. Okay, try it.

The spine is doing the same as in the
 

1785

Yes. Yes. Now, and start releasing the
 

1795
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,069
Yes. Yes. Now, and start releasing the
tension just like in the other drill.

1796
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:22,079
tension just like in the other drill.
 

1797
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,750
tension just like in the other drill.
You just can't release the spinal

1798
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:23,760
You just can't release the spinal
 

1799
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,790
You just can't release the spinal
tension. Okay. Which we don't control.

1800
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:26,800
tension. Okay. Which we don't control.
 

1801
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,309
tension. Okay. Which we don't control.
Okay.

1802
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:30,319

 

1803
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,630

There you had a little outer deltoid

1804
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:32,640
There you had a little outer deltoid
 

1805
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:40,710
There you had a little outer deltoid
there.

1806
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:40,720

 

1807
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,630

He's got he's got a got a push. Okay.

Are you going to pull?

1810
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:56,880

 

1811
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,829

Release the tension.

1812
00:54:59,829 --> 00:54:59,839
Release the tension.
 

1813
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:04,870
Release the tension.
Okay.

1814
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:04,880

 

1815
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,230

So how in other words how much tension I

1816
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:08,240
So how in other words how much tension I
 

1817
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,870
So how in other words how much tension I
feel in zen in here it shouldn't change

1818
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:12,880
feel in zen in here it shouldn't change
 

1819
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,270
feel in zen in here it shouldn't change
because he's attacking me it doesn't

1820
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:15,280
because he's attacking me it doesn't
 

1821
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,670
because he's attacking me it doesn't
change okay but it's not that okay all

1822
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:19,680
change okay but it's not that okay all
 

1823
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,030
change okay but it's not that okay all
right so pay attention marshially what's

1824
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:23,040
right so pay attention marshially what's
 

1825
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,349
right so pay attention marshially what's
happening when I do the inward spiral

1826
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:27,359
happening when I do the inward spiral
 

1827
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,549
happening when I do the inward spiral
it is already starting to tilt on him

1828
00:55:30,549 --> 00:55:30,559
it is already starting to tilt on him
 

1829
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,510
it is already starting to tilt on him
when I take the elbow

1830
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:33,520
when I take the elbow
 

1831
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,630
when I take the elbow
and bring it to the inside

1832
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:36,640
and bring it to the inside
 

1833
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,390
and bring it to the inside
as I would on I'm sorry the outward

1834
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:38,400
as I would on I'm sorry the outward
 

1835
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,790
as I would on I'm sorry the outward
spiral. It gets that tilt going. Do you

1836
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:40,800
spiral. It gets that tilt going. Do you
 

1837
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,910
spiral. It gets that tilt going. Do you
see when you come around like this? No

1838
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:43,920
see when you come around like this? No
 

1839
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,470
see when you come around like this? No
tilt. No tilt. No tilt. No t. Now I get

1840
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:46,480
tilt. No tilt. No tilt. No t. Now I get
 

1841
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:53,510
tilt. No tilt. No tilt. No t. Now I get
a tilt. Do you see that?

1842
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:53,520

 

1843
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,030

What we're trying to do here

1844
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:57,040
What we're trying to do here
 

1845
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,390
What we're trying to do here
is do something to him.

1846
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:00,400
is do something to him.
 

1847
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:05,109
is do something to him.
Cut down.

1848
00:56:05,109 --> 00:56:05,119

 

1849
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,430

But if you pay attention,

1850
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:07,440
But if you pay attention,
 

1851
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,109
But if you pay attention,
no kazushi, no kazushi, and now you're

1852
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:11,119
no kazushi, no kazushi, and now you're
 

1853
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,150
no kazushi, no kazushi, and now you're
going to have to use your lats.

1854
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:14,160
going to have to use your lats.
 

1855
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,030
going to have to use your lats.
Do you see that?

1856
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,040
Do you see that?
 

1857
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,910
Do you see that?
Instead, I go around the contention

1858
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:19,920
Instead, I go around the contention
 

1859
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,670
Instead, I go around the contention
point

1860
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:21,680
point
 

1861
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,990
point
until I'm now going in the direction of

1862
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,000
until I'm now going in the direction of
 

1863
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,349
until I'm now going in the direction of
the force. Okay? And that is done by

1864
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:29,359
the force. Okay? And that is done by
 

1865
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,430
the force. Okay? And that is done by
rotating

1866
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:31,440
rotating
 

1867
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,230
rotating
But getting out of the way,

1868
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:34,240
But getting out of the way,
 

1869
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,710
But getting out of the way,
don't cut down. Let it keep going till I

1870
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:38,720
don't cut down. Let it keep going till I
 

1871
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,349
don't cut down. Let it keep going till I
match its direction.

1872
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:41,359
match its direction.
 

1873
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:45,990
match its direction.
So I am not cutting his arm down. His

1874
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:46,000
So I am not cutting his arm down. His
 

1875
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,870
So I am not cutting his arm down. His
arm is lowering because the kazushi is

1876
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:48,880
arm is lowering because the kazushi is
 

1877
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,430
arm is lowering because the kazushi is
lowering his shoulder. So I don't have

1878
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:51,440
lowering his shoulder. So I don't have
 

1879
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,309
lowering his shoulder. So I don't have
to press on his arm.

1880
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:54,319
to press on his arm.
 

1881
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,670
to press on his arm.
I just have to tilt his spine

1882
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:57,680
I just have to tilt his spine
 

1883
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,910
I just have to tilt his spine
and stay up with his hand. Do you see

1884
00:56:59,910 --> 00:56:59,920
and stay up with his hand. Do you see
 

1885
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,069
and stay up with his hand. Do you see
that difference? So, I never had even

1886
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:02,079
that difference? So, I never had even
 

1887
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,789
that difference? So, I never had even
had to do tricep or lat pressure either.

1888
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:06,799
had to do tricep or lat pressure either.
 

1889
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,109
had to do tricep or lat pressure either.
Boom.

1890
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:09,119
Boom.
 

1891
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,750
Boom.
Okay, try it again. It should feel

1892
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:11,760
Okay, try it again. It should feel
 

1893
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,470
Okay, try it again. It should feel
effortless except for the attentiveness

1894
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:14,480
effortless except for the attentiveness
 

1895
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:20,630
effortless except for the attentiveness
for your spine.

1896
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:20,640

 

1897
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,030

Keep tilting his spine. Don't cut his

1898
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,040
Keep tilting his spine. Don't cut his
 

1899
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:28,549
Keep tilting his spine. Don't cut his
arm down.

1900
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:28,559

 

1901
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:37,109

Turn your elbow under.

1902
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:37,119

 

1903
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:51,349

Turn your elbow under.

1904
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:51,359

 

1905
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:55,349

Less less slat. Keep you want your hand

1906
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:55,359
Less less slat. Keep you want your hand
 

1907
00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:00,789
Less less slat. Keep you want your hand
to go that way, not that way. Okay.

1908
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:00,799
to go that way, not that way. Okay.
 

1909
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,190
to go that way, not that way. Okay.
Bring your elbow underneath towards your

1910
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:03,200
Bring your elbow underneath towards your
 

1911
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:09,030
Bring your elbow underneath towards your
center line.

1912
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:09,040

 

1913
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,910

Less deltoids.

1914
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:11,920
Less deltoids.
 

1915
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,950
Less deltoids.
You keep your spine erect though.

1916
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:14,960
You keep your spine erect though.
 

1917
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,230
You keep your spine erect though.
Turn your elbow under. That's it. That's

1918
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,240
Turn your elbow under. That's it. That's
 

1919
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,109
Turn your elbow under. That's it. That's
it.

1920
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:21,119
it.
 

1921
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,990
it.
So,

1922
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:24,000
So,
 

1923
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,910
So,
if I go like that, see there's the

1924
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:25,920
if I go like that, see there's the
 

1925
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,470
if I go like that, see there's the
contesting. But if I turn like this,

1926
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:28,480
contesting. But if I turn like this,
 

1927
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,549
contesting. But if I turn like this,
that's what I want. Then I got to get

1928
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:30,559
that's what I want. Then I got to get
 

1929
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,630
that's what I want. Then I got to get
out of the way. So that energy that's

1930
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:32,640
out of the way. So that energy that's
 

1931
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,789
out of the way. So that energy that's
coming, that's what I get out of the

1932
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:34,799
coming, that's what I get out of the
 

1933
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:38,950
coming, that's what I get out of the

get out of the way of the line of

get out of the way of the line of

again, if you were a cop and the bad guy
did that to you, you would go, "Ah, I'm

2079
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,549

iikido, he's on his toes. So now I could

2080
01:03:16,549 --> 01:03:16,559
iikido, he's on his toes. So now I could
 

2081
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,309
iikido, he's on his toes. So now I could
throw him. Do you get what I'm saying?

2082
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:18,319
throw him. Do you get what I'm saying?
 

2083
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,470
throw him. Do you get what I'm saying?
But if you look, is his line of gravity

2084
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:20,480
But if you look, is his line of gravity
 

2085
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,470
But if you look, is his line of gravity
inside his base of support? The answer

2086
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:22,480
inside his base of support? The answer
 

2087
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,870
inside his base of support? The answer
is yes. Okay? And that's where the root

2088
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:24,880
is yes. Okay? And that's where the root
 

2089
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,950
is yes. Okay? And that's where the root
awakening comes. When you venture out,

2090
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:26,960
awakening comes. When you venture out,
 

2091
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,349
awakening comes. When you venture out,
they just move. It's not not on his

2092
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:29,359
they just move. It's not not on his
 

2093
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,750
they just move. It's not not on his
toes. He lets go. He goes under. He goes

2094
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:31,760
toes. He lets go. He goes under. He goes
 

2095
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,670
toes. He lets go. He goes under. He goes
over the top. Okay. So likewise, when I

2096
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:35,680
over the top. Okay. So likewise, when I
 

2097
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,069

Derek,
here's where the first reconciliation

2418
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:57,440
here's where the first reconciliation
 

2419
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:01,750
here's where the first reconciliation
is. So, if I go here, I'm going to bend.

2420
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:01,760
is. So, if I go here, I'm going to bend.
 

2421
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,229
is. So, if I go here, I'm going to bend.
So the first reconciliation

2422
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:04,239
So the first reconciliation
 

2423
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:09,430
So the first reconciliation
is on his grab. I turn it down. So he

2424
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:09,440
is on his grab. I turn it down. So he
 

2425
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,350
is on his grab. I turn it down. So he
has a linear line. I go 90°. You see

2426
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:13,360
has a linear line. I go 90°. You see
 

2427
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:17,030
has a linear line. I go 90°. You see
that? Eventually you'll hit that

2431
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,910

first this goes yield before he hits

01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,470

01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,550
that that shoulder moves.
You see that?

2436
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:30,560
You see that?
 

2437
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,189
You see that?
I'm not trying to go around. That's a

2438
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:33,199
I'm not trying to go around. That's a
 

2439
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,510
I'm not trying to go around. That's a
contestation there. And I'm not trying

2440
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:35,520
contestation there. And I'm not trying
 

2441
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,030
contestation there. And I'm not trying
to dominate it. Right on the grab, I

2442
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,040
to dominate it. Right on the grab, I
 

2443
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,350
to dominate it. Right on the grab, I
turn it before he hits the shoulder. The

2444
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:41,360
turn it before he hits the shoulder. The
 

2445
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,550
turn it before he hits the shoulder. The
shoulder yields. I go around that. This

2446
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:44,560
shoulder yields. I go around that. This
 

2447
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,910
shoulder yields. I go around that. This
is why it's effortless.

2448
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:49,920

 

2449
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,630

What happens?

2450
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:52,640
What happens?
 

2451
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:58,390
What happens?
Which part? The shoulder. Okay.

2452
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:58,400

 

2453
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:14,950

What happened? The elbow didn't go.

2454
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:14,960

 

2455
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:33,590

Okay, try

2456
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:33,600

 

2457
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,500

Two hands are doing something different.

2458
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:36,510
Two hands are doing something different.

2483
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,590
the conscious level. Okay. Some of you
felt my technique. You could comment on

2484
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:53,600
felt my technique. You could comment on
 

2485
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,310
felt my technique. You could comment on
that too. Uh you could raise any any

could do is not bring any of this to the
 

2491
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:04,870
could do is not bring any of this to the

2492
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:04,880

 

2493
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:11,350

Uhhuh.

2494
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:11,360

 

2495

Uhhuh.

2496
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480

 

2497
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,350

Yeah. So

2498
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:17,360
Yeah. So
 

2499
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,390
Yeah. So
my coaching again remember I said pay

2500
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:20,400
my coaching again remember I said pay
 

2501
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,950
my coaching again remember I said pay
attention to the instructions that I'm

2502
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:22,960
attention to the instructions that I'm
 

2503
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,470
attention to the instructions that I'm
giving you multiple times and then

2504
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:26,480
giving you multiple times and then
 

2505
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,630
giving you multiple times and then
quadruple your effort because whatever

2506
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:28,640
quadruple your effort because whatever
 

2507
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,110
quadruple your effort because whatever
you think is what I'm saying is not

2508
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:31,120
you think is what I'm saying is not
 

2509
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,390
you think is what I'm saying is not
quite it. Okay. So the you can watch the

2510
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:34,400
quite it. Okay. So the you can watch the
 

2511
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,470
quite it. Okay. So the you can watch the
video later was like there's two hands,

2512
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:36,480
video later was like there's two hands,
 

2513
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,630
video later was like there's two hands,
one's yin, one's yang. They're not doing

2514
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:38,640
one's yin, one's yang. They're not doing
 

2515
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,310
one's yin, one's yang. They're not doing
the same thing. Okay. How did this whole

2516
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:42,320
the same thing. Okay. How did this whole
 

2517
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:46,149
the same thing. Okay. How did this whole
lesson start? two young hands in nor in

2518
01:18:46,149 --> 01:18:46,159
lesson start? two young hands in nor in
 

2519
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:50,709
lesson start? two young hands in nor in
normal kokho, right? This keeps their

2520
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:50,719
normal kokho, right? This keeps their
 

2521
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,790
normal kokho, right? This keeps their
line of gravity inside their base of

2522
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:52,800
line of gravity inside their base of
 

2523
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,950
line of gravity inside their base of
support and you have to muscle and you

2524
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:54,960
support and you have to muscle and you
 

2525
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,590
support and you have to muscle and you
contest. And if I go yong yong, we go

2526
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:57,600
contest. And if I go yong yong, we go
 

2527
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:05,350
contest. And if I go yong yong, we go
yong yong. Okay. So, you're

2528
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:05,360

 

2529
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,390

when you when you go with two, there's

2530
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:08,400
when you when you go with two, there's
 

2531
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,030
when you when you go with two, there's
already a yong yong. there's no place

2532
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:11,040
already a yong yong. there's no place
 

2533
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,229
already a yong yong. there's no place
for his spinal displacement to go. Does

2534
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:14,239
for his spinal displacement to go. Does
 

2535
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:16,310
for his spinal displacement to go. Does
that make sense? There was no yin yield

2536
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:16,320
that make sense? There was no yin yield
 

2537
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,270
that make sense? There was no yin yield
at all in that technique. Usually, it's

2538
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:19,280
at all in that technique. Usually, it's
 

2539
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,510
at all in that technique. Usually, it's
not problematic because the UK just

2540
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:21,520
not problematic because the UK just
 

2541
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,510
not problematic because the UK just
grabs you without the spinal

2542
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:23,520
grabs you without the spinal
 

2543
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:28,310
grabs you without the spinal
displacement. Do you see? Um,

2544
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:28,320
displacement. Do you see? Um,
 

2545
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,870
displacement. Do you see? Um,
we want the contest so that I get

2546
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:30,880
we want the contest so that I get
 

2547
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,950
we want the contest so that I get
skilled in non-contestation.

2548
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:32,960
skilled in non-contestation.
 

2549
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,229
skilled in non-contestation.
We don't I don't really care that he's

2550
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:36,239
We don't I don't really care that he's
 

2551
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,350
We don't I don't really care that he's
thrown. I care how he's thrown. Am I

2552
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:39,360
thrown. I care how he's thrown. Am I
 

2553
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,350
thrown. I care how he's thrown. Am I
throwing him with the concentric theory

2554
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:43,360
throwing him with the concentric theory
 

2555
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:48,470
throwing him with the concentric theory
of the art? Yin matches yang. Do not

2556
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:48,480
of the art? Yin matches yang. Do not
 

2557
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,390
of the art? Yin matches yang. Do not
contest.

2558
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:50,400
contest.
 

2559
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,270
contest.
Keep your spine erect.

2560
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:53,280
Keep your spine erect.
 

2561
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,110
Keep your spine erect.
You should have no tension. You should

2562
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:55,120
You should have no tension. You should
 

2563
01:19:55,120 --> 01:20:00,550
You should have no tension. You should
have no exertion. Right? So

2564
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:00,560
have no exertion. Right? So
 

2565
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,870
have no exertion. Right? So
this has to go somewhere

2566
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:04,880
this has to go somewhere
 

2567
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,310
this has to go somewhere
in his push.

2568
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:08,320
in his push.
 

2569
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,750
in his push.
This doesn't let it go somewhere. Okay.

2570
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:11,760
This doesn't let it go somewhere. Okay.
 

2571
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,189
This doesn't let it go somewhere. Okay.
And in your technique, you still have

2572
01:20:15,189 --> 01:20:15,199
And in your technique, you still have
 

2573
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:17,510
And in your technique, you still have
this is two yongs. I can tell you're

2574
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:17,520
this is two yongs. I can tell you're
 

2575
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,310
this is two yongs. I can tell you're
trying to get around it, but it entered

2576
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:20,320
trying to get around it, but it entered
 

2577
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:26,310
trying to get around it, but it entered
into a yong phase first, and it needs to

2578
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:26,320
into a yong phase first, and it needs to
 

2579
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:29,590
into a yong phase first, and it needs to
enter into that yin phase first. Do you

2580
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:29,600
enter into that yin phase first. Do you
 

2581
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,910
enter into that yin phase first. Do you
see that? And then this hand

2582
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:33,920
see that? And then this hand
 

2583
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,550
see that? And then this hand
is not even me

2584
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:36,560
is not even me
 

2585
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,950
is not even me
throwing the qua.

2586
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:38,960
throwing the qua.
 

2587
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,510
throwing the qua.
Um,

2588
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:41,520
Um,
 

2589
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,390
Um,
just kind of go ahead a little here. I

2590
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:44,400
just kind of go ahead a little here. I
 

2591
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,830
just kind of go ahead a little here. I
wanted you to train the qua because I

2592
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:45,840
wanted you to train the qua because I
 

2593
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,350
wanted you to train the qua because I
want you to bring consciousness to the

2594
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:47,360
want you to bring consciousness to the
 

2595
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,590
want you to bring consciousness to the
qua. Grab, please. So, I had you move

2596
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:51,600
qua. Grab, please. So, I had you move
 

2597
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,790
qua. Grab, please. So, I had you move
the qua to move him.

2598
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:54,800
the qua to move him.
 

2599
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,830
the qua to move him.
What the art actually does

2600
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:57,840
What the art actually does
 

2601
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,430
What the art actually does
is

2602
01:20:59,430 --> 01:20:59,440
is
 

2603
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,630
is
brings his mass and his balance here and

2604
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:02,640
brings his mass and his balance here and
 

2605
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:06,790
brings his mass and his balance here and
he hits that ground path. Does that make

2606
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:06,800
he hits that ground path. Does that make
 

2607
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,229
he hits that ground path. Does that make
sense? So, it's not that I have to move

2608
01:21:10,229 --> 01:21:10,239
sense? So, it's not that I have to move
 

2609
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:13,350
sense? So, it's not that I have to move
the quaw, but there has to be qua

2610
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,360
the quaw, but there has to be qua
 

2611
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,830
the quaw, but there has to be qua
integrity so that when he when I feel

2612
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:15,840
integrity so that when he when I feel
 

2613
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,790
integrity so that when he when I feel
his force, it doesn't spill out around

2614
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:18,800
his force, it doesn't spill out around
 

2615
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,149
his force, it doesn't spill out around
my spine. But I'm basically throwing him

2616
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:22,159
my spine. But I'm basically throwing him
 

2617
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:25,270
my spine. But I'm basically throwing him
onto the yong ground path or he's

2618
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:25,280
onto the yong ground path or he's
 

2619
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,950
onto the yong ground path or he's
throwing himself onto the yong ground

2620
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:26,960
throwing himself onto the yong ground
 

2621
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,350
throwing himself onto the yong ground
path and the technique is a boom and

2622
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:29,360
path and the technique is a boom and
 

2623
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:34,870
path and the technique is a boom and
it's immediate on on touch. Okay. Um

2624
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:34,880
it's immediate on on touch. Okay. Um
 

2625
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,950
it's immediate on on touch. Okay. Um
but when you do when you're here like

2626
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:36,960
but when you do when you're here like
 

2627
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,510
but when you do when you're here like
this, you're always going to have to

2628
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:39,520
this, you're always going to have to
 

2629
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,430
this, you're always going to have to
push him. you're always going to have to

2630
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:41,440
push him. you're always going to have to
 

2631
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,630
push him. you're always going to have to
do something to him as opposed to I get

2632
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:44,640
do something to him as opposed to I get
 

2633
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,030
do something to him as opposed to I get
out of the way and he hits the ground

2634
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:47,040
out of the way and he hits the ground
 

2635
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,630
out of the way and he hits the ground
vector and it projects back into him at

2636
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:50,640
vector and it projects back into him at
 

2637
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,870
vector and it projects back into him at
an angle at which his line of gravity is

2638
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:52,880
an angle at which his line of gravity is
 

2639
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,390
an angle at which his line of gravity is
going to be pushed out of his space of

2640
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:54,400
going to be pushed out of his space of
 

2641
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,310
going to be pushed out of his space of
support. Okay, so your real difficulty

2642
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:58,320
support. Okay, so your real difficulty
 

2643
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:02,070
support. Okay, so your real difficulty
was the yin hand. It is the yin is

2644
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:02,080
was the yin hand. It is the yin is
 

2645
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,470
was the yin hand. It is the yin is
always the hardest. Yin is

2646
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:06,480
always the hardest. Yin is
 

2647
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,950
always the hardest. Yin is
the seed of non-contestation. So, it's

2648
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:08,960
the seed of non-contestation. So, it's
 

2649
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,870
the seed of non-contestation. So, it's
the most alien to us if you pay

2650
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:10,880
the most alien to us if you pay
 

2651
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,750
the most alien to us if you pay
attention. Uh, you almost will never

2652
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:13,760
attention. Uh, you almost will never
 

2653
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,709
attention. Uh, you almost will never
pull. You almost will never pull in your

2654
01:22:16,709 --> 01:22:16,719
pull. You almost will never pull in your
 

2655
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:18,629
pull. You almost will never pull in your
contestation. It does happen and it's

2656
01:22:18,629 --> 01:22:18,639
contestation. It does happen and it's
 

2657
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:21,750
contestation. It does happen and it's
still a clash, but it's almost always

2658
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:21,760
still a clash, but it's almost always
 

2659
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,750
still a clash, but it's almost always
pushing and pressing. Do you know what I

2660
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:23,760
pushing and pressing. Do you know what I
 

2661
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,830
pushing and pressing. Do you know what I
mean? Yin is very foreign to us, which

2662
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:27,840
mean? Yin is very foreign to us, which
 

2663
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,990
mean? Yin is very foreign to us, which
is why

2664
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,000
is why
 

2665
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,310
is why
all of your four disciplines, all your

2666
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:32,320
all of your four disciplines, all your
 

2667
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,790
all of your four disciplines, all your
bedrock practices, they're all yin

2668
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:34,800
bedrock practices, they're all yin
 

2669
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,110
bedrock practices, they're all yin
practices. So take your karma yoga and

2670
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:37,120
practices. So take your karma yoga and
 

2671
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,709
practices. So take your karma yoga and
your servitude, the practice of

2672
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:38,719
your servitude, the practice of
 

2673
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,590
your servitude, the practice of
servitude, it's a yin displacement on a

2674
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:41,600
servitude, it's a yin displacement on a
 

2675
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,910
servitude, it's a yin displacement on a
daily basis everywhere you go in life.

2676
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:43,920
daily basis everywhere you go in life.
 

2677
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,950
daily basis everywhere you go in life.
Okay? Um why do you say yes to

2678
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:46,960
Okay? Um why do you say yes to
 

2679
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,990
Okay? Um why do you say yes to
everything? Um because you're the one

2680
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:50,000
everything? Um because you're the one
 

2681
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,910
everything? Um because you're the one
that's going to do the work. You're the

2682
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:51,920
that's going to do the work. You're the
 

2683
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,910
that's going to do the work. You're the
one, no matter how tired you are, you're

2684
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:53,920
one, no matter how tired you are, you're
 

2685
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,510
one, no matter how tired you are, you're
the one that's going to do the work.

2686
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:55,520
the one that's going to do the work.
 

2687
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,910
the one that's going to do the work.
You're not going to complain. Uh you're

2688
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:57,920
You're not going to complain. Uh you're
 

2689
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,590
You're not going to complain. Uh you're
the burden. You're the one up on the

2690
01:22:59,590 --> 01:22:59,600
the burden. You're the one up on the
 

2691
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,430
the burden. You're the one up on the
cross, okay? You're not the one down

2692
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:01,440
cross, okay? You're not the one down
 

2693
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,310
cross, okay? You're not the one down
below kind of stuff. You're on the cross

2694
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:04,320
below kind of stuff. You're on the cross
 

2695
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,110
below kind of stuff. You're on the cross
and you're asking for them to all be

2696
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:07,120
and you're asking for them to all be
 

2697
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,350
and you're asking for them to all be
forgiven. This is the ultimate yin

2698
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:09,360
forgiven. This is the ultimate yin
 

2699
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,070
forgiven. This is the ultimate yin
expression. Okay? So, yin has to become

2700
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:12,080
expression. Okay? So, yin has to become
 

2701
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,229
expression. Okay? So, yin has to become
second nature. But at first is the

2702
01:23:14,229 --> 01:23:14,239
second nature. But at first is the
 

2703
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,550
second nature. But at first is the
opposite. You you want your will to

2704
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:16,560
opposite. You you want your will to
 

2705
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,030
opposite. You you want your will to
power and you want to do something.

2706
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:19,040
power and you want to do something.
 

2707
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:23,510
power and you want to do something.
Okay? But this is where that move is

2708
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:23,520
Okay? But this is where that move is
 

2709
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,830
Okay? But this is where that move is
and that is a hard move to get. Okay?

2710
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:25,840
and that is a hard move to get. Okay?
 

2711
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:29,669
and that is a hard move to get. Okay?
We'll work on it later today. Um,

2712
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:29,679
We'll work on it later today. Um,
 

2713
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:31,990
We'll work on it later today. Um,
but as I mentioned earlier, it's the

2714
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:32,000
but as I mentioned earlier, it's the
 

2715
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,870
but as I mentioned earlier, it's the
same thing on the sword. It's in my

2716
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:34,880
same thing on the sword. It's in my
 

2717
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,350
same thing on the sword. It's in my
yielding that the sword does what it

2718
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:37,360
yielding that the sword does what it
 

2719
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,070
yielding that the sword does what it
needs to do naturally and in my

2720
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:40,080
needs to do naturally and in my
 

2721
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,870
needs to do naturally and in my
resisting to the yielding in any way

2722
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:42,880
resisting to the yielding in any way
 

2723
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,030
resisting to the yielding in any way
makes that sword do something else.

2724
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:45,040
makes that sword do something else.
 

2725
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,149
makes that sword do something else.
Okay? Something to the degree that it

2726
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:48,159
Okay? Something to the degree that it
 

2727
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,470
Okay? Something to the degree that it
won't actually function when someone's

2728
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:50,480
won't actually function when someone's
 

2729
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:53,030
won't actually function when someone's
actually trying to do an a tosh on my

2730
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
actually trying to do an a tosh on my
 

2731
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,030
actually trying to do an a tosh on my
weapon. Okay? Remember that point? if

2732
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,040
weapon. Okay? Remember that point? if
 

2733
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,629
weapon. Okay? Remember that point? if
you if it's going to go into your leg

2734
01:23:56,629 --> 01:23:56,639
you if it's going to go into your leg
 

2735
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,070
you if it's going to go into your leg
when they when they hit it nice and

2736
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:58,080
when they when they hit it nice and
 

2737
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:04,550
when they when they hit it nice and
hard. Okay. Um

2738
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:04,560

 

2739
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,350

just let take away yin is very hard. Yin

2740
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,360
just let take away yin is very hard. Yin
 

2741
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,790
just let take away yin is very hard. Yin
is very important. Um

2742
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:10,800
is very important. Um
 

2743
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,229
is very important. Um
hence shosin humility do you see the

2744
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:14,239
hence shosin humility do you see the
 

2745
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:16,149
hence shosin humility do you see the
importance in Buudo training the virtues

2746
01:24:16,149 --> 01:24:16,159
importance in Buudo training the virtues
 

2747
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:18,149
importance in Buudo training the virtues
all that kind of stuff. Servitude

2748
01:24:18,149 --> 01:24:18,159
all that kind of stuff. Servitude
 

2749
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:21,030
all that kind of stuff. Servitude
loyalty filopalty these are all

2750
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:21,040
loyalty filopalty these are all
 

2751
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:24,229
loyalty filopalty these are all
unselfing practices and behaviors. Um,

2752
01:24:24,229 --> 01:24:24,239
unselfing practices and behaviors. Um,
 

2753
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:27,669
unselfing practices and behaviors. Um,
and they concentrically are in the art.

2754
01:24:27,669 --> 01:24:27,679
and they concentrically are in the art.
 

2755
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,350
and they concentrically are in the art.
Okay.

2756
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:29,360
Okay.
 

2757
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,270
Okay.
Uh, all right. Good, good, good, good,

2758
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:31,280
Uh, all right. Good, good, good, good,
 

2759
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,870
Uh, all right. Good, good, good, good,
good question. Good point. But that's

2760
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:32,880
good question. Good point. But that's
 

2761
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,270
good question. Good point. But that's
what it was. Okay. The young hand is

2762
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:35,280
what it was. Okay. The young hand is
 

2763
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,110
what it was. Okay. The young hand is
like, especially here when I'm not

2764
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:37,120
like, especially here when I'm not
 

2765
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,030
like, especially here when I'm not
really projecting. I'm just maintaining

2766
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:39,040
really projecting. I'm just maintaining
 

2767
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,270
really projecting. I'm just maintaining
integrity that everyone was pretty good

2768
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:41,280
integrity that everyone was pretty good
 

2769
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:44,070
integrity that everyone was pretty good
on the young hand. All right. Any other

2770
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:44,080
on the young hand. All right. Any other
 

2771
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,229
on the young hand. All right. Any other
questions or comments?

2772
01:24:46,229 --> 01:24:46,239
questions or comments?
 

2773
01:24:46,239 --> 01:25:00,310
questions or comments?
Yep.

2774
01:25:00,310 --> 01:25:00,320

 

2775
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,910

I think it's probably more coordination

2776
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:01,920
I think it's probably more coordination
 

2777
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,990
I think it's probably more coordination
to tell you the truth. Okay. I just

2778
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:04,000
to tell you the truth. Okay. I just
 

2779
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,070
to tell you the truth. Okay. I just
remember the rolling like one side I can

2780
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:06,080
remember the rolling like one side I can
 

2781
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,830
remember the rolling like one side I can
roll better on and then the other side I

2782
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:07,840
roll better on and then the other side I
 

2783
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,669
roll better on and then the other side I
I don't roll as good on. That's very

2784
01:25:09,669 --> 01:25:09,679
I don't roll as good on. That's very
 

2785
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,910
I don't roll as good on. That's very
common. I can always throw better with

2786
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:11,920
common. I can always throw better with
 

2787
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:14,229
common. I can always throw better with
my right than with my left. Right. I can

2788
01:25:14,229 --> 01:25:14,239
my right than with my left. Right. I can
 

2789
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,709
my right than with my left. Right. I can
write better with my right than my left.

2790
01:25:16,709 --> 01:25:16,719
write better with my right than my left.
 

2791
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:18,470
write better with my right than my left.
Um

2792
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:18,480
Um
 

2793
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,629
Um
it it'll go away with just the reps.

2794
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:20,639
it it'll go away with just the reps.
 

2795
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,390
it it'll go away with just the reps.
It'll just go away. Coordination problem

2796
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:22,400
It'll just go away. Coordination problem
 

2797
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:25,189
It'll just go away. Coordination problem
goes away with repetition. Okay?

2798
01:25:25,189 --> 01:25:25,199
goes away with repetition. Okay?
 

2799
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:26,870
goes away with repetition. Okay?
Especially if you're conscientiously

2800
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:26,880
Especially if you're conscientiously
 

2801
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,790
Especially if you're conscientiously
trying to take tension out of whatever

2802
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:28,800
trying to take tension out of whatever
 

2803
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,790
trying to take tension out of whatever
you're doing because the uncoordination

2804
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:30,800
you're doing because the uncoordination
 

2805
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,270
you're doing because the uncoordination
always is going to manifest with the

2806
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:33,280
always is going to manifest with the
 

2807
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,110
always is going to manifest with the
unnecessary tension and it's

2808
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:35,120
unnecessary tension and it's
 

2809
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,390
unnecessary tension and it's
constipating the motion.

2810
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:38,400
constipating the motion.
 

2811
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,709
constipating the motion.
Anything else?

2812
01:25:40,709 --> 01:25:40,719
Anything else?
 

2813
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,440
Anything else?
All right.
